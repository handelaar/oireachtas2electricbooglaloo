      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin (for Tomás O Conaill)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the President if he will state (1) what arrangements have been made for carrying on the duties of the Minister for Defence and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce respectively during their absence in the United States; (2) whether any portion of the cost of the visit will fall upon State funds; and if so, what is the estimated amount and under which vote has authority been given for such expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>(1) On the 25th September last the Executive Council, pursuant to Sec. 11 of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924 (No. 16 of 1924) made an Order entitled &ldquo;Minister for Defence (Agency) Order, 1929&rdquo; authorising the Minister for Finance to exercise and perform as agent for the Minister for Defence any of the duties and public services of the Minister for Defence during the latter's inability, through absence from Saorstát Eireann, to exercise and perform such duties and public services. This Order was published in &ldquo;Iris Oifigiúil,&rdquo; No. 81 of the 8th October, 1929, and was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas on the 23rd October, 1929; (2) Sec. 7 (7) of the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, provides that each Parliamentary Secretary shall by his appointment be assigned to act as Parliamentary Secretary to the Executive Council <Col N="1086" /> or to a Minister and shall have such powers and perform such duties as the Executive Council or such Minister with the consent of the Executive Council (as the case may be) may from time to time delegate to him.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, with the consent of the Executive Council, has made suitable arrangements for the carrying out of the duties of his Parliamentary Secretary during the latter's absence; (3) No portion of the expenses of the visit to the United States of the Minister for Defence or of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce has been or will be defrayed from public funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin (for Tomás O Conaill)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether, in view of the fact that boy messengers in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are required to pass a written and oral examination in Irish prior to <Col N="1087" /> entering the Post Office Department, and a further written and oral examination in Irish at 16 years of age for appointments as postmen, he will make representations to the Civil Service Commissioners to discontinue the requirement that such boys should be required to undergo a further oral examination in Irish at 18 years of age.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe) Ernest Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Blythe)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no oral test in Irish for boy messengers in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs at the entrance open examination. At the qualifying examination which boy messengers are required to pass on attaining 16 years of age for appointments as established postmen, both a written and oral examination in Irish of a simple character is imposed.  Candidates who qualify at the latter examination are required to pass within a period of two years, as in the case of all other classes who enter the Civil Service by open competition, an oral test in Irish as a condition of satisfying their probation for final appointments. There are only two oral tests in Irish, and not three, as stated in the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if the tribunal set up under the Civil Service (Transferred Officers) Compensation Bill, 1929, is the tribunal referred to in his statement of February 27th, 1929, and, if so, whether it will consider claims to compensation made under Article X. of the Treaty of transferred officers of the Dublin Metropolitan Police who joined prior to 1921 and who retired prior to the expiration of the prescribed period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative, and to the second part in the negative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time my answer to the Deputy's previous question on this subject was given, I contemplated that transferred members of the late <Col N="1088" /> Dublin Metropolitan Police Force would be included in the Bill then being drafted to give effect to the agreement reached with the British Government in regard to Article X. of the Treaty.  On further consideration, however, I felt that such members need not be included for the reasons (1) that the issues which gave rise to the Wigg-Cochrane litigation had no reference to members of the Dublin Metropolitan Police; (2) that points of dispute in connection with awards of compensation already made to such members had been settled as the result of a comprehensive judgement of the High Court, and (3) that the period within which members might give notice of their desire to retire under Article X. had long since expired, and the question of compensation could in future only arise in the unlikely event of a man being discharged from his employment for a cause other than misconduct or incapacity. In such a case, the claim for compensation would be dealt with Departmentally, as was contemplated by the Act of 1920.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if his attention has been drawn to a statement made by Circuit Court Judge Wyse Power at the Clifden sittings of the Galway Circuit Court, as reported in the Dublin morning papers of the 1st instant, that the Gárda Síochána had not carried out their statutory duty of opposing an application for the <Col N="1090" /> grant of a new hotel licence in a case in which Mr. Andrew Carolan, manager of the Renvyle Hotel Company, was the applicant; what, if any, instructions were issued officially to the Gárdaí in regard to the application, and if no instructions were issued, can he state who are the people in Dublin who, according to the Judge, instructed the Gárdaí to refrain from carrying out their statutory obligations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention has been drawn to the statement in question, which was obviously a very grave imputation against the local police officers and some higher authorities in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised there is no statutory duty on the police or anybody else to oppose an application for a new licence.  It is in the discretion of the local police officer to oppose such applications on certain statutory grounds, namely, (a) the character of the applicant; (b) inconvenience or unfitness of the premises; (c) the number of previously licensed houses in the neighbourhood; and there is no binding duty to oppose an application even formally if the officer in his discretion thinks it unnecessary to do so.  In the case of Renvyle Hotel, the local officer felt that he could urge nothing against the character of the applicant, that he could urge nothing against the premises, which have been built as a new hotel for tourist traffic in Connemara and contain 70 rooms, and that as regards the number of previously licensed houses he could not very well ground objection to the application, because there were very few licensed houses in the neighbourhood, and none at all in the nature of a big hotel aiming at tourist development. No instructions of any kind were issued to the local officers from Police Headquarters, or from my office or from any other source.  These officers acted entirely on their own responsibility in the <i>bona fide</i> exercise of their discretion without instructions from anybody and according to the usual practice in these matters.  The practice is not to <Col N="1091" /> refer notices of applications for new licences received by local officers to Police Headquarters and, in the particular case of Renvyle Hotel, that practice was followed as a matter of routine.</P>

      <P>Frank Connick, who is suspected of being actively associated with a criminal organisation, was detained for about five minutes at about 11 o'clock on the night of 31st October and searched for firearms.  No firearms were found upon him, and he was immediately released.  He was not brought inside the Gárda Station at all, nor threatened, nor was a revolver produced at any stage of the search, which, as I have said, lasted about five minutes.</P>

      <P>The Report of the Board of Visitors of the National Museum for the year 1928-29 contains the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In view of the re-arrangement of the Museum being carried out in accordance with the recommendations of the Government's Committee of Enquiry, it is considered that the early publication of the Report of that Committee would be of great service to the Board of Visitors and also to the staff.</P>
      <P>As two members of the Board of Visitors acted on the Committee of Enquiry, it was assumed that the Board was aware of the Committee's recommendations, but I can arrange to have a complete copy of the Report supplied for the Board's information. Members of the staff who require information from the Report for the purposes of their official duties may have such information on application to the Department.</P>
      <P>I am also prepared to have copies placed in the National Library, and in the Oireachtas Library, for the information of members who may be interested therein.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education what steps are being taken to fill the vacancies on the <Col N="1093" /> staff of the National Museum; whether it is proposed to satisfy the several imperative needs of the Irish Antiquities Division as enumerated in the Report of the Board of Visitors for 1928-1929.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Civil Service Commission have been asked to recommend a candidate for appointment to the post of Keeper in the Art and Industrial Division. Steps have also been taken, and the necessary sanction has been obtained, for the filling of the vacant post of Keeper in the Natural History Division, and for the appointment of three Assistants, one in each of the three Divisions.  It is considered desirable to defer the appointment of the remaining four Assistants owing to the difficulty of training a larger staff of officers of this class if they were all appointed at the same time.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second part of the question, the needs of the Irish Antiquities Division of the Museum, which are stated in the Report of the Board of Visitors for 1928-29 to be imperative, are the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  additional office accommodation,</P>
      <P>(2)  a reference library with a sufficient selection of current European Archaeological literature,</P>
      <P>(3)  adequate provision for travelling expenses,</P>
      <P>(4)  the filling up of the staff in accordance with the recommendations of the Museum Commission.</P>
      <P>The chief difficulty in satisfying these needs is the financial one, and all the proposals or applications for increases in expenditure of this nature must be considered in the light of the State's financial position.</P>
      <P>With regard to No. (1) above, the needs of the Museum generally, as regards both office accommodation and exhibition rooms, are at present engaging the attention of the Commissioners of Public Works and of my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1094" /> As regards Nos. (2) and (3), I am prepared to consider carefully any representations put before me, and to meet the needs of the Museum in these matters, subject to the general financial consideration already mentioned.  No. (4) is dealt with in the reply to the first part of the question.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he is aware that the children of the townlands of Meentishesk, Loughnalocraman, Largynacarra and Meenabul in the Ardara district, Co. Donegal, have to make a dangerous descent of one thousand feet down a precipitous mountain path to reach the nearest national school, and if he will state whether a petition has been received from the parents of those children for the erection of a new school for this outpost of the Gaeltacht, and, if so, if he will state what action, if any, he proposes to take in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>An application from the local parties for the establishment of a school for the children of the families in the townlands referred to by the Deputy has been received through the parish priest of Ardara.  The issue has been investigated by my Department, and I gather that there are twenty-two children in the district.  The homes of the majority are not more than two miles distant from the nearest school.  It is unlikely, having regard to the number and ages of the children, that a school, if established, would maintain a sufficient average attendance for its continued recognition for more than a few years, and, in addition, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to secure the services of a teacher in view of the local conditions.</P>
      <P>I am advised that the only path by which the children affected may travel to the nearest school is on the side of a precipitous hill, but the provision of a more suitable means of communication is not a matter for my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1095" /> My Department would not be warranted, on the facts as disclosed, in making grants for the establishment of a new school.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the motion is put, A Chinn Comhairle, I think it is incumbent upon the Minister for Finance, who is responsible for this Bill, and who wound up the debate on the Second Reading thereof, to clear up the somewhat obscure position which his statements during the course of that debate have created. He said (col. 667, Vol. 32): &ldquo;Incidentally I am quite satisfied that this particular case, although we did not set out to destroy the appeal to the Privy Council by means of it, has in fact finished the appeals to the Privy Council.&rdquo;&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he went on to say, &ldquo;it is no longer a question of getting the British Government to agree to kill appeals to the Privy Council.  It is only a question of getting them to agree to give the corpse a decent burial.&rdquo;  Now, if the Minister really thinks that the result of this litigation has ended appeals to the Privy Council, has he any objection to formulating that opinion in the way we have already suggested as a preamble to this Bill?  If he will definitely state, or enter it on the Statute Book of this House, that this Bill is not introduced into the Dáil for the purpose of honouring the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, the position of this Party, as I have already indicated, will be radically altered.  It is mainly because we believe that the Bill is deliberately intended to give effect to that decision, to honour that decision, even though, admittedly, it does not impose any extra financial liability on the State, that we on these benches are opposing it.  Like the Minister, we do not object if the British Government decides, out of the goodness of its heart, to pay to its ex-civil servants in Ireland moneys and allowances over and above what they were clearly entitled <Col N="1110" /> to under Article X of the Treaty, but we do object to the British Government doing that as an inducement to secure the recognition in this State of a decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, and it is for that reason that we are opposing the Bill.</P>
      <P>If the Minister at this late stage would say that he will formally make it clear, either by way of a preamble such as I have indicated, or a definite statement in this House, that in introducing this Bill the Government are in no way taking cognisance of the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, then our way with regard to it would be much easier and our opposition to it would be much less.  Beyond that, I do not think there is anything we can say on the Bill.  The Bill is a result of an agreement.  We believe that, in some sections at any rate, that agreement is unfortunate.  We do not believe that Section 14 of the Bill will ultimately make for the smooth working of the Civil Service in this country.  We believe that it will create difficulties for those who, some time or another, will have to take upon themselves the burden and the responsibility of overhauling the Civil Service.  We do not like Section 16 of the Bill for the reasons which I have already stated on the Second Reading and, above all, we do not like the fact that the Minister, in making this agreement, did not take the opportunity to deal with the question of absentee pensioners.</P>
      <P>But those objections to the Bill are secondary objections only.  Our principal objection is, as I have already stated, the feeling which we have that this Bill, no matter what financial responsibility the British may take in connection with it, is primarily designed to secure from the Minister and from this State an acceptance and a recognition of the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.  For that reason we are opposed to it at this stage.</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Minister for information on a point in connection with the Bill?  What <Col N="1111" /> I want to have made clear is whether a case I have in mind is concerned with the Bill or not.  What will be the position of the staff of the late Intermediate Education Board, for example?  Will it come under the Bill?  Will it be subject to the Civil Service Committee in the same way as those who were definitely civil servants at the time of the Treaty? They were not so recognised, I understand, at the time of the Treaty, but they were recognised as civil servants afterwards, and I would like the Minister to give me some information as to their status if he can.  I am sorry that I have not been able to give him longer notice about the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing that I think I need say in reply to Deputy MacEntee is this, that the decision of the Privy Council created differences of opinion between the two Governments concerned with reference to the treatment of transferred civil servants.  The Government here held that the decision of the Supreme Court correctly interpreted the Treaty.  The British Government, whatever the individual views of its members were, were bound to hold, until there had been legislation to amend it, that the decision of the Privy Council correctly interpreted the Treaty.  In a matter of this kind it was necessary that further agreements should be made and that further legislation should be carried so that the two Governments might again be in a position to be of one mind with reference to the interpretation of the agreement which existed between them.  When this Bill becomes an Act it will bring the point of view of the two Governments together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Privy Council delivered a certain judgment, holding against us, holding that the Free State was bound to pay certain sums.  This Bill does not impose the burden of paying those sums on us.  Furthermore, the judgment of the Privy Council was to the effect that all civil servants transferred had certain rights and were entitled to <Col N="1112" /> certain sums.  While this Bill provides that those of them who retired before 1st March shall be paid those sums, not by us in reality but by the British Government, it also provides that the civil servants retiring after the 1st March shall not be paid those sums.  I think that the Deputy can form his own conclusion as to whether or not this Bill honours the judgment of the Privy Council. As I say, the judgment of the Privy Council was to the effect that we were bound to pay certain sums. We will pay none of those sums.  It held that all civil servants were entitled to those sums.  This Bill provides that one section of civil servants shall receive those sums in the ultimate resort from the British Government and another section shall not receive them at all.</P>
    <P>I did not claim that this incident alone would have been sufficient to bring the question of appeals to the Privy Council to the position to which it has been brought.  I think there was a movement, a definite tendency, towards getting away from the appeal to the Privy Council, and towards bringing that appeal, which is an anomaly, to an end.  The blunders of the Privy Council in this matter have hastened that process very materially to the point, as I have said, that in my opinion the appeal to the Privy Council is really dead, and that we are not likely to be very much troubled with it in the future.</P>
    <P>Section 14 will not, in my opinion, create any difficulty.  Its object is to make clear provisions that were already in existence, and every provision in Section 14, in so far as it was not perfectly clear in the Act of 1920, has already been fixed by a judgment of the Wylie Committee. That is to say in every matter Section 14 deals with, the Wylie Committee has already given a decision along the lines of the sub-sections of the Bill. So far as Section 16 is concerned, if Section 16 or some similar provision were not there people would be entitled to get full pensions from the Free State, even though they might afterwards have been employed by <Col N="1113" /> the Northern or other Government. The effect of Section 16 is to suspend pensions and prevent people drawing, in pensions and salary from two Governments combined sums in excess of the amounts of their salaries before their retirement.</P>
    <P>I am sorry I am not able to answer Deputy Thrift's question at any rate in any detail.  This Bill does not confer new rights on anybody. It simply confirms the rights which various transferred civil servants had and provides a means of settling disputes, and it provides a tribunal whereby compensation may be fixed and other matters may be determined.  I understand that persons who were in the employment of the Intermediate Board at the date of the transfer, that is on the 1st April, 1922, do come under the terms of the Bill.  I do not undertake at the moment and without notice to give any indication of what rights they have, but at any rate they come within the scope of the Bill, and will in case of need be able to apply to the Tribunal for the determination of their rights.</P>

      <P>In reply to what the Minister said it appears to me that this Bill is to bring the views of the two Governments into accord. It is a sort of an offering of incense to Cæsar.  According to the statement of the Minister, his position is <Col N="1114" /> that while the Government are prepared to honour the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council with their lips, the British are, on the other hand, honouring it with their pockets.  That is exactly what we feel, that because the British are taking upon themselves the burden of the financial responsibility arising out of the decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, the Government here are prepared, on the other hand nominally, to accept that decision with their lips.  For that reason I think that we must vote against the Bill.</P>

I will then be able to take Deputy Thrift's amendment, which is an endeavour to make the two years' period into a three years' period by putting the question that the word &ldquo;two&rdquo; stand.  Deputy Good's amendment 3 hangs on his amendment 5 and the debate on the whole question could be taken on amendment 5.  So I will put amendments 1, 2 and 4.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;To delete all words after the word `workhouse,' line 41, to the end of the section.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill originally was to give relief to all people who were destitute, and to bring Dublin City into line with the rest of the country.  In the rest of the country, where a man is unable to obtain work the board of health is liable to give a small amount towards his subsistence.  I am asking that the residence qualification be removed I find that, with the exception of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, the ratepayers of Dublin, according to a report of a meeting of that body, are not opposed to the proposal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>A report appeared in the newspapers to-day of a meeting of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce. In that report, it appears that one of <Col N="1118" /> the members mentioned the fact that there was no opposition to the Bill, notwithstanding that they had got a Commissioner to come to the Chamber and to warn the people of the great increase in the rates it would mean if this Bill were passed.  Notwithstanding the propaganda of the Chamber of Commerce, they have failed to get the support of the ratepayers of Dublin in opposition to this Bill.  The Dublin members are requesting that the Government should give a contribution towards any extra expense that will be incurred. It is only when Dublin is asked to give similar relief to that given in the rest of the country that we find the Dublin members united in appealing to the Government to bear a portion of the cost.  We have no objection, but I would ask them to remember the ratepayers in other areas.  The amount of relief given in my county in 1923 was less than £5,000.  The cost of home assistance now given in small sums to able-bodied men with dependants who are willing to work and unable to obtain work is £15,000.  Dublin is complaining that its rates have increased, but their rates, according to Deputy Byrne, have increased from £163,000 to £264,000.  So Dublin rates have not increased in proportion to the rest of the country, as regards home assistance for the able-bodied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would appeal to those Deputies not to demand what I consider another boundary in this country. They are asking that a man who happens to be out of work should not get relief unless he was living for two years in the city.  Some of the people who are making that appeal, have made huge fortunes out of the sweat of people like these, and are living outside the city themselves. Probably, outside of Dublin there are many people in receipt of relief at the present time, who are Dublin people.  We have to maintain people who come from Dublin to the country looking for work; they are a charge upon our rates. We have in my own county at present a large number of people who are not natives of the county in receipt <Col N="1119" /> of home help.  I would ask the Minister if he has any statistics as to the number of people who may not be native born or two years in Dublin and who will be likely to be looking for home help.  I put it to him that the proportion is very small.  If there are any persons from the country districts out of work in Dublin and who would be looking for home assistance, the proportion is altogether smaller than the proportion of Dublin people who have to be maintained in country districts.  If the city of Dublin says that it is not going to fall into line with the rest of the country in this matter it will be going against the principle of the Poor Law Acts, because under these Acts a destitute man is entitled to get relief no matter from where he comes.  The expense of officials in trying to find out whether persons have two years residence in the city will be greater than the amount of immediate relief that an able-bodied man who is willing to work, if he can get it, will ask the ratepayers to pay.  It is not usual for a man from a country district who happens to be in the city to find himself out of work.  It is not likely that such men, when out of work, will remain in the city.  If only people with two years' residence are to get relief, it may hit the people of Dublin far harder, because we in the country districts will send back to Dublin those people who are at present getting home help, to be maintained at the expense of Deputy Good and other people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne says that men from the country districts are putting Dublin men out of employment, and another Deputy says that these men should be sent back to the place where they were born.  If many of us were sent back to the place we were born in, probably some people would not be in the comfortable position that they are in to-day and would have smaller bank balances. I would remind the House that reprisals will take place from Cork <Col N="1120" /> up to my own county and that these Dublin people will get short shrift and will be sent back for the Dublin people to maintain them.  We have never advocated that&mdash;I personally would not advocate it, because I hold that if a man is destitute, no matter where he comes from in the thirty-two counties, he is entitled to get relief, and no man, unless he is in very bad circumstances, will look for relief.  What we on these benches want, even if the Bill is passed, is not relief, but employment for men who are willing to work, instead of looking for charity or doles.</P>

      <P>The Pembroke Urban District Council desires to record its protest against the unjustifiable burden which will be cast upon the ratepayers should the Poor Relief (Dublin) Bill now before the Dáil be passed.  The poor and unemployed from all areas in the Saorstát come to Dublin with the hope of obtaining employment, and after failing to do so become a charge on the ratepayers in the Dublin area.  In the opinion of this council every county, including Dublin, should be called upon to carry its share of the burden.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In face of that I am afraid the Deputy must spend all his time in the country and very little in Dublin, if he is not aware of the fact that a large proportion of the ratepayers&mdash;I <Col N="1121" /> am satisfied it runs into 90 per cent.&mdash;are opposed to the burden imposed under this Bill.  Let me say that they are not opposed to the principle of the Bill, as far as I know.  As I said on the Second Reading, I have not heard a single protest against the giving of assistance to a destitute man or woman, but we do say that this Bill is unfair to the city, and for that reason we are opposed to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We on these benches agree entirely with the proposition put forward by Deputy Everett when he says that every destitute person should get relief.  We maintain that under the Bill, as we have it here, that relief is provided for. It is set out there that every destitute person must get relief.  If they do not get relief from the union they will get it outside.  Those who come from outside the area are also dealt with in the Bill.  Provision is made in the Bill for sending them back to the place that they are residents or inhabitants of.  The Bill therefore provides for relief for every destitute person.  We think that it is reasonable to ask that there should be some residence qualification, that two years is a reasonable period, and we propose therefore to vote for it.  It may be that there are Dublin people who seek relief outside the Dublin area.  They may go to Wicklow.  Many people probably do, but not many destitute ones, I think, go to Wicklow.  Many people who are ratepayers in Dublin live in County Wicklow, and Wicklow gets some return out of them.  I do not think that any great proportion of destitute people go out of Dublin to seek work in the country &mdash;not anything like the same proportion goes out of Dublin as comes into it.  Speaking from personal experience&mdash;and I think any Deputy living in Dublin will have had a similar experience&mdash;I know that a number of people come to my door day after day from the country looking for work or for money to take them back to the place where they came from.  That is, as I say, an almost daily experience of mine, <Col N="1122" /> and I think I am no exception in the matter.  As far as the citizens of Dublin are concerned, I think that it is fair to them to have a qualification of this kind, and we propose to stand by what is in the Bill.</P>

Deputy Good has read a resolution which shows what real opposition there is to this Bill.  The City Commissioners themselves are opposed to this Bill, the urban councils are opposed to it, the business men of the city are opposed to it, but we are not opposed to shouldering our liabilities to the destitute poor of the city. Deputy Everett contended that people will not remain in the city who do not find work.  What happened after the disbandment of the National Army?  Forty or fifty thousand people remained in the city of Dublin, and never left it. What will happen after the completion of the Shannon scheme?  The people who will be unemployed will drift up to Dublin with the hope of finding employment.</P>

      <P>Deputy Everett referred to some figures, and there he was about as correct as in some of the other facts that he gave the Dáil.  He said that I stated that £133,000 was spent here in relief of the destitute poor.  That was the figure for 1914, but he should have gone along and said that in 1927 the sum of £264,000 was spent in Dublin on the destitute poor.  Why cannot the Deputy be honest and straightforward and when he gives figures give correct figures?  This Bill will mean the placing of half a million of money on the shoulders of the people of Dublin.  We object to that, and not to taking our own fair share of the burden.  We want to see that the destitute poor are not allowed to go hungry.  That is the duty of all of us, and we are prepared to do it, but we strongly object to supporting the unemployed of the whole country, and that is the principle involved in this Bill.</P>

      <P>As far as members of this Party are concerned, we realise that this Bill, if passed into law, will place a fairly big burden upon the ratepayers of Dublin city and county.  But we want again to emphasise that Dublin is not being asked to do any more now than other parts of the country.  Deputy Byrne said that Dublin was shouldering the burden of the whole country.  That is not so.  I might put it this way: that Dublin is living on the remainder of the country. That would be nearer the truth than Deputy Byrne's statement.  We know, if this burden is put on the people of Dublin, the business people or others, in the end it will be the people down in the rural parts of the country who will have to pay it.  People come up from the country on buses and trains and go into Deputy Byrne's shop and make purchases. That shows that the Deputy is transferring the burden put upon him to somebody else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is most unfair to suggest that only those who are destitute and down and out come to Dublin from the country. We know that most of our pensioners, and also traders, who make a certain amount of money in other parts of the country, come up to Dublin and spend the remainder of their lives and their money there. Deputy Byrne told us that the people whom he represented and spoke for were against this Bill, and against even the principle of it. Deputy Good tells us that the people for whom he speaks are very sympathetic towards the poor, and are <Col N="1125" /> in favour of the principle of this Bill.  Deputy Good knows as well as I do that the principle of this Bill is worth very little to the unemployed, and to those who are hungry unless the money is forthcoming.</P>
      <P>I am rather surprised at the attitude taken up by Deputy O'Kelly.  I believe Deputy O'Kelly has had experience in poor law administration, and I am satisfied he is a man who would like to see the unemployed and the destitute getting sufficient to keep them alive.  Knowing the Deputy's very strong feelings upon any question of partition, I am surprised he should be in favour of a section of the Bill which aims at building a wall round the city and county of Dublin.  We believe that the people who are destitute should be relieved.  It is said that under the Bill those who do not come within the residence qualification can be sent back to their districts. How, and by whom?  Who is going to pay?  And what is to keep them between the time they make the application, and the time they are sent back, and the next meeting of the county board of health in their particular county?  I know the Minister will probably say that the home assistance officers are entitled to give emergency relief.  The Minister may not be aware that some of those county boards of health have given instructions against giving emergency relief, although the assistance officer is, by law, required to do so. I do not see that any serious case can be made against Deputy Everett's amendment.  Deputy Byrne does not try to make any case whatever, and Deputy Good has not tried to make any case against it The gist of Deputy Good's speech was that those for whom he speaks are in favour of the principle of the Bill.  As I say, the principle of the Bill is of no use to those who are unemployed and looking for food. Again, it ought to be emphasised that Dublin is not being asked to do any more under this Bill than the other poor law authorities in the country are doing already.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Really the only <Col N="1126" /> point at issue in connection with these amendments is the one referred to by Deputy O'Kelly.  This is no question of erecting a wall around Dublin city and county.  At the moment you have this position in Dublin city and county, that you have workhouses and that indoor relief is afforded.  Because an amalgamation scheme has not been set up in Dublin city and county, the provisions with regard to relief for the able-bodied have not, up to the present, applied.  This Bill proposes to apply them.  In deciding in the special circumstances of Dublin city and county how, in this temporary measure, relief to the able-bodied should be applied, it is proposed that relief, outside institutions, will only be given to persons who have a residence qualification here.  There is no question at all of denying relief to persons with a non-residence qualification.  The Bill provides that they can be relieved in the institutions that exist in Dublin city and county for the provision of indoor relief.  On the application of a person without a residence qualification, the payment by the guardians in the city and county of Dublin of his travelling expenses to a place where the board is satisfied &ldquo;that such removal is likely to enable such person to support himself and his dependants by his own industry or other lawful means&rdquo; can be made, On the board being satisfied that his removal will help him to support himself by industry or otherwise&mdash; by being kept by his friends or in any other way&mdash;the travelling expenses to the place suggested by the applicant himself can be paid.</P>

The point that Deputy Morrissey raises <Col N="1127" /> about another county board of health coming into the matter does not arise at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The point at issue then is simply this: that Deputies want to secure that every person applying for relief in the county and city of Dublin can, subject to the discretion of the guardians, get outdoor relief.  The proposition in the Bill is that certain institutions exist in the county and city of Dublin at present for the giving of indoor relief.  It is proposed to utilise those institutions for that purpose so that, say, people coming from the rural districts into Dublin without any prospect of getting employment in the city, but coming in the hope that they can get relief in the city, will not be invited by any arrangement here to leave the country and come into the city.  There is the danger with regard to the city and county of Dublin that, if there was no residence qualification, people at the present moment in the rural districts would be attracted to the city. They would come up here really looking for relief, whilst pretending to look for employment.  The difference between other counties and the city and county of Dublin is not so marked, for the giving of outdoor relief to able-bodied people is a matter of discretion with those dealing with the distribution of relief.  In these circumstances, if there is anything unreasonable in the situation of a person who applies to a local body down the country for relief, it is entirely in the hands of the local body as to whether they will give it or not.  As far as I know, there has not been any scrap of complaint from any area that persons from other counties or other areas have been applying for this particular class of relief in their area.</P>

      <P>The Minister has unconsciously, I think, made a speech in favour of the amendment moved by Deputy Everett.  He has stated that the destitute poor resident in Dublin city or county for less than two years will be entitled to indoor relief under the provisions of this Bill, but that they will not be entitled to outdoor relief.  I would like to know from the Minister if he has taken into consideration the fact that, in most cases, indoor relief costs more than outdoor relief, while of course it must not be forgotten that the giving of the latter helps to keep the homes of many people together.  The Minister has not contradicted the statement of Deputy Morrissey that this amendment only asks that the same treatment be given to the destitute poor in the city and county of Dublin, as is already being given in other counties through the boards of health.  As far as Dublin men are concerned, they have always been looked upon in other parts of the country as people with a very broad outlook.  I must say that the remarks of Deputy Good and of Deputy J. J. Byrne would give one the impression that they have a very narrow outlook. They want, as it were, to get preferential treatment for the city and county of Dublin as against the other counties.  It has been asserted by the Chamber of Commerce and by Deputy Good, I think, at one time, that Dublin was carrying the rest of the country on its back.  I believe it is the other way about.  I believe that if a wall were built around Dublin city and county, and that the trade of those residing within that area was cut away from the rest of the country, there would be no necessity for the existence of such a body as the Chamber of Commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Good made what I can only describe as a laughable plea on <Col N="1129" /> behalf of the poor Dublin ratepayers. I suggest to him that he does not represent the poor ratepayers in Dublin city and county who&mdash;and I admit there are some&mdash; are altogether in favour of this Bill. They believe that the destitute people in the city and county of Dublin, even if they are not resident here for two years, should be relieved in the same way as the destitute poor are relieved in the other counties of the Saorstát.  Deputy Good referred to the fact that the Dublin Chamber of Commerce was not the only body that passed a resolution condemning this section in the Bill.  The Deputy quoted a resolution that was passed by the Pembroke Urban District Council.  The Deputy, however, did not tell us who the mover of the resolution was at the meeting of that council.  I wonder would I be correct in saying &mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Deputy appears to be more interested in the wealthier classes of ratepayers in Dublin City and County than he is, say, in those who reside around Talbot Street, Gloucester Street, Gardiner Street and other areas around there.  The Deputy is really asking for preferential treatment for Dublin City and County.  Might I point out that Dublin City and County has already got preferential treatment because, in regard to <Col N="1130" /> tariffs that were put on certain articles, Dublin got the benefit of the industries that were established and the employment given as a result of them.</P>

I put it that any money taken from the ratepayers under the provisions of this Bill, if Deputy Everett's amendment is accepted, will go towards the cost of relieving the destitute in the city and county, for whom I am sorry Deputy Byrne has not more regard.  If a person who has not the two years' residential qualification is given indoor relief that will be more costly than if he were given outdoor relief.  I think the House should support the amendment moved by Deputy Everett, which will not alone help the destitute poor in the city and county of Dublin, but will also help the ratepayers, because otherwise the cost would be greater in the long run.  I think the House would be well advised to accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey stated that he had some difficulty in understanding Deputy O'Kelly's attitude in relation to this amendment. I have listened very carefully to the speeches which have been made in support of the amendment, and I have not yet satisfied myself that I have discovered a real reason why the amendment was tabled. Deputy Morrissey gave in the course of his remarks only one such reason, and one which indicated that he had either not read or failed to grasp the proposals contained in the Bill. Deputy Everett did give one reason which, I think, requires examination, <Col N="1131" /> and that is the difficulty which will arise in determining the two years' residence qualification, and the expense which may be involved in making inquiries in that connection.  I asked the Minister for Local Government on the occasion of the Second Reading to inform us as to the actual machinery which it was proposed to set up for the purpose of deciding disputed cases in relation to the residence qualification, and he could not inform me what the machinery would be.  He said it would be a matter for the City Commissioners to decide.  I would like if he could give any more information on that matter now, because it seems to me that no matter what appears in the Bill the residence qualification will, in fact, prove to be inoperative because of the difficulty of proving or disproving statements made by the applicants for relief.  The case for the maintenance of the residence qualification is that there is undoubtedly a drift towards Dublin of the unemployed from the rest of the country.  That statement can be and has been questioned.  I ask those who doubt it to do no more than examine the census returns for the year 1926.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>That applies to all cities and towns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, to all cities to an extent, and to some towns, but to Dublin more than any other.  The mere fact that the population of Dublin is increasing and continues to increase while the population of the entire country is decreasing is proof that the abolition of the residence qualification would mean that the destitute poor at present coming to Dublin from any other part of the country would be immediately in the position to qualify for outdoor relief.  That would tend to increase the drift of the unemployed towards Dublin, and, in my opinion, such a result would be nationally bad.  Let us be quite clear about this.  There is adequate provision in the Bill for dealing with the destitute poor that have been resident in Dublin for <Col N="1132" /> more than two years.  They can get outdoor relief.  If they have been resident in Dublin for less than two years either they can be sent at the expense of the Dublin ratepayers to any other place where they can secure employment or maintain themselves through their own efforts, or else they can, at the expense of the Dublin ratepayers, be maintained in the workhouses. There is, I admit, a strong case in favour of outdoor relief as against institutional relief.  Deputy Cassidy is on fairly sure ground in his argument in that connection, but he has not, I think, examined the position far enough.  In the first place, the question of preserving family life will not arise, for the only persons debarred from getting outdoor relief will be the destitute poor from the country with less than two years' residence, and they will not be people with families.</P>

      <P>I grant that in a small number of cases they may, but in the majority of cases they will be young people who come to Dublin for the purpose of getting employment and who will find themselves temporarily destitute here.  Deputy Cassidy argued that the cost of indoor relief is greater than the cost of outdoor relief.  It is per head, but it is not the cost per head that is worrying the ratepayers of Dublin, but the total cost of the whole scheme, and the total cost of providing indoor relief to the destitute poor who are without the two years' residence qualification will, I am convinced, be less than the cost of providing outdoor relief.</P>

      <P>I cannot give the approximate figures.  The scheme has not been in operation, and we can only make up our minds upon our own calculations as to what the results of the various provisions will be.  My conclusion is that the abolition of the residence qualification <Col N="1133" /> will increase the drift of the unemployed towards Dublin.  People who might come to Dublin for the purpose of seeking employment here are prevented by the prospect of being here a considerable time without getting work, but if the residence qualification is abolished they will come knowing that if they cannot get work immediately they can get outdoor relief&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Yes, but they cannot get employment at home.  There is no doubt that though there is considerable unemployment in Dublin there is more employment in Dublin than in the country, and the person who cannot get work in the country may get employment in Dublin. There is more employment here, and the destitute person will feel that there is some prospect of improving his position in Dublin and that there is no prospect in the rural area in which he is resident, and as he can get outdoor relief in Dublin as he can at home he will come to Dublin and take the chance of getting any work that may be available.  Deputy Morrissey was wrong in his interpretation of the Bill when he said it proposed to send a person with less than two years' residence qualification back to the area he came from. There is no such proposal in the Bill.</P>

      <P>There is a case to be made for outdoor relief in preference to indoor relief from a theoretical point of view, but this Bill imposes a substantial burden upon the ratepayers of Dublin.  so much so that one of its effects will be to increase the number of unemployed, as there are struggling industries that may go under as a result of this burden, and new industries which might otherwise be started will not be started because of the high rates that will prevail.  Let us consider that aspect of the question.  The burden will be very heavy.  I do not agree with Deputy Byrne that the ratepayers are opposed to the Bill.  I think the general attitude in Dublin amongst the ratepayers is that there is the duty to provide for the destitute poor, and that though the burden will be very heavy they would like to meet that burden, and they do not want to shirk their obvious duty to the destitute poor. It is obviously in the national interest that the burden should not be unduly increased, and it would, I think, be unduly increased if the residence qualification was abolished, not merely because there will be that drift of the unemployed towards Dublin for the purpose of getting relief out of the rates, but also because the whole work of the scheme will be impeded by its deletion.  As I said in the beginning, I am not at all sure that the residential qualification will prove workable, but there should be some means of checking any such tendency on the part of the unemployed, destitute poor throughout the country gravitating to Dublin for the purpose of seeking work, knowing that while they are looking for it they will be maintained out of the rates in Dublin.  I think that the residential qualification of two years is fair, because they can get institutional relief or get back to some place where they can get employment.  The ratepayers are not shirking their duty to the poor.  They are devising a method to meet that duty which will make the burden to themselves lighter in consequence.</P>

      <P>Deputy Byrne claims to be the eloquent spokesman of the poor down-and-out shopkeeper, the poor fellow who can buy potatoes at threepence per stone from a countryman and sell them at tenpence per stone.  The poor down-and-out shopkeeper passes on this and every other charge to the persons who buy in his shop.  Deputy Byrne admitted that he is always willing to welcome any person coming into his shop, even those who come from the country, to buy anything which he is in a position to sell so long as he gets a reasonable return.  I suggest that if he is prepared to take money from a countryman who buys what he has to sell, he should take the risk involved in having people coming to the city to get employment and subsequently losing it.  He should shoulder the responsibility which will save that individual from starvation.  Deputy Lemass made a far better case in support of the Bill than the Minister attempted to make, but neither the Minister nor Deputy Lemass, unlike the Chambers of Commerce, the &ldquo;Irish Independent&rdquo; and other newspapers, which are bawling and groaning about this Bill, gave us anything like reliable estimates as to the cost of the Bill.  I want to know from the Minister what would be the charge which, in the ordinary course, would fall on the Dublin city and county ratepayers by leaving out the two years' residence qualification and what would be saved to those ratepayers by the inclusion of that qualification.  I think that we should have figures from the Minister, as I am not, and apparently Deputy Lemass is not, disposed to accept the figures which have been floating around from the Chamber of Commerce and other bodies which represent nobody.</P>

      <P>We are looking for light, and I am willing to accept information from the eloquent spokesman of the poor down-and-out shopkeeper. Deputy Lemass contradicted himself in his enthusiasm, I suppose, for the measure.  I agree that it is right and proper for Deputies O'Kelly and Lemass to shout and bawl as much as they can against the Bill, but what about Deputy Boland or Deputy Sheehy from Tipperary? What have they to say on this matter?  Are they in agreement with the Front Bench shadow Ministers in backing the Government in support of this measure?  That is a coalition which we sometimes see in this House&mdash;the Minister for Local Government and the shadow Minister for Local Government backing each other in building a wall to <Col N="1137" /> divide the rich from the poor, but not in building a wall to keep out of the city those who have money to buy anything from the shopkeepers. Deputy Lemass stated that the drift towards the city is a drift of the unemployed, and he went on to say that it is a drift of people who come to the city to take up employment and who subsequently become destitute and unemployed.  Which is it?</P>

      <P>I suggest that there is such a thing in this country as movable occupations and nobody knows that better than Deputy Good. Deputy Good and people in his line of business, in the building trade, often induce men, such as plasterers, carpenters, and bricklayers, to come from the country in the hope of getting permanent employment in the city building trades.  Deputy Good and others who are similarly circumstanced get people to leave their homes, such as they are, in the country on the assumption that they will get permanent employment here, but these people subsequently find themselves out of work without any home to which they can return. That often happens in the building trade.  There are many operatives walking around the city who came to Dublin some years ago in the hope that the work which they got would be permanent.  Deputy Good suggests that they should be shifted back or given indoor relief which might possibly prevent them from getting any employment that might be going.  Deputy Byrne was suffering from an elastic imagination when he suggested that between 40,000 and 50,000 of National Army men were thrown on the city when they were demobilised.  Does Deputy Byrne know that the strength of the National Army never exceeded the figure of 52,000?  I suggest that he is suffering from an elastic imagination when he says that 40,000 of them were thrown on the ratepayers of the city.</P>

      <P>The present Minister for Local Government was Minister for Defence when the National Army was at its height, and I am sure that he is in a position to tell his colleague in the representation of North City that there were never 40,000 Army men stationed in Dublin. Deputy Colohan knows that very well, because a big percentage of them were stationed at Cork, or rather at the Curragh.  What I meant to say was that a good number of them came from Cork, but were stationed at the Curragh.  It is quite true that the Dublin ratepayers are actually living on the fat of the land.  Any wealth or extravagance that one can see in the country to-day is to be seen in the principal streets of the city.  Those who make money out of the people who work on the land are spending it in the city upon themselves, but apparently they are not able to do anything for the down-and-out people who may come from the country to seek employment here and become destitute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I am not at all in sympathy with a residential clause in the administration of relief, but one must view this matter from all angles, and I have sympathy with the Dublin ratepayers <Col N="1139" /> who are being asked to shoulder the burden of the whole country.  If Deputy Everett was correct in his contention, in introducing the amendment, it would indicate that at the present time in Dublin City there must be a tremendous number of destitute poor who are under two years in the city.  I wish to disagree with Deputy Everett on that, and I am satisfied that the number who would be affected at the present time by the residential clause is not so very big. None of us has any figures and none of us can say how many will be affected by the residential clause.  I am prepared to say, as a result of an investigation that I have been trying to make over the week-end, that the number of destitute poor from the country will not be so great, as distinct from the poor in Dublin itself. I think that Deputy Lemass is quite right in saying that, if this residential clause was not inserted in the Bill, we might find ourselves in Dublin called upon to shoulder the burden of the nation, and we are not prepared to do that.  The Government will not solve the unemployment question as a national problem, and certainly it cannot be expected that Dublin City itself should take the whole burden on its shoulders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures which Deputy Davin asked for would certainly be interesting, but we cannot get these figures, and I think it is a waste of time for Deputy Davin and Deputy Byrne to be haranguing each other as to what happened the demobilised members of the National Army, when we know that if the whole 52,000 had been disbanded in Dublin and remained here, their maintenance would be on the shoulders of the ratepayers here, according to this Bill, because it is over two years since disbandment took place.  We are trying to give relief to those who require it.  The position is that Dublin will have to shoulder a big burden, but it cannot be expected that even the shopkeepers whom Deputy Byrne and Deputy Davin spoke about should be compelled to close up altogether to pay for the <Col N="1140" /> maintenance of the destitute poor from country districts.  There is no question that if this residential clause were not inserted we in Dublin City and County would find ourselves called upon to provide for the poor of the whole Twenty-six Counties.  I am rather reluctant to find myself in the position of differentiating at all as to whether the destitute poor come from Dublin or from the country, but I feel I have a responsibility to the constituents of Dublin City, and I must in the circumstances support the residential clause.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughColohan" hpid="Mr. Colohan Mr. Colohan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Colohan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support the amendment moved by Deputy Everett.  The residential clause of two years, as set out in the Bill, is a two-edged weapon.  We could use it with effect in the different counties outside Dublin, especially in county Kildare.  A lot of the men demobilised from the National Army are Dublin men.  There are men from other counties also, and when they are demobilised from the Curragh, they remain hanging round the county, and we have to give them assistance.  I want to make it quite clear that I am not opposed to giving assistance to the destitute poor from any county, but I certainly believe that this clause which provides that in order to qualify for relief in Dublin a person must be resident here for two years is a retrograde step and a reactionary measure.  Further, the word &ldquo;workhouse&rdquo; appears in the Bill.  When we were setting up the county boards of health seven or eight years ago we were led to believe that we would not use the word &ldquo;workhouse&rdquo; in any enactment of this House, and we have it now in a Bill in 1929.  At that time it was said that assistance was to be given outside the workhouse wherever possible. No one was to go into the county home, and if one mentioned the word &ldquo;workhouse&rdquo; at a meeting of the board of health, one would be asked to go outside.  Here we are bringing back the old taint of pauperism again and demoralising our people.  That comes from both sides of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1141" /> Unemployment has been caused in the rural areas in many cases because the people come to Dublin in buses to make their purchases.  The Dublin shopkeepers get the benefit of the country money in that way, and the traders in our country towns are complaining.  I can see if this amendment is defeated that our county board of health will get to work to see what they can do in the other direction, in sending people after demobilisation from the Army back to Dublin.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health was the Minister for Defence seven years ago, and I remember that as a member of the board of health and of Naas No. 1 District Council I had to try to get separation allowances for some of the men serving in the National Army.  I found I had great difficulty in getting these allowances from the Minister. When I brought the matter up <Col N="1142" /> at a meeting of the board of health and urged that the Minister should provide for these people the Minister's officers would not allow the proceedings of that meeting to be published in the local papers.  He threw the charge that should rightly attach to his Department on to the county board of health of Kildare.  We have the exact opposite now in this case, and I say that it is grossly unfair to insert a two years' residence qualification to debar any man who may become destitute in the city from getting relief.  It is not right to offer him the workhouse.  I hope the Deputies on my left will reconsider the position and vote for the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In line 43 to delete the word &ldquo;two&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;three.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>With nearly everyone who has spoken I too recognise the necessity for some exceptional measure for dealing with the destitution which is rife in the city.  No one, I think, challenges that.  But I and other Independent Deputies are very anxious that the exceptional measure that is taken shall not be of a character which is likely to intensify the very evil it seeks to alleviate.  We do not want that anything should be done which is at all calculated to increase unemployment, which is really the cause of the destitution that is abroad, and we think that there is great danger&mdash;though the Minister has given us no figures&mdash; from the figures which have been supplied, that this Bill will actually tend to increase unemployment and not diminish it, because there will be such extra charges put upon those who are very little able to afford it that there will be a tendency amongst them to employ fewer people, and the more you increase the rates that that kind of person has to pay, the more likely it is that the effect will be that somebody is to be thrown out of employment.  I admit that the amendment which I am advocating is likely to have a very small effect, but we believe that it will have some effect in diminishing the charge which is likely to fall upon the city of Dublin through this Bill.  We cannot give the figures to show to what extent this may operate, but we think the tendency will be that to a certain extent it will diminish the total charges that fall upon the rates of the city, and that is the reason that I am suggesting that the residential qualification should be increased from the two years' period to the three years' period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the exception of the Labour Deputies, I think almost everybody admits that Dublin is in an exceptional position, for to an exceptional degree the unemployed are drifting towards Dublin in the hope of getting employment, and therefore I think there is no point in the argument which says that the effect of this Bill is simply to put Dublin in the same position as the rest of the country.  It cannot be so done. It can be done in the letter of the <Col N="1145" /> law.  In fact, if you make the letter of the law the same for the city of Dublin as for the rest of the country it puts Dublin in an unfavourable position.  That is our argument. Dublin is to bear a greater share, as a matter of fact, from the inevitable tendency of the unemployed to drift towards the city in the hope of getting employment.  As Deputy Lemass showed definitely, that is the case; the unemployed are so drifting. In that connection I would quote a paragraph from the Report of the Commission on the Relief of the Sick and Destitute Poor.  That is the paragraph in which Mr. MacLysaght, the Chairman of the Dublin Union Commissioners, recommended that persons with less than three years' residence in the Union area before admission to the institution should not be chargeable to the Union.  He gave some figures which tended to show the fact to which I have referred.  He submitted the following statistics as to the number of persons admitted to the Dublin workhouse through a period of nine months and who had not been three years resident in the city.  The figures are:&mdash;Persons aged 60 and upwards, 59; persons aged 59 and over 40, 138; persons aged 40 and over 30, 156; and persons aged 30 and under, 513.  You have, out of 866 persons, 513 who are under the age of 30, young people not resident three years in the city of Dublin and who had drifted into the workhouse, no doubt having come to the city in the hope of getting employment.</P>
    <P>Mr. MacLysaght suggested that, unless a person had been resident for at least three years in the city, the charge of maintaining him or her in the Union workhouse should not be made chargeable against the Dublin Union.  Our contention is that Dublin is in an exceptional position and that therefore there is no point in making the letter of the law exactly the same for Dublin as for the rest of the country.  If you do so you make the burden upon the city and county of Dublin unfavourably heavy.  I am not able to give you figures which will tend to <Col N="1146" /> show the nature of the relief that would come by the substitution of the three for the two years' period. It would be difficult to get those figures.  I do not anticipate that the difference would be serious, but it would be something and we think it is imperatively necessary that we should do everything we can to make the charge that is going to fall on the city ratepayers as small as possible. For that reason we are supporting certain amendments which will have the effect of somewhat diminishing the extent of that charge. I hope this amendment will commend itself to the House because we believe it will have some small effect on the total magnitude of the rate which will inevitably have to be borne by the city.  We believe that that rate will be so big that it will make it increasingly difficult for many people to make both ends meet.</P>

      <P>Apropos of what Deputy Thrift says in regard to Mr. MacLysaght's evidence, that question was fully considered by the Commission at the time and their opinion was that even if it were thought advisable to put a residence restriction on persons coming to Dublin to seek institutional relief, that restriction should not be more than one year of residence.  They pointed out the very great difficulties that had arisen elsewhere and that would arise here if there were a restriction like that.  We propose a restriction here and we say in connection with it that we are not, by reason of putting on a restriction, denying relief; we are not preventing persons who have not any residence qualification from getting institutional relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been pointed out that institutional relief is more costly than outdoor relief, and possibly there would be no reason for not giving outdoor relief as against institutional relief if there was not the point that the giving of outdoor relief direct would inevitably lure to the city persons who were unemployed. The type of relief that we propose here for persons who have not the necessary residential qualification <Col N="1147" /> is indoor relief or payment at the expense of the Guardians to return persons either to their own homes or to some other place where the Guardians would be persuaded that they can earn their own livings or get sustenance as apart from relief.  To extend the residential period of two years to three years would make the period too big, in my opinion.</P>
    <P>I think if a person has been resident in the city for two years and has been in employment, perhaps casual employment, he is then faced with the problem of suggesting where he could go and get work.  A man who has spent more than two years in the city is in a very different position from the point of view of possible connection with work elsewhere in the country, from a person who has been less than two years here, and I think the additional year between two and three is very material from that point of view. The two years gives us all we want in the matter of a safeguard, that is, protection against persons being lured into the city by the hope of employment, and more particularly in expectation that if they did not get employment they would get outdoor relief.  I think two years is ample for that particular purpose, and that to extend it to three years would create a difficulty between two alternatives, between the alternative of accepting indoor relief or accepting a transfer to some other place where they expected to get work.  I would like to say, a propos of the point raised, that this period applies to the able-bodied who have not a residential qualification, and does not apply to the infirm or sick who may lack a residential qualification, or to persons who may be entitled to what is called provisional relief.  I submit to the House that two years' residential qualification is ample to provide for the cases we ought to provide for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We intend to oppose this amendment for the same reason as Deputy Thrift stated he had in proposing it.  We think it would increase the burden that will be <Col N="1148" /> placed on the Dublin ratepayers under the Bill.  The case for the existence of a residential qualification, whether or not that residential qualification could be made effective, is that it will act as a deterrent against poor persons coming to Dublin in the hope of getting employment. But if any of those persons come to Dublin and get employment, or continue to reside here for a period of two years, I think we are safe in assuming that they will remain for three years; in other words, that they will look upon Dublin as their permanent residence, in which case, if they are destitute, we will have to provide for them either in the institutions or by outdoor relief.  If we have to provide for them in institutions, the cost is going to be heavier than if we have to provide for them by outdoor relief.  Therefore, we think it is much better that the local authority should be free to meet their cases by the method of outdoor relief in preference to the method of institutional relief.  It will be cheaper and more efficient, and will not be subject to all the various objections to which institutional relief is subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point made by Deputy Thrift concerning the recommendation that only persons with three years' residence should receive institutional relief does not arise in connection with the amendment at all, because whether this amendment is passed or not, any person will be entitled to claim institutional relief, and I think it is right that they should be able to do so, because otherwise you would have the possibility of having persons in the city, for whom no provision of any kind could be made, who could in fact die of starvation before relief could be brought to them.  There must be certain provision made to ensure that no one will die of starvation.  I think that will be agreed.  That provision can be more cheaply and more efficiently provided by outdoor relief than in institutions.  If we have provided for the difficulty which the absence of a residential qualification would involve, by having two years' residential <Col N="1149" /> qualification in the Bill, then we can afford, and in fact we would prefer to give outdoor relief to those in need of relief in preference to institutional relief.  I think the Deputy would be well advised to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not admit at all that Deputy Lemass is right in his view as to the way this would work out.  I am quite sure he is wrong.  I do not think he surveyed the situation rightly.  If it were the case that everybody having somewhere between two and three years' residence in the city were to go into the workhouse instead of obtaining outdoor relief, no doubt it would be more expensive.  But we know quite well that that is not what happens. There are various other ways by which these people get assistance, and by this Bill we shall very largely remove the tremendous strain that has been put on philanthropic institutions. That will be to a very large extent taken out of their hands.  I had definitely in mind that by extending the limit a certain distance you would relieve those institutions of quite a perceptible amount of the work which they have done in the past, and for which they are supported by benevolent people's subscriptions, and I do not think that would be a wise thing to do.  I recognise that there is not the slightest use in pressing the amendment against the united will of the Ministerial side and the Fianna Fáil side. However, I am still convinced that if this amendment were accepted it would relieve the burden to some small extent.  I cannot give figures, and, under the circumstances, I ask the leave of the House to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <P>To add at the end of the section the following proviso:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and provided always that the expenses incurred by such relief shall not exceed the amount that would be raised by a rate not exceeding three shillings in the pound on the corresponding area of charge.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>A good deal of what I might have said in support of this amendment has already really been said by Deputy Lemass, Deputy Briscoe and Deputy Thrift.  We all agree that Dublin is in a very exceptional position as regards other large centres, and Deputy Lemass and Deputy Briscoe especially stressed the point that whatever increase there is in the rates in order to meet this relief for the poor, which we all admit is right, will tell very heavily against certain businesses and industries in Dublin, and perhaps outside it, and produce unemployment.  My idea is that we should not give a blank cheque to those who are going to administer the relief.  It has been stated in various newpapers, and at meetings, that the relief may mean anything from 2/- to 5/- in the £ in any one year.  We have had nothing definite from the Minister&mdash;perhaps he is not able to give us anything definite&mdash;but what I suggest is that the rates should not be increased by more than a maximum of three shillings in any one year, and if the amount produced by these three shillings is not sufficient to afford the relief contemplated in the Bill, those who administer the relief should cut their clothes according to their cloth. or else that the Minister should supplement the amount raised by some contribution from Government funds.  There is really nothing more that I can say.  I think Deputy Lemass put it very clearly as to the effect that this may have on industries, and I would ask the Minister to consider seriously fixing the maximum of three shillings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather surprised that this amendment should appear on the Paper at all, because it seems to me to be in direct conflict with the whole principle of the Bill. I have had some experience of home assistance as administered by other boards, and I cannot see how the people who will be entrusted with the administration of this Bill can be asked to differentiate between applicants for home assistance.  I take it that the principle of the Bill is to relieve the destitute, and I cannot see any case whatever for putting a limit to the amount and to the number of cases that are to be dealt with.  If it is a question of getting the Minister to contribute a certain amount to the fund which will be available for this purpose, that is another matter, but from what appears on the face of the amendment it seems to me to be undesirable, and I ask the House to reject it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In case any confusion may have been created by Deputy J. X. Murphy's remarks, let me say that I intend to oppose this amendment. Despite the burden the Bill places upon the citizens of Dublin, they should be asked to meet the cost of providing relief for the destitute poor, and if Deputy Murphy's amendment were in operation it would result in a certain number of the destitute poor being unable to secure relief.  I take it that the amount which a three-shillings rate would bring in would be expended, as long as it would last, upon the relief of the able-bodied poor, and as soon as it was exhausted no further relief could be given until the next year, when a further amount would be realised by another three shillings rate.  That would mean that towards the end of each financial year there would be a certain number of destitute poor who would be unable to get relief.  If we are going to put this burden upon the ratepayers, let us put it in such a way that we will not appear to be hoodwinking the destitute poor.  It seems to me that if we pass this Bill, while at the same time strictly limiting the <Col N="1152" /> amount which can be spent under it, we are, in fact, hoodwinking those who are to receive relief under it.  Deputy Murphy indicated that it more money were needed it might be provided by the Minister for Finance out of State funds.  But if moneys are provided by the Minister for Finance out of State funds, this amendment is not necessary.  Certainly, I would like to hear the Minister for Finance promising to supply the money before the amendment was even moved.</P>
      <P>I want to put this point to the Deputy, that if the money comes from the Exchequer to the Corporation as a grant-in-aid of relief, the amount which the Corporation will be required to levy off the rates in order to supplement that sum will be fixed by them, and this amendment will certainly not be necessary at all, because obviously they will not strike a rate higher than three shillings if it is not necessary.  If the money does not come from the Central Fund, or from any other source, then the burden must be placed upon the ratepayers.  Personally, I hope that some means will be devised for making the burden sit as lightly as possible on the shoulders of the ratepayers, but if that means cannot be devised the burden will have to be placed there.  If this amendment were passed the problem would be dealt with only in a partial manner by giving relief to one section of the able-bodied poor, and making it impossible to give relief to another section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment has one advantage at least: it will show the House the magnitude of the problem that will confront the Commissioners in administering this Bill.  I understand that a penny in the £ on the rates of Dublin produces something like £6,000, and three shillings in the £ would produce a sum amounting to £216,000.  Deputy Murphy wants to fix a limit to what this Bill will commit the city of Dublin to, and we now have the official Opposition committed to the principle that we should fix no limit to the amount which must be paid by <Col N="1153" /> the ratepayers under this Bill.  I think that at least it is a good thing to have that principle appearing on the records of this House, and I hope that when the representatives of Dublin City in that Party face their constituents again their action in connection with this Bill will be carefully considered by those who have the best interests of Dublin City at heart.</P>
      <P>It has been stated here to-day that the commercial community of this city are reaping fortunes under existing conditions.  That statement was made without a scintilla of evidence produced to support it.  It was, in fact, an utterly untrue statement. Anybody who looks at the balance sheets of business firms in this city will be aware that the maximum dividends paid are about ten per cent., that the greater number of them are unable to pay two and a half per cent., and that a very large number are unable to pay any dividend at all.</P>

I also want to make it perfectly clear that another statement made by members of the Labour Party has no foundation in fact.  They stated that this burden can be passed on by the commercial community to the consumers in extra prices for the goods which they sell.  I wonder if they have any idea of what competition there is at the present moment in the city of Dublin for the limited volume of trade that is available.  I wonder if they know that firms established in this city for over a century are unable to pay any dividends at all.  Do they realise that many firms, in order to keep afloat, are drawing substantially on their reserves?</P>

      <P>As I have stated on more than one occasion, the ratepayers of Dublin are ready and willing to foot the bill for the destitute poor of the city, but we are not, as we are asked in this Bill, ready to accept responsibilities for which there is no right or title.  It has been said by some of the most serious speakers in this House that there is no doubt whatever that this Bill will lead to unemployment.  I believe that there are certain large firms here which, when this Bill becomes law, may have to face an increase in their rates ranging from £300 to £500 a year.  I know that some of these firms are competing against English firms, that they are in a very bad way of business, being able to pay no dividends whatever, and being anxious, if possible, to transfer their businesses to other hands.  That is what is involved in the principle of the Bill.  It requires a business man to understand these things, and those are the real facts, if the House wants to have them and wants to consider the net effect which this Bill will have upon the city.  There is scarcely a shopkeeper in the city who will not be faced with an increase in his rates of from £20 to £30 a year.  I can speak for a large number of the shopkeepers of Dublin, and I know that the greater portion of them are very hard pushed to meet the rates at all, even at 14/8 in the £.  If the rates go up to something like 19/6 or 20/- in the £, what will become of the families of the smaller shopkeepers?  Have they not got a claim upon the consideration of this House?  Are they not entitled to consideration?  I think that Deputies ought to take a wide and a broad view of this matter and endeavour to do what is best, not alone for the destitute poor of the city, but what is best in the interest of all the citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been pointed out by many Deputies that this will have repercussions upon industries set up in this country.  In that respect the Labour Party is the most irresponsible Party that one could meet They never take into consideration <Col N="1155" /> how the bill is to be met.  It means nothing to them where the money is to be found.  That is one fault I have always to find with the Labour Party in this House&mdash;their tendency to commit the nation to anything and to let the men in authority and responsibility find the money and foot the bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing this amendment.  The question has been raised from time to time as to what burden this measure is going to place on the city and the county. All kinds of figures have been talked of.  When figures are mentioned they can be multiplied and increased and translated into rates and then the rates multiplied and increased.  There has been generally a volume of criticism based on what are alleged to be the possibilities of this Bill that would suggest that Dublin was not a place where people ought to invest their capital.  The whole of that is very unfounded.  I am asked whether I will accept the estimate that has been publicly given by the Dublin City Commissioners that in certain circumstances the probable cost of this will be an additional £200,000 a year. My answer is, I do not accept that. The amount spent during 1927 on outdoor relief in the Dublin Union, that is, that part of the city and county taking in the city proper&mdash; Rathmines, Pembroke, the North Dublin Rural District, the South Dublin Rural District, and Celbridge&mdash;was £99,607, and that £99,000 included £11,000 spent on special relief under what is known as Section 13.  In the year ended March, 1928, the total amount spent was £86,050, including £4,500 special relief.  The amount of money spent in the year ended March, 1929, was £88,538, including £1,280 on special relief; and the estimate this year, including a certain amount on special relief is £93,000. I admit the Commissioners will expect to exceed that estimate, but these are the figures for the whole area covered by the present Dublin Union for <Col N="1156" /> ordinary outdoor relief for the last three years, and the figures that were estimated at the beginning of this year.  I am asked to believe that because relief is extended to the able-bodied that an amount of £200,000 additional is going to be spent upon the additional class of relief.  My answer is, I do not believe it.  And in the face of the five shillings and the six shillings and all that we are quoted as falling upon the unfortunate ratepayers of the city of Dublin, I say that even if the £200,000 fell upon the area of Dublin, Rathmines and Pembroke, it would be less than 2/9 in the £ in the rates for a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister would allow me to interrupt, it is agreed, I think, that the coming rates will have to cover a much larger period than one year.  They will have to cover a period of eighteen months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I said for a full year something less than 2/9 for £200,000, which I do not believe.  So that assume that this Bill comes into operation on 1st December and that you run four months, and assume, as the calculation of £200,000 has been made on an expenditure running normally month for month without any fluctuation over 12 months, that one-third of it is going in addition to fall, it gives you, to your 2/9, an additional 1/3.  It gives you 4/- in special circumstances, assuming that the burden is going to fall on the city, which, personally, I do not believe.  Deputies want exact figures. I cannot give you exact figures, but I can say that, with a very considerable sense of responsibility in the matter, I do not believe that the expenditure on this particular class of relief in the city, if it is administered in the way it ought to be administered, is going to be more than twice what the expenditure on ordinary relief has been for the last few years over Rathmines, Pembroke, Dublin, the North Rural District of Dublin, the South Rural District and Celbridge.</P>

      <P>Deputies will understand how difficult it is even for a City Commissioner who may be close up to the situation to arrive at a figure of the unemployed and to say with regard to a figure like this particular 3/-, that fifty per cent. of this expenditure should fall over the whole State.  If you put up a figure of three shillings here, you put up a figure to be aimed at for this particular class of expenditure, not only here in the city of Dublin but in Limerick, Cork, Mayo, Donegal and other counties where this particular class of relief can be given.  As I say, it is absolutely unnecessary. There is only one way, in the present circumstances, to find out what is the true problem of this nature in the city and to prevent extravagant expenditure for whatever problem there may be.  That is proper and effective administration.  If we here and ratepayers in the city of Dublin are frightened by expressions of one kind or another and are driven to run away from the problem instead of facing it up and saying &ldquo;this is a problem which if it is serious will require our serious attention,&rdquo; it is a serious matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The city may not be able to bear a rate of 3/- in normal circumstances but there is only one way of facing the problem and to prevent it growing unnecessarily and that is setting out with a determination that this matter is going to be looked at thoroughly by an efficiently laid out scheme of administration and that such relief as requires to be given will be given but will be given by an effective machine of administration. <Col N="1158" /> I submit that the arrangements which will be made under this Bill will be the most perfect that can be made for the administration of this particular class of relief.  They will be more perfect than any other class of machinery that exists in any other part of the country at the present time, and we ought to have confidence in that machinery.  At any rate, I certainly would object very much that we should put up before the bodies responsible in Rathdown, Balrothery and the city of Dublin a suggestion that in any way we think this particular class of relief to the destitute able-bodied should or could in any circumstances reach 3/- in the £ in a normal year.  I think it would be very inadvisable and it might be disastrous to put in this limit.  There is a limit to which any body of people socially organised can bear a burden of this kind, but do not run the risk, when you are only finding out what exactly the problem is, of doing anything that is going to increase the rate.  If you put in 3/- I submit you are going to increase the burden for yourselves and probably for other persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S.T. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Deputy Murphy speaks, I would like to say a few words.  I think Deputy Murphy was not wise in putting down an amendment in these terms. First of all, I am sure that he would not like to be charged with the death of any person, if such person died of starvation as a result of there being no funds at the disposal of the Commissioner or whoever else may be in charge of the relief of the destitute poor, as a result of there being a limit to the amount that they could raise.  I do not suggest that it would be possible that there would not be enough money if 3/- in the £1 were raised, but still something of that kind may happen if we adopt the principle of putting a limit to the amount that the Commissioners or other poor law authorities might raise for the relief of destitution.  From that point of view, I do not think it was wise, although I do agree that he left himself a fairly wide margin in putting down 3/-.  On the other hand, the complaint that I hear most against those who now deal with poor relief in Dublin is that they are parsimonious in their dealings with the poor and that they have cut down the services to the poor inside the Union institutions to an extent that was not known for long before their period of service.  I think in that way the Commissioners or those in charge, are not likely to ask for more than they require for the relief of the poor this year or any other year.  Our experience of them has been that they will certainly not err on the side of being over-generous. To put up then any limit at all, to my mind, would be bad, and to put up a limit like 3/- is bad from several points of view.  It is putting up, as the Minister said, a limit that some authorities might be anxious to strive to reach, even though it would not be necessary.  From every point of view, a limit is bad, because you must feed the poor.  If we have any consciences, they must not be allowed to die of starvation. The Minister gave us probable figures for the year ending the 31st March, 1930.  He estimates that in <Col N="1160" /> the Dublin Union area the cost will be £93,000, roughly.</P>

      <P>The original liability. That was his statement as it appeared in the &ldquo;Independent&rdquo; of the 22nd October.  He meant, of course, spread over the whole area. The Minister gave a figure that was certainly far and away below that. I wonder on what he bases his estimate. The Commissioner definitely stated that 5,000 additional cases would be put on the outdoor relief list, and that the total cost would be from £200,000 to £250,000 per annum.  That is a fairly definite statement.  If the Minister's figures are correct&mdash;and, after all, his officials ought to know, and I am sure do know what the expenditure has been in the past in this respect and what it is likely to be in the future&mdash;there is a wide discrepancy, and there was justification for alarm in the minds of those business people in Dublin who saw danger facing them as a result of the great additional cost that was foreshadowed by the Commissioners.  But it does not speak highly, if the Commissioner's figures are incorrect, as the Minister would suggest, for the competence of the Commissioner that he would give an estimate of that kind and do what the Minister suggests&mdash;shake the confidence of the people of the city of Dublin by raising a scare of that kind.  I take it that the Minister's figures are correct.</P>

      <P>May I intervene? I have not quoted a figure, but I have said that, taking it that the estimate for ordinary relief this year is £93,000, and that the figures I have quoted for the three years before were as I stated, I do not accept it that £200,000 is going to be spent in dealing with this additional class of relief.</P>

      <P>I take it that the rates generally throughout the country, whether in cities or in the rural districts, have not risen anything like that proportion because of the putting in of this particular class of relief.  It is impossible to say, because the local bodies do not keep their figures in that particular way, what proportion of the money spent on outdoor relief since 1924 has been spent on the able-bodied.  I have been able to get the figures for the city of Limerick.  Limerick is a city where a Commissioner had to be put in recently to deal with the Poor Law side of administration.  In the city of Limerick the proportion of the total expenditure on outdoor relief last year spent on the able-bodied was 36 per cent.  If the expenditure in Limerick on this particular class of relief has been a third of the total expenditure on outdoor relief.  I cannot bring myself to see that it is going to be 60 or 70 per cent. of the total amount of money spent on general relief here in the city of Dublin.  When I quoted a figure of £93,000 for this year I meant the whole of the Dublin Union &mdash;the rural parts and the city parts.</P>

      <P>On this figure that the Minister has given, I should like some more information.  The Minister has a Department behind him, and this House is entitled to expect an estimate from him.  There is no use in the Minister saying that he cannot form an estimate.  The Minister should be able to give the House an estimate of the probable expenditure. As I take it, the figure given by the Minister is his estimate of the charge which will fall on the city&mdash; that is, the additional burden&mdash; namely, 2/9 in the £.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>We have got the figure of 2/9 from the Minister.  Let us take that basis to start with.  It is quite clear that any deficiency in the estimate of this year will have to be a first charge on the rates for that particular purpose for next year. Rates are struck on 31st March, and we have four months of this year to go&mdash;four of the worst months of this year from the point of view of the burden on the rates.  Whatever that amount will be, it will have to be added to the rates next year.  That has been estimated at something like 50 per cent. of the rates, in view of the period we have to run through. The Minister has given us 2/9 as an outside figure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnGood" hpid="Mr. Good Mr. Good">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Good</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not take an abnormal year&mdash;we will take a normal year.  The figure is 2/9.  Add 50 per cent. to that for the period of this year which is unexpired and for the burden accruing out of that period, which will be the first charge on the rates next year, and what do you get?  Over 4/-.  That is the Minister's estimate.  We are told that the figures given by Dr. Dwyer are fallacious.  Let me read his figures:&mdash;</P>
      <P>If this expenditure were a Union-at-large charge it would be about 2/6 to 3/- in the £ of an extra rate.  If it were charged only on the city, it would be 3/6 to 4/6 in the £ extra on the city rate.  In addition, any expenditure incurred and not provided for in any year must be paid in the following year.  That is, if this relief were granted as from 1st October, 1929, the extra rate next year would be, if a Union-at-large charge, 3/9 to 4/6 in the £ and, if a city charge only, 5/3 to 6/9.</P>
      <P>Then he proceeds:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The conference called by the Minister for Local Government of representatives of the contributory bodies and the poor law authorities of Dublin has since recommended that the Dublin Union be divided into two districts&mdash;the city and urban district in one area and the rural portion of the Union in the other area.  If such a proposal is adopted the increase in the city rates will be about 12½ per cent. more than if the entire cost were a Union-at-large charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dr. Dwyer says that if it is a Union-at-large charge it will be 2/6 to 3/- in the £.  The Minister says that according to his estimate in a normal year it will be 2/9.  There is not very much variation there.  Then it is pointed out that you have to add the additional burden for the period of this year that will have to be included next year.  That will bring it up, if it is a Union-at-large charge, to from 3/9 to 4/6.  But, as it is not <Col N="1164" /> going to be a Union-at-large charge, as the area is to be restricted, you have to add to that 12½ per cent., and that would bring it up to 5/-. That will show the seriousness of the situation.  This is the first time we have had a figure from the Minister, although we were entitled to have it at an earlier stage.  I can only say, with regard to Deputy Murphy's amendment, that if the House refuses to put a limit of 3/- on the additional expenditure that this will put on the estimate for next year, that fact will create a further element of suspicion in the minds of the ratepayers that 3/- is inadequate to carry the burden.  That is all I will say at present on the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephXMurphy" hpid="Mr. J.X. Murphy Mr. J.X. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.X. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that he was not in a position to give an estimate, or else that he would not give one&mdash;that he would only express an opinion.  All that I can hope is that his opinion is correct and that Dr. Dwyer's estimate is wrong.  Deputy O'Kelly and Deputy Lemass seemed to think that I was inhuman and that I would rather that the rates were not increased above 3/- and that the people should die of starvation. I do not really think they meant that.  What I wanted to convey was that if the 3/- in the £ should not produce sufficient to keep up the scale of relief as mentioned by Dr. Dwyer, whoever administered the relief would have to cut down their scale so as to fit the amount raised by a 3/- rate.  With regard to Deputy Boland and the small ratepayers, surely he is just as concerned with the small ratepayers as with the large business men.  Any increase in the rates will fall very harshly on them.  If we went into the Division Lobby on this amendment we would be a very small minority and there is not the slightest use in wasting time over it.  However, I think the Minister should consider the matter, if he can, at a later stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O'Kelly Mr. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I point out to Deputy Murphy as one more reason for my voting against this amendment limiting it to 3/-, that <Col N="1165" /> I have here the second Report of the Department of Local Government and Public Health for 1925-27, in which it is set out that the number of people in the Dublin Union in receipt of outdoor relief in 1925-6 was 6,873, and in 1926-7, 6,933?  If we take the total of the Dublin Union, the Balrothery Union, and the Rathdown Union, all three of which will be concerned in this Bill, the total receiving relief in 1925-6 was 8,103, and, in the second period, 8,755.  Even suppose the number has increased in the last year or two, it is probably not very much beyond 9,000.  I take it that Deputy Murphy, in putting on this extra 3/-, would imply that the number that would secure relief would be trebled, because the total charge for outdoor relief for this particular purpose on the rates in the Dublin Union was 1/0¾, according to the statistics given here, so that 3/- would almost cover treble the number seeking outdoor relief. Great as the number may be, it is hardly likely to be that number. Therefore I think it would be unwise, from that point of view, to put in a limit of that kind, even with such a wide margin.</P>

      <P>Before the Bill goes any further, I think it would be advisable if the Minister would give a considered estimate of the cost.  There is considerable uneasiness about it, and I think most of the opposition to the Bill has been occasioned by the statement of one of the City Commissioners at the Chamber of Commerce, which the Minister is not prepared to accept.  Otherwise I feel certain there would not be this uneasiness and opposition to the Bill in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know where I could go to get anything like an estimate that you could say. &ldquo;You can face that in respect of relieving the able-bodied destitute in the city,&rdquo; until you have had actual experience of the measure for a year, with machinery that will receive applications, that will examine the condition of the persons applying <Col N="1166" /> and that will give relief.  There is no way of finding out except by actual trial.  When provisions were introduced in 1923, extending this particular class of relief to the whole country, there was no question of an estimate, and there could be no question of an estimate.  If I wanted an estimate, I would have to set up machinery, I would have to invite applications, and if an estimate was wanted earlier than, say, the next six months, I would have to take the first month and the second month and examine what came out of them.  Any other way is purely thinking of a number.  I think it is very much better to look at the situation in this way, that while unemployment may to a certain extent be concentrated a bit in Dublin City, the proportion of unemployed as against the ordinary people seeking relief should not be so very much different in Dublin City from that in Cork City or in Limerick City or Waterford City. At any rate, it should not be the outrageous proportion suggested here. You can only find out the position by actual experience of the machinery set up to meet it, so that I could not take the responsibility for getting an estimate made up or suggesting an estimate.  But I do take the responsibility for suggesting that the proportion of relief of the able-bodied to the ordinary outdoor relief, up to the present&mdash;and I say this after giving a considerable amount of thought to it&mdash;is not what has been suggested up to the present, and that the ratepayers need not fear that the burden suggested will be put upon them.</P>

      <P>The Minister claims to be in a difficulty in arriving at some definite figure, but Deputies in this House have a greater difficulty still.  I think the Minister is overlooking the fact that he must have the means of getting the figures or the estimate required from information already in his possession.  When this House voted a sum of money to relief work a certain proportion was devoted to Dublin, and he must have some idea, from the number of applicants for relief work, as to roughly the number of people who would apply under this Bill.  As against that, I do not know how we can make any comparison between the figures of cost with regard to outdoor relief up to the present and outdoor relief under this Bill.  We do not yet know what the class of outdoor relief is to be, how people are to be paid, and what return is to be given.  I heard it stated that people are to get food only.  The Minister must have some means of calculating, and he must have a rough idea of the number of people seeking relief and the cost per head that would give us some idea of the amount.</P>

      <P>Quite so.  I move amendment 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To insert before Section 3 a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1)  Where a destitute poor person in a Union to which this Act applies has not been resident either in the County of Dublin or in the County Borough of Dublin, or in the said County and County Borough, for a continuous period of not less than three years, the Board of Guardians of the said Union shall pay the reasonable expenses of his removal from such union to the workhouse of the union responsible for his relief under this Act, or if there be no such workhouse shall charge the cost of his relief upon the said union responsible under this Act.</P>
      <P>(2)  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health may make regulations to determine the responsibility of the several boards of health and public assistance for destitute poor persons in the County of Dublin or the County Borough of Dublin who have not been resident in the said County or County Borough for a continuous period of not less than three years.</P>
      <P>(3)  The expenses of removal of a destitute poor person from a union to which this Act applies to the union responsible for his relief under the regulations made by the Minister shall be a charge upon the responsible union and be repayable to the union from which the destitute poor person was removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4)  The whole of the expenses incurred by a board of guardians of a union to which this Act applies in or in relation to the granting of relief under this Act to destitute poor persons who have not been resident either in the County of Dublin or in the County Borough of Dublin or in the said County or County Borough for a <Col N="1170" /> continuous period of not less than three years shall be a charge upon the union responsible under this Act and shall be repayable to the union granting the relief.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If there should be any doubt in the minds of any Deputy about the abnormal position of Dublin in connection with this matter, I think the point we have just been discussing will clear away that doubt.  I have before me the figures for the other areas in the Saorstát, for 1926-27 and, as has been pointed out, these areas have all been discharging this particular burden, including the area of Cork.  In Limerick borough I see that the rate is 1/10½d. and in South Cork 1/1d.  I think that the rates in Limerick are the highest, and they run down as low as 4d. in the £.  All those areas are discharging a liability that we are going to thrust upon Dublin.  If it takes a rate of 4/- or 5/- to discharge the liability in the Dublin area, that indicates that there is something abnormal about the Dublin area, some liability to be met in that area that does not exist in any other area. The figures that I have given make it clear that Dublin is in an exceptional position.  The question is, how are we to meet that particular burden: how are we going to distribute it equitably?  In the Second Reading debate there was practically unanimous opinion amongst parties in all parts of the House that the burden falling on Dublin was an unfair one. Deputy de Valera said&mdash;I have his speech here but I do not think that it is necessary to read it&mdash;that it was unfair that the burden should fall on Dublin.  Deputy Lemass said the same thing to-day.  In my opinion, anyone who has given any thought to the subject must come to the same conclusion.  From our discussions here, therefore, we have reached the point that it is unfair to put the whole of this burden on Dublin. That appears to be common cause. The question now appears to be, how are we going to distribute the burden so that it will not fall unfairly on Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Minister called a conference <Col N="1171" /> at which he had representatives from the different areas present, so that, before he introduced this Bill, he might discuss with them the question as to how the difficulties that presented themselves might be met.  I might say, in passing, that I am sorry, when the Minister called that conference, he did not invite delegates from the Rathmines and Pembroke areas.  Both areas are to be subject to this additional burden, but neither body was called in or had anything to do with the conference.  That conference urged that half the moiety of the liability falling on Dublin should be met by the State.  The Minister was not prepared to meet that.  As members of the House are aware, no ordinary Deputy can bring forward an amendment the effect of which is to throw an additional burden on the Central Fund. Such an amendment can only be moved by a Minister.  Therefore ordinary Deputies are debarred from moving an amendment embodying such a principle.  In fairness to the Minister, I wish to say that it is not a principle that one would altogether approve.  This Bill is only to be in operation for a period of eighteen months.  It is to expire on the 31st March, 1931. While there may be a justification for bringing it in as a sort of temporary measure for dealing with a difficulty, it is not the sort of proposal to commend itself.  Anyone who has any experience at all in municipal administration will agree that it is advisable, in the local as well as in the national interest, that expenditure of this class should be kept in the hands of the municipalities so that it shall be properly scrutinised.</P>
    <P>The proposal put forward in my amendment was in fact made by the Chairman of the Commissioners, Mr. MacLysaght, in his evidence before the Poor Law Commission in 1924. His suggestion was that the charge should be made a county one, each county carrying its own burden. That was his recommendation on behalf of the Commissioners.  That <Col N="1172" /> recommendation did not meet with the acceptance of the Poor Law Commission.  It is only right to point out that the proposal embodied in my amendment and the proposal made by Mr. MacLysaght has been working in England for many years.  They found a difficulty there and, after considerable inquiry, came to the conclusion to put the charge on each county.  It is only right to point out that we also have the same principle in operation as regards admissions to our mental hospitals.</P>
    <P>Members of the House who have served on mental hospital committees are aware that the qualification for admission to these institutions is one of residence in the particular area.  That shows that the proposal embodied in my amendment is one that has already met with acceptance.  To my mind it is the only equitable method of dealing with this particular problem.  If this burden is to be left as it is in the Bill at present, I am quite satisfied that the effect of it is going to be very serious in adding to the number of the unemployed.  There can be no doubt, I think, about that.  The adding of anything like 3/-, 4/- or 5/- in the £ to the rates is, in my opinion, going to stultify the enterprise of municipalities on the one hand and the enterprise of individual effort on the other, and in the end you are going to do far more injury&mdash;of that I am satisfied&mdash;than good.  That is a line of policy that none of us is going to support.  If that is so, then let us consider alternatives.  I put forward this alternative, of a county proposal, a proposal that has been tried on the other side and has been found to work satisfactorily.  The only objection that I can find to it is that it will involve a certain amount of accountancy work.  I cannot see that that is a serious objection.  In sub-section (1) of this amendment I propose a remedy for dealing with removals from one particular county to another.  Under this system, if you have the nationals of one particular county chargeable to another county that other county can, under this <Col N="1173" /> proposal, have them changed back and recoup itself for carrying that burden.  Sub-section (2) of the amendment gives power to the Minister to make regulations to de-to be a birth or a residence qualifications of the individual, whether it is to be a birth or a residence qualification. It will be for the Minister to determine what the qualification will be.  Sub-section (3) deals with the responsibility of the county for defraying the cost of removal, and sub-section (4) deals with the county which has no workhouse of its own.</P>
    <P>I do not put this amendment forward as an ideal in legislation as a solution of the problem before us, but I would ask the House seriously to consider the principle involved in it.  As regards the details, if he wishes to alter them it will be easy enough for the Minister to do so. But let us consider the principle involved in the amendment as a practical proposal for dealing with this problem.  If the problem is dealt with in the manner outlined in my amendment it will mean that almost half the burden will be spread over the whole county instead of, as is the proposal in the Bill, spreading it over the city of Dublin.

      <P>Deputy Good referred to the suggestion that was made before the Commission on the relief of sick and destitute poor by Mr. MacLysaght, that a person from a county other than Dublin in the Dublin Union should be charged to that county.  That suggestion was in a way turned down by the Commission, who suggested that if it were considered at all, a year's residence should be the qualification for admittance to the Dublin Union. Deputy Good, in his amendment. proposes that if there is a person from Dublin who, under the definition by the Minister for Local <Col N="1174" /> Government, is a national of some county, he should be removed to the workhouse in that county at the expense of the county of which he is a national, or if there is no workhouse in that county that he should be maintained in Dublin at the expense of that county.  I would not undertake to define a national in the sense mentioned.  If Deputy Good has a clear conception of what he wants he should define what he means by &ldquo;national,&rdquo; so that we would know better where we stand. The Poor Law Commission, dealing with the question of the removal of residents, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The evils which in England have attended the law of settlement and removal must lead us to view with the utmost caution proposals for introducing it here, even in an attenuated and carefully circumscribed form.</P>
      <P>It makes these remarks a propos of the suggestion in regard to the people from outside areas in the Dublin Union:</P>
      <P>The investigation of questions of residence by local officers, their determination by some judicial or quasi-judicial authority, and the machinery for appeal either to the Minister or the courts would all involve expenditure besides being a fruitful source of friction.</P>
      <P>Then it says:</P>
      <P>If it could be shown that there was migration to an appreciable extent to the cities merely for the purpose of getting relief in institutions it might be advisable to prescribe a period of residence in the district as one of the conditions of eligibility provided that persons of no fixed abode would not be deprived of relief.  The period of residence should not in our view exceed one year.  Very little evidence of migration of this nature came before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy says that they have this in England.  They have, but every poor law reformer who touched on the question argued very strongly that it should be done away <Col N="1175" /> with.  I think it was in 1908 or 1909 the matter was discussed by the Commission set up in Great Britain, and in connection with that the present Lord Parmoor said: &ldquo;I look upon the law of settlement as a survival of the old penal laws.  It ought to have been done away with when the parish was no longer a unit.&rdquo; Another member of the Commission said: &ldquo;A necessary reform is the final and complete abolition of the law of removal that has been so long condemned.&rdquo;  In connection with the Commission which recommended a reduction in England of the period of residence from three years to one year, the minority part of the Commission took it for granted that when the present system came into operation in England, that is when they put their poor law system on a county basis, as they have done, the law of settlement and removal would go.  Let us assume the workhouses are completely out of the question.  If a person who can be described as a national of a county. say Westmeath, applies for relief here in the city, it is not clear whether it is intended that he can be sent down to Westmeath and his expenses charged to the county of Westmeath, and his bill sent after him, or whether it is intended that he shall be relieved in the city, whether in an institution or by outdoor relief and the bill for that sent down to the county body.  As things stand at present with institutional relief done away with, except in the city and county of Dublin, we would get into a most chaotic state if we had different areas in the country charged with the administration of poor law sending bills after persons who are nationals of other areas. The expense and confusion of it would be as costly as the cost of relief itself, in my opinion.</P>

      <P>We think it desirable that Dublin should not be asked to bear the total cost of providing relief to persons coming in here from other counties.  I do not think that Deputy Good has hit on the ideal solution.  It seems to me if some other method could be devised for assisting the Dublin ratepayers to meet the burden of providing relief for such persons than that suggested by Deputy Good, the same end would be served and justice would also be served.  I do not know if I would be in order in suggesting that some such scheme as the allocation of the proceeds of a special tax on amusements, or the proceeds of the existing entertainments tax, should be devoted towards the relief of distress in each district, according to the amount of the tax raised in each district.  I think that would ease the burden of the ratepayers, while at the same time providing a considerable sum for the relief of destitution. The money will have to be raised in any case, and the only way in which the burden can be made less onerous on industry and commerce is in the manner in which it is raised.  The placing of the burden on the rates is likely to have a bad effect upon trade and industry, but the placing of the burden on amusements would not have that effect, and the amount raised by a tax of that kind would help considerably in enabling the city to meet the additional charges which this Bill will impose if there is any considerable drift of unemployed from the country into the city for the purpose of getting institutional or outdoor relief.  The city, in justice, is undoubtedly entitled to some contribution from the country to meet the cost of maintaining them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said, Deputy Good's <Col N="1177" /> proposal seems to be impracticable and unworkable and would, perhaps, prove expensive.  A general contribution from the Central Fund would provide the same relief in the city and would serve the same purpose as Deputy Good's proposal without additional administrative expense being involved.  I will admit that there is a case against contributing out of State funds towards exceptional distress in Dublin, but if the proceeds of the amusements tax were devoted to the relief of unemployment in proportion to the amount raised in each area, there would be no injustice done to any county.  As the greater part of the tax comes from Dublin the amount available for relief here would be in proportion to that available in any other part of the country.  The result would be to case the burden on industry while at the same time making funds available to meet destitution.  We intend to oppose Deputy Good's proposal, but we think that the difficulty which he is endeavouring to meet should be met in some way, if not in the manner which we suggest.</P>

      <P>There is a proposal in the amendment of Deputy Good that the cost of maintaining in Dublin the destitute poor who come from outside the city should be charged against the areas from which they come or, rather, that the cost of sending them back should be charged against those areas.  That is an attempt to spread over the country some of the exceptional burdens which Dublin is asked to bear. Deputy Good's proposal, as has been pointed out by the Minister for Local Government, involves administrative difficulties and probably considerable cost.  I am suggesting another method, namely, calling on the Central Fund for the amount of a particular tax, the amusements tax, in order to serve the same purpose at less expense.</P>

      <P>While Deputy Good criticised the expenditure in regard to the relief of destitution in Dublin, he put forward no suggestion.  How would he view the suggestion of increasing the income tax on all incomes over £700 or £800?  Would he accept that alternative?  I believe that his amendment is not practicable and is based on a false assumption. It is based on the assumption that boards of guardians will only have power to send people trying to get relief back to other parts of the Saorstát, but, according to Section 3, the boards of guardians can pay any reasonable expense involved in removing them to some other place. They might be able, for instance, to send them to places like Tyrone, Fermanagh, and other places outside the Saorstát.  I would suggest that the proposal that the cost should be borne by the places where they are sent is not practicable.  It could not be worked.  How would Deputy Good view the suggestion that instead of making it a county-at-large charge the additional expenditure should be obtained by increasing the income tax on salaries such as I have suggested?</P>

The doctrine of trying to set up another partition line between the rest of the country and Dublin is dangerous.  I think it would be well if Deputy Good and all the other Dublin Deputies who spoke to this amendment would remember the fact that the rest of the Free State can live without Dublin, but Dublin cannot live without the rest of the Free State.</P>

If Deputy Good speaks his mind in regard to the business in which he is engaged, he will say that the men who occupy the positions of trust in the building line came from the towns and villages of the Free State.  I know that from experience.  If it were not for the people of the rest of the country I believe that Dublin City would not exist at all.  If you want tradesmen or workers in Dublin you must draw them from the rest of the Free State.  It is very unwise to make any distinction in this Bill, because you may be up against a double-edged weapon.  In dealing with this question I always adopt the attitude which I take up in trade union circles.  I have been a trade unionist for thirty years and I always maintain that whether a man comes from China, Japan, or America, so long as he is a trade unionist, he is entitled to get work in any country.  The same principle should apply in the case of a man coming from the country to Dublin. There should be no distinction.  This country is too small to have any distinction, and if people, through any misfortune not of their own making have to leave their native towns and villages to come to Dublin in search of work, it is only fair and just, in the event of their finding themselves destitute here, that some provision should be made for them whilst they are living in the city, because there are at the moment large numbers of city people who have obtained relief in other parts of the State.</P>

      <P>I think, taking everything into consideration, the attitude of the Minister in regard to this amendment is the logical attitude and is the only feasible attitude to be pursued.  As he rightly points out, if this amendment were adopted, the whole question of poor relief throughout the country would soon be in a chaotie condition.  You would have nothing but letters passing from the secretary of one board of health to the secretary of another board of health. There would be no finality about claims and the result would be that the unfortunate people would suffer during the period in which these investigations were being made as to where they were born.  Taking everything into consideration, I think Deputy Good would be wise to withdraw the amendment, seeing that it would be impossible to work it or at all events that it could not be put into the Bill with any degree of success.  As the Minister pointed out, it would be no use as far as the Bill is concerned.  Experience of the position which obtains in Great Britain at the moment, shows that it would be impracticable, and it would be well that this amendment should not be pushed at present and that the section as it stands in the Bill should be allowed to remain.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 5, after the word &ldquo;work&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;which is not work that, but for the provisions of this section, would be done by persons employed for wages in the ordinary course of industry or trade and&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of the amendment is to ensure that, under the provisions of the Bill as it stands, the giving of employment to persons who are relieved by the poor law authority, will not result in the displacement of those who would be recruited in the ordinary way, as that would, in effect, defeat the object of the Bill. So far as we are concerned we are not at all opposed to people who are relieved in this way being required to do work.  As a matter of fact we favour that but we want to be sure that the provision of the employment set out in the Bill will not lead to the displacement of people who would be employed in the ordinary course of commerce and trade.  I realise that it is difficult to get a form of words or to put anything into the Bill that will ensure what we would like to see there.  I think as a matter of fact it will depend very largely on the way in which the Bill is administered.  If it were intelligently administered, I am confident that the work which would be required by the poor law authorities would not be work, which would, as I say, lead to the displacement of men who would get work through the ordinary channels.  That is the <Col N="1184" /> reason for putting down the amendment and I hope the Minister will be able to see his way to accept it or, if not, to agree to put something into the Bill which will safeguard the position that we desire to see safeguarded.</P>

      <P>I quite appreciate the effect of Deputy Morrissey's remarks that actually what is intended to be safeguarded in the the amendment can only be safeguarded by administration if you accept the principle at all that it is desirable to provide some class of work for persons who are unemployed and are willing to work, and who are driven to look for relief.  I think all Deputies will appreciate the fact that the trouble always is to find work to which a local authority administering poor relief can put persons looking for relief.  Different classes of work have been done here in the city to which, while they might conflict with Deputy Morrissey's amendment, no one could reasonably object.  I would like to get suggestions, and I am certain that those responsible for administering poor relief would be very appreciative of suggestions, as to the class of work on which relief labour could be utilised.</P>
      <P>The only work that it has been used on recently was done last year in the preparation or clearance of ground intended for building.  I understood from Deputy O'Connell that he had an objection to that particular class of development work for building being done by this particular class of labour.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If relief labour of this particular kind cannot be used on work like that, I find it difficult to know on what particular class of work it can be used.  It is desirable to have work for persons desiring work.  It is particularly desirable to offer work as a test in the case of persons who are suspected of not being bona fide applicants for <Col N="1185" /> work.  There are cases such as that. The difficulty is to provide the work. I am opposed to Deputy Morrissey's amendment in this particular form. I put down an amendment here&mdash; amendment 8&mdash;which might give us, in a more satisfactory way than the original drafting, machinery for getting work done.  The intention is clearly not to interfere with or to displace ordinary labour by relief labour&mdash;any work that could usefully be done.  Personally, I realise that the most satisfactory way of dealing with the unemployment question is by way of stimulating trade and business enterprise generally, and that if work is going to be done by way of relief that would ordinarily be done in the course of trade and business, you are simply creating a further problem.  The administration of this section was intended certainly to provide work that would not otherwise be carried out.  The suggestion that I make to the Deputy is that instead of restricting any work being done he would add to my amendment (2) (a) the words &ldquo;undertaken for the purpose of providing additional employment.&rdquo; The new sub-section would then read:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  For the purpose of the provision of work under this section, a board of guardians may&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  contract with any person or body of persons for the performance by the board for or on behalf of such a person or body of persons of any work of public utility undertaken for the purpose of providing additional employment.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have given a considerable amount of thought to the matter.  I realise that the thing can only be done administratively.  The insertion of these words will, in my opinion, safeguard it, that is to say, the guardians will only set relief labour on work of this kind where it is definitely the provision of additional work.</P>

From our point of view, the <Col N="1186" /> Minister's amendment 8, suggesting a new sub-section, is worse than the sub-section in the Bill as it stands, because it is wider, and, as far as we can see, would, if carried in its present form, enable or allow the board of guardians to contract with any person or body of persons for almost any work that a public authority would do.  That being so, there is no doubt whatever that, immediately, the persons who would be in receipt of relief would come into conflict with those who get their work in the ordinary channels or those who get employment through the ordinary channels. There is another matter which arises on this, and I would like that the Minister would give us some information on it.  What are the terms or conditions of employment of persons receiving outdoor relief? The Minister said he would like to have that work as a test.  What work would they be required to do? At what rate of wages would they be required to do that work?  Will the rate be in conflict with the trade union rate of wages?  And if it is in conflict, does the Minister realise that it is immediately going to be open to abuse and that it will make the position very much worse than it is?  At the outset, I realise that it is very hard to frame an amendment which will give the safeguards which we think necessary.  I think the Minister ought to consider the matter more fully between now and the Report Stage, and try to get a form of words which would be more acceptable to us, in a way, than those which appear on the Paper. As I have stated, we are satisfied that it is desirable that there should be some work test&mdash;that the applicant for relief should do some work. The difficulty is to find the class of employment which will not bring the people seeking relief into conflict with those who get their employment in the ordinary way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister would be prepared to look into the matter between now and the Report Stage I would be prepared to withdraw the amendment at this stage and then to consider the matter on the Report Stage when the <Col N="1187" /> Minister brings in a new form.  I think we would want something better than the form of words which is on the paper at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Our main difficulty is that whatever form of words we put in here will not help in any special way the persons dealing with relief to find work to which they can put relief labour.  My amendment 8, giving power to contract with any person or body of persons, looks very elaborate machinery to the Union Commissioners, but the intention of it really is to enable the Union Commissioners to do work for the City Commissioners if the City Commissioners are able to find work on which relief labour can be employed. That is the main intention of that section&mdash;asking for powers to contract with any person or body of persons. I would be prepared to consider the matter further on Report Stage.  I would ask, however, that the opportunity be taken during this discussion to suggest what particular class of work the Commissioners could carry out.</P>
      <P>On the question of wages, I cannot see the Commissioners carrying out any work upon which they would pay the ordinary trade union wages, whether for labourers or for skilled workers of any kind, because I consider that the work which would warrant these conditions of pay would be work that would conflict with the principles that Deputy Morrissey has in his suggested amendment, and that the type of work that the Commissioners would be able to set men to would be a type of work that is not fully remunerative, work upon which the full conditions and the full rates of pay cannot and will not be given.  I cannot imagine any relief labour being employed upon work which would warrant their being given trade union wages.  Our difficulty is to realise what class of work the Commissioners would find to put men on.</P>

      <P>I realise the Minister's difficulty, but I want to be <Col N="1188" /> satisfied that if, for instance, the Commissioners are going to give a man, say, £1 or 15/- a week outdoor relief that that man is not, under the terms of this Bill, to be compelled to give in return for that amount a full week's work.  There is nothing in the Bill at present to prevent that being asked for and to prevent that test being used.  Under (2) (a), in the Minister's own amendment, would it not be possible for a poor law authority in the county of Dublin, if it had a scheme for the building of 50, 80 or 100 labourers' cottages, to contract in such a way that only those who are seeking outdoor relief would be employed on the building of these cottages and that a rate of wages which would be very much lower than the rate ordinarily paid would be paid. Something like that has happened before and the Minister knows it. Attention was drawn to it here before and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that there were houses built, but there were certain relief works where those who were employed were paid at a rate less than that given to ordinary employees, and the excuse given on that occasion was that those men had been unemployed for a considerable time and there had been a certain wastage.  They were not able to give as good a return as the ordinary workman and for that reason they were paid at a lower rate.  It is because we do not want that to happen again that we want to get the position made clear now.  So far as the Labour Party are concerned, we are anxious to meet the Minister, if it is at all possible, on a form of words which will safeguard the persons who will have hopes of securing <Col N="1189" /> employment through the ordinary channels.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not easy to do that, and I realise the difficulty. I think any person who has any experience of the administration of the poor law or of poor law institutions will be prepared to admit that. You might say that there is work which could be done within the institutions themselves.  In many institutions there are farms for the production of food for the inmates; then there could be plenty of work in the way of repairs and road-making and cleaning.  All that could be done inside the institutions. I realise that in a scheme like this, which is going to involve a considerable number of men, you cannot find employment for all in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Morrissey has no suggestion to offer in that connection.  If his amendment were passed the relief labour could only be used building follies, or something like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh no.  I have no doubt whatever that the poor law authorities, if it is at all possible to find work, will find it.  The Deputy will realise that we want to safeguard this position: that we are not going to have this Bill used in order to get labour at half trade union rates.  It is quite legitimate on our part to try to secure that.  If the House agrees with us in that attitude, I suggest it is up to the Department and to the authorities concerned to carry out the wishes of the House.  So far as we are concerned we have no objection whatever to the Minister insisting that no persons except those who are willing to work will get food, clothing and shelter; but if these people are going to work they should not be asked to work a full week or four or five days for £1 or 25/-.</P>

      <P>I am in great sympathy with Deputy Morrissey's point of view.  I do not believe in this kind of labour, and I do not think that the community will get any benefit out of such labour in proportion to the amount of expendíture and trouble.  There is the fatal bar there.  You have the trade unions looking for employment for their members, and if you are going to allow the Commissioners or the guardians to employ labour at half wages&mdash;because the Minister, and everybody will agree with him, has pointed out that you cannot possibly pay the trade union rate&mdash;you are going to have a clash.  You are going to be in the position that the ratepayers will be subsidising a certain type of labour which may in the long run drive persons who would otherwise find ordinary employment out of that employment, as, for example, the building trade. I doubt also whether, apart from the administrative difficulties, you can expect a man who is destitute and who has a wife and family to look after, to give real value for the money.  I do not know what the amount of relief in Dublin will be, but I presume that the amount of relief given, even for this work, will not be so considerably increased that it can be regarded as a basis of subsistence for a whole family.  I cannot see how that man could be expected to give work really of value for the money.  I am against the whole principle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to stress the point made by Deputy Morrissey. We feel very keenly upon this thing, because there is a possibility that if the Bill were allowed to go through as it is now the men on relief works will be brought into conflict with men who at the moment are doing ordinary work and who may be expecting to get work from the institutions. The Minister and Deputy Lemass have asked what type of work we would suggest.  As far as I am concerned.  I would not have any objection to men being engaged on clearing housing sites.  I think it would be a good thing to have done, so long as they get rates commensurate <Col N="1191" /> with the demands of trade unions.  As Deputy Morrissey said, we would object to a man getting £1 or 30/- relief and working a whole week for that.  We believe that the periods of work which every man should give should be in proportion to the amount of relief he would get.  As far as the clearing of housing sites is concerned, I believe it would be of immense advantage to have these men engaged on that work.  The clearing of housing sites in a great many, if not in all, cases is charged against the building of the house, and in consequence the rent is made dearer on the man who inhabits the house afterwards.  In this case it will be the rates that will be paying for the clearing of the site.  I think there would be a double advantage in that.  Unless we get some assurance from the Minister that he will try to have Deputy Morrissey's intentions carried into effect, we will have to insist on putting the matter to a division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There seems to be a general agreement that some work test should be provided, but I am not satisfied that either Deputy Morrissey's amendment or the amendment suggested by the Minister meets the situation.  The work upon which relief labour will be employed will be either totally unnecessary work, such as the building of follies, or else it will be necessary or useful work, in which case it could easily be held that the use of relief labour on that work would be preventing persons getting employment in the ordinary way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corish suggests that this labour could be used on the clearing of building sites, presumably, the clearing of derelict sites in the city, as a preliminary to the carrying out of building operations.  That suggestion immediately occurred to everyone who considered the question. But it would be most undesirable that this labour should be used to disemploy persons likely to be engaged in the ordinary way, or to force down labour rates in the city.  It is not necessary, I think, <Col N="1192" /> that that should happen, but, as the Minister points out, it is more a matter to be safeguarded in administration than in the statute.  In fact, I think it would be almost impossible to put safeguards into the Bill that would provide against every possible contingency.  If, for example, the trade union rate for a particular unskilled class of work is £3 a week, and the maximum relief which you could allow was £1 a week, then the maximum amount of work that the applicant should be asked to do in a week would be, obviously, two days.  No doubt that would involve a considerable amount of waste, and the result of the work done by relief labour would be much less satisfactory than work carried out in the ordinary way, but that waste is inevitable, I think, in the administration of relief schemes, and would, in any case, prove better than merely giving relief without any work test whatever.  There seems general agreement in favour of the work test, and anyone who has given any consideration to the subject will agree that the work test is not merely advisable but is necessary to prevent abuse.  I would be inclined, very definitely, to vote against Deputy Morrissey's amendment as it reads.  I am influenced in that decision by the fact that this Party is committed more than any other Party, to the solution of the problem of unemployment by the provision of work on State schemes in preference to the giving of relief of any kind, and we cannot allow the effectiveness of any programme which may be involved to carry out that policy to be hampered by the imposition of rigid restrictions of this nature.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey's amendment is much too rigid.  It would in fact prevent any work being done of a useful nature, and would confine relief labour to the picking of oakum or something of that kind.  On the other hand, the Minister's amendment does not go any way far enough, and would not provide against the various possibilities of danger that Deputy Corish and <Col N="1193" /> Deputy Morrissey referred to.  I would like the Minister to consider the possibility of giving some guarantee in the Bill, that the amount of work which would be asked from any person in receipt of relief would bear the same proportion to the amount of relief received as the recognised rate of wages for unskilled workers bears to a full week's work.  That sounds a little involved, but, nevertheless, I think it conveys the idea I have in my mind.  We know that in the past work that was given out of State grants was used to depress the general standard of wages in certain districts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

I would say that the general rate of wages for unskilled labour was forced down all over the country in consequence of the policy adopted by the Government at that time, not merely in relation to roads, but in relation <Col N="1194" /> to other relief schemes, and in conjunction with the rate of wages paid on the Shannon scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I mean that they were definitely forced down and pinned down.  However, that is outside the issue.  The Minister will, no doubt, admit that the relief labour under this Bill can be used to force down wages, and that is a most undesirable thing to happen.  If it is possible to get safeguards against the Bill being used in that way, I think it is very desirable that we should get them.  At the moment I cannot think what safeguards can be provided in the form of an amendment.  Undoubtedly, in the administration of the Bill, even if no such provision was there, steps should be taken to ensure that that danger would not arise.  But the administration of the Act will not be in the hands of the Minister.  We do not know in whose hands it may be from time to time, and quite possibly there may come a time when one of the authorities in County Dublin, administering the Act, will definitely decide to use relief labour for the purpose of counteracting demands, say, from their regular employees. It would be undesirable if that should happen, and accordingly we think that some provision against that danger should be made, if at all possible, in the Bill.  Deputy Morrissey's amendment does not meet it; the Minister's proposal does not meet it, and we have not been able to devise an amendment that would meet it.  But if another effort were made to do it between now and the Report Stage it might meet with more success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be as well for Ministers and Deputies to realise that the workers generally look at Section 4 with a big amount of suspicion.  They look on it as an attempt by the Minister to force down wages, and one of the reasons why they look on it in that way is owing to the fact that some time ago <Col N="1195" /> at Whitehall the Minister suggested that 30/- a week was enough for relief purposes in connection with work that had previously been performed by men drawing a higher rate of wages.  While Deputy Lemass was speaking the Minister interjected a remark about road work.  I know that the Minister's Department refused to allow at least one county to pay more than 26/- a week to road workers, and the possibility is that the Minister may endeavour to do in Dublin City and County what he did in that county if he gets away with it in the manner proposed in this section.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Morrissey the Minister stated that he intended, with the permission of the House, to add a sub-section to give permission to guardians to contract with any person or body of persons for the performance by the board for or on behalf of such person or body of persons of any work of public utility. Now, what might that mean?  It might mean that it would be necessary to build a number of new roads in the suburbs of Dublin and that the guardians, acting under this permission which will be given if the sub-section passes, would employ only men who are drawing outdoor relief, so that what would actually be necessary work would be performed by men who were paid 21/- or 22/- a week.  If the Minister is going to give outdoor relief to the extent of £1 or 22/- a week to destitute people why not give them work for two or three days a week at trade union rates?  What is the idea underlying this section?  The workers generally in Dublin City and County view it as an insidious attempt on the part of the Minister generally to press down the rate of wages.  If the Minister is actually sincere in not wanting to force down the rate of wages there is no real reason whatever why he should not accept Deputy Morrissey's amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is, of course, a painful problem, to be frank about it, and what I suggest to the House <Col N="1196" /> is that they should treat it as a problem. It would be quite easy for us all to say the things which would be popular; it would be quite easy for us all to say the things which would be get votes; it would be possible for us to say the things which would be comfortable and pleasant to ourselves, but we may have to say things which will be neither pleasant to ourselves nor bring us votes.  I think that we are up against a really serious and difficult problem.  It has been suggested that there is a great deal of suspicion in relation to this clause.  I personally do not understand&mdash;I will be perfectly frank&mdash; the meaning and purpose of the latter part of the clause, and when we have had an explanation of that possibly some of my difficulties will be removed.</P>
      <P>The way I look at it is this: There are 40,000 houses requiring to be built in this country, which ought to be built, and which, we are told by the responsible people, cannot be built under present conditions. There is an amount of drainage which possibly ought to be done, but which, we are told by the responsible people, cannot be done under the present conditions.  That is work which requires to be done, but we have frankly to face the fact at the moment that we cannot do it under our conditions.  Now, if 20,000 of those houses, that will not be built with trade union labour under present conditions in the next five or six years, could be built by the people who are anxious to work at the wage which they are prepared to take, is it wrong that these people should be employed at that?  That is my position. I am not saying anything for the purpose of getting at anybody; if I say anything it is not intended in any way to be an attack upon anybody. You had the case of the Shannon scheme, where, when a certain wage of, I think, 35/- was proposed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Well, thirty-two shillings; we will take that; I do not <Col N="1197" /> mind what the figure is for the moment&mdash;there was an absolute outcry, and every organisation which was regularly called a trade union organisation was undoubtedly put forward for the purpose of preventing that wage from being accepted. Now, if there is one thing that that challenge to existing conditions did prove, it proved that there were in this country far more people than were required by the Shannon scheme who were only too anxious to have the opportunity of working under the conditions imposed by the Shannon scheme at the wages which were authorised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We will call it that if you like.  But forced to by what? Forced to by the whole of the existing surrounding conditions, most of which, at any rate, in any immediate sense, are completely outside the control of this Dáil.  Anyone who knows the canvassing which went on merely to get jobs at thirty-two shillings a week on the Shannon Scheme and under the conditions of the Shannon Scheme will know that the labour which was there used did not more than touch the fringes of the fund which was available.  Now, I have to face these facts.  I cannot get away from them.  I am up against them every day.  Men come to me, and they do not say that 48/- a week, 58/- a week, or 78/- a week is what they want; they come to me and they say that they have a writ or an ejectment notice, that they have children who are ill, that they have no means of employment of any sort, kind or description, and will one for God's sake somehow get them any wages.  Those are the actual conditions, and they represent an enormous number of people.  Are we to take the line that because these men's demand does not conform to some standard or other of a trade union they shall not be employed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that we should pick out those things which to-day are uneconomic under the actual conditions <Col N="1198" /> and which cannot be done&mdash; the vast mass of housing which cannot immediately be done, for instance.  The Government have said that they are prepared to provide so many millions of money for the purpose of building houses if any scheme can be put forward by which they could be built within that sum, and built under such conditions that people could live in them.  The people who are to live in them are the people who are coming to every one of us every day asking us for God's sake to find them work at any wages&mdash;thousands of them.  What are we to do with them?  Are we who are healthy and comfortable, and possibly freed from anxiety, to say to these people that because their standard of comfort is not the standard of comfort to which we are prepared to live down, that they shall not have any standard of comfort?</P>
    <P>I have said that this is a painful subject.  It is deeply painful to me, because I do know people whose means of livelihood, whose actual relations to their own families, to their own children, are matters of intimate personal concern, and I multiply my experience by the number of people in the country, and I know that it must cover a large area of misery.  Are we going to say: &ldquo;We have a standard of conditions, and unless you are prepared to insist upon that standard of conditions you shall not be employed?&rdquo; I find that a thing which in my heart and conscience I cannot say. I cannot get away from the fact that when an artificial standard was set up in relation to the Shannon it merely exposed the fact that there were tens of thousands of people who were eagerly anxious to get a means of living.</P>

At the time I was not able to follow the Deputy very clearly as to what he meant.  I must certainly say, while I disagree absolutely with every <Col N="1200" /> word uttered by Deputy Flinn, I certainly have respect for the honest and open speech he has made.  Now we know the way in which the Fianna Fáil Party propose to solve the unemployment problem is by using the fact that there are so many unemployed, destitute in the country, and forcing them to work at the lowest rate of wages.</P>

I can only say in defence of that statement coming from the Deputy that he was not aware of the conditions or the actual wages paid on the Shannon scheme.  I was, and I certainly say that the Deputy would not get much honour from the workers of this country if that was the position.</P>

      <P>A further point was this: we do not wish that any man in this country who is not willing to work should get relief, and we are prepared, in so far as we can go, consistent with the safeguarding of the standard rate of wages which will give a moderate standard of living to the workers in this country, to meet the Minister.  The Deputy said houses could not be built; that there were so many workers coming to him who were prepared to work for any wage.  Unfortunately, the workers were unemployed and could not do what the Deputy advised a certain section of this community to do some time ago when he said that capital must get its price; if it does not get it in Ireland, it must go elsewhere. Unfortunately, the unemployed <Col N="1201" /> cannot go elsewhere.  Surely the worker is entitled to his price as much as the capitalist, with this difference, that he cannot go elsewhere to look for it if he cannot get it in this country.</P>
      <P>So far as we are concerned, we are as anxious as any person or party in this House to secure employment, and we are prepared to assist Fianna Fáil, Cumann na nGaedheal, or any other party in any schemes which will benefit the unemployed and which will secure work for them, but we certainly are not going to allow either this Government, or any other Government which may replace them, to solve unemployment on the basis that they will only give just what they are forced to give, in other words, that the rate of wages shall be fixed on the basis of the law of supply and demand.  That is a fair interpretation of the case as it was put from the Fianna Fáil Benches that this question of wages should be on the basis of supply and demand.  As I say, I have no desire whatever to misrepresent Deputy Flinn in any way at all, but that was how his speech appeared to me. That was what it conveyed to me, and if I am wrong I should be very glad if the Deputy would put me right, but the Deputy spoke clearly and, if I may say so, fearlessly on it. I am trying to speak as clearly as I can and to put the point of view of my Party, and I say that we disagree absolutely with the point of view put by Deputy Flinn.</P>

      <P>I was not prepared to go into the debate that has just taken place.  I was almost prepared to remark that you had become rather lenient this afternoon.  I would like the Minister to tell us before we go any further what Section <Col N="1202" /> 4 means.  On the Second Stage of this Bill I asked the Minister to let us know on the Committee Stage what his interpretation of this section was.  First of all, we have been discussing rates of wages, classes of work, and so forth, and not even Deputy Morrissey can answer to this House whether any wages can be paid at all.  Section 2 points out that a person must be destitute. Deputy Morrissey, Deputy Flinn and other speakers have been discussing unemployed people.  I would like the Minister to tell us definitely whether a person must be absolutely destitute, as we understand the word destitute, before he can be considered for relief.  Secondly, I would like if the Minister would tell the House how these people are going to be paid.  Are they going to be paid in money; are they going to be paid in kind?  It has been suggested outside this House that all people will get, as a result of this relief measure, will be food in exchange for work&mdash; those who can work.  If that is so, I would like the Minister to explain how these people are going to keep themselves covered as far as clothes are concerned, and how they are going to maintain their shelter. Then I would ask the Minister to explain how it is understood outside this House by people who are concerned with the administration of this Bill when it becomes an Act. There are already restrictions with regard to the administration of this money.  I understand in the case of a widow that unless she has a certain number of children she is not going to benefit by this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House in going into cross purposes as to the national solution of unemployment, rates of wages, and standard of living.  What I want a clear understanding on is what does this Bill mean?  The Minister cannot say that he has no definite idea with regard to Section 4, because the Minister is responsible for the framing of this Bill and the inclusion of this section, and must have something in the back of his mind which prompted him to frame it.  He has not told us yet what this section means, and how it <Col N="1203" /> is going to work.  One would gather that in exchange for food people are going to be hired out, are going to do work for outside bodies in exchange for their food.  I would ask the Minister to be as frank as he can to let us know not only what Section 4 means but how it is going to be put into operation.</P>

      <P>Might I take this opportunity of explaining to Deputy Morrissey exactly what I did say in relation to his amendment?  I said that if Deputy Morrissey's amendment is carried that the persons in receipt of outdoor relief cannot be used upon any useful work whatever. They can only be employed on the picking of oakum or the construction of follies.  Deputy Morrissey was asked two or three times to state by the Minister for Local Government what class of work he thought persons in receipt of outdoor relief should be employed on. He said it was difficult to state what kind of work they could be employed on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corish suggested that they should be occupied on the clearing of sites for housing. Does Deputy Morrissey accept that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We are getting to the position in which we are agreed that the persons in receipt of outdoor relief can be employed in such work as the clearing of sites, provided that the amount of work which is asked of them in return for the amount they get in relief is not excessive in relation to the prevailing rates for that class of work.  If we are agreed upon that it should be possible, I think, to put in safeguards in the Bill which will prevent the labour of these persons in receipt of outdoor relief being used to depress ordinary wages rates or to do work which other workers have refused to do in consequence of the rate of wages offered.  If <Col N="1204" /> these safeguards can be provided, we have met the only danger which Deputy Morrissey appeared to contemplate, but it seems to me that the putting forward of this amendment in its present form is neither going to secure that it will be possible to do work in that way or to insure that the wages will be paid in the manner in which he suggests. It will only make it absolutely impossible to do anything except that these persons in receipt of outdoor relief are engaged in order to test their willingness to work.  For example, transferring a heap of stones from one side of the institution yard to another and taking them back again.  Undoubtedly, by asking them to do that work you will find out whether they are willing to work or not, but it is much better, in the national interests, that such persons should be employed upon useful work.  If they are going to be employed upon ordinary work then they are going to do work which, if they were not available, would have to be done in the ordinary course of industry or trade.  We must face the fact that these persons in receipt of outdoor relief, if they are going to do useful work, would be preventing a much smaller number of individuals getting employment in the performance of the particular useful work in which they are engaged.  Nevertheless, it is very much more desirable that a large number of persons doing that work for two days or three days a week and receiving a smaller amount than the other persons would receive for a full week's work is much better than to have the smaller number engaged and the larger number starving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think if Deputy Morrissey reads Deputy Flinn's speech, when it appears in the Official Report, he will find that that is the idea that Deputy Flinn has in mind, that it is much better to have the larger number engaged at a lower rate of wages than the smaller number engaged at a higher rate and the balance starving.  It is quite possible that persons with whom Deputy Morrissey has no political <Col N="1205" /> sympathy whatsoever will be found backing Deputy Morrissey up if it is his view that certain high rates should be paid and that nobody should be employed except at that rate, even if it meant that a large number of people would have to starve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We want to ensure that every person working in this country will have the highest standard of living possible, but I think it would be much more satisfactory to speak of relation to the standard of living that relation to the amount of money than can be got, because the amount of money means nothing until we know its purchasing power. We think if the State is going to meet the immediate difficulties by the institution of State schemes of work it cannot be bound down by trade union regulations.  It cannot be bound down, for example, to pay a carpenter a carpenter's recognised rate of wages even though they have no carpentry work for him to do, if that carpenter has to do whatever useful work is available, such as the planting of trees, or something of that kind.  While I think that there should be precautions against the use of such labour for the purpose of depressing the standard of living generally or for the purpose of dealing with a situation that might develop into a strike of workers on a particular job, nevertheless we cannot bind ourselves up so closely as Deputy Morrissey would have us do in his amendment that we would find it altogether impossible to put that relief labour upon useful work. It will be very difficult to get an amendment which will provide against all the dangers that we all want to prevent, even the Minister for Local Government.  It is really a matter which must be dealt with in administration.  Even if the Bill passed as it now stands, without any further amendments whatsoever, it need not necessarily be used in any way detrimental to the interests of the working classes.  But it can be <Col N="1206" /> used in a manner detrimental to the interests of the working classes and, I think, any amendment which it would be possible to devise will not alter that position, except one such as Deputy Morrissey suggests, which would be more harmful than the passing of the Bill in its present form, because it would be purely negative in its working.  We have to control all those charged with the working of the Act, and if we find that they are acting in some discreditable manner we can kick up such a row about it that they will have to stop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say that the reason I suggested the clearing of housing sites as being useful work for these people is due to the fact that I am in a position to know that a great many housing schemes in this country have been abandoned because of the fact that the clearance of the sites was uneconomic, and in view of the fact that this labour would be paid for out of rates, it would serve a two-fold purpose by making schemes economic and providing employment.  In almost every case the cost of the preparation of sites is taken into consideration when the rent is being fixed, and it would be very desirable if this labour was so used in the clearance of sites.  So long as trade union rates of wages are paid I do not see why they should not be so-employed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>It was very difficult for any one of us who were trying to understand this amendment to make out exactly what is conveyed, but it does not require very much to see, the moment you deal with it, that you are dealing with one of the most difficult problems that have got to be tackled. Unfortunately, I was not here for all the speeches on both sides, but I can see at once where the difficulty lies. It is this: I think Deputy Flinn put it that you have a certain amount to spend, and you are up against a problem.  Are you going to spend that in the way in which you are going to give the greatest amount of <Col N="1207" /> employment and risk the dangers that are attaching to that scheme? I do not think that big question exactly arises here.  Thinking over this, it seemed to me that the poor law authorities are going to fix, in the first place, the amount of relief that they can give.  A certain amount of relief has to be given.  The Bill, I take it, is to provide an opportunity to those who are getting the relief of earning that amount of money.  I take it that that would be the basis. If I had to operate that for myself I would say: &ldquo;Here is a class of work. This is the ruling wages for doing this class of work.  If I am going to give in relief 30/- I will employ that man for the time that he would earn 30/- at that particular wage.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not seem to me that to work it on these lines is impossible. It seems to me to be a just way of dealing with it.  That is, there is a class of work to be done; those who are engaged in that work will be paid at the rate&mdash;the word &ldquo;rate&rdquo; is the word which comes in with importance; the time that he will be employed will depend on the amount of relief that you are going to give that particular individual.  That is how to look at it.  I think that is the way in which every member of our Party looks at it.  I think that if it is examined home there will not be found any tremendous difference of opinion in our Party on that particular matter.  As far as this particular Bill is concerned, the solution to me is obvious at any rate.  As far as we have discussed it, and as far as any members of our Party I have discussed it with are concerned, that has been the solution they have agreed upon so far as I found.  There are other wider and more difficult problems introduced into the wider question which Deputy Flinn has raised.  There are certain fallacies, to my mind, in what he has raised. The point in this case is that we have not a definite fixed pool&mdash;there is not a definite fixed sum as to which we can say, &ldquo;Out of that it has to come.&rdquo;  In this particular case the <Col N="1208" /> point is that there is a duty on the local authorities to provide this relief. They have got to provide a certain sum.  If they are wise, they will try also to provide work equal to that amount, so that the person getting relief will give an equivalent in work.  It does not seem to me that there is going to be any reduction or interference with the rate of wages on that account.  It is a matter really of time.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. French</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This is a Bill just simply to bring into existence a Minister of Transport. Under certain electricity agreements a Minister of Transport has been named as the person to appoint an arbitrator in any disputes that might arise between public bodies and electricity companies.  I am only asking the House to agree that that person will be brought into existence, as, owing to the transfer from the British Government, at present a Minister of Transport does not exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain agreements in different municipalities in Ireland of which only one is immediately within my personal knowledge, and in that a Minister of Transport is named to perform a certain function.  The Cork electric supply, for instance, was originally given to Cork Corporation, and the Corporation, by an agreement dated, I think, 1920, handed that over to the Electricity Supply Company.  In this agreement there is one particular clause which is concerned with this Bill.  That clause says that if the Corporation of Cork are dissatisfied with the price of electricity in that area they can apply to the <Col N="1209" /> Electricity Supply Company to have that price reduced, and if the Corporation and the Company cannot agree as to the price that ought to be charged, the price which is described as the minimum in all existing circumstances, then the Minister of Transport is authorised to decide what the price of electricity will be. Due, I understand, to an omission in the Adaptation of Enactments Act, nobody was named as Minister of Transport, and therefore there is nobody in the Free State at present to perform the particular function which is laid down in that clause of the agreement.  That has completely prevented that particular clause being made operative.  We suggest in the Bill that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health be named in such agreement in lieu of the Minister of Transport.  We have only put in that name because it was necessary to put in the name of a particular Minister.  Owing to the fact that the Minister for Industry and Commerce was responsible for, and is to some considerable extent still responsible for the electrification of the Saorstát, it was thought that possibly he may not like to act in that particular capacity. If the Ministry do desire, or if the Minister for Industry and Commerce does desire, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce shall act in that capacity, we are perfectly satisfied.  The choice was out of regard for the particular position of the Minister, and was not intended to be in any way an exclusion of him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may say that this Bill has been introduced by Deputy Seán French, Lord Mayor of Cork, for the Corporation of Cork, supported by Deputies Richard Anthony, Barry M. Egan and myself, so that it covers the whole&mdash;if I may say so&mdash;of the political differences in Cork.  The only reason why the President's name was omitted from that, or why the President himself was not asked to back that Bill, was because we recognised that, as President of the Executive Council, he has possibly another function to perform in the <Col N="1210" /> matter and that it would not be fair to involve him at this stage by using his name.  Therefore the absence of his name from the Bill is not to be taken as having any significance, positive or negative.</P>

      <NameTxt>The President</NameTxt>
      <P>This measure is designed to find a way out of a difficulty that has arisen, as described by Deputies French and Flinn.  This appears to be a very fair method of finding a solution.  The only possible objection that I think could be urged against this measure would be one which might be made by the other party to the agreement mentioned. The two parties to the agreement arrived at the conclusion that a particular person should appoint an arbitrator.  In this case, the only possible objection that I could foresee which could be made to this is that there has not been agreement between the two parties as to the naming of the person who is to appoint the arbitrator.  I should like to ask Deputy French whether, if between this and the Report Stage representations were made to him by the other party to the agreement as to an alternative method, he would be prepared to consider that. I cannot see any other possible objection that could be made, and I think, if Deputy French were agreeable to that course, that no possible objection could be made to this measure.  If representations be made, and if an alternative method of finding an arbitrator be arrived at, then we effect the same purpose as the passage of the measure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFrench1927" hpid="Mr. French Mr. French">
      <NameTxt>Mr. French</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cork Corporation in considering this matter were simply influenced by the fact that at present there was no individual who could be styled the Minister of Transport. We simply named the Minister for Local Government, as explained by Deputy Flinn, as the individual who should act as Minister for Transport. I am perfectly certain that the Corporation of Cork would accept an individual as arbitrator, provided that he took the responsibility imposed upon the Minister of Transport by the 1920 agreement.</P>

      <P>And in the ordinary way some Minister of the Executive Council would have been named to take that position.  Due to an oversight, I think, that was not done. Therefore the authority to decide who is Minister of Transport does not seem to be a matter in any way of agreement between those two parties.  It seems to me to be a thing that is outside of the two of them.  I do not think either of the two parties appointed the Minister of Transport in the sense possibly that the President envisages him as chosen arbitrator.  Because the Minister of Transport under the old Bill might have been &ldquo;A&rdquo; to-day, &ldquo;B&rdquo; to-morrow, and &ldquo;C&rdquo; the next day, depending upon the change of Ministries.</P>

      <P>I do not think that Deputy Flinn quite gets my point. An agreement was arrived at between two bodies in 1920 as to the appointment of the Minister.  That agreement could be carried into effect in 1922, 1923, 1924 or 1925, but the conditions have altered since.  It may be that the other party to the agreement would prefer&mdash;and perhaps the Corporation would agree to &mdash;a person nominated, say, by the President of the High Court or the Chief Justice, and all I am asking is that if representation is made that that would be more agreeable to one of the parties that the Corporation shall be prepared to entertain that and consider it before finally deciding on this.  The circumstances, as Deputy Flinn will agree, are somewhat different now to what they were at the time when the agreement was made.</P>

      <P>If I might put it this way: it is that a Minister of Transport which exists in the agreement does not happen to exist as an individual. So far as the Dáil is concerned, <Col N="1212" /> it is not concerned in any way with the individual in that agreement.  It is merely concerned with implementing or putting some reality into that agreement by repairing an omission of the Dáil.  It is not a question of appointing an arbitrator.  The arbitrator is there in name.  All this Dáil has got to do is to repair the omission not providing anybody of that name in order to do the job.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;That it is the opinion of the Dáil that proposals for legislation should be introduced by the Executive Council to provide:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  for the establishment of a Wheat Control Board, which shall be a Limited Liability Company, charged with the purchase of imported wheat for resale to millers and the fixing of a minimum price to be paid by Saorstát millers for home-grown wheat sold to them for milling purposes;</P>
    <P>(b)  for the prohibition of the importation of wheat by any person other than the Wheat Control Board and such persons as may be authorised by the Board;</P>
    <P>(c)  for the payment by the Board to Saorstát millers of such sums as may be necessary to make good the difference between the price paid by the millers for home-grown wheat and its market value compared with Pacific wheats, taking into account its higher moisture content;</P>
    <P>(d)  that the Minister for Finance be authorised to subscribe to the capital of the Company, <Col N="1214" /> and to make good any losses incurred by the Company in the administration of the scheme, out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas;</P>
    <P>(e)  that the importation of flour be permitted only under licence issued by the Wheat Control Board, and subject to an import duty: provided that there shall be no restrictions on flour imported for biscuit manufacture.&rdquo;&mdash;(Dr. Ryan.)</P>

      <P>At the adjournment of this debate on the last occasion I was giving the House examples of the methods in which a number of other countries were endeavouring to secure home supplies of essential bread-stuffs.  The countries that I gave examples of ranged over all sorts of climates, and the conditions were almost as varied in those countries as they possibly could be.  Objection was made when I mentioned Bolivia, which happened to be pretty near the Equator, and the point of that can easily be met when you realise that amongst the examples I gave was also a country like Norway, which is more northerly situated than our own.  So that I think it is fair to say that countries in the most varying conditions have come to the conclusion that it is a wise policy for them to take steps to save their home production against the competition of newly opened areas like, if we think in centuries, the opening up of the great grain belts of the middle States of America in the last forty or fifty years.  There are two of these in which we are particularly interested&mdash;one was the country I have named, namely, Norway, and the other the example of Switzerland.  In Norway, since about 1905, this question of wheat has been under continual examination by committees and commissions. In 1917, a State monopoly was established, and that continued until 1927, when a new arrangement, that has lasted for two years, was arrived at.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>That arrangement differed slightly from the State monopoly that existed from 1917 to 1927.  Since the 1st July this year, Norway has reverted back to the monopoly.  As the arrangements in Norway are more or less like those which we suggest, it might be no harm to mention them in detail.  The arrangement that was made in 1927 was as follows: The State purchased all suitable home-grown wheat, rye and barley, as well as 15,000 tons of oats.  They paid prices of approximately 2/4 per cwt. over the prices of the finest quality of imported grain at Norwegian ports.  The State bought the home supplies, but allowed the free import of these same cereals, on the condition, however, that the importers would take from the State a certain proportion of the home-grown supplies which the State had purchased.  The price at which the importers had to take that over was the price of first-class imported grain during the same period.  That arrangement lasted until this year.  It therefore had got a two-years trial.  After that trial they reverted, as I have said, this year to the original monopoly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The State now imports itself instead of allowing free import and compelling importers to take home supplies from the State.  It imports all that is required to meet home requirements. The only difference is that, as regards oats, they may limit the amount of home-grown oats which they purchase to, as before, 15,000 tons.  Under the new arrangement a premium is no longer fixed. Formerly there was a premium fixed, but now it is not fixed.  It is a variable premium, varying according to certain definite rules that have been laid down.  This year, about February, on the prices then current, the premium that would be paid would roughly correspond to the premium that was paid formerly, that is, about 2/4 per cwt.  That is the position in Norway.  As Deputies can see, it amounts to this: that the State purchases the home-grown supplies, it imports what is necessary and arranges for a premium for the <Col N="1216" /> home grain in excess of world prices.</P>
    <P>In Switzerland, during the war, there was also a monopoly.  This year, I think it was, there was a definite referendum there as to whether there should be a State monopoly or not.  The results of the referendum were two to one in favour of the monopoly, which was supported, not merely by the lowland people who grow cereals, but also by those in the higher regions who raise stock.  So that the whole community, so to speak, are overwhelmingly in favour of this particular arrangement, and the reason is that they believe it is the best scheme at the present time for helping agriculture in general.  I have read for Deputies the position in Switzerland that has resulted from this referendum.  It came into force on the 1st July, 1929, and by it the State maintains a reserve of the corn it requires&mdash;home-grown wheat at a guaranteed price in excess of world prices.  It sells that wheat to the millers, pays certain milling premiums, and protects the national milling industry against foreign competition.  The right to import flour is reserved to the wheat administration, but imports are permitted, or may be granted, on payment of a compensatory duty of a sum that is equivalent to about 7/8 per cwt. That duty may be waived or reduced in the case of industries which do not use such flour for the manufacture of bread.  All importers of bread-making cereals are compelled to register with a surtax equivalent to 7/8 per cwt. in addition to the customs duty in case anybody imports without registration.</P>
    <P>That gives Deputies, in detail, the position in two countries, and they can realise how closely they correspond with the proposition that we put forward on behalf of our Party to the Economic Committee.  Our proposition, as before, is that the State should purchase from the growers at a price to be fixed from year to year for a period of three years, and that that price should be paid by the millers.  Any wheat offered for sale was to be purchased by the millers, <Col N="1217" /> the millers to be compelled to pay this fixed price, with the State making good the difference between the fixed price that was paid and the price of the imported grain.</P>
    <P>The State is to make good this difference.  The question is, what is the amount of subsidy involved? Until the price is fixed that cannot be stated definitely, but we took an average for a number of years, and we considered the price that it was likely would induce the farmers under ruling conditions to grow wheat.  Our calculation was that £250,000 is all that would have to be spent to meet the subsidy for all our requirements.  We showed also that the increase of wealth for the community that would come from that increase of tillage directly on account of the greater value to the community of an acre of land under wheat to an acre of land under grass was about £1,250,000.  Therefore, the proposition is that in order to produce for the community an increase of wealth of £1,250,000 the community should be prepared to spend £250,000.  Apart altogether from any other consideration whatever, except narrow economic considerations, we regard that as good national economy.  The Minister for Agriculture, in speaking on this asked us why we chose wheat.  Our answer is, we chose wheat because there is a big market available for that particular product.  There is, as I pointed out, a market in this country, on the average for the last three years, of £6,600,000 for wheat and flour.  That is a market which is there for the taking of it.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister point out to us what home market to the same extent is available for any other product? If he does he will have to show that the attempt to supply that particular market would interfere with supplying the other, and in so far as we do not meet our own needs with our own agricultural products it cannot be shown that the growing of wheat would interfere with the attempt to meet the other needs. The Minister mentioned potatoes on the last occasion.  At the very time that he was mentioning potatoes the <Col N="1218" /> growers of potatoes in the Six Counties were crying out and saying that they could not get a market for their supply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it then the Minister tells us to go in for potatoes instead of wheat?  We are at present supplying our own home needs as regards potatoes.  Taking the figures, our exports are greater than our imports so far as potatoes are concerned and, therefore, at this particular moment we are supplying our home needs.  Where are we to export them to if we grow them for export?  Britain also is self-supporting practically, and, therefore, it is nonsense to say if we want to increase tillage go in for potatoes.  The point is that the market does not exist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>They grow potatoes because there is a market up to a certain limit, and they grow them to meet that limit, and for export in so far as there is an export market, but the fact is that the market is saturated at the moment and there is no outlet.  A person is not going to grow when there is no market to sell in, and in any case over-production means a reduction of prices, so that does not work.  The Minister asks us: &ldquo;Why not try oats?&rdquo; When we make a suggestion that more oats should be grown, that we should use our own oats instead of the maize that is imported, he will have the very same negative attitude with regard to that, so the Minister is not serious about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has on no occasion put forward any programme for increasing the cultivation of any crop.  So far as the question as to why we fixed on wheat is concerned, we say that we fixed on wheat for the good reason <Col N="1219" /> that between wheat and flour there is a home market to the extent of £6,600,000 odd, and that it is good business to supply that.  By not doing it we are giving employment to others whilst our own people are idle, and here we are with a Dublin Relief Bill, and Bills of that sort, coming in to try and meet the obligation that there is to keep our citizens alive when there is an obvious way of doing it by catering for our own needs.  The Minister's attitude is, as I said before, a purely negative one.  When any scheme is put up he asks, why not try something else?  But he has put up no scheme in order to increase the tillage or production he was talking about, or giving the employment which is so badly needed.  I would like to take these questions in their order.  I have dealt with one of them&mdash;why we chose wheat.  I have given the reason for it.  There are several reasons besides the obvious one of the market.  There is no other single measure which would lead so much to the increase of tillage as the growing of wheat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us have a scheme.  We have agreed, in order to induce the farmers to grow foodstuffs here instead of importing them from outside, that the scheme of mixing should be tried.  Evidently when that is put up to the Minister he takes a negative attitude in respect to it also.  He next speaks about our climate and says that our climatic conditions are unfavourable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Relatively.</P>

    <Col N="1220" />
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, relatively.  It is to meet that relative disadvantage that the subsidy is advisable because certain risks have to be taken, and it is to the advantage of the community that the risk should be taken and, seeing the net value to the community, we think that it is a fair bargain to the community to give one-fifth to the farmers for their services out of the total gain which the community makes.  The next point was that the trend of prices for some years back was against wheat.  That is quite true.  The reason for it is obvious.  The opening up of the great grain belts was responsible.  It simply meant that the production here was made precarious because of the low price. Consequently we have to stand up against that and protect our own industry against competition from outside.  If it was a question of having all our people employed, if there was employment for everybody, and if it was a question of choosing in what direction we were going to get the most profitable employment, there would be some reason in the Minister's argument, but, so long as we have in this country something like 100,000 unemployed, who cannot get any kind of work, there is no sense in his argument. The Minister said that wheat is not as profitable for the farmers as other crops.  On the previous occasion I pointed out that Deputy Dr. Ryan quoted figures given to us against that showing that wheat was more profitable, even for the individual farmer, than oats.  These, I think, are really the points that the Minister wished to have dealt with.  He said that what we really wanted was to increase production.  We agree. He stated that to increase tillage was to increase production.  We agree.  Our proposition was, definitely, to meet that, to get increased production in the best possible way. Let the Minister put up an alternative, but let us not always be put off by saying that there is some other way without indicating definitely in what way it could be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To sum up, so far as we are concerned, our arguments are simply <Col N="1221" /> these: That to supply our own needs as regards breadstuffs would mean an increase of production to the value of from one and a quarter millions to one and a half millions, at a cost of only a quarter of a million; that it would mean the equivalent of full-time employment of about 27,000 people; that the production of wheat is the key to increased tillage and general better agricultural economy; that in regard to extra roots having to be grown, it is very questionable because our percentage at present is very far under&mdash;even if we had all our wheat&mdash;the percentage of green crops to grain in Denmark and other countries, and it is very much less than what it was here at one time; that the growing of roots would lead to more stall-feeding and, therefore, to better economy, because it is generally admitted that if you put land under crops to feed cattle it is about twice as valuable as the same land under grass; that there would, in addition, be cheap offals for the farmer, because our scheme also would involve possible restrictions on the export of offals; that it would be a cash crop which would be particularly valuable to the farmer; that land under wheat produces about five times as much, from the point of view of food, as does the same amount of land under grass; that the entire supplies could be grown on something like 7½ per cent. of our agricultural land; and that the total amount under tillage that would result would be far less than that which there was in this country about eighty years ago, so that there is absolutely nothing impossible about this scheme.</P>
    <P>The cost of administration cannot, of course, be absolutely determined, but the scheme indicates very clearly that it would not be very high.  It is possible that the saving that would result by the combined purchase of such corn as would have to be imported might balance that.  We have not been able to see in any one of the arguments put forward by the Minister anything that should deter us from undertaking the scheme. <Col N="1222" /> The arguments that he has applied could be applied almost to any crop, and if they were to deter us from adopting this scheme they would certainly deter us from adopting any scheme of inducing the farmer by State action to go in for more cultivation. We hope that Deputies will examine this matter for themselves and will not be influenced by the &ldquo;I say so&rdquo; of the Minister.  The Minister at all times is quite prepared to make statements categorically and ex cathedra on matters in respect of which subsequent examination proves him to be totally wrong.  The time has come when we ought to take some steps to change the present situation, and those who will have to bear the burden of relief schemes will be brought to their senses fairly soon if an attempt is not made to get proper production and remunerative labour.  So far as we are concerned, in any case, we regard this as a very important matter; we regard it as a key to the whole question, and that is why we press it, and intend to press it, until we convince others, as we have convinced ourselves, that it is the right road.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>The agricultural policy which was expounded in the speech made by Deputy Dr. Ryan, and which was followed by the statement of Deputy de Valera, may seem at the present time not to be of any great urgent or immediate importance, but it is well that the House and the country should recognise that the policy expressed here to-night in regard to wheat is part of the general agricultural policy expounded by the Fianna Fáil Party, and that in the unlikely event of that Party attaining to office&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;they will attempt to force the country to accept that policy.  It seems to me that this policy, expressed in connection with the agricultural situation in this country by the Opposition Party, is founded on fallacious premises, premises which have never been accepted <Col N="1223" /> or recognised and that those premises are indicated and shown by the series of catch-phrases which are made use of by Deputies when speaking of their policy.  We hear expressions such as &ldquo;the necessity of the country being self-contained and self-sufficing.&rdquo;  We also heard the expression used by Deputy Dr. Ryan that &ldquo;it is the primary function of agriculture to provide food for human use.&rdquo;  These are very interesting as platitudes, but do they really indicate anything as a basis of policy?  We all know that the primary function of agriculture is to provide food for the community, but do we know that the primary function of agriculture is to provide all classes of food which the community may consume?  Until that theory is accepted, to my mind, the policy of the Fianna Fáil Party must be regarded as unsound.</P>
      <P>Another catch-phrase constantly used here by the Opposition Party is the question of the value of certain forms of production to the community. In the Report of the Committee which sat and reported on this matter, a reference is made in the Minority Report to the value of production to the community, and an attempt is partly made there to distinguish between the value of production to the community as against the value of production to the individual.  It is attempted to be shown there, that because wheat is supposed to be of greater value to the community than, say, the production of meat or butter, or the production of other articles of agricultural produce, we should stimulate the production of wheat, but at the same time it is recognised that the profit from wheat to the individual is less than the profit from other crops.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind, the value of the production to the community is the sum of the values of production to the individual.  If a crop, to my mind, is not valuable to the individual, it cannot be of value to the community.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>The tables which are shown in regard to the value of production to the community are, to my mind, misleading and convey, really, practically no information, because they leave out of account certain factors.  They only show what is mentioned by Deputy de Valera as value to the community in contradistinction to profit to the community.  Certain items such as labour are left out, with the result that certain fictitious figures are produced which nominally show value to the community in regard to crops which may be an actual loss to the individual, and therefore, in my opinion, a loss to the community. This whole argument such as we have heard here to-night and on other occasions is founded on the theory that the increased production of wheat will result in increased tillage. That has been stated, but it has not been proved.  Opinions differ and will continue to differ as to whether that would be the effect or not.  The question of substitution has never been decided.  Deputies on the other side say that there will not be substitution, but that there will be increased production of crops in addition to those already produced. To my mind, and to the minds of everybody associated with the practical side of agricultural production, the effect of an artificial stimulus in the production of wheat will be that wheat will be substituted for other crops and will not be grown in addition to the crops at present grown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy de Valera states that the increased value or benefit to the community by the substitution of the growing of wheat for grass, will mean approximately £1,286,000.  To estimate the real value we must put against these figures the cost.  We have had figures given here of the cost of the artificial stimulus which it is proposed to give under the scheme.  The cost, estimated by the Deputies speaking on the other side, has been stated roughly to be a quarter of a million pounds for the <Col N="1225" /> production of the wheat we require for our own use, and that cost is taken from an accepted set of figures, but accepted on the other side only.  We can substitute for these figures anything we like.  That cost is taken on the value of imported wheat being approximately something over 31/- per barrel, but take the present price of imported wheat. The present price is roughly about 28/- per barrel, and we do not know what the future price may be.  The lower the price the greater the subsidy will be which we will have to give.  Taking it at the present price of 28/-, and taking the price at which Deputies on the other side said farmers will grow wheat, namely, 30/-, what is the cost of the subsidy going to be to the community? The cost of the subsidy at that rate, as shown by the report of the Committee, would be £550,000 for the production of half the requirements of the State, or £1,100,000 for the production of the whole requirements of the State.  That is, for an increased value to the community, as stated by Deputy de Valera, of £1,286,000, it is going to cost the community, at the present price of imported wheat, and at the rate of subsidy which Deputies on the opposite side say should be granted to farmers, £1,100,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The farmers are going to get all that.  I wonder you speak against it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the cost. We are going to pay over £1,000,000 to produce wheat value £1,286,000 to the community.  Well, now, if that is a good business proposition, if Deputies on the opposite side regard that as a good business proposition, I do not.  I doubt if the farmers of this country will regard it as a good business proposition either.  That argument is founded on the belief held by Deputies opposite that the farmers will grow wheat in sufficient quantity to come up to the full requirements of this country at a fixed price of 30/- per barrel.  That is the question <Col N="1226" /> upon which we can get no decision here.  We can only find out in practice what will actually happen, but we hold some views based on existing conditions.  Deputy de Valera goes down to the country and he talks to a farmer, and that farmer tells him that if he got 26/- per barrel for wheat he would grow it.  Now, in actual fact, in the three years 1926-27-28 the average price paid was 30/- per barrel, and in spite of that the farmers of this country did not grow much wheat.  Only 30,000 acres were grown.</P>
      <P>Speaking as one who has some practical experience of wheat growing in this and in other countries, I do not believe that the farmers in this country will grow wheat at a price of 30/- a barrel.  The practical farmer will grow a certain quantity of wheat, and he may sell it at 25/- a barrel and feel satisfied.  He does not examine very closely into the question.  He grows only a small quantity.  He feels satisfied it fits into the economy of his farm to grow a little wheat.  But that is quite a different thing to growing wheat by artificial stimulation. That will mean that he will have to substitute wheat for another crop which he has been growing; or that will mean that he will grow wheat in addition to the crops he is growing already.  If he is to grow wheat in addition to the crops he is growing, 35/- per barrel would not be sufficient stimulant to farmers to grow it.  But what would it cost at 35/- per barrel in the matter of subsidies?  It will be double the cost of a subsidy at 30/- per barrel, and will approximately amount to £2,200,000 to the taxpayers of this country.</P>

      <P>The country will have to stump up £2,200,000 in order to get the farmers of this country to meet the requirements of the country in the matter of wheat.  Is that a good business proposition to put before the farmers and before the people of this country?  Deputy de Valera, in his statement, entered <Col N="1227" /> into a long discussion and a long examination of the prices which are being obtained for Irish agricultural produce in the English market at the present time.  On such matters as eggs, butter, and bacon I found that I could not quite follow the trend of his arguments or what he wanted to show.  There is one thing which he argued at all events and that is that Irish produce is not able to hold its own in the English market except in the case of one article&mdash;</P>

I showed that the price of Irish butter was lower than the price paid for the butter from any other country.</P>

      <P>Deputy de Valera showed to his own satisfaction that such was the case.  I do not accept these figures.  His figures in this case cannot be accepted without reference to other things which we have not before us here.  But having shown that, where was the Deputy's argument leading to?  Apparently that it was dangerous to continue upon our present policy; that we are not holding our own, and that instead of continuing as at present we ought to go in for other forms of production.  What would be the effect of going in for other forms of production?  Does the Deputy mean that in regard to those markets in which we find it so very difficult to hold our own, and for which we have to work very hard in order to do so, that we are to divert our energy from improving our position in those markets and produce another form of agricultural produce altogether, neglecting the particular line of production which the country has been following and which has been the national line of production, so to speak, in the past.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with the statements of Deputy de Valera, and I am trying to get at the conclusion to which he is leading up. The only conclusion that I could arrive at from his argument is that we are not holding our own in the live stock produce market and that we should divert our energies to some other means of production, and turn to other forms of production, and away from those products for which our geographical position best fits us. Deputy de Valera referred to the fact that it was bad policy to produce and export raw material.  I have not his exact words before me, but the general tenor of his speech was to that effect.  He said that what we are doing to a large extent is producing and exporting raw material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will at once accept the argument that it is bad policy to produce and export raw material.  But are we doing so?  Is that not one of those catch-phrases and fallacies to which we have got accustomed during a long number of years?  I refer to the cry that we are producing and exporting raw material. Are we?  Is butter a raw material? Is bacon a raw material?  Anybody who gives any thought to the amount of labour that is put into the production of butter, bacon or eggs, or even into the production of that much maligned beast known as the bullock, must be aware that none of these products is really raw material. Some of them are highly-finished products.  Bacon certainly is a highly-finished product, and so are butter and eggs.  There is a great deal of employment in the production of those articles.  It is time that we should face up to the facts of the matter.  It is time, too that the man who talks about growing wheat and about tillage, regardless of whether <Col N="1229" /> wheat and tillage pay or not should not any longer be regarded as a patriot or Nationalist.  Surely it is our duty in our own Parliament to investigate in our own way and work out the best agricultural policy that is desirable for this country. None of us is interested in stimulating any particular article because it was the policy of John Bull to have these articles produced here.</P>
    <P>In the examination of this subject a great deal of talk and a great deal of capital has been made of the unfavourable trade balance.  We have been told that we have an unfavourable trade balance of £19,000,000, or £18,000,000, or £17,000,000.  Does anybody know whether there is an unfavourable trade balance or not?  Does anybody know that actually?  Nobody seems to be quite sure about it.</P>

      <P>Is this method of growing wheat going to correct the unfavourable trade balance?  It is if we are going to cause the importation of £6,000,000 worth of wheat to cease and if, at the same time, we are not going to cause exports to decrease.  Is there any indication that there will not be a decrease in our exports?  If wheat is to be substituted for other forms of production, is it going to diminish production in other directions?  This artificial stimulation of wheat may also have the effect of decreasing our exports in one direction and increasing our imports in another.  If we induce farmers to grow wheat, or if we force them to grow wheat, we are putting portion of their land <Col N="1230" /> out of use from the point of view of producing livestock or livestock feeding products.  We may be even obliging farmers to import further feeding stuffs.  Therefore, what we gain in one direction we lose in another.  There is no easy way out of the difficulties in which we find ourselves.  In this proposal there are implications and reactions which will become visible only in the working out of things.  The whole question of subsidies forms a large part of the economic policy of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>The Deputy mentioned also that creameries and the beet sugar industry have been subsidised. A subsidy under the scheme now proposed would be totally different to either the subsidy in connection with beet or with creameries.  The subsidy for beet is purely experimental and it will, it is expected, eventually cease. Any little subsidy that has been given to the very important industry of dairying is also regarded as purely a temporary subsidy or as a loan, which will later on have to be repaid.  It has never been argued, nor can it be argued, that the wheat growing subsidy will ever be stopped.  The moment that subsidy is stopped, that same moment the growing of wheat ceases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not say whether beet will be grown without a subsidy or not.  The subsidy was given on the understanding that the whole thing was purely experimental. It is expected it will gradually diminish and eventually cease, and, to my mind, it is not justifiable unless it does cease.  On the question of subsidies.  I have always stood against them, except as a temporary stimulant or as an experiment.  I am opposed to them for the reason that subsidies to farmers will have <Col N="1231" /> to be paid by the farmers themselves. It is a different thing if we start subsidising industries.  You can subsidise them at the expense of the community, mainly the farmers, but you can only subsidise farming at the expense of the farmer.  In addition to the subsidy you will have the expense and annoyance and inconvenience of administration.</P>
      <P>I would like again to refer to the belief of the Fianna Fáil Party that a subsidy of 30/- will induce farmers to grow wheat in quantity.  In dealing with this question of agricultural policy the Fianna Fáil Party simply take up the attitude of looking back into history.  They find that previous to 1847 there were seven or eight millions of people in the country, and we were growing approximate 800,000 acres of wheat.  It is contended that we could revert to those conditions and have a population here again of eight millions.  This contention is made regardless of what has happened in the interval. I have knowledge of what happened in connection with the growing of wheat in the old times, and the prices that were then obtained.  I happened to be born on a farm which at one time was largely devoted to wheat, at a time when it paid farmers to grow wheat.  I was talking to one of the old people about it, and he said to me that it was easy to make money when they were able to sell wheat at 2/6 a stone.  Even taking it that it did not always fetch 2/6, it was a common thing to get 2/- a stone or 40/- a barrel for wheat back in 1857 and 1858.  At that time, as everyone knows, farmers employed labour at about 8/- a week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelRichardHeffer" hpid="Mr. Heffernan Mr. Heffernan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking into account the depreciation in the value of money, the 2/- a stone for wheat then would be worth 4/- at the present time.  Of course, we admit that improved methods are causing increased production at the present time, and we also acknowledge <Col N="1232" /> that the introduction of machinery has helped somewhat, particularly in the matter of wheat production. There is no indication, however, that the farmers in 1930 can grow wheat as a paying proposition at 30/- a barrel, when as I have indicated, as far back as 1857 the farmers were getting 2/- a stone.</P>
      <P>Deputy de Valera hopes to find employment for 27,000 workers with his scheme.  Deputy Ryan and the Deputies who were engaged in the drafting of the Minority Report were not nearly so optimistic.  They said: &ldquo;We do not claim that it would result in a great increase in the number of persons employed in agriculture.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Heffernan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an extraordinary state of affairs that we, situated as we are, geographically near one of the most valuable markets in the world, where livestock products are in considerable demand, and because we are, on account of our contiguity to the market, in a position to obtain enhanced prices, should be advocating the policy of reverting to the conditions which existed sixty or seventy years ago, before the plains of Canada, the prairies of the middle States of America and the pampas of Argentina had come into the production of wheat.  Surely the best policy for us is to confine our attention to as large an extent as possible to a production of the articles in regard to which we have a fixed market, in regard to which we have a specialised market, and in regard to which we are in a better position to compete than are the vast prairie provinces which are producing wheat.  We cannot produce wheat in competition with them.  Those countries have vast areas of uncultivated land and <Col N="1233" /> their natural wealth is untouched; they can cultivate their wheat lands for ten years without manuring. Their costs of transport are reduced now to the minimum, and their overhead charges in regard to rent, rates, and labour are comparatively small. With our high overhead charges, with our climatic conditions, which are not suitable for the growing and the saving of wheat, we are endeavouring to stimulate our people to compete with those vast provinces in the production of wheat, when we should divert their attention to the production of the articles in regard to which we can compete and compete with advantage, because the outstanding fact in connection with live-stock production is that people should get these products fresh. They like to get their eggs and bacon fresh, and we are in a rather fortunate position in that regard. Why should we not endeavour to build up our market and by increasing the quality of our products, to secure the market which is waiting for it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The idea that because one advocates a live-stock policy one is standing for decreased tillage is quite unsound.  A correct live-stock policy for this country must mean increased tillage, and the right kind of increased tillage&mdash;increased tillage on a paying basis&mdash;because there is no doubt whatsoever that the farms which are producing, the farms which are paying best at the moment are the farms on which the greatest quantity of tillage is carried on.  But the tillage is not carried on on those farms for the purpose of selling grain or any other cash crop; it is carried on for the purpose of converting the grain and the other foodstuffs produced on the farm into live-stock and live-stock produce, which is the most profitable side of farming at the present moment.  There is no doubt whatever that there are considerable possibilities of extension and growth in that direction, and that if we expand as we ought to, provision will be found for the employment of a greater number of people on the farms.  They would be <Col N="1234" /> employed on a form of production most suitable to our requirements, and to our climatic and geographical conditions, a form of production which can stand on its own legs and not have to ask for any artificial stimulants in the form of a subsidy or a tax on the community.</P>

I can fancy the discussion that went on in the Executive Council when it was found that the leader of the Farmers' Party was to be taken into the ranks, and I can see the Minister for Agriculture holding up his hands in holy horror and saying&mdash;and I admire him for it: &ldquo;No, no, he is not to be made Secretary of my Department, thank you.&rdquo;  The agricultural policy preached here during. I might say, the lifetime of this and the previous Dáil by the present leader of the Farmers' Party leaves him, in an agricultural community, leading a Farmers' Party of six, and I am not surprised.  It is no wonder. I think the changes that have taken place show, at any rate, that the policy of ranching has not the support of the farmers.</P>

He said it was a pity they did not know that, because if they did there would be the same area under wheat as under barley.  When it comes to preaching anything against the policy that is enunciated here the Minister says that the farmers know best themselves, that if it is all right the farmers will do it, and this from a Minister for Agriculture who might be described by his friends in the shorthorn bull-ring as the greatest Minister for Agriculture in Europe, but whom the ordinary, plain farmers in my part of the country call the worst coercionist since Balfour. The Minister has introduced Act after Act to make them wash eggs, to mark butter, to have a special licence for bulls&mdash;why, he has introduced so many Coercion Acts for the farmer that we will soon have the farmer, as &ldquo;Dublin Opinion&rdquo; put it a few days ago, washing the cows' teeth every morning and evening.  That is the Minister for Agriculture who introduced those Acts one after another &mdash;Acts compelling the farmer to do something, Acts of compulsion on the farming community&mdash;who tells us when a motion is proposed from this side of the House that the farmers know best themselves.  If the farmers knew best themselves the Minister need not have introduced a Bill to eliminate scrub bulls. If they knew best themselves he need not have introduced an Eggs Act, the Butter Act, an Act dealing with scrub bulls, and followed them up with one dealing with fresh meat. The Minister for Agriculture unlike the leader of the Farmers' Party can change his tune off and on.</P>

      <P>Take your time and I will deal with it.  I am not finished with it yet, and I am not finished with you either.  As I stated this lady grows wheat and gets 7½ barrels to the acre on lea ground.  She found that it pays to grow wheat on lea ground.  I noticed some Deputies laughing a few days ago when Deputy de Valera stated that wheat and potatoes go well together.  They do, because potatoes are practically the only tillage crop that can be followed with a crop of wheat.  The reason why farmers do not grow much wheat is that very few farmers will plough lea land early enough to set wheat on, and very few farmers will have their root crops cleared up in time to set winter wheat.  At any rate one of the principal reasons for the failure of wheat in this country is that it is set too late in the year. Farmers wait to set wheat until the middle or the end of November when the ground is not in a fit condition to put in the seed.  That is the principal reason for the failure of wheat here.  The figures I have given <Col N="1238" /> cover a certain number of years.  If this matter is approached in a fair-minded spirit by the House, I am certain that there will be a majority in favour of the motion.  Some Deputies asked why not subsidise some other crop, why not go in for more butter for instance, more dairy farming, as against the growing of wheat?  The leader of the late Farmers' Party said that we would find that it would be generally substituted. When the leader of the Farmers' Party was substituted for the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs anything might happen.  Even if it was substituted we have been told that farmers will have to pay the subsidy.  As far as paying any subsidies is concerned, the general community pays all subsidies. Farmers are included in the general community and I take it they have to pay the biggest part of the subsidies or tariffs that were put on here from time to time&mdash;the tariff on boots, the tariff on woollens, the tariff on rosary beads, and the tariff on margarine.</P>

      <P>The reason why we advocate a subsidy for wheat is that you have a home market here for your wheat and for your butter and eggs you have to face your foreign competitor.  You have to export your butter and eggs and take pot luck in the English market.  Judging from the figures given here the other night by Deputy de Valera our pot luck has not been improved by all the Acts that have been passed. Here you have a market at home. There was imported into this country in 1927 over £4,000,000 worth of foreign wheat.  That is you have a market at home for £4,000,000 worth of agricultural produce, and there was two or three million pounds' worth of flour as well imported.  So you have a market at home for six or seven million pounds' worth of agricultural produce.  I, at any rate, believe that we should concentrate on that home market and produce crops which will find a home market which you can save and protect yourselves.  It is because of that that I am in favour of a subsidy on wheat.  There is another reason. During the last few years here you had a subsidy for beet, costing £829,000; creameries, £365,000.</P>

      <P>Question.  When you look at these figures, remember that the wheat-growing areas in Ireland are valued at three times their present valuation.  The land was valued as wheat land in the wheat-growing areas, and it is not worth anything like that value at the present time. The grain-growing areas are paying twice as much on valuation in rates as they ought to pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>Three times as much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>In wheat growing land they are paying twice as much as they should pay in rates on their <Col N="1240" /> rateable valuation.  If any party of agriculturists in Ireland are entitled to protection it is those farmers in the grain growing areas.  They have been carrying the whole community on their backs.  I have heard questions in this House asking for a re-valuation which has nothing to do with it.  There is land suited for grain growing valued as grain growing land.  When wheat went out they turned to barley.  Now that barley has been knocked out, it is but natural that these people should be entitled to at least a fair crack of the whip.  Those people are entitled in justice to a subsidy or to what protection can be given to them by this House.</P>
      <P>Instead of that, we have the dairy farmers fostered.  We have a couple of little counties specially fostered because of reasons which I will not go into now.  They are too well known.  The grain growing counties are entitled to preferential treatment here at any rate.  Instead of that, they are the one body of agriculturists who are cried down and given no fair show.  It is because I believe that we can capture the home market, because I believe that there is a home market here for seven million pounds' worth of agricultural produce waiting for the crops to be grown that I believe in fostering the wheat industry here, and in hoping by that to retrieve the agricultural position in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that I have anything further to add.  Statements made are in a large number of cases ridiculous.  Whenever we put forward a proposal here it is always met with a cry from the opposite benches, &ldquo;The farmers know best themselves.&rdquo; That statement has been made here by a Minister who has introduced coercion Act after coercion Act to compel farmers to change their methods of farming.  I do not think a single session in this Dáil has passed without some new Bill having been introduced to compel the farmers to do something, and that by the very Minister who says that the farmers know best themselves. I hope he will take that lesson to heart, and if he thinks <Col N="1241" /> farmers know best themselves, the best thing for him is to introduce one single Bill wiping out all the coercion Acts that have been passed for the last seven years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hennessy</NameTxt>
      <P>After Deputy Corry's contribution, it requires some courage to intervene in this debate.  However, I am more concerned with Deputy de Valera's appeal to members on Government Benches as to why they should not, in agricultural questions, be unduly or in any part hypnotised by the Minister for Agriculture.  I do not think Deputy de Valera has made a convincing case in support of Deputy Dr. Ryan's motion.  He has given figures.  Figures are easily quoted, but they do not prove all we might expect from them.  At times the question of the impoverishment of land by wheat has been referred to here, and Deputy Corry has made one very true admission that wheat is a soil-exhausting crop.  We have three soil-exhausting crops growing in this country at the moment; we have wheat, sugar beet and flax.  The practical farmers here will appreciate that very quickly when they let out, say, a six-acre field to grass seeds.  On two acres of it seeds are sown with the accompanying crop, wheat; two more acres are put under barley, and two more acres under oats.  It is quite easy to see when these grass seeds develop the first year and the second and third year that in the strip in which the wheat has grown the seeds are backward, and not at all to be compared with the seeds grown with the barley or oaten crop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that the remedy for that is manuring.  If you are manuring to the extent of bringing the grass seeds in the wheat plot to the same condition as those in the barley and oaten plots, I think it will exhaust your whole subsidies. It has been said on one side of the House that Ireland is particularly suited for the growing of wheat. Others on this side of the House think differently.  I do not believe from climatic and soil conditions that Ireland, on the whole, is a suitable <Col N="1242" /> country for the growing of wheat.  We have in most counties in Ireland a sub-soil called <i>marl buidhe.</i>  I know a little Irish.  We all know that sub-soil is particularly retentive of moisture, and that sub-soil does not exist to any extent in countries like Canada, America, and the Argentine, or even in England. We know that England has a chalky sub-soil, and for that reason the soil is much drier than in Ireland. We also know that the climate of Ireland is particularly wet.  The remedy offered for that is kiln-drying the Irish-grown wheat.  Kiln-drying carried on on an extensive scale, and the extra heat employed to kilndry Irish wheat will certainly injure the nutriment of the wheat.  It will simply shrivel it up.  Deputy Ryan knows something about vitamins and things like that, and knows when the heat is excessive some of those will be destroyed.  I was rather amused to hear Deputy de Valera say that wheat was a catch-crop, as one of the reasons why it should be grown.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Mr. de Valera Mr. de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Mr. de Valera</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DrThomasHennessy" hpid="Dr. Hennessy Dr. Hennessy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hennessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg your pardon. I think Deputy Corry said something about catch-crop.  We all know that wheat is put into the soil at the end of October or early in November and not reaped until the end of August or early in September. So if Deputy Corry calls it a catch-crop he is very far wrong.  If wheat-growing lessens, as it will very likely if it is grown with a subsidy, the acreage in other forms of tillage and even of grass lands, I do not think it is desirable.  Grass land has been referred to here as a very poor method of farming.  I think that grass land, especially for the purposes of dairy-farming, gives a great deal of employment&mdash;far more employment than wheat-growing will give.  I know that the saving of one acre of old meadow hay gives far more employment than the sowing and reaping of wheat.</P>

      <P>Then we know that for dairy purposes grass is far more valuable for a dairy cow than any cereals you will grow.  There is more nourishment in three inches of grass than in a yard of any corn you could possibly grow, including the head.  That is received, I see, with scepticism on the opposite benches, but a clear proof of that is that when dairy cows are fed on concentrates and cereals in the month of April we know the quantity of milk they will give.  Put them on nutritious grass in May and June and they will double their milk, not only double the quantity but the milk will be much richer in quality.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrThomasHennessy" hpid="Dr. Hennessy Dr. Hennessy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hennessy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can make his speech when I am finished. He can contradict me in some way that will be convincing.  We here on this side of the House, are taunted with being in favour of ranches and of bullocks.  I do not know that we have any greater regard for the bullock here than they have on the opposite side.  At any rate, when we adjourn to the restaurant I do not see that the cleavage of opinion is very marked. But the bullock is part of the economic system of Irish farming. The bullock is bred by the small farmer and he must get a market in Ireland for that bullock.  It is better that he should get a market in Ireland than elsewhere.  He will sell him at any age from six to twelve months and it is well that we have people here to buy him, because one of the uneconomic sides of Irish farming is sending our cattle across <Col N="1244" /> channel in an unfinished state.  You cannot fatten them in Ireland without grazing them on suitable grass lands and that is simply the complement of Irish dairy farming, the fattening of that bullock at home. On another occasion, I said I did not care how you will multiply the ownership of land in Ireland but that it is absolutely essential to the economic side of Irish farming that you will keep a certain portion of land and use that land, as nature intended it, for fattening.</P>
      <P>Another matter that has been referred to here is the price for Irish produce in England and the English market, as compared with Denmark and other countries.  We all know the reason why Irish produce is selling at a lower rate in England at the moment, and for some time.  It has a bad reputation.  If we had the co-operative creameries earlier and if they were producing as good an article as they are doing now, our butter and eggs would be commanding higher prices in England. We all know of the old &ldquo;lump&rdquo; market in Ireland, and of the way butter was made at home in small farmers' places&mdash;sometimes in the bedroom.  It was carted into the local market, then blended, mixed-up and sent across to England and sold as Irish creamery butter.  That did more to injure the reputation of Irish butter in England than anything else did.  We are paying for that now, and we have to outlive it.  The quality of Irish butter at the present moment, especially that made in the creameries under the co-operative system, is second to no butter in the world, but we have, as I said, to outlive the bad reputation and to get the English people to appreciate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not convinced that the subsidy will encourage wheat-growing in Ireland&mdash;it has too many drawbacks. I would be in favour of a tariff on flour as more calculated to encourage wheat-growing, if there is any advantage in it, than a subsidy. I know the objection to a tariff on flour&mdash;that it will make bread dearer.  I would be very glad <Col N="1245" /> to support a tariff on flour if I thought that bread would be sold at the same price as at present.  I have not seen any miller or group of millers coming forward to say, as was said by people when a tariff on margarine was being considered, that they would give an undertaking to sell bread at the current price in a non-tariff country like England.  When they do that, I believe Deputies on this side will give very favourable consideration to a tariff on flour.  I believe that a tariff on flour would effect far more than a subsidy to wheat-growing.</P>

      <P>I would wish to support the motion before the House if I could.  I have listened with attention to all that has been said by those supporting the motion.  Although I am a wheat grower, whose experience I am afraid is not in favour of wheat growing, I was still open to conviction, and I was rather hoping that Deputy Ryan would be able to convince me that there was something in his motion.  The speeches made in favour of the motion may have been very intelligent and very illuminating to economic theorists, but to the ordinary farmer, who has been growing wheat, the arguments put forward were neither sensible nor anything else.  In any case, when the arguments put forward contained a repetition of the fallacies, that wheat is not an exhausting crop, that it is a good nurse crop for grass, and that it does not dirty the soil, they absolutely spoil the whole of the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Any argument put forward that would contain a repetition of these fallacies would absolutely spoil any case.  Even Deputy Corry admits that it is an exhausting crop.  Deputy Corry made a further very candid admission. Though he said it could be grown in lea, he made the very remarkable statement afterwards that potatoes is the only tillage crop which can be followed by wheat.  I am entirely with him in that.  At least as far as my part of the country is concerned, wheat is never sown except after potatoes, and then only on the choicest bit of ground.  I do not propose to try to prove to the House that these statements with regard to the dirtying of the soil, the exhausting of the soil, and as to a nurse crop for grass, are fallacies.  If any Deputy is at any time in the vicinity of Roscommon I shall certainly illustrate it to him on my own farm, and I shall guarantee that he shall not come back to the House and make that statement here again&mdash;that it is a good nurse crop for grass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ryan said: &ldquo;Some of these objections are, in my opinion, altogether unfounded, and some of them, I believe, have been suggested by minds prejudiced against the growing of wheat.&rdquo;  In making that statement he was referring to the Majority Report of the Economic Committee.  The Deputy went on to state: &ldquo;For instance, the very first objection tells us that `flour manufactured from imported wheat, if sold without restriction, would appeal more strongly to the public taste than flour made wholly or partially from native wheat.' &rdquo;  He goes on for a whole column of the Official Report to show that this is really a fallacy.  As a matter of fact, in the Minority Report, which is signed by Deputy Ryan, Deputy de Valera, Deputy Lemass and Deputy Anthony, we find this on page 38: &ldquo;We have valued the product at an average price depressed by the high cost of handling the small quantity produced for sale at the present <Col N="1247" /> time, by the absence of any effective organisation of growers, and by the existence of a decided preference for imported wheat.&rdquo;  Now Deputy Ryan comes along and says that the inclusion of this or something similar to this, in the Majority Report is a fallacy.  I am not very much surprised at that. The motion before the House includes this: &ldquo;That the importation of flour be permitted only under licence issued by the Wheat Control Board, and subject to an import duty: provided that there shall be no restrictions on flour imported for biscuit manufacture.&rdquo;  The Minority Report states at page 46, paragraph 23: &ldquo;It would be possible to restrict them&rdquo;&mdash;that is foreign wheats&mdash;&ldquo;by an import duty; but, pending the expansion of home production to meet our requirements, that would place an unjustifiable burden on the poorest of our people.&rdquo;  In the same paragraph, further down, we find this remarkable statement: &ldquo;The scheme also proposes to stabilise the price of wheat to millers in a manner which, we believe, would result in lower average prices to the consumer.&rdquo;  The one paragraph contains these two things; that the imposition of an import duty would place an unjustifiable burden on the poorest of our people, and &ldquo;we believe it would result in lower average prices to the consumer.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Deputy Ryan, at page 537 of the Official Reports, <Col N="1249" /> said: &ldquo;There are, however, other proposals for these two crops.  I need not go into them now.  Another reason why we should consider that the growing of wheat would be a benefit to this country is the fact that it would give employment where employment is badly needed, because there are many people unemployed in the rural districts just as there are in the urban districts, and many people are only partially employed in the rural districts.  Even taking the official figures that were supplied by the Department of Agriculture, it is estimated that the amount of manual labour necessary for the cultivation of one acre of wheat came to £2 6s. 6d. per acre.  If we were to produce sufficient wheat for our own needs, it was estimated that we would require about 860,000 acres, so that on the figures supplied by the Department there would be a distribution of £1,999,000 in wages.&rdquo; Deputy de Valera goes further, and says that it would give full-time employment to 27,000 people.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear it, but I am certain that if Deputy de Valera and Deputy Ryan are going to get this wheat subsidy that they expect to get they will get it out of the very small farmers of the country.  If the big or little farmers of the country grow this 860,000 acres of wheat does anyone expect that they will have to pay for that two million pounds in wages?  Is that what the statement means?  Is the small farmer of the country who ordinarily grows an acre or two of wheat to be told that if he grows an extra acre or two he must get somebody in and pay him wages? Or does it mean, as was stated on another occasion at the Economic Committee, that we could keep more people on the land?  Does anybody seriously suggest that the small farmer by growing an extra acre of wheat or two will be able to keep a second son at home and get him married and settled down on the farm?</P>

      <P>The thing is preposterous to anybody who has to do with farming.  Deputy Ryan in advocating the acceptance of the motion said: &ldquo;Under this scheme of increased acreage of wheat there would naturally be mills for the grinding of wheat set up more generally throughout the country and the result would be that these mills would have to sell the offals more cheaply than they are sold at present, because the sale of offals depends like everything else on demand and supply.&rdquo;  I am afraid I <Col N="1251" /> cannot agree with Deputy Ryan in that.  I have more faith in the business enterprise of the milling people of this country than that.  Whatever few mills there are in the country at the present time they would have business capacity enough to see that the price of offals would not come down.  If it did the price of flour would go up.  If Deputy Ryan was right what would be the ultimate result?  Suppose we had extra mills.  Reading the evidence given before the Tariff Commission when the application was made for a tariff on flour was very interesting. It was proved conclusively there that the milling industry in this country was a highly mechanised industry; the milling plant was up-to-date, so much so that it really cut out the human element altogether except to a very small extent. Notwithstanding that, the flour mills of this country were being undersold by the flour mills across the water, though their capacity was very high and equal to that of the other mills across the water.  The Merseyside mills were at a certain disadvantage in sending flour over to this country.  They are at the disadvantage of freight and insurance, which meant at least 14s. or 15s. per ton.  Well if these mills across the water are able to send their flour here and then undersell our best equipped mills here as was alleged by the applicants for a tariff on flour, what would be the position of the smaller mills that Deputy Ryan said would spring up as a result of this motion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if they did spring up, could you expect them to spring up in such a way that they would be as thoroughly equipped and as highly organised as the mills on the other side?  As far as I am concerned, I would like to see these mills spring up.  There is another thing that I would also like to see&mdash;namely, the Irish people fed largely on wheaten meal, and not on flour at all.  I do not think, however, that we can ever grow wheat of a quality in this country from which you could make decent flour.  Occasionally, of <Col N="1252" /> course, you may be able to grow a crop of wheat from which you could mill good flour.  If some scheme could be introduced by which the people of this country were made to fall back on the eating of whole meal, I for one would give that my hearty support.  I am a firm believer in whole meal, although I must say that there are some years &mdash;this year particularly&mdash;in which the wheat crop has gone against me absolutely.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  As regards a subsidy on wheat, even if there was one, I do not see how it could be administered.  Unless you had the mills which Deputy Ryan believes and hopes will spring up under the operation of a subsidy scattered around the country, you would, in my opinion, have a disparity in the distribution of that subsidy.  Take the flour mills that we have at the moment in the country.  If we were to grow wheat in our locality it would cost about 2/- a barrel to take it to the nearest flour mill.  I imagine the farmer would have to be at the loss of that 2/-; that it would not be made up to him in the subsidy. There is another reason why I think wheat would not be grown in the locality I come from for a small subsidy. It is this: wheat is grown for a dual purpose in my part of the country.  It is grown for the corn and for the straw which is used for thatching purposes.  I have seen wheaten straw fetch as high a price as 7/- per cwt. in the market.  At the moment I believe it is being bought at from 4/6 to 5/- per cwt. If the country were to grow the 860,000 acres of wheat that have been spoken of, the wheaten straw could not bring these prices.  From the market point of view the straw would be useless.  In my opinion, no subsidy would make up to the farmers in the locality that I come <Col N="1253" /> from for the price they are able to get at present for their wheaten straw.  I do not think I need say any more on this question.  I have not the slightest hope of converting anyone on the benches opposite to my way of thinking on this question, nor do I think they have much hope of converting me to their way of thinking.</P>

      <P>In supporting the motion by Deputy Ryan I will not go into statistics as the time at my disposal will not allow me to do so. The Minister for Agriculture stated that the growing of wheat takes a certain amount of nourishment out of the land and dirties the land to a great extent.  Is not the land of Ireland as fertile and productive to-day as it was eighty years ago?  Is it not better to use the land for a productive crop that would be remunerative to the farmers than to have them searching their empty pockets?  Some eighty years ago the population of the country amounted to about 8,000,000.  Their daily menu consisted principally of home-made bread, made from home-grown wheat. In those days doctors were few and dentists were unknown.  We had a healthy race of people then.  They were largely dependent on what they produced from the soil, and we had no consumption.  We had no stomach troubles of any kind, and very few cases of appendicitis came under the doctors' notice.  I can easily understand the opposition of Deputy Dr. Hennessy to this Bill, for I think he, like a good many Deputies on the opposite benches, is suffering from political constipation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask Deputies to take into serious consideration the advisability of supporting the motion.  I hope when they go on their knees in the morning <Col N="1254" /> to make their offering they will fervently pray, &ldquo;Give us this day our daily bread manufactured from home-grown wheat, and forgive those who do not assist in the production of the necessaries of life from our native soil.&rdquo;  I have grown wheat to a great extent for the past ten or twelve years, and my practical experience is that it is a most productive cash crop.  I have grown it in lea land principally.  It was sown in the spring from double stand-up white.  I have grown wheat that gave ten barrels to the statute acre. I am satisfied that the farmers would be very well advised if they took into serious consideration the question of growing more wheat.  At present the farmers of Ireland are practically down and out, and unless there is some measure of relief for them they are a bankrupt people.  It must be remembered that the farmers are the principal contributors to the taxation of the country from the hard earnings of their toiling and moiling from morning to night, and which is thrown into the bottomless pit of Government expenditure.  When they are down and out this State is finished, for it will be shattered to its very foundations.  I move the adjournment.</P>
