      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if any progress has been made in regard to the legislation promised in his statement in the Dáil on February 20th for the purpose of carrying out the agreement reached with the British Government regarding the compensation claims of civil servants under Article 10 of the Treaty; whether in fact a Bill has been, or is being, drafted and is intended to be passed within the time specified by the Minister; whether the proposed committee to deal with the claims for retirement awaiting disposal has been constituted; and if and when the Government proposes to release those officials whose cases <Col N="1284" /> have been disposed of, and who are waiting over two years the retirement on pension granted to them by the Civil Service Committee first set up under the Treaty Article referred to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestBlythe" hpid="Mr. Blythe Mr. Blythe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blythe</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  The Bill in question has been drafted, but, as I have already indicated to the House, its introduction is dependent on the formal signature by representatives of the British Government and of the Saorstát Government of the agreement arrived at.  Now that the general election in Great Britain is over, I have every reason to believe that the agreement will be signed at an early date.  It is not the intention to constitute the new tribunal until the proposals for legislation have been passed into law.  I am not aware that there are any cases of the kind referred to in the concluding part of the question.</P>

      <P>The only portion of the Shannon Works taken over by the Electricity Supply Board is that known as Loop IV., consisting of the 38 Kv. transmission lines on the circuit Dublin-Wexford-Waterford-Maryborough-Dublin, the connected 38 Kv. transformer stations and the temporary transformer station at Inchicore.  These works were transferred to the Board on the 25th March last.  The precise amount of the liability in respect of the works thus transferred to the Electricity <Col N="1285" /> Supply Board and the rate of interest to be charged thereon have not yet been determined.  No payments in respect of interest have yet been made by the Board, the period which has elapsed since the transfer of the works being only eleven weeks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the number of deaths due to electrocution resulting from the climbing of poles and coming in contact with wires of the recently opened Shannon Loop and the dates on which they occurred; if he has in <Col N="1286" /> contemplation the fixing or spiking of structures carrying overhead live wires to prevent such occurrences, and if he is aware that under Section 79 (3) of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927, Public Bodies or Local Authorities have no power to make regulations to force the Electricity Supply Board to secure the safety of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Two deaths have occurred by electrocution of persons who climbed the poles on Loop IV., which is at present in operation.  The first accident occurred on the 9th May, 1929, and the second on the 19th May. The spiking or otherwise fixing structures to prevent unauthorised persons climbing the poles would involve an altogether unjustifiable expense. Such devices have been tried in the past by other countries, but by general consent have been abandoned as costly, ineffective, and obstructive to repair and maintenance work.  I do not consider there is any necessity for the Saorstát to depart from what is now the general international practice in this matter. No person can climb any pole without first having seen a clear warning on an enamel plate fixed to the pole that he is endangering his life. I am aware of the provisions of Section 79, sub-section (3) of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1927, and that a final judgment as to regulations intended for the public safety was designedly left with the Electricity Supply Board, and not with local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with the reply given by the Minister, which is fairly exhaustive, there is one point to which he has not given attention, namely, the age of the persons who met their death by electrocution. The Minister is aware that the notice reads something like this: &ldquo;To climb this pole is dangerous. Anybody doing so will be prosecuted.&rdquo;  The reason I ask the question is that children might not understand the danger of climbing these poles, and the terms of such a warning.  The section of the Act prohibits anybody or any authority from interfering with the work of <Col N="1287" /> the Board, and insists on certain means of protection preventing such occurrences.  I would like to hear from the Minister whether he would consider the advisability of having some means by which deaths caused through the Shannon scheme would be minimised, if not done away with altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has founded a statement purporting to be a question on a wrong assumption. There have been no children killed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>How old were the people killed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>They certainly were not children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>How old were they?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say. They were of sufficient age to understand the warning.  One of them was warned twice by a young lady in the house opposite the pole, that his life would be in danger if he climbed the pole.  Climbing it in these circumstances, would be sheer bravado.  I am not acquainted with the details in the second case, but there is no question of a child involved. The arrangements we have made are those ordinarily adopted with regard to these things, and I think they will be found adequate.  I got recently a letter from some people who advised that we should put spikes on the poles.  In contradistinction to that, I got information as to the difficulty and cost of fixing these spikes, and the fact that they are ineffective.  They seem to offer even a greater incentive to a particular type of youth to get over the spiking.  If the Deputy casts his mind back to the time when railways were first started, he will remember that people advocated that a wall should be put up twelve feet high all along the railway to prevent people thrusting themselves in front of the train.  The same situation will arise in regard to electricity poles, and the people will get used to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the Minister will appreciate what prompted <Col N="1288" /> me to ask the question.  There is only one loop opened up yet, and there have been two deaths on that. When the other loops are opened there may be more deaths if some precautions are not taken.  I hope the Minister will give consideration to this matter, particularly as the responsibility lies on him, and, through him, on the Board and nobody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no responsibility in the matter.  If the House insists on certain things being done and meets the cost, certain obligations may be imposed on the Electricity Board.  At the moment, the Electricity Board have full control, and at the moment, as I am advised, there is no necessity for any further arrangements to prevent people climbing these poles.</P>

If the Bill is to be effective it ought to be passed without delay. It refers to the one day, the 23rd June, and alters the opening hours of premises from 2 to 5 to 4 to 7.  I think there is general agreement that on the occasion of a very important religious festival the licensed <Col N="1294" /> premises ought not to be open during the course of the religious ceremonies. It is anticipated that the ceremonies will have concluded before 4 o'clock.  That is the hour that has been suggested as most suitable for the opening.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the Second Reading of the Bill.  The long <Col N="1296" /> title of this Bill is: &ldquo;An Act to preserve in Saorstát Eireann all copyrights which were subsisting in the late United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland on the 5th day of December, 1921.&rdquo;  The Act is a short one and is simple.  The necessity for it has been brought about by a decision given by the Supreme Court in a case litigated over a year ago, and by virtue of the decision of the Supreme Court which, of course, is recognised as the highest authority on what the state of the law is at any time in this country, it has been discovered that the intention of the legislature, as expressed here during the course of debate with regard to the Industrial and Commercial Property (Protection) Act, 1927, has not in fact been carried out.  It was intended in that legislation that the time gap which existed as between the date of the Treaty and the date of the passing of the Act of 1927 should be bridged and that copyrights which had previously subsisted, as well as property in patents, trade marks and designs should be carried over.</P>
      <P>The Supreme Court have now decided two things; they decided, first of all, that copyright subsisting prior to the 5th day of December, 1921, was not carried over by any Article of the Constitution, and that the wishes of the legislature, in so far as it expressed the wishes of the legislature, were not carried out by the Act of 1927.  A further point arising from the decision is referred to in the second clause.  The Supreme Court held that the word &ldquo;acquired,&rdquo; as used in that particular section of the Act of 1927, can only mean acquired by assignment; at least the implication is that the word &ldquo;acquired&rdquo; can only mean acquired by assignment, and consequently the more general meaning attempted to be given to that word is not there.  Hence the second clause.  The third clause simply gathers up the first two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last clause has to deal with this point.  It was definitely stated and always understood that the 1927 Act had brought about a particular state of things, that copyright previously <Col N="1297" /> subsisting was carried on and given full effect to in this country.  The law has now been declared to be otherwise.  There are certain people consequently whose interests have to be considered.</P>
    <P>In the case in question the company got the assignment of two musical compositions from the composer.  It was the case of the Performing Rights Society v. the Bray Council.  The Performing Rights Society took action on the basis that the law was as it had often been stated to be and always had been held to be prior to this decision.  They took that case to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court have held, in fact, that the law is not as it was thought to be and as it was intended to be. The Performing Rights Society, at any rate, took their case to all the Courts in this country before whom they could bring it and their case has been turned down.  The other people have to be considered&mdash; the Bray Council.  The Bray Council have acted on the law as it is now found to be.  These are the only two parties.  Both have rights to a certain extent.  Both have litigated their rights and there is a particular decision before us.  We want to amend the law at the same time so that there should be no injury put upon other parties.  We have only the instance of the two parties.</P>
    <P>There has only been one alleged infringement of copyright litigated, that is, the Performing Rights Society versus the Bray Council.  It is hardly likely that there are others. If there were they would have come to light before this.  But in case there are others Clause 4 is introduced to meet the circumstances. Clause 4 lays down that no remedy or relief, whether by way of damages, injunction, costs, expenses or otherwise, shall be recoverable or granted in respect or by reason of an infringement in Saorstát Eireann before the passing of this Act of a copyright by this Act declared to subsist or deemed to have subsisted in Saorstát Eireann.  We want to patch up the breach of continuity that there has been.  We recognise that there has been an interim.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1298" /> There may have been infringements but if there were any infringements it is probable that they would have come to light.</P>
    <P>We think the best thing to do is to patch up the copyright, to preserve continuity and to ensure continuity for the future and to say with regard to any infringement that may have happened in the past when the law was as the Supreme Court declared it to be&mdash; that no action shall lie.  We do not consider that we are prejudicing anybody's rights in that respect, because we say if any infringements had taken place they certainly would have come to light before this.  The measure is difficult in the reading of it but the effect is simple.  It is simply to renew the continuity that we always thought had been effected by the old 1927 Act.  The Supreme Court decision stands.  We want to amend the law and to amend it retrospectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to oppose this Bill, but I do wish to point out that, to my mind, Section 4 of the Bill is a very important, and as I at present understand it, a very objectionable section.  I think there is much more involved in this than a question affecting the Free State. I think our position under the International Copyrights Agreement comes in.  I do not wish to argue the matter at length now.  I will not say more than this, that it seems to me, as I at present understand the situation, that the effect of this Act will be if an author or anyone has copyright before 1921 that that copyright is preserved to him by Section 174 of the Copyright Act of 1927, but if he assigned his copyright between December, 1921 and 1927, his copyright is entirely lost, and under Section 4 any attempt to secure copyright is lost to the person to whom he has assigned it.  The whole of the value of that property is lost to the assignee and cannot be recovered.  I would like the Minister to undertake to look into the matter closely before the Committee Stage is reached, and I will endeavour to make myself as sure of the position as I can.  But I am quite convinced <Col N="1299" /> that Section 4 and the action that was taken in the interval before 1927 are undoubtedly contrary to the intentions of the Legislature and of those who framed the Copyright Act of 1927.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will investigate with Deputy Thrift what is exactly the point he is raising with regard to Section 4 that he thinks affects our position in the Copyright Union. I do not think that is so.  I think if this amending legislation was not introduced our position in the Copyright Union would have been very seriously affected, because we would have left a gap, and it was a gap we always intended to fill.  As far as I could follow the Deputy's statement, I want to take objection to one phrase he used.  He said that while copyright existing prior to 1921 was carried forward by Section 174 of the 1927 Act assignments of it were not.  The second part is undoubtedly right, but the first part I think the judgment has reversed as well as the second part&mdash;that copyright has not been carried forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the judgment stated that under Section 174 if the copyright was obtained before the Treaty it was secured by the Order that was issued under Section 174 and that no lapse in that copyright occurred, but if the copyright was assigned between the dates, December, 1921 and 1927, owing to failure to issue the Order&mdash;powers for the issue of it were given under the Act&mdash;the whole of that copyright is irrecoverably lost if Section 4 continues in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are in agreement that assignments are lost. There is no doubt of that in the judgment.  I would like to query with the Deputy the late judgment of the Supreme Court as affecting copyright itself, without any question of assignment coming in to complicate the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of the legislation is intended to affect, in a proper way, our position in the Union in <Col N="1300" /> connection with copyright to which we belong.  The Deputy referred to the action taken in the interim.  If that means the legal action upon which the whole legislation is to rest itself, it was taken in a particular way, and the Bray Council fought and won out a particular case.  There has been, I believe, notice given of intention to appeal outside this country.  If that is the point to which the Deputy referred, it ought to be clearly stated that this is one of the types of cases which we think ought not to be brought before a tribunal outside the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfWilliamEThrift" hpid="Professor Thrift Professor Thrift">
      <NameTxt>Professor Thrift</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not referring to the question of appeal.  I was referring to the question of assignment.  If that action had taken place between December, 1921 and 1927, the copyright would have been irrecoverably lost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Without this amendment, the Bill would achieve its purpose, because Section 4 of the Act of 1926, which is the section we are amending, runs as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Principal Act shall as from the twenty-fourth day of June, 1926, be construed and have effect as if sub-section (1) of Section 3 thereof were amended as follows, that is to say, by the deletion of the first paragraph of the said sub-section, which paragraph begins with the words: &lsquo;This Act shall&rsquo; and ends with the words &lsquo;a dwelling-house to which this Act applies,&rsquo; and the insertion of the following paragraph in lieu of the paragraph so deleted, that is to say:</P>
      <P>(1)  Subject to the provisions of this section this Act shall in respect of any particular house or part of a house let as a separate dwelling (a) apply to such house or part of a house....&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the Act would apply to these houses with the words 24th June, 1930, instead of 24th June, 1928.  That section would, I think, be perfectly clear in itself and would carry on the Act.  But I agree with Deputy Kerlin that it is much more artistic and correct to have this Section 2 amended also. Possibly, it is not strictly necessary because the particular statement that it actually applied to this class of house would overrule any general section.  But I agree with the Deputy that it is entirely advisable that no doubts of any kind should arise in the interpretation of this Act. Therefore, I am accepting the suggestion made by the Deputy yesterday, <Col N="1302" /> and I have handed in this amendment, which carries out the suggestion which the Deputy made. I am obliged to the Deputy for pointing out what might be a difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that this Bill do now pass.  In doing so, I merely desire to say a few words. In introducing this Bill, I said that its introduction was necessitated by the existence of a conspiracy to prevent the working and operation of the criminal law in this country. That was shown by the murder of a witness and by the attempted murder of a juryman.  Unfortunately, since the Bill was last before the House, we have had further evidence of the existence of this conspiracy <Col N="1303" /> to break down the administration of the law in this country.  The law depends upon witnesses, upon jurymen, and it also depends upon the Guards, whose duty it is to detect and to prevent crime.  The night before last, in the County Clare, there was perpetrated a murder, one of the most cold-blooded in its calculation and one of the most diabolical in its execution, that has ever been perpetrated in this country.  It is a murder which must fill the minds of every decent and self-respecting person in this country with loathing and abhorrence for the murder itself and with loathing and abhorrence for the persons who perpetrated a crime of that nature.</P>
      <P>In the County Clare an unfortunate young Guard was literally blown to pieces and two other members of the Guards were seriously injured by a trap mine.  No doubt, the whole diabolical design of the perpetrators of this murder was not carried out.  The mine was not opened in the barrack, with the result that would have followed if it had been opened there, but the results that did happen are in themselves terrible.  This unfortunate young Guard, a fine type of man, a splendid young Irishman, has met his death in the discharge of his duties &mdash;discharging, bravely and fearlessly, the duties of his position and the duties he owed to the country. He has died in the discharge of his duty and he has died for his country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an awful thing that in this country of ours crimes of that kind should happen.  We are, on the whole, a country which is free from crime, and it seems as if the criminality of the whole community has concentrated itself in the minds of a few of those desperate, hatefully-minded assassins.  They are endeavouring to break down the administration of the law by every means; no matter how diabolical the means that suggest themselves to their minds they adopt them.  It is to safeguard the lives of jurymen from this type of man that this Bill is introduced, and it is in that spirit <Col N="1304" /> that I ask the House now to pass this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be rejected.  It would be much more decent, I think, if the Minister, in asking the House to pass this Bill, had honestly told the House that it was not an attempt to protect jurors, that it was not an attempt to improve the jury system, that it was not intended for the protection of citizens, but that it was merely a camouflage attempt to do away with or abolish the jury system altogether; because that is what it means.  In the many statements the Minister has made in this House he gave no indication as to the way this Bill was going to succeed in securing the safety and preserving the lives of jurymen if they were ever in danger.  There has been a good deal said during the discussion on this Bill, and wild statements made, as to the conspiracy on foot.  We have had trotted out here time after time the cases of a witness and a juryman, one of whom was wounded and the other killed, and that that is the justification for the introduction of this Bill.  But it has been pointed out, time after time, that it took the Government a very long time to bring in this measure if they seriously believed or considered, or were influenced by that in the belief or consideration, that such a Bill was necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first time that this Bill was mooted and the first time there was any talk about it was when the North Dublin by-election was in the offing, and only that there was another by-election I do not think this House would have heard any more about it. Between these two by-elections you had the President characterising as scare-mongers the people who circulated reports that a conspiracy was on foot in this country to overthrow the State and that there was danger for the citizens of the State.  The President himself, as everybody knows, was the chief scare-monger in that matter.  He was the first, I think, who broadcasted the statement here in Dublin as to such a conspiracy being on foot, and the Government <Col N="1305" /> being about to take serious notice of it.  He was the first, perhaps, after the election to repudiate the scare-mongering that he started himself.  A few weeks ago the scare-mongering was started again by the Minister for Justice carrying out the political plans of the Executive Council and for political purposes. To test this matter one must examine and see how far this Bill can protect jurors.  If there was ever a measure introduced to try and frighten and terrorise jurors this measure was intended for that purpose and it can have no other effect. Pursuing the policy that is embodied in this Bill means going back to nothing less than the court martial régime which this country was familiar with some years ago.  It means doing away with what was regarded for a very considerable time under British law, and recognised and accepted in this country, as one of the fundamental safeguards of the citizens of this country&mdash;safeguards which the lapse of time and experience have proved necessary for the protection of the citizens and the guarding of the rights to which they were entitled.</P>
    <P>Take one of the most potent examples of what these rights mean and how jealously they had been guarded and how jealously they had been seen to by the authorities which I think the Minister for Justice and the Executive Council will recognise. Take Section 7.  It amounts to having proceedings in future before juries in camera or in a secret way. See how reactionary this measure is because in that section the judges who have been appointed by the Executive Council no longer hold the confidence of the Executive Council. I think that is a tribute to them in some sense&mdash;that they will not be so partisan as to be influenced in ways that other officials of the State may be influenced.</P>
    <P>In Section 7 it is proposed that the judge must peremptorily, when the superintendent of the Gárda says it is desirable that the court should be cleared, clear the court, that the judge has no option but to <Col N="1306" /> do so.  The Minister for Justice is well aware that there are certain practices and procedures already in operation that enable the judge, at any time he sees fit, to clear the court on any grounds&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I will quote a case in a moment for the Minister for Justice.  If the Minister disputes that we can very easily get the authority.  If he says it is not so I would like him to state so now.  I would like the Minister to repudiate that, and to say there is no authority for that.  But the Minister knows perfectly well it is so.  He knows there is an authority for that, but because he imagines that a Deputy getting up here has not by him at the moment the whole 30 volumes of Halsbury available that he can, in a sleek way, get out of it.  I challenge the Minister to say it is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have stated, under the existing law the judges have ample power to do that.  Why did not the Minister, if he had confidence in his judges, leave in their hands the power to clear the court themselves if they thought fit?  If he thought that the powers for doing that already available were not ample <Col N="1307" /> or that the powers were not extensive enough or wide enough, why did he not leave in the hands of the judge, under certain circumstances that might arise, power that would enable the judge to clear the courts? No.  The Minister waxes very eloquent whenever anybody on this side of the House criticises a member of the Gárda Síochána.  The test of some of the partisanship, at any rate, is proved in this Bill; the Minister will not trust the judges. But he will trust the superintendent of the Gárda Síochána.  He will not leave it optional with the judges. He will not leave it to the judge to be satisfied with any evidence, but the judge must, on the evidence of the superintendent of the Gárda Síochána, have the court cleared.</P>
    <P>To say that that humiliates the judges is to put it very mildly.  To some people, and in some set of circumstances, it will mean that the superintendent of the Gárda will be prejudiced.  I think that goes without question.  A case has been referred to.  I will deal with that later.  The Minister in asking the House to pass this Bill denied that the local superintendent would be prejudiced or that he would take up a certain line with regard to any person as to whose guilt he had any idea.  The superintendent would make every effort that he possibly could to secure a conviction.</P>
    <P>The judge would, I believe, be impartial, but the superintendent of the Gárda would not be impartial in such cases as these.  I mentioned that I would refer the Minister to authorities for which I think he would have some respect as to how they are regarded under British law. That law has been in operation in this country, and a good deal of it is still in operation in this country. I will refer him to authorities as to how it is regarded by authorities elsewhere.  Bentham is a well-known authority.  He has been referred to by Lord Shaw in the case of Scott v. Scott.  If the Minister wants to be so meticulously exact about it, the authority is in the 1913 Appeal <Col N="1308" /> Court Cases, page 477.  This is what he says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the darkness of secrecy, sinister interest and evil in every shape have full swing.  Only in proportion as publicity has place can any of the checks applicable to judicial injustice operate.  Where there is no publicity there is no justice.  Publicity is the very soul of justice.  It is the keenest spur to exertion and the surest of all guards against improbity.  It keeps the judge himself whilst trying under trial.  The security of securities is publicity.&rdquo;  I think that the Minister might have some respect for that authority at any rate.  Lord Shaw further refers to the enlightened verdict of Hallam in which he ranks the publicity of judicial proceedings even higher than the rights of Parliament as a guarantee of public security.</P>
    <P>Bentham further says: &ldquo;Civil liberty in this kingdom has two direct guarantees, the open administration of justice according to known laws and the right of Parliament to inquire into and obtain redress of public grievances.  Of these the first is by far the most indispensable, nor can the subjects of any State be reckoned to enjoy a real freedom where this condition is not found both in its judicial institutions and their constant exercise.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Lord Shaw, going further than that, says that the very conception of trials in camera shocked him. He further says: &ldquo;The right of the citizen and the working of the Constitution in the sense which I have described have, upon the whole, since the fall of the Stuart Dynasty from the judiciary&mdash;and they appear to me still to demand it&mdash;a constant and most watchful respect.&rdquo;  That decision many recognise as fixing definitely and finally, in British law at any rate, the right to open trial. These authorities are the authorities of the British law and the British Constitution, and I think that the Minister cannot quote any higher. They have placed it that publicity is the only means that can secure for the citizens a fair trial.  That is the <Col N="1309" /> major means, and the principal means, that will secure a fair trial and the liberty of the subject.  But here we have in this country a reactionary measure brought in that is intended to go behind all that, and intended to secure that there will be trials in camera.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Where is the question of camera?  As the Deputy knows, the Press is always present.  There is no trial in camera.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the Press in a moment.  The Press also is sought to be excluded.  The Press itself is being curbed.  They also must have some sort of docket or voucher that they are all right, at any rate, from the point of view of the Executive of the day.  The Press have not free access to it.  The public can be cleared out of it.  These star-chambered proceedings will go on which cannot get respect from anybody.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows, if he has ever attempted to secure disrespect for the law, that under this section alone he has taken the surest and the quickest road towards securing it.  Every authority that can be quoted on the question of publicity in the courts, open trial and trial above board, has been flung aside in this attempt to justify this political means of furthering propaganda, and it is a mean means at that.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentions about the Press.  Sub-section (5) of Section 7 makes provision for the clearing of the Press also if, in the opinion of the superintendent, there were any articles calculated to intimidate jurors generally, and so on.  That is left in a very indefinite and vague way.  It leaves it in a certain position so that there would be no difficulty in dealing with the Press, if there were such a Press in the country as would take a stand definitely on the rights of citizens, where that stand might be construed as running counter to the policy of the Executive of the time.  It might be construed by some of the enlightened superintendents of the Guards as being a Press that might be calculated to intimidate jurors.</P>

      <P>I have.  I do not know whether the Minister is referring to the amendment he brought in when he tried to improve it a little, or pretended to improve it.  He effected no real improvement. &ldquo;Produce copies of the paper,&rdquo; and so on&mdash;I do not know whether that is what the Minister is at.  Why does not the Minister leave it in the hands of the judge so that more evidence shall be called than the evidence of the Superintendent? Why does he not leave it open in the Bill so that any person who is interested, the Press, for example, will be entitled to call witnessess to explain the articles or the attitude adopted and satisfy the judge generally that they are entitled to be there as Press representatives for the specific and proper purpose of fairly reporting the proceedings? That is not down in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 3 makes the jury panel a confidential document.  It deprives the accused of any right to get a copy of the panel.  If there was any means of securing a packed jury in the interests of the State.  I think this is the most effective means; it is the most effective method that could be adopted by the State.  The <Col N="1311" /> State has taken up an attitude all through this question which is the very opposite of what has been regarded as the liberty of the subject down to the introduction of this Bill.  In some ways in this country it is sometimes more often discarded&mdash;particularly has that been so in the last five or seven years&mdash; than observed.  But it is openly discarded with some pretence of argument on this occasion.  They are discarding the giving to the person charged of every reasonable facility for enabling him to get every possible chance of being dealt with fairly.</P>
    <P>To make the jury panel a confidential document will not secure or protect jurymen if such a conspiracy were on foot.  The Minister for Justice knows quite well that, especially in country districts, the people are familiar with the persons who are brought up as jurors.  In country districts, for example, if a man goes to the county town, which in many cases may be thirty or forty miles away, the people know he is going there on some particular business. They know there is a Circuit Court sitting and they know perfectly well that the man, who has not been brought to that county town before, is going on a summons to attend on the jury.  The whole countryside knows that.  There is some reference here about loitering about the courts.  Does the Minister propose to bring jurymen to the courts from all parts of the country in Black Marias or in closed vans? Does he propose to bring them at night?  Does he think that by merely keeping the jury panel secret he has secured protection for jurors?  Does he think that the whole countryside in the case of country areas, or whole streets in towns, will not know all about the jurors?  Does he propose&mdash;I am only putting this for the sake of argument; I am not advocating it&mdash;to make it an offence for the motor drivers or other people engaged in transferring jurors from their places of residence to the places of trial to <Col N="1312" /> disclose the name of the person they have conveyed?</P>
    <P>Of course, this Bill was never intended as a protection for jurors; that is obvious to the meanest intelligence. It may go down, though, with people blinded by prejudice or embittered by propaganda.  Anybody who wants to deal with the situation fairly will know that this Bill is a huge bluff, and instead of being a protection for jurors it is an intimidation of jurors.  He knows also that this Bill is not intended to safeguard jurors.  It is intended wholly and solely to abolish the jury system altogether, and the Bill is a sort of preliminary canter.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (2) deprives the accused of any right to get a copy of the panel.  The reduction in the number of challenges which the accused is entitled to&mdash;unlimited challenges&mdash;is bad enough.  There is a reduction from twenty to five.  That was in one of the Acts passed by this House some years ago.  There is unlimited power on the part of the State to order stand-bys.  The State will continue to weed out from the jury, without any reason being given, every person who they think will not bring in a verdict in a certain way. The Minister, of course, will say that the people prosecuting never try to get a conviction.  Does he think that people are living in the moon?  Does he think that there are people here who have never been at a Circuit Court or a Criminal Court in their lives?  Does he think for a moment that in a matter like this people are so direfully ignorant that they will put the prosecutor on the same plane as the judge?  I have seen, and the Minister has seen it time after time, where the prosecutor was watching the solicitor for the defence to see his attitude towards certain jurors as they were going into the box to take the book.  At the last moment, if the prosecutor thought for a second there was somebody going in who might in some way or other, by look or otherwise, please the solicitor for the defence&mdash;it was he who would be challenging&mdash;he would order that person to stand-by.</P>

      <P>The sort of scale of respectability, the sort of scale of &ldquo;Upper Ten,&rdquo; as some people call it, has often been considered by the State, at any rate, as a means of saying that those people are not fit to serve on juries.  Might I not appeal to the House&mdash;the Minister has made up his mind according to prearranged political plans&mdash;to say that the prisoner ought to be entitled at least to as much fair play and justice as to have his case adequately put before the courts, and that he ought to have the same opportunities for doing that as the State will have. Was it not an attempt to deprive the prisoner of those facilities that the right of challenge was reduced from 20 to 5 and that unlimited stand-bys were allowed to the prosecutor for the State?  Is not this a further attempt to curb and restrict considerably more the powers and the <Col N="1314" /> safeguards that were given to him previously, and is not that so intended by this Bill?</P>
      <P>As I pointed out on the Second Reading of this Bill, there may be persons on that panel, and, if the prisoner had a copy of it, he would, in consultation with his legal advisers, be able to decide whether or not certain of those jurors may not be prejudiced against him.  I gave the example before of the insurance company.  It was a simple example that should bring home to anyone how easily a jury might be secured which would be entirely prejudiced against the prisoner.  The State will have the jury panel.  It will not be a secret document from them.  It will be taken over by them and marked and re-marked in every way, so that they, with their unlimited challenges and knowing all the members of the jury, will be able to pack the jury in such a way as to secure a verdict against the prisoner.  Is that the intention of the Bill?  Is it the intention of the Bill to make sure that every person who is arrested and charged is going to be convicted?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very different thing when the Minister brings in here a Bill which tries to curb in every possible way all the rights and facilities that might enable a prisoner to get a fair trial.  The Minister mentioned other countries where there were certain alterations in the jury system.  I do not think he mentioned any country where the jury panel is secret.  In that respect, apparently, the Twenty-six Counties are going to show the way.  They are going to show the way that the sense of justice and fair play, the sense of safeguards for the prisoner and the sense of the maxim that every man is presumed innocent until he is found guilty&mdash;that all those are to <Col N="1315" /> be flung away, and that the prisoner is going to go into the dock with a definite handicap against him, so that, unless some miracle happens, he is going to go to jail or even to suffer the extreme penalty if the charge is on the capital offence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another section in the Bill that the Minister tried to justify was Section 5 which deals with the majority verdict.  If we leave out this bluff about conspiracy, if we leave that out of the discussion for the moment, on what grounds can the Minister for Justice justify the introduction of such a section? When the Courts of Justice Act was being introduced and passed through this House, passed, I believe, on the recommendation of a Committee, an Act that was carefully drafted and carefully considered, that Committee and this House were very careful to exclude criminal trials from the effect of the majority verdict. To anybody the reason was quite obvious, that a prisoner, according to the system of jurisprudence and according to every other authority, has always been recognised as being entitled to any reasonable doubt.  As was pointed out here before, if three persons on the jury disagree with the verdict of the other nine, is there not a reasonable doubt there, since previously it was recognised here that even if one disagreed there was a disagreement of the jury and the prisoner might be brought up again? The usual practice, I believe, after three disagreements is to enter a nolle prosequi.  Now the Minister seeks to introduce this section and to make the majority verdict the verdict&mdash;that is, the majority of nine to three.  Surely it is evident to anyone that if there are three reasonable men, three men who get on that jury after all the packing and the curtailed methods that have been adopted or even visualised in this Bill, in the interests of the State, three people approved of by the State prosecutor in favour of an acquittal, there is a reasonable doubt there?  Is a man to be hanged <Col N="1316" /> where a reasonable doubt exists in the minds of three people?  It will be justified on the one ground of expediency, the one ground that it is going to be a safeguard for jurors. Is it a safeguard for jurors?  Is it not obvious to anyone that if there is any feeling whatever against a particular verdict that the three men on that jury who have held the view that the prisoner was not guilty, are going to advertise it and to blazen it all over the country that they, at any rate, disagreed with the verdict?  If three disagree, must it not have been the other nine that found the prisoner guilty?  Will those people keep it secret?</P>
    <P>Will there not be somebody in the court or around the court, or in the locality from which those jurors are drawn, that will know and say that it was certain people who were responsible for a certain verdict?  Is that a protection to jurors?  Is it intended to be a protection for jurors?  It was quite plain, in the other instance, that if twelve were required to bring in a verdict of guilty, and if there was a verdict of guilty, that then the twelve jurors found the prisoner guilty.  This will have the same effect.  If there is a feeling that a wrong verdict has been arrived at, you will have people who disagreed from that circulating it to everybody in justification of their own action. There is no penalty provided to prevent them doing so.  The Bill, as I say, is not intended for the protection of jurors.  It is intended merely as a political propagandist method, and nothing else.</P>
    <P>Section 6 deals in a very roundabout and a very ambiguous and vague way, with what is now constituted an offence&mdash;non-recognition of the court.  &ldquo;Any act or omission&rdquo;&mdash;I do not know, and it has not been so far defined to the House in what way an omission can be construed as contempt of court. Apart from that, passive resistance has always been recognised as a constitutional and ethical method to which people were entitled to resort, <Col N="1317" /> and it has been recognised in this country.  It has been recognised everywhere, and here again the Free State must lead the way in constituting as an offence what other nations have not done so far.  If that is what they lead the way in it is not much of an advertisement for them outside this country.  Passive resistance is a method, and the only method in many cases, that is left to people to try to secure some justice, or some rights, where the law may be immoral, or may become immoral by maladministration, where there is a system of law that in its ordinary application may be fair but in its maladministration may become very unfair.</P>
    <P>What method is left to prevent an unfortunate prisoner being tried by a packed jury, by a Star Chamber, behind closed doors, with the court cleared, and the advice and opinion of the Civic Guards pressed, and in certain cases excluded, with no way of getting the light of publicity which we are told is the security of jurisprudence and the administration of the law&mdash;as I quoted from Lord Shaw for the Minister?  What method is left to the unfortunate prisoner, handicapped, manacled and shackled in that way, except a resort to the method of passive resistance? I believe that when this Bill is in operation, and has been working for some little time, and when it is obvious that passive resistance is the only method which can be used against the ill-usage to which it may be brought, I believe and sincerely hope that there will be men in the country who will resort to that method of passive resistance as the only method open to them to try and break down the administration of laws that have turned out immoral, and that in their conception were immoral. It is the only method that will be open to people in that position, and as this Bill is more and more administered it will be followed more and more.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I want to refer.  The Minister here, last evening, referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal as being a safeguard. When I stated that the <Col N="1318" /> court had not gone into facts in certain cases the Minister was shocked at the time.  On that matter, as the Minister is aware, in civil cases, although the courts have the power to go into facts, it is only in very few cases they have done so.  I refer the Minister to a decision in the Kerry case three or four weeks ago, where the Chief Justice in the Court of Criminal Appeal said quite definitely they were not to go into certain facts.  The Court of Criminal Appeal is not, as the Minister is aware, a court of re-hearing.  If the judges administering the law as they find it have come to the conclusion they are not entitled to go into all the facts of the case, what safeguard is the Court of Criminal Appeal?</P>

      <P>Is the Minister justifying the Court that because there has been some miscarriage through not calling certain witnesses the Court in its discretion may do so? Does the Minister try to say in face of that that the Court of Criminal Appeal is a safeguard?  What safeguard has it proved except in certain technicalities?  And a Bill introduced here even did away with that matter of technicality.  Finally, what reason can the Minister give for the introduction of this Bill and passing it through the Oireachtas?  Some people, I suppose, have been listening so often and so long to it they would be inclined to believe that there was a great revival of citizenship within the last few years, a great pride of citizenship within the country, and that people were not afraid to do their duty as citizens.  Members on the Government Benches opposite have prattled that pretty freely through the country, and in their press organs inside and outside the country.  They have tried to show that the people of this country are <Col N="1319" /> not afraid to exercise citizen rights, and they have tried to show that the people of this country were not afraid of the people referred to here by the Minister as assassins, gunmen and so on.  Is this Bill not a contradiction of that?  If there is pride of citizenship, if there is civic responsibility&mdash;I think that is the phrase used&mdash;if there is all that in the country, why is it necessary to bring in this Bill?  It was brought in, as I have said, simply and solely as political bluff, and the purpose having ended to some extent with limited success would they not be satisfied even now at the eleventh stage to drop it?</P>
      <P>Reference has been made by the Minister to the Clare case that happened the other day.  The Minister was very indignant to-day about the Clare case.  The Minister should remember that on his shoulders rests a certain amount of responsibility for these happenings in Clare.  Time after time questions have been raised in this House and demands made on the Minister to inquire into the action of certain members, or thugs, of the Civic Guards force in Clare, as to the taking out of citizens and hammering them on the roads, and so on.  These questions have been raised on the Estimates, and on other occasions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has consistently and persistently taken up the attitude that he would have no inquiry into these cases, that he would take the word of the Guards as gospel.  When affidavits were brought into the House in which the facts were sworn to by people he sneered at them and said that there was nothing in them. When people pledge their oaths and go before commissioners appointed by the Government, or before commissioners for oaths perhaps holding under the courts of the present Executive, if there happens to be a Civic Guard involved we are told: &ldquo;No, you cannot inquire into that; you cannot consider it.  They are above suspicion; they are above reproach; they can do nothing wrong.&rdquo;  That is what the Minister says.  Does the Minister not know <Col N="1320" /> that such an attitude as that must inevitably result in exasperating people in the areas where these things have taken place?  Does the Minister not recognise and realise that if he continues these provocative methods and if he more or less claps on the back the men whom the citizens of Clare have testified on oath to have done this work, he will force people into an exasperated condition?  There is nothing about that, but it is very easy for the Minister to wax eloquent on the other side.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the incident in Clare happened.  I am not certain whether it has been proved that a trap mine was used, or whether it is known exactly in what way it happened. The Minister may have more definite information as to what happened, and when we get all the facts we can discuss them.  When all the facts are shown clearly to the public and when the public have examined them they will be in a position to consider them from the proper aspect.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that the operation of this Bill will depend upon the jurymen and upon the Gárdaí.  The operation of this Bill will depend on the feeling in the country that must rise against it.  The length of the term for which this Bill will exist will be made very clear a little while after it becomes effective, if it is ever put into effective operation. I believe that the country will very soon, very clearly, and very definitely show that they are not satisfied to keep in operation a measure that I say was intended as political propaganda.  They will show their resentment in a very definite and a very clear way.  They will show that they will not allow open injustice to be carried on by Star Chamber tribunals, set up in their political interest by the Government, and if this measure passes the Oireachtas we hope, and we sincerely believe, that the people will show their revulsion towards the tactics and the methods that have been adopted.  We are very often told that the Free State is in advance of other nations and that it <Col N="1322" /> leads the way.  It leads the way merely in such things as this reactionary and coercive measure.  I suppose that it is proud of that.  It leads the way in that, if in no other way, under the present régime.  We depend on the people, when they understand this thing to its full extent, not only to root this Bill out of existence, but to root out the Executive responsible for it.</P>

      <P>We are opposed to this measure because we feel that it will not accomplish the object which the Government purported to have in view in introducing it.  We believe that the Government felt that some gesture was necessary from them to meet the situation that had been created by the two outrages that were committed in Dublin, and that they can only hope that this will be a gesture. In our opinion it will not even be an effective gesture.  We think that it is altogether wrong that new and very drastic changes should be introduced into the criminal law to handle a situation of that kind.  The Minister has not shown, nor has it been shown at any time during the course of these debates, that this measure will be effective to prevent the kind of thing that happened in Dublin, or the outrage that occurred yesterday, if that was a deliberate act, and as far as the facts are known it would appear that it was a crime that under no circumstances could possibly be justified.  But that being so, I think the Minister would have great difficulty in showing how the provisions of this Bill would prevent a thing like that happening.  In the course of these debates I pointed out that I was quite ready to support other and more effective measures to deal with matters of that kind, but that I believed that this Bill would not have the effect that it was intended to produce. I believe it is wrong to introduce reactionary legislation and to make reactionary changes in our whole criminal law in a temporary <Col N="1323" /> measure of this kind.  I do not want to take up the time of the House by dealing with the Bill any further, but I think we have made our position very clear on the whole matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to go through the sub-heads of the Vote this year in detail as I did on the previous occasion because the changes are indicated by the figures themselves, and the details for which the moneys are voted have either been adequately explained already or where there are changes they are indicated in foot notes.  On the details of the items I would draw attention only to one point on page 234 where the estimate under the heading &ldquo;Census of Population,&rdquo; salaries and allowances for the staff required amounts to £3,858, about the same as last year.  I had hoped, and I think I expressed the hope last year, that that particular item would have shown a considerable reduction this year, but, owing to the amount of information requested from time to time from the Statistical Department by committees and individual queries, it has been found quite impossible for that Department to succeed in doing anything like the amount of work put before themselves.  They did not and could not hope to keep to their programme for the production of certain materials.  It will be understood, with the Census of Population, taken in a particular way and under certain conditions in 1926, and with the Census of Production, which was taken for the first time in this country, that duties have been put upon that Department which it was not easy to <Col N="1327" /> measure in advance in any year. We have made up our minds that the staff required last year will be almost to the same extent required in the coming year to complete the Census of Population and everything that arises out of it.  I mention the Census of Production because I desired to make the statement I have made in regard to the Statistics Bureau as a whole, namely, that on account of the information required from time to time from Commissions and individual inquiries it has not been able to keep up to the programme outlined. The amount of work this year, even on the Census of Population basis, is very much the same as last year.  Outside that, there does not seem to be much that calls for comment as regards detail.  I wish to point out that sub-head HH, &ldquo;Gift to International Labour Office at Geneva,&rdquo; is re-voted as the gift has not yet been given.  It may go out this autumn.  Certain items have dropped from the Vote in contrast with last year.  For instance, the prize offered by the Departmental Committee on Crude Alcohol has been withdrawn.  I have indicated already in answer to a question why that was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Committee sat for a long time and a change was made in respect of the money voted to see whether advantage would be taken of it, but we came to the conclusion that no use was being made of the money and therefore it is not being re-voted.  Sub-heads H (1) and H (2) show increased expenditure in connection with the International Labour Organisation.  That is explained by the fact that this year there is to be a special session held in the autumn.  In other words, so far as the Labour Organisation is concerned, this year will see two meetings instead of one.  Therefore the Vote itself, and that for travelling expenses, in this respect have to show an increase.  Three items have been dropped.  So far as the allowance for &ldquo;Minerals Exploration&rdquo; is concerned, in any other year it <Col N="1328" /> might have been considered advisable to keep up the sum set aside for that purpose, but for the year in which we had it we did not discover that any great use was being made of it.  We hope that the necessity there was for it will disappear.  In regard to the item &ldquo;Industrial and Commercial Fairs and Exhibitions,&rdquo; the dropping of that Vote is a commentary on the attitude of manufacturers and industrialists with regard to foreign exhibitions.  The only time that industrialists or anybody in this country promise to exhibit&mdash; I say this subject to certain reservations&mdash;is when the cost of carriage and, in some cases, of the insurance of the articles to be exhibited is borne by the State.  We do not consider that that is a proper claim to make.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Vote for &ldquo;Industrial Investigations,&rdquo; it was introduced here to meet a particular emergency.  One particular investigation was before us when it was put in.  That has since been carried through.  It is considered that in future such items as visits by officials of my Department to make investigations into industrial matters abroad can best be borne on the ordinary Vote for travelling expenses. In regard to inducing other people to come to this country, we think that such expense could be provided by coming to the Dáil specially for the money.  We will only ask people to come to the country when a case is made for investigation into a matter from which there seems to be a good commercial return or likely business to accrue to the country.  On the last occasion when submitting the Estimate, I gave a very detailed account of the different Departments and paid particular attention to the work done in what I call the Trade and Industry Section, and I do not propose to repeat that in detail.  I wish to point out that, even though I make no detailed explanation of the activities of the Department in that line, I want to be understood that the activities to which I referred last year continue as before.</P>
    <P>That is to say, industrial inspectors <Col N="1329" /> and factory inspectors are occupied, not merely in advising as to breaches of the Factories Act or investigating conditions where Trade Boards have been established, but also endeavouring to report to headquarters, whereever they go, as to whether opportunities exist for industrial development, to get in touch with local people who have money or interest in developing industry, and to bring to headquarters such information as would enable us to advise people regarding the ways in which State aid would be got, if required, to get industry going.  The same system holds only with much increased activity in regard to frequent consultations with advisory committees, to the number of thirty or forty, in the different groups of industry in order to get their difficulties eased&mdash; if Governmental action can ease them &mdash;to give them information, to receive inquiries from them and generally to get the whole conditions of industry under review in order to see what action the Government can take that will lead to any increase. I referred on another occasion to the situation which had developed showing that there had been a steady turnover in the old, lopsided situation in which we found ourselves after the Treaty, depending almost entirely on agriculture.  That condition of things now shows that the industrial arm is stronger than it was and that its strength is likely to increase in the near future.</P>
    <P>That statement of mine was queried, and the point was put to me when I replied that some evidence should be furnished in the returns of the Census of Production, that these figures were useless inasmuch as they neither instituted themselves nor gave any material for instituting a comparison with previous years.  I admitted that was so, but I say this: if one takes these figures and compares the figures published with regard to industry and the information previously given in other reports, with regard to agricultural produce produced in the Saorstát in 1926, and if one takes also the number of people engaged in agriculture, using that term in the broadest sense <Col N="1330" /> of the word, and in industry, one will get, at any rate, certain illuminating facts.  It emerges that the total value of agricultural produce produced in the Saorstát in 1926, either consumed by the farmers and their families or sold by them, amounted to 62 million pounds, and that the materials purchased and used in connection with that output amounted to 8½ millions.  The net value, deducting wages, rents, etc., would be 53½ millions.  That could be clearly understood with regard to agricultural production, but when one comes to industrial activity and industrial production the term has to be defined a little more.  If one took the returns given in the Census of Production reports and simply made an enumeration, a wrong calculation could be made easily because there one would find, at any rate in an implied way, grouped under the heading of industrial activity and industrial production, such things as maintenance of roads, railways and harbours, construction, or anything in the way of new house building, repair of houses, or repair work of any kind.  I want to get a figure that will give industrial production in a narrower sense than that.</P>
    <P>If one has to take maintenance work, repair work and the building of houses into account the net value of the output under the Census of Production in 1926 would be 31½ millions. That excludes excise duty, but if the production of new transportable goods is taken into account &mdash;only this will require a long calculation&mdash;from the figures it will be seen that the 31½ millions must be reduced to 20 millions.  The deductions really come to this: that one omits gas, electricity, water, excludes excise duties on beer, takes away maintenance work, repair work and building of houses and all the other things that I have spoken of already, and one will then get two figures to put into comparison.  The net value of agricultural production in 1926 was 53½ million pounds.  In industrial production, in the narrower sense, excluding the things which I have spoken of, the amount will come <Col N="1331" /> to about 20 million pounds.  Other figures must be taken into consideration such as the number of persons employed.  I am not yet speaking at all of comparison.</P>
    <P>The Census of Population groups people according to occupation and it will be seen that agriculture gives employment to about nine times as many people as industry.  It also shows that the net value of the goods produced from agriculture is less than three times as great as from industry.  One concrete figure which I would like to have considered in the course of the debate is this.  The amount per person employed in agriculture is about £80 while the amount per person employed in manufacturing industry is about £266.  I do not want to quarrel with any statements made here, which will continue to be made and which can be rightly made, that agriculture is the main industry of the country, taking that either from the point of view of numbers employed or the wealth produced, but the figures I have quoted show at any rate the great importance of manufacturing industry as a potential source of wealth in the country.  Let me get to my comparison.  Industry was carried on under conditions which everybody knows up to 1921, even up to 1923.  Since 1923 certain arrangements have been made for fostering industry.  They took various forms&mdash;tariffs, the Trade Loans Act, moneys put up for certain production, certain big works that were segregated by themselves either to be dealt with specially other than by tariffs or trade loans, such as the sugar beet industry.  Certain other matters remain to be dealt with and probably will be dealt with in the same manner.  Tariffs have given employment.  The increase in employment amounts to something over 12,000 people.  The employment given by the operation of the Trade Loans Act, even though only about £400,000 out of the £1,000,000 set aside has been called on, amounts to 2,000 extra people.  There are therefore a net 14,000 extra hands in employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1332" /> On that alone, I say the contention can be made that the country has advanced to a certain degree and towards a better balance as between industry and agriculture. That can be fortified by looking at certain other things.  The figures in relation to exports and imports, if taken and if properly considered in relation to the increased home consumption that there is for certain tariffed industries and for certain groups of industries helped other than by tariffs, fortify that contention. It will be seen that there is some decrease in imports of manufactured articles if the figures are properly examined.  If, however, it will be denied still in face of the 14,000 extra put into employment and the increased activity there is shown in industry&mdash;by applications where made, by inquiries made with regard to helping and aiding industry in a variety of ways other than by financial help&mdash;if it is stated that, nevertheless, there is no improvement in the situation, will the people who say there is no improvement visible in the situation tell us how improvement is ever going to come about?  When previously speaking in the House I took a calculation. The items might be open to argument, but I made my calculation in this way.  Taking the imports into the country in a particular year, I calculated that about 50 per cent. of those were not taxable, and I defined what I meant by nontaxable in answer to a question&mdash; that they were things that could not be economically produced in this country or could not be easily replaced by other things produced in the country.  I calculated that 50 per cent. came under that heading. There can be argumentation afterwards as to the point raised in regard to the articles which I include under the heading of nontaxable at the moment.  Of the remainder, when I last made the statement, I said about half had been taxed.</P>
    <P>The other half have not.  That shifts the balance somewhat definitely away from that 50-50 position even with regard to the taxable imports, <Col N="1333" /> by reason of the woollen tariff.  Omitting it for the moment, because the effect of it is not much and because there are certain other little things that will come in possibly to change that situation the other way, the statement, on the grounds on which I made it, remains as good now as it did that of taxable imports, in the sense of tariffed imports, 50 per cent. are taxed, giving us increased employment for over 12,000 people.  If I am told, in fact, that although that has happened there is no improvement in the country in the sense of making it have a better balance of dependence on agriculture and dependence on manufacturing industry, then how can it be assumed that taxing more articles is going to rectify the balance?  The other argument was put up to me, that there have been so many things destroyed in the interval.  We can have arguments of that kind.  I gave a list in answer to a question here one time as to the number of factories&mdash;I think we defined them in some manner, employing upwards of a certain number of hands&mdash;that have disappeared. I waited to hear any single one of these cases brought forward as an argument that there was a business which disappeared and which in fact could have been and would have been saved under some other treatment, and I failed to hear any such argument brought forward.  On another Vote, when I made a statement similar to that, two cases were put up to me, that of the Dundalk Distillery and what were described as the Cotton Mills in Cork.  I do not know whether those interjections meant to convey that these were two outstanding cases in which State action could have prevented the disappearance of two concerns or were things that just occurred to the mind of certain Deputies and were thrown out.  But I would like to get somebody who has gone into this matter to indicate some concern he thinks might have been preserved by State action and that it was a dereliction of duty not to have taken State <Col N="1334" /> action to preserve it.  I would welcome an examination of, say, the spinning and weaving concern near Cork, and also an examination of the Dundalk Distillery, because I am not taking these as examples because they have been interjected in this debate in the haphazard sort of comment made the last day.  I say there has been an increase in industrial activity; I say there are certain things that show that, and have led me to the conclusion I mentioned here before.  I say further, if the statement is denied that there is a better balance now as between industry and agriculture, then the denial of that statement requires some explanation.  It may be on the basis that there has been so much disappearance that the things which have come into being are more or less nullified and that we are more or less in the same position.  It may be that there is increased agricultural production, and that consequently though industry is increased there is no better balance.  That is a much sounder argument.  Nevertheless, I say that&mdash;again the figure may be queried but it will only result in changing the percentage&mdash; if 50 per cent. of articles are tariffed and a million pounds is only availed to the extent of £400,000, if those two things in themselves have not brought about a better situation, then one would be forced to the conclusion that neither tariffs nor the provision of credit for enterprises still running under private control are worth anything.  That is lamentable and is a conclusion I would not like to be driven to.</P>

      <P>I think one would naturally accept the point of view of the industries themselves rather than the point of view of a layman speaking outside the industry.  Advisory committees, in a great many cases, have been asked over and over again as to whether or not they consider tariffs in the tariffed industries to be sufficient.  I know of one case in which the people who <Col N="1335" /> are considering putting up an application were asked should an increase be made in regard to a section of articles tariffed in one of the Finance Acts.  The biggest experiment made in tariffs was the boot experiment.  The Advisory Committee, although asked frequently, has not yet intimated, apart from making an application to the Tariff Commission, to my officials that they think that an increase in the tariff would better their situation.  The objection does not carry it very far. If the tariffs are not high enough, nevertheless there has been an improvement. There have been 14,000 people put in employment more than before in these particular industries. The only thing in the remark as to the tariff not being high enough is this: If it were high more people would be employed and there would be a better approach, but there is no foundation for the statement that there has not been an improvement in the situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I would. That is a bad year to take for the Deputy's purpose.  I will take before 1914.  I say yes, most decidedly. <Col N="1336" /> War figures should not be taken because there was an artificial increase. Things were done out of necessity that would not have been done in the ordinary course.  But take the normal year 1914.  Is it going to be the contention in any political party in this country which has any belief in protection duties and State assistance to industries of any type that conditions in 1914 were likely to bring about a situation better than it is now?  It is not an answer.  The only definite answer to the Deputy is to produce figures which are not in existence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Even so, there are no figures comparable with these. One would have to admit that conditions are more stable now, but one would say that in 1914 there were certain things which might not have been a national benefit but which were in existence and had industry going here.  For instance, there was the connection with Belfast which had a reaction on the Twenty-Six Counties. That has disappeared to a great extent, and to that extent there is an adverse factor operating now.  The effect of that has been nullified to some extent.  I think for the purpose of a discussion like this the period should be since the establishment of the Free State, the period when any Government action obedient to the wishes of the people of this country was in operation. That is the period which should fall for consideration.</P>
      <P>I want to make one point with reference to the Trade Loans Act.  I have been speaking of tariffs.  I also referred to the Trade Loans Act. The position with regard to the Trade Loans Act is, as I said, in summary there.  About £400,000 has been guaranteed, certainly £320,000 actually has been guaranteed. £80,000 fall for settlement almost immediately under two cases. £400,000 with about 2,000 employed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That does not finish the story <Col N="1337" /> from the point of view of the Trade Loans Act, because one must take into consideration that some of these concerns which have been helped under the Trade Loans Act are still struggling; some of them have not yet reached a profit-making stage, but we hope that they will soon. There is another side of the matter to be looked at.  What is the relation between the money which eventually may have to be met out of the public purse and the expenditure to date?  Leaving out the £80,000 which has to be considered immediately, guaranteed loans have amounted to £320,000, and the total expenditure to date on salaries and wages amounts to about £370,000.  I have come to the conclusion that that particular Act, or the series of Acts founded upon the Principal, the Trade Loan Guarantee, Act, have exhausted their utility.  Few applications of any importance are now coming forward.  There are some remaining to be dealt with, but we hope to get these cleared up in a short time.  There are very few new applications coming in, and there is no evidence that the Acts have brought about the position that was hoped for.  In one respect this was to enable industries to secure capital at a less rate of interest than they could get in the ordinary way. In some of these cases the employment given has been considerable, but one would need to be a great optimist to consider that the employment given will be anything like permanent.  In other words, some of the concerns that have been helped do not show themselves sufficiently strong.  In fact they show themselves to be so weak that one can only hope that they will continue in more limited and restricted circumstances than they are operating at the moment.  When the more limited and restricted circumstances come into operation the numbers of people employed at the moment will be reduced to a certain degree.  Some of the employment will be permanent and more temporary.  There also emerges from the history of the Trade Loans Guarantee Acts&mdash;this <Col N="1338" /> is a fact, and I state it as a fact with some trepidation&mdash;that it has not been discovered that banks in this country have been unduly restrictive in financing industry.  In a sense, one may say that the Advisory Committee under the Trade Loans Act was an appeal board against the banks.  Quite a number of cases came to us where banks had refused to loan money. All these cases went before the Advisory Committee for adjudication. Generally speaking, the composition of the Committee was about half business men and half persons definitely in the financial line of business, a stockbroker or a banker, and in very few cases did the Advisory Committees pass anything which the banks had previously refused to finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know that I should answer that question. Looking back on my own mind in 1924, I would have expected that the Advisory Committees would have passed a considerable number of cases which banks had turned down, because I then had the view that banks were deliberately, because of some sort of innate conservatism, refusing to help Irish industry. I will say now that I would not expect the Advisory Committees to pass very many of these cases.  I have much better faith in the banks now than I had when the Trade Loans Guarantee Act was first introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The situation that generally arose with regard to applications coming before the Committee, where a banker was on the Committee who had previously been concerned in a refusal from his banking corporation, was that that gentleman withdrew from the Committee and did not adjudicate on the hearing.  There were two or three examples of that. There has been quite a good appreciation <Col N="1339" /> amongst members of the Committee of that particular type of circumstances.  No banker adjudicated on the Advisory Committee where previously his bank turned down an application.  We think, at any rate, that there has not been brought forward by means of these cases any evidence of banks being unduly restrictive of the financing of industry in this country.  We have seen cases brought forward where banks were rather loth to give loans and turned down applications, but took them up when there was a Government guarantee; but these cases are very few.  We have not been able to segregate out finance as the main or anything like the chief thing on which the failure to better industrial conditions in this country rests.  We have discovered that it is rather the opposite way. There is any amount of money and any number of people who are sympathetically inclined towards investment in Irish concerns, but we generally find that people who have most sympathy and have put money in them had one, two or three bad experiences, and thereafter they got very conservative and did not move until good cases were presented to them.  How we are going to get eventually an investing public to put money at the disposal of industrialists who have good propositions and who are only prevented from starting by the absence of capital is another and more difficult matter. It certainly is not going to be achieved through the Trade Loans Acts.  Once or twice we did put it to people who were going to open up in the country that they should see how much of their capital could be provided for them here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked, I think last year, to make it a condition of the guaranteeing of moneys that the people concerned should be asked to have a certain amount of money raised from Irish sources.  I pointed out in answer to that, from the experience we had, that it was very difficult and particularly difficult in the type of cases coming before the Advisory Committees and the two <Col N="1340" /> Ministers concerned under the Trade Loans Guarantee Act.  Ordinarily speaking, they are not the type of cases for which one could go to the investing public with any confidence that on the facts being made known there would be a response from them. On two occasions only did we go to the investing public.  The response in one case was nil and in the other it was very small.  I do not intend, unless there be in the next couple of months an increase in the type of applications that ordinarily would be made under the Trade Loans Guarantee Act, to ask for a renewal of that Act.  What I intend to do in the future, and it will be thrown more as a burden on my inspectors and other through the country, is to segregate out cases where industry requires only for starting the provision of capital and by this means and other means at my disposal&mdash; friendly conference, etc.&mdash;to bring people who have control of moneys into contact with these people.  In other words, if again there seems to be a gap which is not being bridged by the ordinary action of the banks, there is one investment corporation obviously, and certain other groups, which may be brought into contact with these people in a friendly way. On the whole, it was the fairly big concern that really did seem to be the proper one for the Trade Loans (Facilities) Act, and if there be any big concern wanting a big amount of money, I propose to deal with that as, say, sugar beet was dealt with, or as kelp may have to be dealt with by coming to the Dáil in that case, getting a particular claim for it, and putting it to the House that there is a case made for a State loan or guarantee, or, in some way, for the provision of public monies or credit, and asking the Dáil to pass its opinion upon the individual case with the facts before it.  I think that that will not involve the House in very many discussions with regard to individual cases, if I am to take it from the run of these cases before. Anyway when I say that the big case involving a big amount of capital was the one that seemed best suited to the Trade Loans (Facilities) Act <Col N="1341" /> I do not mean to say that the concerns which have only been guaranteed a small amount of money in fact have not been successful.  The most successful of the 18 or 20 cases for which moneys were guaranteed are three smaller ones.  I do not want any wrong deduction to be taken from that phrase.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion on which this Estimate was under consideration the matter of transport occupied a great deal of attention.  Since I last spoke, certain things have happened which to my mind put the transport situation in a somewhat better condition, although not by any means satisfactory yet.  During the last discussion of this Estimate a variety of complaints were made with regard mainly to the operation of road vehicles, and I divided these complaints into three classes, one of which was that road vehicles were not paying their way; that phrase being interpreted in a variety of meanings, either that they did not pay their way in relation to the damage they did to the roads, or, as some people would have it, they did not pay their way in relation to the services they did to the community compared with the services which railway companies were giving to the community.  The second group of complaints were in this manner: that owing to the non-regulation or noneffective regulation of road vehicles there was danger to both life and limb, both to the passengers travelling in these vehicles and to other users of the highway operating at the same time.  The third volume of complaints was that there should be some proper connection as between the services run for the transport people.  I said in answer to these that as far as taxation was concerned that matter was being gone into and that people could rely upon road vehicles having to meet certain costs. I gave a statement of policy adopted two or three years ago with regard to the moneys spent on roads in this country&mdash;the division of the money that the ratepayer, the ordinary farmer, would have to pay, and, secondly, the amount of costs which would have to be contributed from <Col N="1342" /> motor taxation.  I said I felt that that basis was a sound one on which to build plans for the future but that the incidence of motor taxation as between the different classes of motorists was a matter that might fall hereafter for consideration.  That has been considered and fresh taxation has been imposed&mdash;not by any means as heavy a taxation as I would have liked to see imposed, and not by any means, to my mind, adequate taxation yet on buses to meet the damage that this type of transport services does to the roads.  When I say that I realise the implication of it, that the ordinary ratepayer is being called upon to bear more than he should to my mind for the damage that is being done to the roads by this type of vehicle.  However, a particular form of taxation has been introduced and the result of that can be followed out for another year.  I am going to make the point again, and I think it should be made, that if in the interval between this and next year we discover that even with the increased taxation these vehicles are not paying their way and subscribing enough through motor taxation to make up for the difference between the 1914 rate, increased by the farmer's sales figures for his produce, then the bus and charabanc taxation will have to be increased until the volume of taxation from motors swells that fund to the amount it should be at.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are variations in these figures.  Taking the 16 per cent., there is, at any rate, a certain amount of money which is payable by the ratepayers and which I think ought to have been paid by the proprietors of these road vehicles, and that they in their turn should take that out of the passengers who travel on that type of vehicle.  That is with regard to one side.  On the second side, regulations have already been introduced for the safeguarding of the lives and limbs of passengers in these vehicles and of other users of the highway.  A certain Order has been made setting forth regulations in regard to public service vehicles regarding length, width, height, seating accommodation, laden weight, springs, lighting, ventilation, etc., and that Order will be supplemented by legislation, as the Minister for Local Government promised here not long ago, which is in course of preparation and which ought to make its appearance in the autumn.  When the legislation does come, and some enactment will have to be put through this House with regard to the regulation of road vehicles, then I think two points will have been met&mdash;the either adequate or inadequate taxation of motor buses or road motor vehicles, and, secondly, the regulation of these vehicles that run along the roads, so that other users of the highway may be protected and the safety of the passengers may be ensured.  There remains the third point&mdash;what is called the co-ordination of transport.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The only people restricted are the railway companies in regard to the road vehicles they have.  It was explained in the House when that measure was being passed that these restrictions were to meet the anxiety felt by Deputies that if the railways were allowed to run buses, and were not restricted by the limitations put upon them in the Act, they would use what was described as their great financial resources to put buses on the roads in numbers, and for short periods, until they had beaten out competitors, and then take them off; and, generally, that that would give them the power which a big corporation has against bus proprietors who may not have very big finances behind them.  I think if I were introducing any measure of that sort now there would be less anxiety on the part of the House in regard to the operations of the railway-owned road vehicles, and that there would not be the same desire to have imposed upon the railway companies restrictions of that nature.  But I do not think it is desirable at this moment, when the whole matter is in a transitional stage, to withdraw these restrictions; if anything, I think the move is in the other direction, to impose upon other people restrictions somewhat similar to those imposed upon the railway company's vehicles, because I always understood that the demand for co-ordination carried with it a demand for regulation, and regulation was to the extent of the imposition of such restrictions as are on the railway companies themselves with regard to their railway services.  I never heard until to-night from people complaining about chaos, that the <Col N="1345" /> way out of chaos was to throw more people into chaotic conditions and to increase disorder.

      <P>I am sure the Minister does not want to misrepresent me. The Minister is not asking for powers to limit a number of non-railway buses on any particular route, and there are certain routes that are overrun by buses, and I say that there should be the same restrictions placed upon those people on those routes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The position was revealed to me in almost the first application that came forward, when I was asked to approve of a route and had the usual representations made to me against the approval of the route for road railway vehicles that there were enough buses already on the road.  That was not counted as a sufficient argument.  There is no power under the Act to withhold the licence from the railway company because a lot of other buses are plying along the route.  The curious thing is that one of the bus companies plying along the route, and which made the objection that there were enough buses on it, proceeded, immediately the railway company put on buses, themselves to institute a new service; and it did seem to be ridiculous that the one under the control of the railway company should be subject to certain limitations with regard to running times, and not being withdrawn once instituted, and that the other could be put on for a week and then taken off.  The difference is that in the one case we were dealing with a big corporation.  It was felt that they regarded road interest as hostile to themselves and if they were given unrestricted powers they would simply operate to wipe out the road traffic in various districts, and then they would cease to provide road services themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the general question of co-ordination, which is the only point outstanding, a great deal of point used to be made&mdash;it is less frequently <Col N="1346" /> made now&mdash;that because there are three Departments dealing with what are called the transport services there is bound to be a lack of co-ordination.  I tried to deal with that at some length last year.  I ask people to take one department. What are the functions of the Department of Justice with regard to road transport at the moment?  They are very small, but such as they are, they must remain with the Department of Justice unless the House envisages the time when the road services are so important and will be able to bear such increased charge that we will have a new section of traffic police, recruited entirely as a thing apart from the ordinary Gárda Síochána, having only traffic duties and paid for out of some type of rate eventually coming from those who use the roads; until that situation arises the Department of Justice, no matter what other Department has control over transport, must have some part.  As long again as the situation remains as it is with regard to the provision of moneys from the rates for the roads, in other words, until the roads are centralised and made a central charge, I think that the Minister for Local Government, on account of his association with local councils, must have a certain control.  But the general control is exercised by my own Department. Any advance towards greater control, in so far as it is transport control and not merely traffic control, or some provision with regard to taxation from a particular type of vehicle and ratepayers, must always rest, as Departments are at present constituted, in the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>I do not propose at present to bring forward any legislation giving me greater powers with regard to the control of road vehicles than I have at the moment, and that is very small, almost negligible.  I do not think the situation calls for it yet. We have regulated the taxation part and in another six months the whole road service will be running under legislation already promised by the Minister for Local Government, but <Col N="1347" /> I do not intend to ask for further legislation giving me, or some statutory body set up under the Department, such control over road vehicles as there is over railways. Again I say we have not got the information. Last year I said we were in process of getting it.  We are nearer to being able to make good decisions, if decisions are required. I am not sure even that the position is such.  If we are going to found a claim for the control of road vehicles on the fact that there are more vehicles on the roads than are necessary for the public service&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;I think that discrimination would have to be made. There are certain parts of the country not yet provided with transport facilities and that will have to be opened up, and where buses would play a tremendously big part in the whole life of the people and would be able to play a big part in aiding the railway situation. There are certain routes on which there are too many services at the moment, but the situation has not yet reached the point at which control would be necessary.  Some people who talk about control do not know what is behind it.  If there is going to be control, and control aimed at lessening the number of road vehicles on certain roads, while possibly allowing them to run on other routes, the question of certain services being scrapped would immediately come up.  Services cannot be scrapped without compensation being paid to people who used to be employed in them, and without some return being made to people who invested their capital in them and who will be able to complain of anybody coming in on them now when they have not had a chance of recovering whatever was their outlay. A situation might come about, which has been reached in certain other cases&mdash;some people think it is close upon us&mdash;in which there would have to be some sacrifice on the part of the State, to have the situation righted in the future.  I <Col N="1348" /> do not think that that time has yet come at all.  I think the situation is righting itself.  I think with the increased taxation on buses, with the fares having necessarily to be raised, there is going to be a bigger burden in the way of expenses to be faced by any company entering into road services.  That is going to lead to amalgamation of the smaller people; they are going to pool their resources to meet the heavier outlay that is required now.  The process of amalgamation and consolidation into one or two big groups is under way at present.  If and when one finds railway road transport in the same situation that rail transport was in in 1922-23 then there is a much easier situation to be met.</P>
      <P>It is only when it gets to that position by itself that there can be any effective solution of this. I ask Deputies who think that there is anything to be gained by State intervention, by State regulation or by State sacrifice in the way of compensation and returns to people for capital already put in and not redeemed, do they really think that in the new conditions there is any call for that?  I want the new conditions given a chance&mdash;the increased tax on the buses and the effect one can see already operating from that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to argue that with the Deputy because I am in agreement to some extent with him on that.  But there should not be any increase on the ratepayers. To some extent they might have to bear an increase, but the whole situation should be the 1914 situation with the conditions I have spoken of, the rest being borne by motor taxation.  Let us assume the situation where the motor vehicle is being taxed to meet the increased cost of the roadway which it requires for its passage and, in addition, that there are regulations ensuring the safety of life and limb to passengers and other users of the highway.  Let us assume there are going to be regulations <Col N="1349" /> with regard to speed, with regard to the conditions under which people get licences, with regard to the insurance of third parties, and with regard to all the varieties of things on which the Commission reported. It is in view of such circumstances that a decision should be formed, and those very circumstances that I have detailed, if not actually present, are very close upon us.  I doubt if anybody, viewing the situation as it will then exist, will say that there is reason for involving the State in the cases of certain men who will be thrown out of employment and certain capitalists who may have lost upon their investments.</P>
      <P>There were certain things mentioned that I dealt with before and certain things that I mentioned last year I would like to deal with. One of the things I mentioned last year has been dealt with and the other has been partly dealt with. The rest of the things mentioned then are about to be dealt with fully. Deputies should bear in mind what I have said, that until we have more data with regard to what would be a reasonable fare for a particular class of vehicle plying between two points, we cannot come to any definite decision.  We have not precise data; we have not the data that we could found a judgement upon as securely as, for instance, we could lay down the maximum and minimum fares that should be allowed for railways.  If one were to enter into that sort of control at the moment there would be a somewhat long period of trial in error, simply making a certain amount of guesses at what would be right and then finding out that too much in the way of profit had been allowed or too little had been allowed, and that the services were not getting a chance of showing how they would develop, even under those conditions.  Those were the two main matters dealt with last year on this Estimate, and they are the only two to which I wish to refer to-day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it would be well to say that the particular invention is, at the moment, being designed by the inventor with a view to its use on the railways. There is going to be a laboratory test given before certain experts in about six or seven weeks' time.  I have got an agreement from certain people that if that laboratory test seems satisfactory to them a test under actual ordinary operating conditions will be carried out.  The matter has progressed since I last spoke in this House in reference to it.  It has been under examination and is still being further investigated, and there have been still further experimentations in connection with it.  It is a very rosy and optimistic view to express, but I do not hesitate to say here that I believe railway electrification at a very, very cheap cost is quite close upon us.  I think there will be quite a considerable portion of the railways in this country&mdash;the main lines&mdash;electrified.  I am founding my opinion entirely upon this invention being successful, and on the experiments carried out to date, and judging by what has been proved with regard to this invention, I can give an estimate of the cost in this way: I am told that the electrification of the main line running between Dublin and Cork under the ordinary conditions of an overhead wire or a third rail, would amount to £1,000,000.  If this invention works out successfully, giving the best estimate we can make of cost and multiplying it by two, it could be carried out for less than £80,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg to move my amendment: &ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo; Deputies who heard the statements by the Minister for Industry and <Col N="1351" /> Commerce will have no difficulty in understanding that the Department of which he is in control is really one of the most important in the whole machinery of Government because its activities affect our people in every sphere of their national life.  It is essential, therefore, that that Department should be animated by the right national spirit and conducted with the ability and skill which would ensure its successful operation.  It is because I cannot honestly believe the right national spirit or the necessary ability is present in the conduct of the Department that I have moved to refer this Vote back for reconsideration.  There are some 348 officials employed in this Department of whom eight receive salaries of over £1,000 a year and of whom sixteen receive in or about the £1,000 mark.  One would expect that we would have very little difficulty in detecting the work done by a Department of that size during the course of a twelvemonth.  I think it is to be regretted that the Department does not publish for the information of Deputies and the general public an annual report on the lines of the report published by the Department of Local Government and Public Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For various reasons we are very much in the dark as to what the Department of Industry and Commerce is doing.  We have to rely almost exclusively upon the statements which are made here by the Minister annually when introducing the Estimate and upon various notes which appear from time to time in the &ldquo;Irish Trade Journal.&rdquo;  As far, however, as an outsider can visualise the work which the Department has been doing during the year, it appears to be almost negligible.  It has, of course, certain statutory functions and routine duties to perform which, I have no doubt, are carried out with reasonable efficiency.  But, as I pointed out last year, its main function should be one of stimulus to Irish industry, bringing assistance to those anxious to employ themselves here, and to find employment for others amongst us who at present are <Col N="1352" /> without work.  In its function of stimulating trade and reviving industry I think we must conclude that the Department has failed, if we are to base our conclusions upon the results which we can see for ourselves in the life of the country.  The Department, of course, should not be judged by its activity in the Dáil in the matter of introducing legislation or enacting measures to increase its powers to deal with particular situations.</P>
    <P>I think in respect to the Department the Minister is open to criticism on the grounds that certain measures which long ago he indicated were necessary and were under consideration by his Department have not yet seen the light of day.  The Minerals Bill was one such measure.  I think it was over twelve months ago the Minister first indicated it was about to be introduced.</P>
    <P>There was also a Bill dealing with industrial marks, which was promised, but which has not yet appeared. If one were to take the speeches of the Minister for the past few years, he would find mentioned in them quite a large number of Acts which the working of his Department requires to have passed, but which we have not yet seen.  I do not know why it is that these Bills have not yet appeared.  I think it is due to the fact that inertia appears to have overtaken the heads of that Department and that they are, to use a common phrase, lying down on their job.  The Minister has gone to great pains to prove to us that Ireland is gradually changing from a predominantly agricultural country to one in which industry and agriculture would be more or less evenly balanced.  In support of his contention he quoted figures made available, apparently, by the Census of Production in 1926, showing the net value of agricultural produce and the net value of industrial produce during that year 1926.  He pointed out that agriculture, however, gives employment to about nine times as many people as industry, but that the average amount produced per person engaged in agriculture was only £80, as against <Col N="1353" /> £266, which is the average production of every person employed in industry.  I think these figures alone are sufficient to cause a very strong doubt in the Minister's argument. It is quite obvious that there are more engaged in agriculture in this country than agriculture can support or that work can be found for in agriculture.</P>
    <P>I think it will not be denied that our agricultural population as a whole is under-worked, in so far as it cannot possibly find employment in the production of agricultural produce for all those who are endeavouring to find a living out of that industry.  It is for that reason that we have such a large number engaged in agriculture, in comparison with the number engaged in industry, and it is for that reason that we have a relatively small amount produced per person.</P>
    <P>If there was anything like a revival of industry in this country, or if there was any attraction to those engaged in agricultural industry to seek employment elsewhere, we would, I think, find that the situation in the agricultural industry would show a change.  The fact is, however, that the amount produced per person in agriculture is decreasing instead of increasing, and the number of persons endeavouring to find employment in that industry is not diminishing.  On the contrary, the numbers have increased within the past few years. We are in this matter very largely speculating.  There are no figures available for the purpose of comparison, and we have only got to place the figures made available by the Census of 1926 against certain information which was not very reliable, but which is available concerning the position that existed in the years before that.</P>
    <P>It is, perhaps, I think necessary at this stage to express very considerable disappointment with the manner in which the information ascertained by that Census of 1926 is being made available.  I think we can again censure the Minister for <Col N="1354" /> Industry and Commerce that he did not make adequate provision to ensure that that information would be made available to the people while it would be of some use to them.  I have already on two or three occasions pointed out here that we have not yet got the important information ascertained in that year relating to the industrial or to the unemployment position here. We are now informed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that even the schedule which he hoped would be followed in relation to the publication of that information will now have to be departed from, and that even that information will not be made available for us until a longer time has passed.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce may believe that the statistics relating to the volume of unemployment in 1926 will be of use in 1929 and 1930.  Personally, I cannot see what value that information is going to be.  The situation in this country is changing up and down every year and there is nothing upon which we can base any conclusion relating to the year 1929 upon information gathered in the year 1926.  I think that the Minister for Industry and Commerce should have made more adequate provision, whether by employing extra officials or not, in order to ensure the speedy publication of that information.  I think if he had done so he would have, in fact, effected an economy, because the continuous employment of a large staff on this work will probably prove more wasteful than the employment of a larger staff for a shorter period would have been. I think a matter which we have all cause to regret is that none of us, not even the Minister in charge of the Department, is in a position to say definitely what the trend of events in this country is in relation to Irish industry.  We can speculate, and the speculation which the Minister has made certainly does not coincide with the speculation that I and others of my acquaintances have indulged in.</P>
    <P>The Minister has informed us that <Col N="1355" /> the Government has taken certain action with a view to fostering industry here.  He even proceeded to indicate what the results of that action were.  I think the efforts of the Government to help industry were by him grouped under three main heads: first, tariffs, secondly, the operation of the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, and, thirdly, special steps taken in particular cases by giving money grants such as in the case of the sugar beet factory. He stated that tariffs had given employment to some 12,000 additional hands in the Saorstát, and that fact in itself is something upon which we can congratulate ourselves, and it helps to constitute the signposts which indicate the direction we must go if we wish to see a real improvement of the situation here that we all profess to desire.  When we say that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is unduly optimistic in his belief that the trend of events in this country is towards a better balance in industry, we do not wish to be taken as deploring the possibility of any such development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We sincerely hope that the Minister is right and that we are wrong.  We sincerely hope that there is that upward development of which he spoke, but he did not give us any data to-day which would indicate that it is taking place, nor do we think that such data are available to be given.  Undoubtedly 12,000 additional hands have been employed in tariffed industries, but I think we will find that a very large number of those additional hands found their way into the tariffed industries from other industries which have declined since the Government's policy was inaugurated.  I want to ask the Minister if that development of which he spoke has taken place in comparison with the pre-war period, or merely in comparison with the period that has existed since the establishment of the Free State Government.  The Minister mentioned the year 1924.  That <Col N="1356" /> year was probably the best year that this State has had since its establishment. It was a year in which our exports were, I think, higher than they have ever been since, and when trade generally was better.  It was a year in which, I think, the yield from the various taxes imposed was higher than it has ever been since. We have not since, I think, succeeded in attaining to the same position that was attained in that particular period.  But if we take the state of affairs in this country in relation to the last normal period, the period that existed before the war, I do not think that we can congratulate ourselves upon any visible improvement.  There may have been, and possibly has been, an increase in the value of certain agricultural products, but it has been very largely at the expense of population.</P>
      <P>We cannot close our eyes to the fact that all the ill-effects which we saw flowing from British rule in this country are still evident as a result of the rule of the present Government. When members on the benches opposite were endeavouring to rouse the people here to overthrow British rule in this country, they will remember that they pointed to the depressing effects which that rule had upon industry here, to the large volume of unemployment, and generally to the bad economic conditions in the country which resulted from it.  We have all those evils to-day accentuated as a result of the action which the present Government has been taking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce can undoubtedly point with pride to the 12,000 persons who would be unemployed if the tariffs imposed in 1925 and since had not been imposed.  But I think he cannot be congratulated upon not having taken the cue which those figures give him, and of endeavouring to work out a sounder and a better programme along the lines upon which the Government appeared to be about to embark in that year.  I think it is obvious that the machinery of the Tariff Commission has broken down.  The Government were acting vigorously and <Col N="1357" /> freely in dealing with the situation, in some degree in the manner in which it should be dealt with, before they established the Tariff Commission in the year 1926.  Since then they have been stagnant.  I think it was stated here that, in the year 1926, some thirteen groups of industries sought to have their applications for tariffs considered by that Commission.  As I pointed out yesterday, only four of them have succeeded in having their applications considered up to this, and it will probably be another ten years, at the present rate of progress, before the last of them will be dealt with.  That is not fair to those who have sunk their money in Irish industries.  I believe that in the majority of cases the Tariff Commission will be compelled to bring in favourable recommendations.</P>
    <P>I instanced the case of the coach-building industry here yesterday. That industry applied for protection in 1926.  It based its application on a situation existing in relation to itself in that year.  It pointed out in its application that the coach-building capacity of the country was up to a certain standard.  It has since declined because of the peculiar method upon which the Government then decided and which has resulted in this amazing delay.  We have the fact that the most efficient and the largest of the coach-building factories which were concerned in that application in the year 1926 are now actually closing down, or are about to close down, and it will probably be another twelve months before the Tariff Commission will think fit to report upon that application.  When they do report, they will have no alternative but to produce a favourable report, but they will then find that the industry they are seeking to foster will have disappeared in the interval that has elapsed since the application for a tariff was made.</P>
    <P>If the Government is irrevocably committed to the method of a Tariff Commission, can they not at least appoint two Tariff Commissions or three Tariff Commissions to deal with the rush of applications which <Col N="1358" /> occurred when the device of setting up a Tariff Commission was first decided upon?  It is not likely that while that method continues there will ever again be thirteen or fourteen applications awaiting consideration at the same time.  The Government should have taken steps to deal with the special circumstances that existed in 1926, and that still exist. They could have appointed two Tariff Commissions or even three Tariff Commissions to deal with all the applications which were then made and which are still pending.  I do not think, as I have said, that it is fair to expect much confidence in Irish industrialists, or to expect the owners of capital in the country to invest their money in Irish enterprise, when the Government, by merely doing nothing, have driven into a state of bankruptcy almost many of the most important industries that we have.</P>
    <P>I remember asking the Minister for Industry and Commerce in this House, shortly after we came into it, if he would consider placing restrictions upon the importation of motor buses while the Tariff Commission were considering the application from the coach-building industry that had been in for more than a year at that time.  Deputies will remember that there was a tremendous influx of that particular class of vehicle into this country at that time.  The motor bus boom had started just then, and everyone that could get a few hundred pounds together was investing in an omnibus. English firms were giving special facilities in the matter of deferred payments in order to increase their output of those buses and their importation into this country.  At that period, the Government should at least have held the balance in favour of Irish industry, but they declined to do so.  To-day we have the position that the country is flooded with omnibuses and the demand for them has practically died away.  Such few orders as there are for buses are going mainly across the water because of the desire of people anxious to purchase a bus to get the whole thing together, body and chassis, instead <Col N="1359" /> of having to import the chassis separately and of getting the body made here.</P>
    <P>That is the case in the coach-building industry, but it is only one case. There are other industries similarly situated.  We think that the Government is deserving of very severe criticism because of the dilatory tacties which they have adopted in relation to these matters.  Whatever the Minister may believe as to the possibility of a change-over in the balance between industry and agriculture in the country, there is no doubt whatever but that such a change could be effected if there was a Government in office that had the right attitude and the right mentality in this matter.  The attitude of the present Minister for Industry and Commerce and the officials of his Department towards Irish industrialists appears to be one of hostility and suspicion.  The representatives of industrial groups who go before them seeking to have action taken to aid them are treated, very largely, as if they were prospective crooks.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, I think, never fails to take advantage of any opportunity afforded him in this Dáil to level criticism, which is very seldom constructive criticism, against those engaged in industry in this country.</P>
    <P>The Minister has asked us how an improvement in the situation is to come about if the steps that have been taken have not brought it about.  There has been an improvement in relation to industries already protected.  I do not accept the Minister's calculation that 50 per cent. of the goods coming into this country are non-taxable.  I think that calculation is 100 per cent. out. Not more than 25 per cent. of the goods imported into this country cannot be produced here, or substituted for by goods produced here.</P>

      <P>Quite economically. It would be a very unprofitable business, I think, to take a copy of the import statistics and go through each item and explain which could <Col N="1360" /> be manufactured here and which substituted for by other articles manufactured here.  The Minister gave the impression he was not very deeply convinced as to the accuracy of his figures.  He informed us that 50 per cent. of the goods coming in were taxable; in other words, to use his own definition, that were capable of being produced here, or substituted for by goods produced here, and of that 50 per cent. only 25 per cent. were taxed.  What about the other 25 per cent.?  We will not fall out with the Government if they get under their pins and get busy in relation to that 25 per cent.  We can do a tremendous amount of good for our people and reduce the statistics in relation to unemployment and emigration if the 25 per cent.  which the Minister admits can be dealt with is attended to.  The Minister, of course, has got this rationalisation bug very badly.  The idea of big business has taken hold of him very strongly.  He appears to think that it is generally a good thing to see some existing industry disappear if, as a result of its disappearance, some other concern would take its place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us who have been thinking about this matter often feel inclined to congratulate ourselves that Ireland did not become largely industrial before an Irish Government was established, because, if it had we would have had reproduced here the situation that exists in industrial areas in England.  I do not think any of us would like to see that situation produced in this country.  We believe it is possible to have efficient industry in this country decentralised; in other words, not grouped into towns, with attendant slums and other evils.  The electric power from the Shannon should help in the decentralisation of industry. The erection of small efficient plants supplying local needs, wherever possible, is preferable to the concentration of production in the hands of one firm situated in some of the larger towns.  The Minister made particular reference to two industries referred to by Deputy Moore which have closed down, the Dundalk Distillery and the Cork <Col N="1361" /> Spinning and Weaving Company.  I do not think he was representing Deputy Moore correctly in relation to these two concerns.</P>

      <P>I can see that, and it is because the Minister did not say that in relation to any particular industry that I asked whether his statement refers to these two or not. Does the Minister consider that the disappearance of an industry is a loss if that loss is not substituted for by another and more efficient concern giving increased employment or producing at a cheaper rate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that when any industry existing in the country disappears that represents a loss unless that loss is made up by some greater good in some other quarter. We have the fact that there are industries disappearing day by day or week by week in this country&mdash;in the flour-milling and coachbuilding industries&mdash;and these have not yet been substituted by more efficient concerns, or any concerns.  The fact that these and other industries are going means that the prospects of producing industrial revival are diminishing.  The vitality of the nation is a limited force, and it is being wasted because the Government is not taking the necessary steps to preserve it.  I can see that steps can be taken to protect it other than by the actual imposition of tariffs.  The Minister on this matter <Col N="1362" /> of tariffs has a peculiar outlook.  He appears to think it is his duty to act merely when the representatives of some industrial group have put up to him a case sufficiently forcible to make it compulsory for him to act.  For instance, Deputy Moore questioned him with reference to the possibility of the present tariffs not being sufficient.  He stated that he would on that point accept the opinion of those engaged in an industry concerned.</P>

The Minister knows that there are in this country a number of industries which would benefit by protection but in respect of which no application would be made by those engaged in them, for those engaged in them fear the effect of protection would be to bring in foreign concerns with greater capital resources and that would put the original persons engaged in the industry out of business.</P>

On the Estimate for the office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce we should not discuss questions of tariff generally.  Deputy Lemass, of course, realises that if he goes into the question of tariffs like this somebody else will also go into it.

      <P>Those engaged in these industries with whom I have been in consultation have expressed the view that they believe the imposition of tariffs would result in the development of their particular industries here, but it would not suit their personal interest to make application. The Minister knows that the terms of the Act make it impossible for any person to apply for a tariff who is not engaged in industry or about to engage in it.  The persons who approached me in reference to these industries were the people employed in them, the representatives of the trade unions in which these men were enrolled.  I wrote to the Minister for Finance asking if he would be prepared to refer to the Tariff Commission an application for a tariff supported only by those employed in the industry, and he replied <Col N="1364" /> that he could not interpret the Tariff Commission Act in a manner which would allow him to do that, and that the application would have to be made by persons representative of the owners and workers.  The owners, however, were not prepared to support an application; the workers who wanted the development of the industries were, and as a result no applications in respect of these industries were made.  I am sure if I waited to think I could mention at least ten different groups of industries in respect of which that applies and in respect of which representations were made to me by those engaged in them.</P>

      <P>I am only giving you the explanation that was offered to me.  With respect to the operation of the Trade Loans Acts, I agree with the Minister that these Acts have exhausted their utility, and I would have been pleased at his statement that it is not intended to continue them beyond next June if he has any better alternative to offer us.  It is quite obvious, however, from what he said that he has no alternative to offer us.  Of course he told us&mdash;it has not been discovered by him alone&mdash;that banks in this country have been unduly restrictive in the matter of assisting industry, and that finance is not the main thing, or even one of the chief things, upon which the development of Irish industries depends.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I cannot see that the Minister is doing any more than attempting to cover up his inability to get a better scheme than that embodied in the Trade Loans Acts.  He will not deny, I think, that there exists among those who control capital in this country a certain timidity about the investment of money in Irish industries which is detrimental to our national interest.  He will not deny that the bulk of the capital created in this country every year goes abroad for investment, except wherever State securities are available, and even when State or semi-State securities are available money cannot be got for them.  But we have, probably, a much higher proportion of our capital invested abroad than have most other countries in the world.  I think that the Minister himself has estimated it at something like £220,000,000.  Certainly it must be in or about that figure if his estimate of the income which is derived from it, and which he takes into consideration when tabulating the invisible exports, is accurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Trade Loans Acts were first introduced into this House because the Government believed, at that time at any rate, that the provision of capital was necessary if those with good industrial propositions were to be enabled to get going, and, secondly, because the Government, as the Minister admitted at that date, believed that the banks were not giving the assistance to Irish industry which the banks in other <Col N="1366" /> countries gave to industries in those countries.  The Minister may have changed his views in relation to the banks, and I do not think it is an extraordinary thing that he should, but I think he has changed them for the worse.  If he had held his attitude of 1924 a little more firmly and had awaited more definite proofs before abandoning it I think he would have come to the conclusion which a very large number of industrialists in this country have arrived at, that the banks here could do a great deal more and should do more to provide the capital which Irish industrialists require.  If we compare the attitude of the banks here to industry with the attitude of the banks in Germany, for example, we will notice a tremendous difference; if we compare the attitude of the banks here with the attitude of the banks in America we will notice that there is a tremendous difference.  There is no doubt whatever that there is available for investment a very large volume of capital which is exported, very largely through the medium of the Irish banks.  These banks exercise a very considerable influence on the owners of that capital, and it is that influence which is used, and probably will for a long time continue to be used, against the interests of an industrial revival here.</P>
    <P>I hoped that the Department of Industry and Commerce, when they decided to abandon the trade loans scheme, would have devised a better scheme which would enable them to take an active instead of a passive part in the development of industry. The criticism of the trade loans scheme which we enunciated here on two or three occasions was that it left the Government playing a purely passive role in relation to Irish in dustry.  The man who had got a good idea, the man who had some natural resources or some particular project to develop, had to overcome a very large number of obstacles before he could avail of that scheme, and the attitude of the Government in relation to him was: &ldquo;Well, you must overcome all these obstacles that we are putting in your way, and if you succeed in doing so, then we may <Col N="1367" /> help you.&rdquo;  It was our view that in the peculiar circumstances that exist in this country the Government should take steps to seek possibilities of development, instead of taking the purely passive attitude that they have adopted.  I believe that if the Government did act in that manner and took such steps, they would have found that there are many avenues of development possible that have not yet been even adequately explored.</P>
    <P>The proposal which the Minister now puts before us is that the officials of his Department will endeavour to segregate the industries in need of capital and having segregated them, will endeavour to interest in such industries those controlling the capital, with the second string that in the case of big propositions he will come to the Dáil and seek to get a subsidy, as in the case of the Carlow beet sugar scheme.  The enunciation of that proposal conveyed to my mind the idea that nothing more is going to be done.  I think that, at any rate, that portion of the Minister's speech indicates very clearly the bankruptcy in initiative of the Department in this matter.  I have no doubt whatever that it should be possible to hammer out a scheme which would place at the disposal of the Government a considerable portion of the capital available for investment and owned by Irishmen, which they could utilise, if they were prepared to do it, in the development of industry here.</P>
    <P>The cynical indifference of the Minister, and of his Department, to the problem of unemployment has continued unchanged during the year.  I spoke briefly upon this matter on the Finance Bill yesterday, when I asked Deputies to endeavour to realise what their attitude would be if, as a result of some great catastrophe&mdash;a flood or an earthquake, or something of that kind&mdash;some 75,000 or 80,000 people were deprived of employment.  They would admit that a national emergency existed which should be dealt with as an emergency, and that very special steps should be taken to provide <Col N="1368" /> that those people would not suffer hardship.  We are glad that there has been no such earthquake or flood as I imagined, but we have 75,000 or 80,000 people without work and suffering that hardship, and we have the Government taking the attitude of pure, absolute indifference towards them.  Their one anxiety appears to be to conceal from Deputies and from the people the magnitude of the problem.  In the course of the by-election in Dublin some months ago the Government Party issued a leaflet in which it endeavoured to prove that there were, in fact, only 6,000 people in Dublin without work.  I do not know if any Deputies in the Cumann na nGaedheal ranks believe that such is the case.  Certainly those who are engaged in the administration of charitable institutions in the city, the officials of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and kindred societies, do not believe it.  A number of these officials have given estimates as to the volume of unemployment, which in some cases exceeds 100,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that is probably an excessive figure.  I do not believe that there are that many unemployed, but I believe that there are that number unemployed and dependents of unemployed.  I have no hesitation in saying that in my constituency one-third of the people are unemployed, or are dependents of unemployed people, and any Deputy who has taken the trouble to examine the conditions that exist here will, I think, have to arrive at the same conclusion.  I know that I am informed by the people when I visit particular parts of my constituency, that the situation is worse now than ever they knew it before, and that it is practically impossible for an able-bodied man to get employment of any kind outside the Corporation and on some of the housing schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it is the policy of the Government in the matter of transport that I wish to deal with specially.  We have a certain transport situation existing which was produced as a result of the legislation which was introduced here in 1924 and since, by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and duly passed.  They have recently imposed an additional tax on omnibuses.  I think they are open to criticism on the ground that the action which they have taken has been spasmodic and inadequate, and I do not think the Minister feels proud of his handiwork.  Certainly he did not give us that impression in the course of his remarks, as he stated there is a general belief that chaos exists in transport, and the blessed word &ldquo;co-ordination&rdquo; is on everyone's lips.  The Minister has assured us that the situation is somewhat better, but is not yet satisfactory. The attitude of the Government appears to be that the chaos must become more chaotic before they will attempt to intervene.  As the Minister put it, the situation is <Col N="1370" /> righting itself, and there does not appear to be any indication that now is the time he should interfere. I think it can be shown that if the Government are contemplating interference in the transport situation at any time, they should act now. It is my belief that instead of the difficulties becoming less with time, they are likely to become greater, and that the Government will yet have occasion to regret the fact that they have not acted at this period&mdash; that is, of course, if they last long enough to regret anything.</P>
    <P>Let us take the railway situation which the Minister dealt with only very casually.  The Railways Amalgamation Act of 1924 was based, I think, on the principle that a standard revenue should be fixed and a schedule of standard charges drawn up from which the Railways Company could hope to secure standard revenue with economical and efficient management.  That Act has been in operation for almost five years.  During that period the net revenue of the Railways Company has undoubtedly increased, but it is still a very considerable way short of the standard revenue which was fixed by the Railway Tribunal.  In 1925 the net receipts of the Railways Company were 40 per cent. of the standard revenue; in 1926 they were 46 per cent; in 1927 they were 64 per cent. and in 1928 74 per cent. Despite the substantial increase indicated by these figures I think it is extremely doubtful if the 26 per cent. remaining to be secured will ever be obtained.  An examination of the railway returns shows that during the same period, 1925 to 1928, the gross receipts have been continuously declining and that the increase in net revenue is due to the fact that reductions effected in expenditure have been more substantial than the reductions in gross receipts. Taking 1925 as the basis year we find the gross receipts decreased by 1.4 per cent. in 1926; 7 per cent. in 1927, and 3.6 per cent in 1928. During the same period expenditure fell by 3.8 per cent. in 1926; 7.9 per cent. in 1927, and 13.5 per cent. in 1928.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1371" /> I do not think that the Railways Company can continue indefinitely to meet decreased revenue by decreased expenditure.  I know that they are attempting to do so and there is now a situation existing in the Inchicore works which may result in a stoppage, as a result of a further effort made to meet the falling revenue by cutting down the cost of the service. The Company has in fact already curtailed expenditure to an extent which, I think, seriously interferes with the efficiency of the concern. At the annual meeting of the proprietors of the Company held on March 8th, the chairman, Sir Walter Nugent, indicated that certain necessary works for the economical working of the concern could not be proceeded with, for lack of funds. The works indicated by him are, the reconstruction of the erecting shops at Inchicore, the standardisation of locomotives, the re-arrangement and grouping of terminals, road transport and hotels.</P>
    <P>He said, of course, that the economies which had already been put into operation had not impaired the efficiency of the service nor imperilled the safety of the line.  The accuracy of that statement is, I think, open to serious doubt.  It would be only expected that a considerable reduction in expenditure would follow amalgamation, but one would naturally look for that reduction in overhead charges, management, supervisory grades, etc., and only to a much lesser extent in the charges for maintenance and renewal of the permanent way and rolling stock, running expenses and similar charges.  In the year 1926-27 the total reduction in expenditure was 4.35 per cent.  Of this total reduction, 31.1 per cent. was achieved on maintenance and renewal work alone.  The reduction in maintenance work between 1925-26 was 98.6 of the total reduction.  In the pre-amalgamation years about 40 per cent. of the total annual expenditure went in the maintenance of the way and stock.  It is worthy of note that when the Great Northern Company <Col N="1372" /> was forced to reorganise its system during the same period the reduction in maintenance and renewal was a much smaller percentage of the total reduction.  It was only 19.8 per cent.  These figures show that the reduction in the expenditure of the Great Southern Railways has been secured by what one might describe as the failure to make proper provision for depreciation.</P>
    <P>When we examine the figures relating to the reduction of staff we get very much the same result.  Since 1925 the total staff of the Great Southern Railways has been decreased by just 2,500.  As I pointed out, one would expect that the bulk of that reduction would be effected in the supervisory grades.  On the contrary, we find that since 1923 the clerical supervisory staff was only reduced by 1.3 per cent. as against a reduction of 26.4 per cent. in the shop and artisan staff.  The total reduction in the same period was 14.4 per cent.  While it would not be possible to state with accuracy how far the uneconomic manner in which railway expenditure has been reduced has affected the efficiency of the concern, it is, nevertheless, apparent that the management have been cutting their costs, not primarily to eliminate waste, but to increase the net receipts by any means for their own immediate benefit. The management of the Great Southern Railways at present is not such as to inspire confidence that the essential public service which they control is in safe hands.  I do not want it to be thought that that is a point of view which I alone hold.  I think I am upheld in that contention by an article contributed by Deputy P.S. Doyle to the &ldquo;Star&rdquo;&mdash;the Star of Eve.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great source of information.  One gets most extraordinary views from Cumann na nGaedheal Deputies.  When asked what, in his opinion, was the main cause which contributed to the decrease in Irish railway receipts <Col N="1373" /> Deputy Doyle unhesitatingly replied, &ldquo;The Irish railway management.&rdquo; The Deputy also proceeded to deal with the matter of the importation of rolling stock material and its effect on employment at Inchicore. As he pointed out, these works are equipped with the most up-to-date machinery for the building of locomotives.  Before 1900 all the requirements of the Great Southern Railways in the matter of rolling stock were met at Inchicore. Since then, particularly in recent years, the rolling stock material which could and should be made there has been imported from Britain with very serious effects on the amount of employment given in the works in Dublin.  I think I can say that from no point of view does the Irish railway management seem all that might be desired.  It will be said that, good or bad, they represent the owners of the railway companies, but I think that the Government has already taken the view that, because of the nature of the service they control, they cannot be allowed to do what they like with their own property.  They have given practical effect to that view by establishing the Railway Tribunal. If the property is badly managed the effects on our trade, industry, and national well-being generally might easily be disastrous. Whatever steps the Government can take to ensure that the working of the railways will be conducive to Irish prosperity, the line they have been following heretofore does not appear to be the right one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decline in the railway receipts has, of course, been due mainly to the decline in the number of passengers carried and even a more substantial reduction in the receipts from passenger traffic, due to the reduction in fares.  With the exception of one item, namely, coal, in 1926&mdash;due to the general strike in England&mdash;all classes of traffic have shown a steady increase, although the latest figures would seem to indicate that that increase has been arrested.  In 1925 the passenger receipts amounted to 34.8 per cent. of the total receipts; in 1926 to 34 per <Col N="1374" /> cent., and in 1927 to 30.5 per cent. That decline is directly due to the great increase which has taken place in that period in road motor vehicles and in the competition from buses. It is that competition which has very largely created the transport problem, as it is called, and as we know it.  If that competition cannot be arrested I think that there is very little prospect that the railways will, for a long time to come, get on to a sound footing, and by that I mean be able to earn the standard revenue fixed by the Railway Tribunal.  If passenger receipts and miscellaneous receipts remain stationary and do not decline further, as they probably will, the goods traffic receipts would have to increase by about 75 per cent. in order to enable the company to earn the standard revenue.  If the passenger receipts continue to fall, a still larger increase in goods receipts will be necessary.</P>
    <P>That is based on the assumption that the company has reached the limit in its policy of reducing expenditure. It appears evident from the Chairman's statement at the annual meeting of the company that some increase in expenditure may be looked for.  If the railways are to be maintained as an economic proposition, some regulation in regard to road transport is required to ensure that it will be directed with a view to helping, rather than injuring, that essential service.  The present motor bus position has been allowed to develop by the Government, either by deliberate design or through lack of foresight.  Their only positive reaction to it was to introduce legislation permitting the railway companies to own and operate motor omnibuses under certain restrictions and to impose the additional tax which was mentioned in the recent Budget statement. There are now some 140 companies, or individual proprietors, operating omnibuses in the Twenty-six Counties. They carry something like 3½ million passengers per month, and their gross monthly receipts are about £50,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce rightly said that it has <Col N="1375" /> probably not yet reached the limit of its development in respect of the area which it serves.  There are still large areas in the country which would be greatly benefited by the extension of the bus services to them.  The service which they are giving in large areas in the country is a very great boon to people.  The railway system of the country was not constructed primarily for the development of Irish trade or the convenience of the Irish people. Anyone who looks at a railway map of the country will notice that a number of lines radiate from Dublin to different centres and that there is no adequate provision made for tapping important districts or for inter-communication in the country.  The deficiency in the railway service is, however, being made up by the motor omnibuses and, in so far as they are doing that, they are of very great use to the people. The fact that the people appreciate the service given to them is indicated by the available statistics relating to the bus traffic.  The fact that they are carrying 3½ million passengers per month indicates that the omnibuses are not altogether the unmixed evil that Deputy Davin and others appear to think they are. The Government, however, appear to be very definitely engaged on a ramp to drive these omnibuses off the roads.  We had the Minister telling us to-day that the tax imposed by the Resolution passed here some weeks ago was not nearly heavy enough, and that the matter of taxation will have to be still further gone into.  The Minister, however, did not give us anything to indicate on what he based that conclusion.  He was just as vague in that respect as the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government were when dealing with the matter during the discussion on the Resolution imposing the tax.</P>
    <P>If the buses are doing more damage to the roads than they are capable of paying for, they are an uneconomic service, and the sooner they are removed the better.  It has not yet been demonstrated that they <Col N="1376" /> are an uneconomic service, or that they are not paying for all the damage they do.  I, personally, do not believe they are, and I would like to see the problem approached in some scientific way, and that we would not be dependent on the guesses of Ministers when they have no data to support them in conclusions which they announce to the House.  The Government, of course, appear to think that it is desirable that the only omnibuses left to ply on the roads should be those owned and controlled by the railways.  So far as they can operate the machinery under their control, they appear to be loading the dice in favour of the railway omnibuses. While the co-ordination of rail and road service is undoubtedly most desirable and, in fact, almost essential for development here, it is by no means certain that that co-ordination can best be secured by giving more complete control over these services to the existing railway management.</P>
    <P>The position is, therefore, that we have the railways apparently inefficiently managed, with continuously declining receipts, and meeting that decline by cutting expenditure in what appears to an outsider to be an uneconomic manner.  We have 140 companies or individual proprietors operating omnibuses engaged in cut-throat and wasteful competition, rendering some service undoubtedly to the travelling public, but at a cost, by way of damage which they do to the roads, which the taxpayers have to meet.  We have the Government without any declared policy, but apparently prepared to operate the legislative machinery in the interests of the railway companies whenever special difficulties arise, and simply hoping that economic forces, which they cannot comprehend, or merely blind chance, will result in the simplification of the problem before public opinion forces them to interfere.  We have also the fact which, to me at any rate, is obvious, that the situation if it develops along the lines which the Government themselves believe it will develop, will become <Col N="1377" /> more difficult rather than easier of solution.</P>
    <P>The Minister will, no doubt, say that this criticism of the Government and of the railway companies is all very fine in its way but that it should be supported by concrete proposals for the improvement of the situation. I do not know what the present position with respect to the Economic Committee is.  It ceased operations after the publication of the report upon flour and wheat and has not yet reassembled.  I do not know if it is intended that it should ever reassemble. If it does meet and whenever it comes to attempt the almost impossible task of completing its terms of reference, by considering this transport situation, there are certain proposals which we would put before it and which we could put forward there in much greater detail than they could be put forward here. Briefly, we think that the time has come when the State should purchase Irish railways&mdash;and I include the Northern Railway&mdash;purchase all the railways which have their headquarters in the Twenty-six Counties and exclude those which have headquarters outside the Twenty-six Counties.  The machinery by which they should be purchased is a matter of detail which could be worked out. That would involve the setting up of some sort of tribunal for the purpose of ascertaining the cash value of the stock in each undertaking, and the payment of stockholders in railway bonds issued by the State for the railway stock held by them and cancelled by the purchaser.  The Oireachtas would have to make provision for a sinking fund for the redemption of railway bonds thus issued.  We believe that there should be established, following the purchase of the railway lines within the country, a national transport board that would be representative of the various interests using the railways and the Government, but that the Government representation on the board should possess certain powers that would prevent a decision being arrived at which would place an undue burden upon the State.  That board would, of course, have the absolute control and <Col N="1378" /> management of the lines acquired. The profits from the working of these lines in any year could be paid into a special fund under the control of the Minister for Finance and out of that fund would be paid the interest on the railway bonds issued, the balance of course, going into the Central Fund for the relief of taxation. It would be necessary to maintain in existence the Railway Tribunal, in something like its present form, for the purpose of fixing standard charges, and on receipt of representations from users of the railway, to order the maintenance of adequate services with respect to particular portions of the line, or the conveyance of goods to and from certain districts.</P>
    <P>That transport board should also have control of the running of bus services on the roads.  The Minister appeared to think that the big difficulty in that connection is the necessity of paying compensation to those who have sunk their money in omnibuses.  In fact, he said the Government could not interfere until the omnibus situation had reached a stage when it resembled the railway situation of 1923.  I think there is very little comparison between the two.  The railways have fixed assets.  They have the lines, the stations, etc., whereas the omnibus companies own only omnibuses. These have a limited life, and I believe very little hardship would be imposed on anybody if it were enacted that after a particular date, let it be one year or eighteen months ahead, the sole right of running public services on the roads would be vested in that transport board, the establishment of which we suggest.  The board would, of course, have to pay compensation or superannuation allowances to railway employees or, to a much lesser extent, to bus company employees who would be rendered redundant by the adoption of these proposals. The State should also acquire and transfer to the control of the board the interest of the shareholders in the Grand Canal Company.  We believe that there should be that unified control of transport by some <Col N="1379" /> institution established by the State, that the transport resources of the country should be owned by the State, and that it should not be left to private enterprise to develop them.</P>
    <P>I think that we in this country need an efficient transport system more than most other countries in the world, because of the fact that we have a very serious industrial problem to face, in order that we may eventually reach that better balance between industry and agriculture that the Minister for Industry and Commerce seems to hope has already been attained.  We cannot possibly get efficient industries established here, and the balance between industry and agriculture properly adjusted without an efficient transport system.  We have not got it yet.  There does not appear to be any indication that we are to get it, or any hope that the lines on which the Government are now going will get it for us.  I think the Government were contemplating the adoption of some such proposal as I have mentioned some time ago themselves.  As far back as 1922 there was a railway commission established by the Provisional Government. It submitted certain recommendations along these lines, and most bodies that have come to the consideration of this problem have, in the meantime, arrived at almost identical conclusions.  I believe if the Government seriously tackle the problem with the idea that they should take an active instead of a passive part, they themselves would arrive at the same conclusions also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In speaking on this Estimate, I need hardly say that I have no intention of voting for the amendment of Deputy Lemass.  I listened very carefully to the speech he delivered, and the only constructive suggestion that came from that rather lengthy but interesting speech was the nationalisation of the railways, which has almost come to be regarded in most countries as an exploded theory which no State, anxious for progress, would endeavour to meddle with.  I would like to say that in listening to the remarks made by the Minister I quite agree that there was no need for him to deal in detail with the activities of his Department when he dealt with them so extensively when this Estimate was before the House last year.  It is well known that the Trade Loans Facilities Act has broken down.  The Minister has come to the important decision that that Act will not be renewed after <Col N="1382" /> a couple of months.  I should like, in considering this Estimate, to say that a survey of the activities of this Department has not shown, in my opinion, that we have progressed as far on the road to industrial prosperity as we might have.  The Minister referred to the tariff imposed in 1925 when we had a tariff imposed on something like £15,000,000 of our imports.  As a result of those activities at that date it was then estimated that we had increased the number of employed in this State from something like 12,000 to 14,000.  I would go a little further and say that a greater number than cause there are quite a number of juveniles employed in the new industries that do not appear in the returns.  We have not yet had the advantage of the development of the Shannon scheme, which may mean great and unlimited possibilities for this country.  That is a thing that we cannot hope to look forward to for some time.  Now that the Trade Loans Facilities Act has broken down, I certainly felt sympathy with Deputy Lemass when he suggested if at all possible something else should be set up to take its place.  I note that last year the Minister for Industry and Commerce informed the House that thirty-five Advisory Committees had been set up.  I waited to hear what definite result, if any, there had been from the establishment of these committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that the Minister had nothing tangible to offer the House as a result of this particular activity. Last year the Minister informed us that they had established foreign contacts.  I would like the Minister to say what is the result of the establishment of these foreign contacts.  I also understand that last year visits were to be made to principal towns outside to tap industrial and technical information.  I would also like to hear from the Minister if as a result of these visits anything valuable has emerged to this State, if any particular benefits have accrued as a result of these activities and if no benefits have actually accrued is there <Col N="1383" /> any possibility that in the near future some will.  I for one am not a pessimist as far as the future of this State is concerned.  I believe that the economic resources of this State compare very favourably with the economic resources of many other small States in Europe which have been eminently successful.  If one considers for a moment that the area of this Free State, with its highly fertile land, is equal to the combined areas of Belgium and Denmark one can see at a glance that we have powerful assets if we can only succeed in developing them.  Consideration of the trade reports issued in 1927 shows the Saorstát exports to England and Northern Ireland are something like £43,000,000.  Denmark at the same time exported to England which is reputed to be our best customer £49,977,000, almost £50,000,000.  While the Free State bought something like £45,000,000 worth in return, Denmark only bought ten and a half million pounds worth.  So far as we are concerned our best customer there appears to be somewhat of a misnomer.  It resulted as far as the net operation is concerned to this State in two and a quarter millions profit to England, while in the case of Denmark it resulted on the face of the figures in a net gain of £39,000,000.  These figures to a State like ours, similar in many respects to Denmark, and superior in many respects, call in my opinion for the earnest consideration of this House and especially for the earnest consideration of the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>The Minister laid before the House figures as to the volume of employment that had accrued in the past year.  I have already adverted to the fact that in 1925 the figures were almost similar.  So that looking at the figures presented to-day we cannot congratulate ourselves upon having materially increased in the past twelve months the number of hands employed in the Irish Free State.  When one considers that within a few short years Belgium to which I referred the other day, after <Col N="1384" /> being practically destroyed, has no unemployment problem and was able to take on 10,000 additional hands from outside to cope with her industrial activities one is forced to the conclusion that the amount of progress made in this country industrially is nothing like as favourable as the amount of progress that has been made by our smaller competitors elsewhere.  It is up to us to ask why we are being out-distanced in the race for a share of the industry that is available.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce referred to the banking system of this country.  He went so far as to say that in his experience he could not come to the conclusion that the banking system of this country was acting unfavourably as far as the development of industry in the Saorstát was concerned.  I think the Minister might have gone a little further than that and said that as far as the banking system of this country is concerned it offered little or no inducement to the development of industrial enterprise. If one considers the banking system in Belgium and the other institutions that act in co-operation with that system one can readily visualise why industrial Belgium is leaving us behind in the race.  If one looks at the iron of Belgium one sees that all the iron ore is imported from outside and that 80 per cent. of the manufactured products of that industry are sent abroad.  If these things are possible in Belgium surely in some small measure or other they are equally possible here.  It is my opinion that the banking system of this country, as it now exists, militates very adversely against the development of trade and industry here.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by Deputy Lemass to capital invested outside this country.  He suggested to the Minister that there should be some prohibition of that outside investment. I wonder did Deputy Lemass ever give any consideration to what is going on outside the shores of this little island of ours.  Before the war Belgium had something like 700,000,000 francs invested abroad, <Col N="1385" /> and these 700,000,000 francs were invested in transport systems, which appear to us in this country to be absolutely bad stock.  Belgium is interested in the transport systems of Turkey, Spain, Egypt, Italy, and even in South America, and every one of these systems is a customer of the great iron industry of Belgium.</P>
    <P>In considering the position of industry in this country one must take into consideration the cost that had to be faced in this country of the civil war.  But that period is past, and I suggest to the Department of Industry and Commerce that some forward step in the development of industry is necessary if this country is to make any progress at all.</P>
    <P>I very often hear the statement made that Irish industries are inefficient. I have no doubt that Irish industries are inefficient, and in a country like ours, which has emerged from centuries of English misrule how can one expect anything else than that inefficiency will exist in Irish industries?  At the same time, there is one thing upon which I would lay emphasis: Let our industries be inefficient or otherwise, it is out of these materials that the future industrial progress of this State has to be evolved; it is out of these inefficient industries that the industrial rehabilitation of this country has got to be brought about. I am of opinion that that is no impossible task if it be tackled in the proper way.  But when I hear sometimes, as I frequently hear in this House, the phrase that we are bolstering up Irish inefficiency, I always feel as a business man that that is a phrase that should be dropped from any references made in this House.  I remember many years ago reading, when I was a schoolboy, how the inefficient shipyards of Russia were started.  I remember reading a few days ago how the great Japanese cotton-spinning industry was started.  Within the lifetime of any man in this House, the cotton industry in Japan hardly existed.  Agents came over from Japan and bought up the obsolete machinery belonging to the Lancashire <Col N="1386" /> manufacturers.  They brought over Lancashire operatives to Japan to teach the Japanese the trade, and they were so inefficient that if they did not protect the home market they would have had no home trade at all.  To-day the resources of the Japanese cotton-spinning industry in the ordinary companies stand at 60 per cent., and in the case of the combine at 100 per cent. of the paid-up capital.  I merely refer to the Japanese cotton-spinning industry to show what has been done in a very short time in other countries, and what can be done in this country provided we set about it in the right way.</P>

      <P>There is a great demand at present in this country, as was shown in the course of the debate on the woollen tariff, for a very cheap and inferior cloth.  Deputy Anthony, I think it was, asked why we should not endeavour to cope with that demand and to manufacture that cloth for ourselves.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in the course of his speech, asked the House to give him some instances of where State intervention could have operated to the advantage of industry in this country.  I should like to inform the Minister that a very honest and valuable attempt has been made by a manufacturer in Dublin, who sent his two sons to Galashiels in order to learn the technique of the woollen trade, and set up an industry in Dublin, investing capital amounting to £25,000.  The machinery was installed, and when the exemption under the woollen tariff on cloth entering the Saorstát was fixed at 1/6, orders for something like 14,000 yards had been booked.  But when the exemption was changed from 1/6 to 2/6 per square yard, which is equivalent to something like 4/- per trade yard, and such cloth was admitted duty free, that meant that this unfortunate manufacturer, who had invested £25,000 in these woollen mills, might as well have <Col N="1387" /> taken his money and thrown it into the sea.</P>

An agreement was reached; certain things were arranged that were to be carried out, which I have no intention of refering to, and, without a moment's notice, these agreements were broken, and the alteration, which <Col N="1389" /> had been recommended by the Tariff Commission as far as this particular industry was concerned, means that unless something can now be done at the eleventh hour&mdash;I do not see any cause for levity in this House when a Deputy takes up the task of dealing with an industry involving £25,000; I see no cause for levity on the part of any Deputy&mdash;unless this thing is taken up definitely now, and something done for this particular little industry in the City of Dublin, this £25,000 is lost money, and if that is going to be the State action, as far the Department of Industry and Commerce is concerned, then God help the future progress of industry in this country.  The Minister, in the course of his speech, admitted that the Trade Loans (Facilities) Acts had broken down, and Deputy Lemass suggested that they should have been replaced by some machinery of another kind.  I said already that I was in sympathy with that particular aspect of the case from Deputy Lemass's point of view. I have referred here briefly to what has been done in a very short time in Belgium.  I would like to point out that at the present time we have 46 engineering firms in this State. The bulk of these 46 engineering firms are only working part time. Their financial backing is exceedingly small; their overhead expenses are exceedingly high and they are working against Belgian rivals who have 350,000,000 francs of organised capital behind them to help them to carry on their industries.  I referred to this engineering industry just as a casual example and as a case in point.  How can this industry be put upon its feet facing financial rivals like those to whom I have referred when the output by these 46 engineering firms is only £324,000 and imports from abroad amount to £500,000?  How can overhead charges be brought down to a level which will enable them to compete with their foreign rivals?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister last year asked two important questions.  He asked should large sums be made available under the Trade Loans (Facilities) <Col N="1390" /> Act.  We now know that the Trade Loans (Facilities) Acts will in a short time be a thing of the past.  These Acts have failed and if industrial regeneration is to take place in this country I suggest the Government will have to go a little further on the road they have already gone.  The question was asked in this House was there any solution of the problem as it now stands.  I suggest that before the industry of this country can ever hope to make any progress at all there must be, first, reconstruction of the existing industries and consolidation of uneconomic units into economic units.  These 46 scattered units of the Irish engineering trade can never hope to make progress situated as they are at present; they must be welded into an economic commercial unit before they can hope to progress.</P>
    <P>In other countries they have certain organisations to bring about these things.  We have a precedent here in this country on very sound lines in the great agricultural industry. We have set up this new Agricultural Credit Corporation for agriculture, and I say it is imperative that something on similar lines should operate on behalf of industry in this country if ever industrial regeneration is to take place.</P>
    <P>If I might for a moment briefly refer to the Belgian National Industrial Society I would suggest that a similar society, set up and operated in this State, would be of the utmost possible benefit to the trade and industry of this country.</P>
    <P>The Belgian Industrial National Society was established in 1919.  It has run successfully for the benefit of Belgian industry and commercial enterprise and it carries out everything likely to encourage Belgian enterprise.  It provides finance and affords long term credits.  It affords even credit for investments abroad, credits for export, for firms operating abroad and it finances reconstruction, and it even makes small grants to other people.  I have said in regard to our industry that the first problem we have here is reconstruction.  If Irish industry is to be reconstructed <Col N="1391" /> what weapon has the country in its hands to effect that reconstruction? Over in Belgium they have Boards of Directors, and the first Board of Directors of the Belgian National Industrial Society was nominated by the Government. That Board issued certain bonds, fixed the rate of interest, and the conditions of issue in agreement with the Government and an auditor was appointed by the Government to watch over the Company's operations. If we could establish in this country a similar society to the Belgian National Industrial Societies then the first step would have been taken for the rehabilitation of industry in this country.  As things now stand industry is so scattered and dismembered and there is so little cohesion amongst its various branches that it cannot possibly make any progress.</P>
    <P>I was struck during the war by the fact that Sir Howard Grubbs' old-established scientific factory in Rathmines disappeared from this country. And why?  It disappeared for the simple reason that, if report speaks true, it was a company that invented the apparatus that enabled ships to discover submarines beneath the sea and, therefore, it was an industry suitable for our great rivals across the Channel, and naturally and automatically it disappeared.  All these things will continue to go on in this country unless active steps are taken by the Department of Industry and Commerce to prevent them.</P>
    <P>I would like for a moment to refer to the question of transport.  The Minister dealt with the transport question, but he dealt with the internal transport question, and there has never been the slightest reference to dealing in the near future with the question of external transport.  In this House some time ago I referred to the possibility of the Minister's Department beginning to face the problem of establishing a mercantile marine.  I made certain statements then, and one of the statements was that all the Irish carrying companies in this country had automatically disappeared <Col N="1392" /> and become the property of an English combine, and I said that over £105,000,000 per annum was carried by English ships and not a pennyworth in Irish bottoms.  I have to offer an apology to the House for making that statement.  I have here a letter from Messrs. Palgrave, Murphy, Ltd., pointing out that my statement was not correct.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have been directed to write you in connection with an inaccuracy in a statement made by you in Dáil Eireann on 27th May this year, when you were speaking in the debate on Mr. O'Hanlon's motion re cattle shipments.  You stated that &lsquo;The Palgrave, Murphy Company and the Michael Murphy Company had gone under the control and management of the British combine, and they are to all intents and purposes English companies.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Palgrave, Murphy, Ltd., have no connection whatsoever with any British combine or with Messrs. Michael Murphy, Ltd., and unless in so far as they act in the simple capacity as agents to certain lines they have no connection with any other company whatever.  I should mention that they are managers for the Dublin and Silloth Steamship Company, Ltd., which is a purely Irish concern.  Palgrave, Murphy Ltd., are a Free State company registered in the Free State, and all the company's income is subject to the Free State only, and assessments of income tax are paid to the Irish Free State Government only.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am directed to express the hope that you will take an opportunity of putting this matter right at an early date.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am very glad to find that there are still two Irish carrying companies left plying their trade, and that they are still outside the tentacles of the British combine.</P>
    <P>Since reference was made in this House to the need for establishing a mercantile marine in this country, a very eloquent plea in furtherance of that particular object has been made <Col N="1393" /> by the Most Rev. Dr. McRory, Archbishop of Armagh.  Speaking at Dundalk, his Grace said: &ldquo;I am sorry to think that your fine town has not as free a circulation of money as it used to have some time ago.  I understand you lost some industries; I know you lost the local steampacket company, a thing for which I was exceedingly sorry.  I think it is a tremendous loss, and that this matter of a mercantile marine is a matter that Ireland will have to take in hand.  Four or five hundred years ago Ireland had a considerable mercantile marine. Her ships lay in large numbers along the coasts of Belgium and France, and she did a big trade with France, Belgium, Spain and Portugal in those days.  Things will never be right in this country until we have an Irish-owned mercantile marine.  I hope those who can do something in that direction will take steps towards that end as soon and as vigorously as possible.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think the great problems that lie before this country should be given the due consideration to which they are undoubtedly entitled.  The transport question should be tackled in a whole-hearted way.  One listens in the House from time to time to a discussion on bus fares and the dimensions of buses, but when one gets up to speak upon the broader problems one is faced with cynical smiles and it makes one feel that if such a spirit is manifested in this House, then there is little hope for the development of industry.  At the present moment we have a revolution in our transport system owing to omnibus traffic being introduced all over the country.  I think it is no exaggeration to say that as far as the transport system of the country is concerned we are no great distance from a condition of chaos.  We have at the present time the railways operating omnibus services in direct competition with their own main lines.  The railways of the State are undoubtedly a national asset and their loss would be a loss from which probably this country would never <Col N="1394" /> recover.  The sooner the whole question of transport is tackled in a thorough fashion the better it will be for the interests of this State.  The railways pay in wages alone something like £60,000 a week; they employ some 18,000 workers and something like £5,500,000 is put up in other ways, while they pay in rates £203,000.  If the present serious financial position of the railways is maintained, what will be the inevitable consequence?  There can be only one result and that will be the wiping out of the railways.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister said he could visualise the day when the railways would possibly control the road services in this State.  I wonder is the Minister still of that opinion? If he is, will he take any steps to deal with this matter in a thorough and workmanlike fashion?  We have here two or three systems, one working in wasteful competition with the other.  That wasteful competition is not in the interests of the State. What it means is that we have two relatively inefficient services and what the State really wants is one efficient service and not two inefficient ones.  They are tackling those problems across the Channel.  If one sees what is going on in other places one must ask the question here: when are we going to get on this job?  Gloucester Corporation, for instance, has substituted on one portion of its system omnibuses for tramcars.  Lincoln and Worcester have done away with tramcars. Oxford and Cambridge have replaced trams by motor buses.  In parts of Scotland there is a rail and motor combine whose capital is over a million pounds.</P>
    <P>The whole question of transport in this country is in the melting pot, and the sooner it is tackled in a broad, comprehensive way the better it will be for this State.  I think the time I have spent in drawing the attention of this House to what other countries are doing is time well spent.  Although these other countries may not be put down on the Estimates before the House, comparison with them is of the greatest possible importance to the development <Col N="1395" /> of this State, for this State has got to face the competition of other countries if it is to get on and continue to live as an economic unit. If that competition is to be faced, our industry will have to be reorganised upon a scientific basis the same as in other countries.  I say it is not impossible for this country to be put upon its feet, and for the industries of this country, which are in a decaying state, to be put upon their feet.  I remember hearing, when the Belgian refugees were in the City of Dublin, that efforts were being made in certain portions of Dublin in the matter of glass manufacture. These efforts never culminated in success.  Why?  Because the Belgians went away.  If the Belgians were here that glass industry could be started; but there is no initiative, no progress, and no scientific tackling of problems here, and until we endeavour to act in this way, as other countries have already acted, I say there will be no industrial progress for this State. I could give many instances of trade leaving this country.  I remember the Irish cycle trade at one time employed 600 hands.  That trade disappeared, and a short time ago something like £25,000 worth of the finest machinery was sold as scrap in Dublin.  When one brings those things to the notice of certain Deputies in this House there appears a cynical smile on their faces.  I must say their intelligence is equal to their countenances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Clery Mr. Clery">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am bringing this case to the notice of all the Deputies in this House, because I am one of those who believe that without the co-operation of all parties in the State, the Labour Party, the Deputies on the opposite benches and the Deputies of my own Party, we cannot restore Irish industry to the level which, in my opinion, it is justly entitled to occupy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to bring <Col N="1396" /> some matters under the notice of the House, and of course under the notice of the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  The chief matter is one which is concerned with that section of his Department which deals with factory inspection and the administration of the factory laws.  On a recent occasion in Cork we had a complaint of the absence from the city for very long periods of one class of factory inspector, whether the chief factory inspector or his assistant I cannot say.  There are one or two incidents which I consider serious enough to bring under the notice of the House, and I will just briefly deal with them.  In one case a docker was injured by the fall of a coal bucket.  When the factory inspector was rung up on the telephone in order to get him to come along and inspect the machinery on the ship on which the accident occurred, the inspector could not be found.  Application was then made to the local manager of the Labour Exchange, a very efficient and courteous officer.  The manager of the Labour Exchange did not know anything of the whereabouts of the factory inspector.  It was found on subsequent examination that the machinery on that ship was defective.</P>
      <P>Later on another instance occurred, and in that case the accident resulted in the death of the docker.  In this case something of a heavy weight fell on the docker and killed him.  Again the factory inspector was sought, and again he was found to be absent.  In a city of the importance of Cork, the second city in the Saorstát, it is a remarkable thing that such a thing as this should take place.  We have had comments from the coroner, who suggested that as these accidents were becoming rather numerous in Cork of late, that greater supervision should be exercised through the factory inspectors and others so that the machinery which those men have to work would be in proper working order, and that it should comply with the conditions laid down by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This now is the point that I want <Col N="1397" /> to emphasise&mdash;here we have evidence of defective machinery to which was attributable the death of this docker. There was no inquiry and no prosecution. I have heard some comments made quite recently by the Minister for Industry and Commerce with regard to what the Minister describes, or at least what I inferred, as malingering on the part of some of those workers on the Shannon scheme.  If the inspection of machinery and plant on the Shannon scheme is anything like what it has been in Cork, I am very much surprised that we have not had more casualties on the Shannon scheme than we have had already.  A comparison was made by the Minister as to the proportion of person lying up and claiming compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Acts, and that comparison was made with other countries.  I would like that the Minister would examine the system of factory inspection in England, for instance, where inspection is of a very close character, and where regular inspection is made of all machinery whether that machinery is situated on the docks, in the workshops, or in the factories.  I think that on examination it will be found that we have a lot to learn, a great deal to learn, indeed, from those other places, and I rather think it will be a good job indeed if we emulate the example of our neighbours across the Channel.  Then, I feel that the number of those accidents which are happening amongst our workers at present would be largely reduced, if not altogether obviated.</P>
    <P>We had no later than this evening a conflict of opinion between the Minister and Deputy Lemass in so far as unemployment figures were concerned as they related to Dublin. I think the figure of 100,000 was mentioned by Deputy Lemass as the number of unemployed.  That was challenged by the Minister.  I am not going to suggest that Deputy Lemass was right or that he was wrong, but in the census of 1926 various questions were asked.  Since then we have had returns from the census. At least we have, as a result of these census returns, got very informative <Col N="1398" /> pamphlets or leaflets from the Department. These have been mainly concerned with the census of religious, the census of various industries, and sub-heads relating to industries and so on.  At the period when these returns were sought and when the papers were filled in, there was a special column for the unemployed, and that was also filled in. Up to the present we have not got any figures from the Department of Industry and Commerce as to the number of unemployed.  I cannot understand how it is that from time to time statements are made here as to the number of unemployed in Dublin, Cork, or elsewhere, and that we do not get the information contained in the last census returns on this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand why this information should be kept from the House.  I have on occasion suggested that the figures given in the Official Returns from time to time are not at all accurate or reliable.  For instance it has been stated on occasion that the number of unemployed in Cork was 5,000 or 6,000 or something like that.  I can readily prove that the number would be double the figures given for the reasons that I have stated here already.  The principal reason is that the Department gets its figures from the Unemployment Exchanges.  But the moment a man is out of unemployment benefit in the Unemployment Exchanges he ceases to register there, and the only figures you get from the Department are the figures of those registered at the Exchanges and receiving unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be safely calculated that there are at least as many more people unemployed who are receiving no unemployment benefit as there are receiving unemployment benefit.  That is understanding the case.  I respectfully ask for inrespect. I will also ask further information from the Minister, in view of the fact that the international conference is now sitting <Col N="1399" /> at Geneva.  I want to know what is the general attitude of the Saorstát Government towards legislation making towards the safeguarding of life and limb.  I want to know their attitude on that point in particular. I ask that because I have some vague idea of what it is, but I want to know definitely what is their attitude because it would be lamentable, indeed, if their attitude was not to tighten up by every means in their power the avenues of escape for certain people who compel their workers to work under conditions which have been in other countries prohibited by legislation. It would be lamentable if we could not make better use of our existing legislation.  I would like an expression from the Minister on that point, as to our future attitude in relation to the safeguarding of life and limb, particularly so far as it concerns the workers on our docks, men amongst whom, as the Minister must know, there is a very large percentage of accidents.  Again, I want to direct his attention to the fact which I mentioned at first: that on these occasions, when it was absolutely essential that a factory inspector should be present in the city of Cork, his whereabouts were practically unknown when he was inquired for at his headquarters. I do know unofficially that the factory inspectors have to leave the city.  It is quite possible that there are not enough of them there, but still the fact remains that in Cork on this occasion, when life and limb were in danger and when at least one docker was killed, there was no factory inspector there to examine the machinery.  The charge is there and can easily be proved, that the machinery was defective.  I am not going to suggest for one moment, though I could very easily do so if I wished, that if the life of some other citizen, and not the life of a humble docker was at stake, action would have been taken and that very quickly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCarney" hpid="Mr. Carney Mr. Carney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>In listening to the speech of Deputy J. J. Byrne, one <Col N="1400" /> would imagine that the Deputy was the discoverer of all the different points that have been made in connection with this Vote; that he had discovered those points himself off his own bat, and that when he had put them up all he could get were melodramatic, cynical sneers from Députies.  He did not specify particular Deputies.  There is one thing he seems to have realised, and it is this: that when these points were put up in connection with industry, they were met with cynical sneers.  I am glad that he has discovered that, like Rip Van Winkle, he has wakened up and made a discovery. These matters were put up here before.  I will give some typical examples to show that they are not new discoveries on the part of Deputy J. J. Byrne.  It is over a year now since I brought up the matter of the Mountcharles freestone quarries before the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the form of question and otherwise.  The Minister assured me that, if it lay in his power, the matter would get the most sympathetic consideration. In one connection he said that he was not able to force private firms to employ Mountcharles stone in their buildings.  Some time ago a building was erected in Dublin.  I was reading &ldquo;Honesty&rdquo; last week &mdash;as I cannot follow all the ramifications of the little stunts of the Ministry, I have to depend sometimes on the newspapers&mdash;and discovered that Portland stone was used in a building recently erected in Dublin.  When I brought the matter of the Mountcharles freestone quarries before the Minister, he pretended to have the utmost sympathy for the people there who should be employed in the quarries, but who are not employed.  They are merely living from hand to mouth.  In former years there were upwards of 300 people employed in those quarries, while at present you have not perhaps quite a dozen employed there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago I understand, although I had no official intimation from the Minister&mdash;probably I was <Col N="1401" /> too humble a subject to have any notification of it&mdash;two men from the Minister's Department, probably from the Geological Survey section of it, went down to Mountcharles. What they thought about Mountcharles stone I do not know, as I never heard.  The fact remains, however, that some of the principal buildings in this country, some buildings not twenty yards away from this Chamber, were built of Mountcharles stone, and they seem to have stood the test of time pretty well.  I do not see why the Minister or any Government Department should have buildings erected with Portland stone out of moneys that come out of the public purse.  It does not seem fair to me that people should be asked to pay and pay, and that when they expect something in return for all the money they have paid, that their money should be sent away to keep the convicts of England employed in quarrying Portland stone.  It means this, that not alone have we to keep a convict element in our own country, but we are helping to keep the convict element of England as well, and for that purpose we are using money that we take out of the pockets of the Irish people.  We are doing that in order to help the English people to support their convicts.  I would like the Minister to explain that away when he is making his reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">

    <Speaker pid="FrankCarney" hpid="Mr. Carney Mr. Carney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carney</NameTxt>
      <P>We have other stone, too, in Donegal.  If I were to go along any of the principal streets in any of the principal cities in the Saorstát, I would discover that they are getting their granite paving sets from Aberdeen.  They are paving their streets with these imported <Col N="1402" /> granite sets.  We can supply the same class of paving sets from the peninsula of Fanad, or from any part of Donegal.  Formerly a great many people in that area were employed in the making of those granite sets; and yet in face of that we must support Scotsmen and send our money across to Aberdeen for these paving sets.  I am not quite satisfied that any serious effort has been made by the Department to have a proper geological survey of the country carried out: nor am I satisfied that the Minister has made any attempt to revive the industries which have already collapsed in the country.  I am not satisfied that the people who might be inclined to invest money in certain industries have all the information which should be put at their disposal by the Minister.  For example, in this country in former years we had a big trade in the smelting of iron ore. That was in the time when iron ore was smelted by the charcoal process. Perhaps it was a very crude way of doing it; but not only were we able to supply our internal needs, but we had a large export trade as well.  Of course the old process is quite obsolete. With the exception, perhaps, of the jungles in Africa, iron ore is not now smelted with charcoal. In the Arigna coalfields you have iron and coal together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the Minister has done all that he should have done to ascertain the actual amount of our coal and iron resources, and of putting that information at the disposal of any people who might be inclined to avail of it.  I am not satisfied, either, that the Minister has any control whatever over that section of his Department that is responsible for the geological survey, nor am I satisfied that they have done their job.  I am not satisfied that all the iron that we have in the Arigna coalfields, from Sligo to Leitrim, and to Slieveanérin in the County Cavan, has been mapped out.  I am not satisfied that those mines in the Arigna coalfield have got the assistance they should have.  I remember that Deputy Reynolds last <Col N="1403" /> year asked that a little road should be made from one of the coal pits to the main road.  He spoke strongly on that matter, but, of course, what he asked for was refused.  It is beside the point that Deputy Reynolds afterwards voted for the Government, but the fact remains that the little road asked for out of one of the coalmines was refused.  I am not satisfied that that is helping industry in this country.</P>
    <P>Another industry which we had some years ago has collapsed.  That was the manufacture of calcium carbide, which depends in its principles on coal, limestone, and electricity.  In view of the development of the Shannon scheme the Minister might with profit look into this matter of the calcium-carbide industry.  Somewhere in Sligo we had that industry, where you have coal and limestone. You have to go no distance for the things that are necessary for the manufacture of it, and now, when the Minister will be looking for a heavy industrial load for his Shannon scheme, is the time to find out any industry in which we could use electricity, and it should be given all the encouragement possible.  At present, the manufacture of calcium-carbide is practically confined to countries like Switzerland and Norway, where they have cheap electric power.  They have hydroelectric schemes there and they are not placed in the same position as we are.  Norway imports her coal from England.  It can afford to import coal from Newcastle and manufacture calcium-carbide and export it to South America at a profit.  Here, although there are large deposits of anthracite coal, semi-bituminous, and with all the limestone and electric power, still we have no factory for the manufacture of calcium-carbide. Another industry which is connected with the manufacture of calcium-carbide is an artificial fertiliser, cyanimide.  That is only one of many others associated with the manufacture of calcium-carbide.  That is practically confined to Norway.  We here could manufacture that more <Col N="1404" /> easily than they do it in Norway, and we are not doing it.</P>

      <P>The Minister might as well ask why we had not done the things in the past that we are trying to do now.  That is nonsense. The Minister might as well ask me why it is we have not a mercantile marine.  He might as well ask me why there are not Irishmen prepared to put money into boats considering we pay as much for sending our produce to Liverpool as they do from Buenos Aires or Australia.  It costs from £4 10s. to £8 to send produce from the interior of Ireland to Manchester, Liverpool or London, and you will get the same produce sent at from 18/- to £4 from Sydney and Buenos Aires, for instance.  Bacon can be sent cheaper from Australia via Canada than we can send it to Liverpool.  The Minister might as well ask me why we have not done that.  The Minister should make an attempt to set about doing it now.  It might have been our fault that these things were not done in the past, but it does not follow because they were not done in the past that they should not be done now or in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another industry to which the Minister might with profit turn his attention is the manufacture of cement.  Some might say that that could not be done in this country, or the Minister might say if it were possible to do it and make it at a profit why is there not somebody doing it.  That is more of the melodramatic sneering to which our friend Deputy Byrne referred.  I would like to point out to the Minister that in the Six Counties&mdash;I will not refer to <Col N="1405" /> them as Northern Ireland as we do not, as the Minister knows, do that up there as a rule&mdash;you have a firm manufacturing cement at Magheramorne. It can defy competition with any cement works in the world.  At present, they are using it in the extension of the harbour at Derry.  If they can do that at Magheramorne I do not see why we should not be able to do it here.  If the Minister would only send his geological experts to find out all the deposits of limestone and so on we have in this country, perhaps somebody might start the manufacture of cement, and the Minister might give them assistance if he thought it worth while.</P>
    <P>Another industry that has fallen through of recent years is the manufacture of talc or soap stone, which was carried out along the coast and in the interior of County Donegal. It gave some employment which could be extended.  There are quite a number of purposes for which talc or soap stone could be used.  At present we import quite a lot from the United States.  It costs about 1/- a tin, and the same material could quite easily be made in this country. There are huge deposits of gypsum in this country.  I think last year it was discovered that there were very large deposits in the County Monaghan.  I believe a company started there to exploit it.  I am wondering if the Minister has made any attempt to find out if there are any other deposits in the country, and if he has made any attempt to give any assistance to those who would be likely to come along and exploit these deposits.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I wish to refer.  I do not know whether the Minister has made any inquiries into the possibility of manufacturing industrial alcohol in this country.  I read last week, or the week before, that in areas around Cooley we used to get very good potatoes, but they developed black scab, and the place was isolated.  They made a pale around Cooley.  I think that in areas where it is impossible practically to get a <Col N="1406" /> decent market or a decent price for our surplus potatoes, and in places like Cooley where the people are not allowed to send their potatoes for sale outside their own area, that if there were an industry established for the manufacture of industrial alcohol from potatoes, the same as is done in Germany, we could utilise all the small potatoes and the half-bad potatoes for which we could not get a sale in the manufacture of industrial alcohol.  There is always a ready market for that, especially for de-natured alcohol, and the manufacture of viscose and artificial silk products.  Of course there is always a market for alcohol in any shape or form.  But the Minister might with profit turn his eyes to the possibilities of this industry, an industry which has never existed here.  If it were established it might be the means of creating quite a number of subsidiary industries of a kind which this country knows practically nothing about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity of doing so in some fashion.  What I have to say will be very brief.  In the operation of the Shannon scheme certain lands were acquired three years ago, and the people who owned these lands have not been able to make use of them since then.  Rates and annuities have been paid on them, without any compensation in any form, while the interest in the land and that sort of thing has passed out of the hands of these people.  Three years ago some of these people were served with notices by the Chief State Solicitor informing them that their cases were cases for arbitration. <Col N="1408" /> Up to the present time no arbitration has taken place.  The Minister told us the other day that it was not for him to appoint an arbitrator, and that it was not for him to suggest arbitration; it was for these people themselves.  These people have suffered very severe loss because of the taking over of their lands.  Surely three years was sufficient time for some agreement to be come to by bargaining?  The Minister said that he hoped that agreements would be reached in all these cases by bargaining.  Some of these people say that the officers of the Minister's Department have told them that some of these cases are cases for arbitration, and cannot be dealt with by bargaining.  That is a very specific statement.  If they cannot be dealt with by bargaining, why is not the machinery of arbitration put into operation so that compensation could be fixed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister took great pleasure this evening in contrasting the amount of wealth got from agriculture and the amount of wealth got from industry, and he contrasted agriculture and industry in the main. It would be interesting to know if we could contrast the values that have been put upon some of these lands by the valuers of his Department with the values that have been put upon similar lands by the Irish Land Commission.  It would be readily conceded, I think, that some of those lands acquired for the Shannon scheme were in commission up to the time that they were acquired, and I think it would also be readily conceded that some of the ranches acquired by the Land Commission were more or less in the nature of wildernesses, and could not be said to be in commission up to the date on which they were acquired by the Land Commission.  I am credibly informed that the values put upon lands acquired by the Land Commission in most of these cases are a good deal higher than the values put by the Minister's valuers on the lands acquired for the Shannon scheme.  That comparison might also be profitably <Col N="1409" /> made by the Minister.  If the Minister's valuers have placed values upon these lands, why should the Minister not relieve the losses that these people have been suffering for the last three or four years?  Why not place to their credit these amounts?  Surely they are entitled to some consideration, and the Department should not deprive them of this money?  Surely the valuations have been made, and something might be done in the matter of giving them credit?  As I said, I want a definite statement from the Minister; something which will clear up the situation; something which will let these people know what they are very anxious to know. They have written to me and have seen me on several occasions, and I want to give the Minister an opportunity to give this information.  I am sorry that he was so anxious to prevent me from stating the position.</P>
    <P>I also want to raise the hardy annual of unemployment insurance benefit.  The Minister always tells us that certain people are not unemployed according to the Act.  I have raised this several times.  I have asked the Minister if he was prepared to consider the position of roadworkers who have to pay unemployment insurance contributions. A certain amount is deducted from their wages weekly, and yet when they are unemployed the Minister's officers say that they are not unemployed within the meaning of the Act.</P>

      <P>Well, I am not going to sit down on account of that; I am going to talk about something else.  This attempt to move the closure on me in a polite fashion is not going to succeed.  Deputy Carney told us something about what the Minister might do in the matter of getting cement manufactured in this country.  I think representations have been made to his Department with regard to certain deposits which could very profitably be used, thereby creating an industry, if his Department made certain advances in the matter.  I have made inquiries, and I find that representations that have been made to his Department have not been given what one might call very serious consideration, and that his Department has not made the necessary investigations to find out whether these deposits could be utilised in the manufacture of cement or not.  I suggest that he ought to make the necessary inquiries and that he ought to give this information to the people who were endeavouring to exploit those deposits, in the interests of the community and of the unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKilroy" hpid="Mr. Kilroy Mr. Kilroy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kilroy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a failing industry along the west coast of Galway and Mayo, and I am anxious to find out from the Minister if it is his intention in any way to help to revive that industry, the kelp industry. Last year Deputy O'Clery asked a question concerning the kelp industry carried on by the people in Erris.  When the kelp is saved the landlord's agent drives along in his car and claims one-third of what is obtained from the kelp. That kind of thing is very annoying and unfair, and I think the claim is not a legitimate one.  The Minister promised last year that he would look into the matter, but since then Deputy O'Clery has not received any further information.  We were very anxious to see what the result <Col N="1411" /> of the question would be, because the kelp industry is practically the only employment that those living along that coast have.  There are a good many concerned in it, and while some people might look upon it as a small matter, the little that is derived from it means a great deal to these poor people.  Therefore, I think the claim made by the landlord is very irregular.  I believe in old times anything under high water mark was claimed by the Admiralty, so that the landlord has no right to demand a tariff on seaweed or what is manufactured from it.  In about a week's time the kelp will again be for sale in Erris and it is expected that the same claim will be made. So far we have no information from the Minister as to what is to be done.  We are very anxious to get information, and I hope that when replying he will let us have it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other minerals along the coast that could be developed. For instance, French people have been down there quite recently looking after some clay deposits, which we have been told for years are very valuable for the production of pottery.  The clays are of a very high quality, but it looks as if the Minister is waiting for foreigners to develop them, just as they developed the cray fishing industry along the coast, and supplied the fishermen with boats and gear for catching cray fish.  Industries should be developed by the Irish people, and should be encouraged by the Department of Industry and Commerce. If the industries got a little encouragement I believe there would be a profitable market got for whatever would be produced, because every day the requirements of the pottery market have to be met. That would be an industry that would help the people in these districts if it was revived.  There is a possible market for iodine on the Continent.  I understand that it was expected for some years past that something would be done by the Department to develop the iodine industry.  We have been <Col N="1412" /> promised something in that respect for a long period, but, like the Fishery Department, it seems to be all promises we get about these things and no development.  We are very anxious that the Minister would give some information, particularly about the kelp industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cassidy</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to direct the attention of the Minister to a few questions in connection with trade boards, and in doing so I want to point out that, in my opinion, the machinery in connection with these boards is not working in the manner in which it should work.  I would direct the attention of the Minister to the fact that the chairmen of these various trade boards are supposed to be&mdash;I say advisedly supposed to be&mdash;nominated by the Government.  I would like to ask the Minister a pertinent question. Why is it that in the case of at least four or five of these trade boards within the Saorstát the Minister nominated to the position of chairmen persons resident outside the Saorstát?  I would also like to direct the attention of the Minister to the fact that the chairmanship of a number of these boards has been vacant for some time.  I would like to know from the Minister when it is his intention to fill these positions, and also if it is his intention to do so with persons resident outside the Saorstát.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as trade boards are concerned in the industries for which they cater, they are supposed to lay down certain minimum rates of wages.  According to law, employers in these particular industries are not allowed to pay a lower rate of wages than the minimum rate laid down by the trade board, whether in regard to time or piece rates.  I would like to ask the Minister what steps his Department are taking to see that the regulation in regard to the rate of wages laid down by the trade boards is carried out.  Here and now, I charge the Minister and the inspectors of his Department with not taking adequate steps to see that the rates of wages stipulated by the <Col N="1413" /> trade boards are paid to employees. For the information of the Minister I will quote a number of specific cases in one particular industry. Some time ago I discovered that in the shirt-making industry in County Donegal a number of employers were not paying the minimum rate of wages to their employees.  I admit that there are a few firms paying the stipulated wages.  It was only when repeated requests were made to the Minister's Department to investigate these complaints that the Minister sent inspectors to Donegal, and they discovered that a number of the firms there were not paying to the girls employed the rate of wages laid down by the shirt-making trade board.  I want to know specifically from the Minister why the names of these particular firms were kept so secret.  Why were the names of these firms that were sweating their employees, by failing to pay the proper rate of wages kept secret?  Why were the names of these firms not disclosed to the members of the trade board? How is it that when a firm is found guilty by an inspector, sent down from the Minister's Department, of sweating their employees, by not paying a sufficient rate of wages, that, at the instigation, or on the instructions of the Minister, the names of these particular firms are withheld, not only from the members of the trade board concerned, but from the general public?</P>
    <P>So far as County Donegal is concerned, I can quite understand the secrecy, and the Minister can probably quite understand it also. I believe that this secrecy in regard to disclosing the names of firms who are openly disregarding the stipulations laid down by the trade boards is being aided and abetted by instructions issued by the Minister's Department.  I think that it would be much better in the interests of employees, and of employers also, that there should not be so much secrecy in regard to this matter of trade boards.  I believe that when an inspector goes out from the Minister's <Col N="1414" /> Department, whether in connection with the shirt-making industry, the shoe-making industry, the paper-box industry or, in fact, any other industry in which a trade board exists, the names of the firms found guilty of violating the rate of wages laid down by the trade boards should be disclosed.</P>
    <P>With regard to Donegal, I believe that the Minister has a particular reason in trying to shield at least one person from the public in regard to the wages paid.  I would further point out to the Minister that at the instigation of that particular person referred to, and as a result of negotiations between the Minister and that individual, the Minister agreed to set up a Committee to deal specifically with the rates of wages paid to those employed in the shirt-making industry in Donegal.  That is a precedent that should not be followed.  So far as trade boards were concerned in the past the rate of wages laid down for them, so far as I am aware, applied to all parts of the Saorstát, but at the behest of one individual the Minister agreed to set up a committee to inquire into the wages paid in the shirt-making industry, possibly with a view to endeavouring to reduce the minimum rates paid to girls in Donegal as compared with those paid in other parts.  These are things which I think the Minister should dwell upon in his reply.</P>
    <P>Another question which I put to the Minister is this.  Even when his Department agreed to set up a committee to inquire into the rates of wages paid in Donegal, the Minister nominated a number of people on it, and it was left to the home workers, so far as the shirt-making industry was concerned, to nominate one or two persons.  One of the trade unions requested the Department to allow these particular people to nominate their own representative through the local Labour Party in Donegal.  The Minister did not agree, with the result that there was one person nominated who was supposed to be the workers' representative, but who was, I might say, the employers' representative.  So much for the <Col N="1415" /> trade boards.  I do not know if I am entitled to go into the question of unemployment insurance, but, if I cannot, I think I am entitled to go into the question of unemployment generally.  I notice that in this year's Estimate no provision is made for those people who were unemployed under the heading &ldquo;Relief Schemes.&rdquo; That being so, one would naturally come to the conclusion that the Minister was going to pay particular attention to this question, but, unfortunately, it seems, to me at any rate, that the Minister's Department seem to think that unemployment is a necessary evil which must and always will exist.</P>
    <P>We in the Labour Party believe that that is not so, that this question should be tackled, and that if it were tackled in a serious manner there would not be so many people unemployed. Unfortunately the fact is that in Dublin, Limerick, Cork and cities generally there are thousands upon thousands of people unemployed. So far as the rural areas are concerned, there are thousands of people unemployed.  These people who are unemployed in the rural areas, especially in the Gaelthacht area in Donegal, see no hope of getting employment, with the result that they are emigrating in hundreds from the Irish-speaking districts for the simple reason that they cannot eke out a livelihood in the land of their birth.  I do not wish to refer to what has taken place recently across Channel in regard to the General Election.  I do not want to advocate that we should copy the methods adopted across Channel.  In some respects, at any rate, I think what we should do is to copy the manner in which the Labour Government in Britain are attempting to cope with the question of unemployment. I think that the Minister should set apart a certain number of officials in his Department specifically to go into this question and try to bring forward ways and means for solving it.  Over a year ago this question of unemployment was raised by the Labour Party in the <Col N="1416" /> Dáil, and it was decided that a committee be set up to inquire into the question and to devise ways and means for getting employment for those who are looking for work and who are unable to find it.  That committee made certain recommendations, but they have not been carried out.  If they were carried out, I believe that the thousands of unemployed persons in Dublin and in the provinces would have secured employment.  They remain, however, unemployed.</P>
    <P>I hope that during the coming year the Minister will pay more attention to this question.  Dublin is not the only city where unemployment exists.  It exists in Cork, Limerick, and in every one of the 32 counties.  The Minister's Department are unfortunately treating it as a necessary evil which must exist. If they would only tackle it with the idea that it is an evil it could be wiped out, provided it is tackled in a serious way.  There is another matter to which I would like to refer. It is in connection with the Harbours Tribunal that was set up in connection with the Minister's Department.  I understand that that tribunal or commission visited a number of harbours throughout the Saorstát, but has not yet made recommendations.  So far as one particular harbour in my constituency is concerned, that of Killy-begs, I desire to point out that it is capable of very big development and that applications have been made to the Government to give grants to help towards that development.  We have been told by one Minister that nothing can be done until the report of the Tribunal is received.  I ask the Minister to try and expedite that report, so that harbour improvements can be carried out not only in Donegal, but in other ports throughout the country.</P>

      <P>When the Bill was previously before the House, Deputy de Valera raised the point as to the extent of the Dublin Metropolitan area.  Somewhere about the year 1836, I think, the first Act was passed specifying what was called the Dublin Police District.  That Act with subsequent amendments&mdash; I think the 1 and 2 Vic.&mdash;extended the district as far as eight miles from Her Majesty's castle in Dublin on one side to the bridge over the river called Anna Liffey in Chapelizod on the other.  There must have been subsequent extensions under the Boundaries Act of 1900.  Shortly, what really comprise the area described as the Dublin Metropolitan Area in this Bill, are the six divisions of what was formerly known as the Dublin Metropolitan Police Divisions &mdash;A, B, C, D, E and F.  They extend as far as Dollymount on the north side to Killiney on the south side, and as far as the bridge over the Liffey in Chapelizod on the west side.

      <P>I am sorry that the ruling already given prevents me from joining with Deputy Hogan in referring to the question of unemployment insurance, but there are some other matters to which I am anxious to call attention.  I would like to ask the Minister what is being done by the different labour exchanges <Col N="1418" /> throughout the country in the way of notifying people in remote areas of vacancies in employment. On any occasion that I have visited small labour exchanges, that could be made of real value to the people in remote areas, I have seen the same list of vacancies hanging up from January to December.  I have never heard of one person who was put in touch with employment through the means of these exchanges. I am not surprised at that because the whole machinery connected with labour exchanges is unsatisfactory.  In the small districts branch managers are paid wretchedly and it is not likely that they can be expected to take an intelligent interest in their work.  I want also to call attention to the need for more facilities in the matter of registering for unemployment benefit and for employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well; I shall have another opportunity of referring to it.  In the course of the Minister's statement he referred to the Trade Loans Act.  I want to say that my experience of one particular application in connection with the Act has been satisfactory.  We have at the moment, in a remote portion of West Cork, some hundreds of men employed at Allihies copper mine. The promise which that industry gives as a result of the assistance from the State is very good.  In that connection something more might be done by the Minister to make the work of the company in that district easier.  The question of transport will largely enter into the success of the industry.  In the improvement and the dredging of the harbour, a scheme for which has been prepared for a considerable time, the Minister might with profit to the Department, to the countryside generally and to the people interested in the enterprise, assist in providing through the means of his Department a fund that will give proper facilities for <Col N="1419" /> the shipment of the copper which has to be transported from the mine.</P>
      <P>Some years ago we had in West Cork an industry that was of very great importance, the barytes mines. It is a very sorrowful reflection today that they are all practically dismantled. The difficulties which led to the closing down of the mines were numerous.  In one particular instance the mines closed because of something that happened during the trouble when a quantity of explosives, used in the ordinary way in connection with the work of the mines, was taken away.  I would like to know what steps the Minister's Department has taken towards exploring the possibilities of getting that industry revived.  I know that for some time there were difficulties by reason of the state of the market and by the fact that barytes was being brought in from Germany at a low cost.  I have reason to know that there has been some change in the situation since, and I would like to know what the Minister is prepared to do in that connection, because generally what I feel is that the Department has not done anything very radical or very useful towards promoting industry or towards bringing people in this country, and people with capital outside, into touch with each other with a view to their mutual advantage.  As an instance of that I might mention that we have, at the moment, near Skibbereen, an English company working at stone deposits which are apparently valuable.  I understand that the stone is being taken from Crookhaven over to a number of cities in England to be used by the local authorities there. It is very strange that it took enterprising English people to discover the value of this stone.  It is rather a sad position to find that people in this country have not been able to make any use of stone of that kind or to find, through the agency of the Department, what possibilities there were in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to see the Minister's Department taking a hand in the execution of small marine <Col N="1420" /> works.  I think it would fall properly to the Department controlled by the Minister.  While we will have another opportunity of raising the question of the failure of another Department to do anything in that connection, I think, in view of the fact that a particular branch of the service is in charge of the Minister, work of this kind might be undertaken by his Department with very good results.  In places in the country where industries are in a bad way at the moment, and where very suitable buildings and good possibilities exist, I would like the Department of the Minister to be a great deal more active.  In my constituency a distillery, one of the many in the State affected by legislation and by other things, is about to close down.  The last few men in the Bandon distillery will be paid off in a few days.  There is a very up-to-date plant there.  There is a very good building which, if it will not be used for the industry it has housed up to the present, could be utilised for other industries in future.  If the Department intends to pay any attention to the representations made to it, I would like to hear what it proposes to do.  It might be possible to suggest to another Department a very appropriate use for that particular building.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that nothing whatever has been done by the Department to tackle the question of unemployment generally.  I believe we will have another opportunity of raising that matter, and perhaps it would be better to defer what we have to say in that connection until a more suitable opportunity arises.  I put these suggestions to the Minister in order that some effort will be made to convince the people in the country that the Department can be of real value to them; that the services of the Department will be reflected in a useful endeavour towards putting people with capital outside the country in touch with the possibilities for the expenditure of that capital in the country; towards improving the <Col N="1421" /> facilities for transport, the condition of a good many of the piers and harbours, and other portions of that particular service which come within the control of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the Minister has been getting any better as he grows older; his Department is as much a failure now as it has been during the years since we came here. Year after year practically the same criticisms are offered, and I do not know what hope there is of improvement in the future.  There is certainly very wide scope for the Minister to improve, and I suggest, as regards the matters I have mentioned, as well as other matters that have been mentioned in the course of the debate, that the Minister might very usefully employ the machinery of his Department in doing something.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to speak in this debate, and were it not for the ingenuity of Deputy Hogan I would not be able to put to the Minister the questions I want to put to him, because they have relationship to or a bearing on the Shannon scheme.  I do not intend to speak on the Shannon scheme proper, but I want to ask the Minister if he can explain to the House how it is that he is able to disregard completely the 1927 Electricity Supply Act. Section 105 of that Act deals with the transfer of certain properties from the Board of Works to the Shannon Board, through the Office of the Ministry for Industry and Commerce.  Sub-section (8) of that section specifically and distinctly states that no Order made under this section shall come into operation until it has been laid before each House of the Oireachtas and has been approved by resolution of each such House.  I know that the Board of Works have handed over to the Minister for Industry and Commerce certain properties in Killaloe, near O'Brien's Bridge.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has proceeded to demand possession of certain properties there and to evict from a certain position <Col N="1422" /> an official of the Board of Works. I have the correspondence here in connection with the matter.  Does the Minister admit or deny that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not putting this for the purpose of making any points against the Minister.  Deputy Hogan has pointed out in one case where the Electricity Supply Board or the Minister can take upon themselves all rights irrespective of the rights of the people in conjunction with property or possessions which they hold, and the people can wait for three or four years for some settlement of their claims for compensation. I would ask the Minister at least to give an assurance where livelihoods are being taken away from people that they will be dealt with immediately.  Men like this lock-keeper at Killaloe, whose position and property are taken from him, cannot afford to wait three years, until the Minister's assessors come to a conclusion as to what they are to get.  The same thing applies to people who wake up in the morning and find one of these poles stuck in their front garden and an offer from the Minister of a shilling a year rental for it.  The President was a member of the old Dublin Corporation, and I think he will agree that when the Corporation took over premises if the person affected did not agree to a reasonable figure there was arbitration, and both sides got fair dealing in connection with it.  In this case, the Minister just goes and plants a pole in a man's garden and he gives him a shilling a year for <Col N="1425" /> it.  The specific clause in the 1927 Act dealing with this item does not count, because the 1925 Act governs it.  I do not think that that is really the sense in which the Act was passed by this House.  It is a very long Act, and all these clauses were put in for some purpose or other.</P>
      <P>The next thing I want to refer to is the subject matter of the answer given to the question which I put to the Minister to-day in connection with public safety and the Shannon scheme.  It is the first time in this country that a Department of State can undertake work outside the control of the Government.  We have evidence of two deaths in a period of ten days, and it is evident that precautions of some nature are necessary. The Minister turns around and tells us the story of the days when railroads were first established and people hurled themselves in front of charging express trains. The public generally want an assurance that some effort will be made to give consideration to some means whereby the public generally will be protected against such occurrences. It is all very well for the Minister to get up and excuse abuses to certain sections of the community when certain accidents occur.  The Minister is responsible for the safety of the people in connection with this scheme.  Deputy Anthony pointed out that there would appear to be some laxity in the Department that is responsible for the examination of machinery, particularly where there was loss of life due to defective machinery.  I would like the Minister to give an assurance to the House, while it might be too expensive to put up barbed wire fences around each pole, that he will consult with the engineers of his Department to see if it is not possible to do something to insure some measure of safety for the public at large.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked a question yesterday in connection with the annual statistics and returns from the Electricity Supply Board.  The Minister replied stating he had authorised the Board to join the first and second <Col N="1426" /> together and to give the report of the returns for the two years together. I contend that the Act, if we are to understand it at all, and if any interpretation can be put on it, specifically states that the Board shall in each year make these returns. I do not say that they can be put to the House in that particular year, but I would like the Minister to assure the House that such returns will be made every year. Does he contend that it is within his right, under this Act, to use his own judgment and authority to give instructions to the Board which are in exact opposition to the sense of the sections of the Act?  I do not want to go into any more details for the present.  I would like the Minister to be less dictatorial in his attitude with regard to the community at large arising out of the extraordinary powers he seems to be able to interpret from the various Acts, particularly the '25 Act.  I have made a study of the 1927 Act. I will have to sit up a few more nights late to study the 1925 Act and compare the clauses of the two Acts to see where they dovetail into each other.</P>
    <P>I would like, before concluding, to ask the Minister if there is any foundation for the suggestion that the non-completion of the agreement entered into between this State and England, by the non-payment of £600,000 into a joint fund, has brought about the impossibility of a reciprocal arrangement on the insurance fund.  If that sum is paid into a fund reciprocal arrangements with regard to unemployment benefits could be entered into.  That is to say, an Irishman unemployed here having credit in England could be paid here.  I do not suggest at the moment that it would be a good policy to pay that money but, in view of the fact that all other payments under the 1926 agreement have been paid, the Minister might state whether that is so.  It has been suggested to me that that is the reason.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I again have to complain with regard to this debate <Col N="1427" /> which I regard as a valuable opportunity of listening to Deputies, if they are seriously-minded in this whole matter, suggesting industrial improvements in the Free State, that instead of suggestions of a practical type I get nothing but vague complaints.  One thing has approached the concrete more definitely this evening than at any time before and that is the new plans with regard to transport, with which I shall deal later.  At the opening of the speech made to support the amendment that this Vote should be referred back, we had from Deputy Lemass two comments that I can only consider ill-natured on his part.  One was as to officials lying down on their jobs.  The Deputy is long enough here to know that that is not the way in which business is conducted. If there is anybody responsible for people lying down on their jobs it is the political head of the Department and not the officials.  If there is any official malingering it is the fault of the Minister who is over him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy started off with certain people who were earning big salaries.  With regard to the last portion of his remarks, one had to conclude that there were certain officials lying down on their jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope it will not occur again that that phrase will be used.  There are people who stand here for criticism and there are other people who are prohibited by the conditions of their employment from taking part in discussions as to how they do their duty.  They are as much at the mercy of the Minister who does not present their case clearly as they are at the mercy of the Deputy who discusses them when they are not in a position to reply. I would like to ask Deputy Lemass, if he is referring to the salaries of certain people in this Department <Col N="1428" /> which he himself describes as a far-reaching and most important Department, one whose activities enter into every sphere of national life, if he thinks it is sound comment to say here that there are people here who are in receipt of salaries over £1,000 a year and afterwards, as was indicated by Fianna Fáil speakers generally, say that the duty of the officials of his Department should be that of going around to see where industry should be started, where there is a chance of development, to find out what is wrong with our industries and to start new industries. The man who is paid less than £1,000 a year is not going to remain long in the Department of Industry and Commerce, if as Deputy Lemass believes, he is capable of carrying out these duties and of discovering opportunities towards advancement. We are told that there are numerous opportunities waiting for development if we can only get the people who are willing to use them.  I do not think there is going to be a successful service run on the basis of no payment of more than £1,000 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure that the publication of a report like that which the Department of Local Government publishes is going to save me from many of the criticisms passed here, because the Department of Local Government when they do publish the report deal almost entirely with what is scornfully described as routine duties.  If I were to publish such a report I would certainly clear up a lot of misunderstanding in regard to what has been described in a scornful and disdainful way as routine duties, but it is not going to save me from criticism because those people, who are only paid for carrying out certain statutory duties, are not, in fact, taking on their shoulders much more in the way of duties of a non-statutory type.  I could ask factory inspectors and officials of certain types when making visits to certain places in connection with their statutory duties to spend the greater portion of their time in investigating possibilities, in getting information, <Col N="1429" /> in getting in touch with people who are likely to use that information and in trying to get people agitated into industrial activity.  These are duties that they could actually and definitely claim they are not being paid for&mdash;duties not laid upon them by statute; but the performance of their routine duties is criticised by Deputies.</P>
    <P>The enactments that the Department has had to bring forward this year were referred to in a critical mood by Deputy Lemass.  He said there was a certain number of measures declared by me to be necessary and not yet introduced, such as a Minerals Bill and a Merchandise Marks Bill.  Then we heard from the Deputy the rather usual comment, that there were quite a large number of other Bills which he could not remember that had been promised and were said to be required but had not yet been seen.  I do not know what they are.  I have committed myself, as far as I can remember, to a Minerals Bill, a Merchandise Marks Bill, and a Workmen's Compensation Bill for next session, and hereafter I said it may be found possible to deal with the question of insurance. I have never promised that for any early date.</P>

      <P>It is a question of being precise.  After saying I had promised A B C D E F G H I J measures, I was told of two, and the tag was put on that there was quite a large number of others said to be necessary and promised but not yet brought in.  I searched my memory, and I do not know where quite a large number of other Bills was promised.  I have no memory of it whatever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not, except in so far as they will be dealt with <Col N="1430" /> under the Merchandise Marks Bill. The Deputy has complained of the production of the unemployment figures.  He says that when produced in 1929 they are no good, as they refer to 1926.  Of course, they will be good.  They will be good if only for this reason: that for the future there is a frame-work established into which any further collection can fit, and it will be a much easier matter to deal with in the future.  At the same time even to get the 1926 figures now is very useful. I am told by the Deputy that it would be found probably more wasteful to have employed a small staff for three years in this matter of the Census figures rather than a big staff for one year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask Deputies, who are concerned about statistical information being provided, to nominate deputations so that they could be shown around the statistical office, and get explained to them its working, because it is only when one sees the machines and gets a realisation of how the cards are dealt with that one can realise that that sort of statement is completely absurd.  The piling up of clerical staff in the statistics office would have meant an inappreciable amount of extra speed with regard to getting out returns, because there is a bottle-neck through which all these returns must pass.  There are two or three officials at the top who have to deal with the rather mechanical work done by the clerical officers and the machines.  These people at the top could not be trained for that work inside of six years.  The newest of them has been about five years in training for the work, and it really would mean an extension of the head staff rather than any increase in the clerical staff to get these returns out any earlier.  I again repeat that I am simply going to leave these returns to the judgment of the public when finally brought out.  If anybody thinks there is undue delay, I ask again people who have that feeling to come along and be shown around the office and pursue inquiries as long as these inquiries do not impede <Col N="1431" /> the work of the office.  I do not at all doubt what the judgment would be if that inspection is made.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass holds that prior to the setting up of the Tariff Commission the Government had been acting freely and well.  He spoke of thirteen groups of industries as having applied for a tariff of whom only four have had their applications heard.  He committed himself to the comment that probably the rest might be heard in about ten years.  There is a proper occasion for considering the question of tariffs.  I only want to make this comment: There is not one single case of undue delay that can be made against the Tariff Commission. There is quite a number of cases of undue delay which can be made against applicants for not putting in applications in the proper way and for not answering rebutting evidence when put up to them.  Any one of the cases that the Deputy talks of can be examined in the light of relevant dates, and the statement made as to the cause of the delay could be answered by the people concerned in the application.  If it is going to take ten years to hear the rest of the cases to come before the Commission, then the blame has to be put upon the applicants much more than on the Tariff Commission. That is my answer to the query: &ldquo;Why not appoint two Commissions?&rdquo; The Tariff Commission have to my knowledge only found themselves on one occasion, for one short period of time, prevented by other duties from dealing with applications ripe for consideration.  If there had been two sets of men sitting instead of only one they simply would be sitting idle.</P>
    <P>I want to query&mdash;I want to do more than query: I want to protest against the type of phrase Deputy Lemass used with regard to the attitude of my Department&mdash;officials or myself&mdash;towards industrialists.  He said that it was one of complete hostility.  Will he get any group of <Col N="1432" /> industrialists to come openly and say that the attitude of any official whom they have met has been one of hostility?  I should like to get some group of industrialists who will say that, because I should like to get examining into the situation in which hostility, active or passive, was displayed towards any industrialists in this country.  &ldquo;They are treated as crooks,&rdquo; was the Deputy's other phrase.  We got an explanation of what that meant.  It was merely a picturesque, although a very irresponsible, phrase for what the Deputy went on afterwards to explain&mdash;that these people have to make their own case in a great many instances.  I even deny that.  I say that I can get evidence from a great many industrialists who have applied for various types of aid, some of whom have got the aid and others of whom are still seeking it, and a great number will say that their case was sometimes made for them by officials of the Ministry, and that is only as it should be.  There is no case, or if there is I should like to hear it, of any group of industrialists who will say, with regard to the Department officials or myself, that the attitude has been one of hostility to industry.</P>
    <P>Similarly Deputy Lemass said that I had been very badly stricken by the idea of rationalisation, and that I was glad to have small industries disappear if they were replaced by one large one.  He went on to say that he personally did not want the conditions here of English industrial towns, and that we should rely upon local concerns to supply local needs.  I have never indicated any absolute preference for the big business over the smaller one.  I have had it borne in on me, in a great many cases, that in order to compete with outside firms that big business&mdash;mass manufacturing that has to be taken relatively to the needs of the country&mdash;is necessary. It is all very well to have an aim with regard to small local concerns put forward from the point of view of the amenities of life and health, but simply to say that one is in favour of big industries, of big <Col N="1433" /> grouping of industry rather than small disconnected units, does not mean that you want industrial towns like those in England or in America.  It is quite possible to have conditions entirely different, even although one would have a grouping of industries.  But I have never expressed any preference and I do not know where that criticism came from.</P>
    <P>I should like to pursue further the Deputy's reference to certain people in this country interested in certain industries who were afraid to come along and make application for a tariff or for help&mdash;for a tariff particularly&mdash;because of the fact that if a tariff were granted the industry itself as operated in this country or the industrialists themselves would suffer.  Of the examples he gave, I know of only one case, that of agricultural machinery, in which an application for a tariff was made to me, not to the Tariff Commission.  On the matter of trade loans, the Deputy's line is that banks do not give to industry here what banks in other countries provide.  I think they do. I admit the German banks do more, but, leaving them out, the banks in this country, on the whole, have done more than the banks in other countries ordinarily do.  In most other countries there is something other than banks of the type we have here, which provide money for industrial purposes.  But, again, that whole matter was examined by the Banking Commission, and they recommended as a temporary expedient, and to get over certain temporary difficulties, that we should cease to operate the Trade Loans Guarantee Act, that it never should operate again once the commitments we had were cleared up, but that we should finance the Industrial Trust Corporation and that we should guarantee their shares.  In a sense that is what has been done, to some extent, recently, and that course can be pursued when it seems that the Industrial Trust Corporation wants help in that way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1434" /> The Deputy criticises me for not holding firmly to my 1924 attitude towards the banks, when I took the attitude, that Irish industrialists hold strongly, that Irish banks could and should do more, or that there is a lot that they could and should do towards helping industry.  I cannot hold to my attitude in 1924 in face of the facts presented since.  A tremendous number of applications came to the office and eventually to me.  I could trace the history of these in relation to banks.  I formed a very sound appreciation of the attitude of banks towards propositions put before them.  I wonder would Deputies be amazed to hear that one of the reasons why certain banking institutions in this country are not in as healthy a position as the others, or as they might be, is that they lent money too freely to bad concerns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I cannot hold to the attitude I had without having any great evidence, acting merely on certain suspicion, when evidence has accumulated in the meantime.  It may be that I have got one side of the case presented to me, and that I have not seen enough of the other side to form a proper judgment; but I think that, owing to the particular Department for which I am concerned, it is only natural to expect that I do get an opportunity of seeing both sides of the case.  I would say deliberately, in agreement more or less with what is implied in the Banking Commission's Report, that there is no fault to be found with the banks, constituted as they are, for the action they have taken with regard to productive manufacturing concerns in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am told by the Deputy&mdash;and this is a frequent phrase used by him&mdash; that the Department should take up <Col N="1435" /> an active rather than a passive part in all this; that occasionally there may be a man with a good idea, and that he is only helped after he has overcome tremendous obstacles.  I wonder what are the obstacles referred to?  In the context of the Deputy's speech that phrase occurred after he had been speaking of the Trade Loans Act. I wonder has it any reference to that Act?  Is it considered, for instance, to be an obstacle in an applicant's way, or is it considered to be helpful to him, to say: &ldquo;You have not provided according to our best estimate sufficient working capital for that concern.  If you start you will be only able to operate for a certain period, and after that period you will not have sufficient stock or sales to keep money circulating back to you and you will go on the rocks.&rdquo; Is that an obstacle or is it a help? Similarly, is it an obstacle or is it a help to say to a man who comes with a proposition for the building of a factory in this country: &ldquo;You have no idea of building conditions in this country; you have set down a certain sum for a particular type of building; we think that ought to be increased by 70 per cent., but we do not ask you to take our opinion.  We ask you to get statistics, to take figures which we will give you as to wage conditions in the building trade and as to the price of material, and make up your own mind whether or not the amount set down is sufficient.&rdquo;  In the end they have always to remember that we have the say as to whether or not there is enough, and we ask them to take our figures and consider them, and, generally speaking, after that type of objection is raised, we find an amendment on the lines suggested. I do not know what are the obstacles put in applicants' way. There have been many queries as to whether applications came within the scope of the Acts.  That is necessitated by the fact that the transfer of the moneys eventually has to come under the review of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and there has to be legal advice <Col N="1436" /> taken.  Outside anything that is done on the question of getting an applicant to realise that an application in a particular form is not satisfactory, and trying to get it put into a better shape, there has finally to be the judgment of the Advisory Committee, composed mainly of business men, as to whether or not the application, in its final and perfect shape, represents a good business proposition.  I do not know of any complaint.  I should like to hear of a complaint made in a particular case of what are called obstacles thrown in the way of an applicant, so that we could examine what they were and find out if they were the type of thing which I suggest&mdash; pointing out that there is not sufficient working capital, or a query to find out where the sales were going to be and what the marketing organisation was to be like.  Although sometimes there may be a ready market, the whole thing may depend upon the fact that the product has to be sold in an area which is under the operation of a ring, that the ring has to be broken, and is not likely to be broken by a small manufacturer starting here.</P>
    <P>As to transport, the Deputy gave a lot of figures and details with which I am not concerned at present, except one thing.  The Deputy did say that one would expect that management and supervising expenditure would be cut down much more than maintenance or repairs.  I do not think that remark could be made if the Deputy appreciated the situation that the Great Southern Railways as now constituted walked into.  A number of unamalgamated concerns operated previously on their own, each having very big provision made in the way of extra locomotives and rolling stock generally, and provision made upon a big scale with regard to the maintenance of track generally.  It was therefore quite ordinary, I think, under the amalgamated circumstances to look for a very big reduction on the maintenance and repair side.  I am taking that to include the rolling stock, because I think it does.  On the <Col N="1437" /> question of the reduction of management and supervisory expenses I had that point raised in an acute form, and had figures queried, and I do not think there is anything to be cavilled at in the way in which expenditure has been reduced by the Great Southern Railways Company between the different sides of their work.</P>
    <P>The question was raised of the reduction operating between the higher grades of employees and the lower grades.  I find that the reduction is between twenty-five and twenty-eight amongst the higher grade officials, amounting to about ten per cent., and on the lower grade the reduction is sixteen per cent.  When one considers the relative numbers in comparison, the difference in the percentage is not so great.  Particularly again one must remember the Great Southern Railways Company took over the concern, and took over the employees of six or seven previously dissociated concerns, and they had to make changes in their staff.  If the Deputy raised the point&mdash;and I suppose it was meant to be raised&mdash;that there was too much money being spent on management, that is a case that I have always held should be made to the directors of the railway by the shareholders.  We have tried to regulate the matter so far as there can be regulation on one side.  Short of taking over the railways, we have no say in regard to what moneys are spent on the management side.  I do say that if expenditure on the management side upon review showed itself to be extravagant or to be grossly unfair in relation to the expenses elsewhere, then there would be a case for inquiring into that, possibly with the threat if inquiry brought out facts substantiating that there was gross extravagance that the management would be reduced and that there would be a facing up to the situation.  But no such gross mismanagement has yet been shown.</P>
    <P>I am trying to get to the principle of Deputy Lemass's speech on transport. <Col N="1438" /> At one time I though a phrase of his meant distinctly that the Deputy was definitely for the railways and against the road vehicles.  I caught the phrase from him that road traffic ought to be regulated so as to feed into the railways. The sentence that followed seemed to me to indicate that he was arguing that that was the only road transport that should be allowed. That would be definitely putting the railway system in the main position, only allowing road vehicles to operate in so far as they feed the railways.  Later on he said that the Executive Council were engaged in a ramp to drive buses off the roads. That seemed to me to be swinging round to the idea that buses were not being fairly treated.  Later on I gathered from him that if his Transport Board was set up, the road vehicles would be given eighteen months' notice; they would be told that after eighteen months no bus services would be allowed except what would be controlled by the Transport Board.  I did not gather that compensation would not be paid to buses which survived after the eighteen months.  I wonder what would be the attitude of bus proprietors were they put up against a proposition of this sort; would they be content to suffer under the ramp which the Executive Council is engaged in to drive them off the roads, or would they accept the simple statement that after eighteen months they would not be allowed on the roads, Which will they consider the greater ramp? Anyway, where is the ramp?</P>
    <P>The Deputy says that there are no data in the possession of Ministers on which to base an equitable taxation of motor vehicles.  That fell for consideration elsewhere.  I indicated twice when speaking on Estimates, and I hinted at it to-day, that there were certain data.  Has this matter really been given fair consideration? Is it fair to deal with the matter in this way, to say that the roads in 1914 were not subjected to much wear and tear from the point of view of transport, that the roads <Col N="1439" /> in 1914 were good enough for the transport of that period, but that the outlook now as compared with 1914 has completely altered; that there is an entirely new system of transport with which the roads of 1914 could never deal, and that in order to cope with that traffic the roads must be reconstructed?  Is it unreasonable to expect that the amount contributed to the upkeep of roads now should be increased in proportion to the extra charges demanded on all commodities as compared with 1914?  The reconstruction and maintenance of roads nowadays is naturally more costly because of the higher cost of labour and materials.  The extra cost is due to the damage caused by motor vehicles on the highways and the construction of roads so as to make them fit for motor vehicles.  Considering all that, is it not a fair conclusion to draw that motors ought to pay all the extra expenditure necessitated over the 1914 figure?  I make a distinction in regard to the 1914 figure because it is largely upon that figure that various computations were made with reference to the increased cost of living and in that respect it is expected that the contribution towards the maintenance of roads on the part of the rate-payers should be increased in proportion. I think on the whole there are sufficient data on which to form definite opinions.</P>
    <P>The Deputy pointed out that it would be necessary to distinguish between the motor vehicles causing most damage to the roads and those vehicles which do least damage and it should be possible, he said, to make the vehicle causing the most damage pay most.  So far from there being a ramp to put buses off the roads, there is a ramp to prevent buses tearing up the roads.  I am not satisfied that the taxation on buses is yet properly regulated.  I think they still do more damage than they pay for.  I think that the amount they contribute through motor taxation to the Road Fund is not enough to meet the cost of <Col N="1440" /> making the better roads that have to be provided in order to enable motor transport to utilise them safely.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has outlined a plan for dealing with the railway situation. It is something that may not be described as nationalisation although it is something very near it.  The Deputy made a statement about purchase and he pointed out that there would be some tribunal to assess the cash value of stock and to pay railway bonds.  The Oireachtas would provide a central fund to pay these people, and there would be a National Transport Board on which there would be represented only railway users and the Government. The railway employees were not mentioned as having a place on it.  It was vaguely said that the Government would have certain powers to prevent undue burdens being put on the State.  What are the undue burdens anticipated?  It is on that very point that the whole plan would work out to be good or else completely inadequate.  Under certain circumstances the plan suggested might mean 16,000 extra civil servants.  It would mean that that number would be added to the present list.  I do not imagine the Deputy had in mind making the railway employees civil servants in the ordinary sense of the term. With a Transport Board on the lines indicated by the Deputy and with his other suggestions carried into effect, how these people could be prevented from assimilating themselves into the Civil Service, I cannot see.  Over and above that, there is to be a railway tribunal to establish fares and such things as routes, because passenger services and road services will come in afterwards. What is the difference between that and nationalisation?  Of course, we would have to have all the details worked out before we could arrive at any opinion on the matter suggested. In considering the plan, has the Deputy studied what has happened in regard to railways in Belgium and Germany within the last ten years?  I do not think that <Col N="1441" /> an investigation of what has happened there would lead anybody to believe other than that it is approaching pretty closely towards what is called nationalisation.  We would have to see this plan in detail before it could be properly criticised.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne went very much on a phrase which I assumed was to be meant as a quotation from myself. The phrase was that the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act has failed.  It has not failed.  I never said it failed and I will not admit it has failed.  I said it had exhausted its utility.  I said it cannot be said to have failed; it is rather that the people for whom it is provided have failed to make adequate use of it, seeing that for over four years £1,000,000 has been at their disposal and only £400,000 has been guaranteed.  On long term credits I would again fall back on what the Banking Commission said, and simply indicate that action on the lines of what the Banking Commission recommended will be taken if and when the circumstances show it is warranted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Anthony raised a very serious point with regard to two cases of accidents where a factory inspector could not be found.  I happen to know of the two cases, because they were brought to my notice, and an investigation was made.  In each case it has been established that the factory inspector was absent from his office, but he was on other inspections.  If it is suggested to me again that there should be more factory inspection&mdash;if the House thinks that, and if the incidents that have occurred were common incidents, then one would have to move towards getting more inspectors.  With the limited number of inspectors at my disposal I cannot promise to have the odd six thousand workers who come under the Factory Acts in the Saorstát supervised as well as the same type of people are supervised in England, where there is a much bigger staff to deal with the matter.  If factory inspectors are appointed in greater numbers, Deputies must remember that it is going <Col N="1442" /> to add to the number of officials and to the number of salaries; it is going to add to the number of officials earning salaries and performing what Deputies in this House invariably like to describe as routine duties, the insinuation being that the routine duties bring no benefit to anybody. We aim at approximating our standards and number of inspections to the conditions existing in regard to factories in Great Britain, but with the staff that I have, and until better organisation is worked out, it will not be possible to do it.  Even at the moment it is not possible to have inspections on the same lines or as often.  The matter of unemployment and census returns had better be left over until the other Vote comes before us.</P>
    <P>On the third point raised by Deputy Anthony as to international labour conventions dealing with legislation with regard to the safeguarding of life and limb, I think a convention on those lines is being discussed at the moment.  I know that when we began to survey our existing legislation on that particular line we found it was very much in advance of a great number of countries that come under the international labour organisation.  I know that the convention is being discussed. There were certain points of great difficulty raised, and these are being elucidated.  When we get a convention in a clearer form it will then be seen how far we will have to introduce legislation in order to become adherents.  On the whole, we are very definitely in advance of the majority of countries on the question of accidents and the safeguarding of life and limb.</P>
    <P>I earnestly hope that any industry that may ever come to this country will never get into the hands of Deputy Carney.  He supplied us with a list of industries to-night&mdash; and it is really amazing how he supplied such a list&mdash;which have already been investigated here, and which were found to be of very little use.  He dealt with such things as calcium carbide, cyanamide, steatite, cement and industrial alcohol.  A <Col N="1443" /> select committee sat for three weary years waiting to find out people who could bring forward anything that offered even a chance of experimentation in the matter of industrial alcohol.  In the end we had to drop a £1,000 offer.  Seven or eight years ago there was an investigation made of the gypsum deposits in Monaghan. If anyone wants information as to the gypsum deposits they can have that information quite readily; but as to getting that material out and marketing it in the place where it really should be marketed, that is an entirely different proposition.  It is a proposition which we cannot get any firm to take up commercially. As regards steatite, I confess I know very little about it.  If Deputy Carney's phrase is correct, the material can easily be had here, and it can be worked so cheaply here that we would be able to save freight from America.  If that is so, I am surprised the people are so lacking in enterprise as not to have started the industry.</P>
    <P>Of all the things that have ever been investigated and brought before the notice of home industrialists and foreign industrialists, cement would, I think, take the biggest place in my Department.  We can tell Deputy Carney, or any other Deputy who is anxious to know, where there are cement deposits.  There is no necessity to have a geological survey with regard to the deposits required for cement because we know there are deposits and we know where they are.  It is mainly a question of working the deposits and getting a product which will compete at a rate even approaching a competitive rate with the cement that is brought into the country.  Cyanimide and calcium carbide are matters that have also been investigated and on which I can supply information in a very definite way to anybody who inquires. The development of calcium carbide depends upon what I said previously. It is a matter of forcing one's way into an expert business, because it is really an expert business. It is a matter of forcing one's <Col N="1444" /> way into combinations governed by the operation of one or two rings inside which one could only break if there was something in the way of very easy development here.  I do not think the industry could be developed here at a rate sufficiently cheap to ensure success.</P>
    <P>I asked the Deputy about the building of houses with Portland stone and Mountcharles stone, and he wanted to know if there is any building under Government control or financed by Government money in which Mountcharles stone was used.  I would like details with regard to the price of Mountcharles stone and its utility.  The Deputy developed a strain of rhetoric at that point, and he left me without the question being answered, and the same happened with regard to granite paving sets.</P>
    <P>Clare people and their compensation do not afford me any more trouble than people in other parts of the country with regard to the compensation they are getting under the Shannon scheme.  I would like to deny definitely and clearly the statement of Deputy Hogan that the Land Commission as a whole value land at a higher figure than my valuer.  I would like even to deny it with regard to Clare land in particular. As a matter of fact, I am conscious that on one part of the Shannon scheme I am being rooked steadily with regard to the payment of compensation for the acquisition of land.  The only difference between the rest of the country and Clare is that Clare wants to rook me at an exorbitant rate and I will not stand it.  The Clare people have the same type of agreement as the people in the neighbourhood.  We have ways of investigating and finding out the value of land.  We have auction returns, and there is the fact that those sales were voluntary sales while in this case it is compulsory acquisition.  We have the Land Commission way of estimating values, and we have our own valuer's estimate, and his estimate is being accepted.  By far the great majority of people who have had <Col N="1445" /> land taken from them have not raised objection; but there are certain recalcitrant people from Clare and, as long as they adopt that attitude, we say that there is no way of dealing with such people by bargaining.</P>
    <P>If they want arbitration there is a way, I think, they can get it.  I do not know what arbitration would give them.  I do not know what awards they will get eventually, and I do not know that they will get an award any more speedily by arbitration than by a process of agreement.  I know that for every case there will have to be a strictly legal form, which would be different to the rough-and-ready form of agreement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of my agreements have taken a very short time as regards arriving at a calculation of the sum to be paid for the lands.  There is a certain amount of time spent in the paying over, and that arises because of the difficulty that is so often encountered in this country where people in possession of land are unable to give proper title.  The question of kelp was raised.  As far as I remember, the case to which Deputy Kilroy, and previously Deputy Clery, referred depends upon what is the exact title of the landlord originally to rights with regard to seaweed, and what is the precise form of the order vesting the land where the land has been vested in certain new proprietors. That is a matter that more definitely falls to the decision of the Land Commission than it does to me.  I have been in touch with the Land Commission people trying to get them to send an inspector down to work out that particular problem. So far I have failed to get an answer from them, the case made for the delay being that they have so much work of another type in hands that it is only when an inspector of a special type is sent to that area that <Col N="1446" /> the problem will be decided.  It is really a legal question.  On that I can only get some sort of an ex-parte expression of opinion from the Land Commission officials. That, however, will not end the problem, if a particular owner tries to prevent certain people crossing his land in order to get seaweed.  As to the amount that will have to be handed over to him, that, of course, would have to be litigated on.</P>
      <P>The question of clay likely to be useful for potteries, was referred to. The particular area to which Deputy Kilroy referred was the area mainly for which I asked for a vote last year of £1,000 for the purpose of getting certain boring operations carried out.  Boring operations have, in fact, been carried out, and as a result we have a good idea of what is to be found there, but that does not, as some Deputies think, end the problem.  The question then arises of trying to get someone to form a company to develop an area, and get the deposits marketed in a commercial way.  The area to which the Deputy referred was investigated two or three years ago by an inquirer from the coast of Brittany. He went down there and carried his investigations to a certain point, after which the Department took it up.  More recently there looked to be a chance of development which has not come about yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cassidy had a lot to complain about in connection with the trade boards.  He complained that a chairman from outside the 26 County area is operating on a number of boards.  I do not know how many. It may be four.  We took the trade boards over as originally established. That particular gentleman is a man of considerable ability and skill in these matters.  His judgment has hitherto been found to be very accurate, fair and impartial on these trade boards.  I have never had any question raised as to his partiality, or to his incapacity in conducting these boards.  I cannot even understand the Deputy raising that point, but if he wishes I will discuss it with him.  The Deputy seems to think <Col N="1447" /> that it is a peculiar situation to have a Six County chairman over a Twenty-Six County board.  I have explained how the situation arose, and I do not propose to disturb a chairman who is acting in a very good way.  The Deputy wanted to know what steps were taken to have trade board minima rates paid.  The Deputy went on to describe the steps that had been taken, the implication being that those employed in the shirt-making industry in Donegal were not being paid the trade board minima rates; that after reports had been made inspectors were sent down, and that the proper wages are now enforced.  The other complaint was why were the officials told to keep secret information with regard to certain firms, or was it of their own volition?  I want to say that there is a definite obligation on officials in my Department, or rather there is a Departmental rule, not to convey the results of their investigations with regard to one firm to any other firm.  We do not want rivals in the same industry in a particular area to know all the ins and outs of the business of another firm.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ArchieJCassidy" hpid="Mr. Cassidy Mr. Cassidy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no obligation to give the information to them, nor do I see that any useful purpose could be served by giving it.  As to the setting up of a district committee under the Trade Board Acts, I did that at the instigation, not of some person who has affected the Deputy's imagination, but at the instigation of certain clergymen in Donegal, who represented to me, and I believe there is a certain amount of accuracy in it, that if the trade board rates were enforced as the minima rates at the point laid down originally, it would mean that there would be no business for out-workers in the County Donegal. Their attitude was that if the work for these out-workers disappeared <Col N="1448" /> there it would be worse than a reduction of 5/- in the case of old age pensioners from the point of view of the money brought into particular areas.  There is no question of sweating and no question of trying to protect sweaters.  There is the question of trying to get the district committees to look into the conditions that operate in country areas as compared with the towns, and a determination on that will be attended to in the ordinary way.</P>
      <P>As to the request made that I should expedite the report in connection with the Killybegs Harbour, I cannot give any promise on that. The report will deal with a number of other harbours, and I can assure the House that the report of the tribunal is being prepared as fast as it can be, and there is no avoidable delay.  Deputy Murphy referred to the carrying out of certain small marine works in the country.  I do not think that falls to my Department. As to the possibility of exploiting the barytes in the Deputy's area, that has been taken up many times.  We have been in communication with the proprietors and with the people interested, without any great success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot answer all Deputy Briscoe's questions, but I would like to say this to him in summary, that I cannot take, irrespective of people's rights, property from them. If I take property from them I must pay compensation.  The way in which people will achieve compensation is laid down in either the 1925 or 1927 Act.  I would ask the Deputy to bear this in mind, that most of the powers I have got with regard to the Shannon scheme arise under the 1925 Act.  I only, incidentally, get powers under the 1927 Act.  That Act empowers the Electricity Supply Board to do certain things.  On the matter of joining these reports together, I do not, even on the Deputy's reading of the section, believe that I have done anything illegal in asking them to present at the same time reports for 1927-28 and 1928-29.  I was horrified to learn that someone had <Col N="1449" /> pulled the Deputy's leg to the extent suggested in the last question, which had something to say about the payment of £600,000 into a fund, which apparently I had agreed to do, and that the nonperformance of that agreement was preventing certain arrangements regarding unemployment.  That is a fairy tale.  On the question of accidents I dealt with that to-day.  I think that proper provision has been made with regard to these accidents. <Col N="1450" /> There have been two deaths already, and in one case the coroner's comment was that this young man had no business to be climbing the pole, on which there was an indication of the danger incurred by doing so. That is the case in which the Deputy was trying to make out that a child was involved.  As far as I recollect, the phrase used by the coroner was &ldquo;this young man.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands and Fisheries whether he will state what action has been taken or it is proposed to take in regard to the petition signed by several tenants in the neighbourhood submitted to the Irish Land Commission in March, 1928, asking for the repair of the bridge over the River Cross at Cordroon, Co. Mayo.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission are not prepared to carry out any repairs to the bridge on the River Cross at Cordroon, or erect a new one, as this matter would appear to be one for consideration by the Drainage Board in that district.</P>
