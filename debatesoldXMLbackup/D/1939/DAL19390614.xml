      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that a serious outbreak of typhoid fever has occurred in the Ballydavid district, County Kerry, and that serious inconvenience has been caused by the absence of adequate accommodation for fever patients in Dingle; and, if so, whether he will state what steps have been taken to cope with the present outbreak, and whether, in view of these grave circumstances, he will take special steps to expedite the erection of a fever hospital in Dingle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that a serious outbreak of typhoid fever has occurred in the Ballydavid district, County Kerry, involving 50 families and a total of 90 cases. I am not aware that serious inconvenience has been caused by the non-existence of a fever hospital at Dingle, and no complaint on that matter has been received.  The district hospital at Dingle was made available for the reception of the fever patients to supplement the institutional accommodation at Tralee.  Some further cases were admitted to the fever hospital at Killarney.  The <Col N="830" /> ambulance service was adequate and satisfactory.</P>
      <P>The outbreak was dealt with by the county medical officer of health, the assistant county medical officer of health and the district medical officer of health.  The latter officer was relieved of his ordinary duties for this special work.  The Department's acting chief medical adviser and the medical inspector for the area cooperated with the local medical staff in coping with the outbreak, which appears to be well under control, only two cases having occurred since Thursday last, 8th instant.  As regards the final part of the question a final decision has not yet been come to.</P>

      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary also consider the necessity, seeing that the creamery has been shut, of compensating the people of this very poor district who have suffered losses as a result of this very serious outbreak?  Does he not consider that the people of the district do suffer grave inconvenience if fever patients, members of a family, have to be sent a distance of anything from 60 to 70 miles to a fever hospital? Does he not consider that that may have to a certain extent contributed to the spread of the outbreak, people being reluctant to send patients so far?  Further, seeing that the ordinary hospital in Dingle has been cleared to make room for fever patients, is that in itself not a hardship for that particular district?  Can he explain the delay in coming to a decision on the question of the erection of a fever hospital in Dingle?  Would he not consider the seriousness of the situation so far as Kerry is concerned owing to the absence of a fever hospital in Dingle and owing to the fact that the erection of the county fever hospital has, for some unexplained reason, also been so long delayed?  Is he not aware that already attention has been drawn to the fact that grave inconvenience has been caused as a result of the absence of a fever hospital in Dingle and that he himself answered a question on that subject within the last fortnight or <Col N="831" /> three weeks, when attention was drawn to it?</P>

      <P>The Deputy has raised quite a number of supplementary questions, some of which do not, I think, arise out of the question on the Order Paper.  For example, the question of consequential loss would scarcely arise out of the question of the provision of a fever hospital in Dingle.  At any rate, for the information of the Deputy on that aspect of the situation, I should like to say that it is being actively examined and that, so far as my information goes, active steps have been taken already to ensure that any consequential distress arising out of the outbreak will be dealt with and is being dealt with.</P>

      <P>That matter is being examined. Beyond that I cannot go at the moment.  On the question of the hardship or inconvenience that the Deputy suggests has been caused by having no fever hospital in Dingle, I am fully satisfied that there was no hardship resulting to the patients by the fact that a fever hospital is not available in Dingle.  The cases were removed to hospital, either to Dingle, where the local hospital was made available, to Tralee or to Killarney, as rapidly as the cases were notified and as soon as the patients were prepared to go <Col N="832" /> There was no great reluctance shown by the patients to take advantage of institutional treatment.  The Deputy will appreciate, I am sure, that an epidemic is an exceptional circumstance and that the question of establishing a fever hospital in Dingle will be determined on its merits without particular regard to the occurrence of the epidemic.  Epidemics occur from time to time in various districts and a fever hospital is not provided in every district where an epidemic of fever occurs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Parliamentary Secretary not recognise the extraordinary distances that have to be travelled, and how hard that is on the families of the different patients?  Will he not see that it is not a question of bringing Dingle people to Tralee or Killarney, but of bringing people who are almost as much west of Dingle, so far as communication is concerned, as Dingle is from Tralee, and that there will be a greater reluctance to notify when people know that the patients will have to be taken a long distance than there would be if the patients were treated in a place quite familiar to the people, namely, their own market town.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of this rather unusual kind of procedure I beg to move the motion standing in my name, namely, that the Estimate for the Department of the Taoiseach be referred back for reconsideration.  In the first place, I want to compliment the Taoiseach on his decision to cancel, or postpone, his tour in America.  For one thing it enables him to come before the House to defend the Estimate for his own Department, a thing that he could not have done if he had gone on the tour.  Since the last general election&mdash; I do not know whether it is considered action on his part or not&mdash;the Taoiseach has appeared very seldom in the House.  He does not appear here except when he is obliged to do so to answer questions addressed to him in his capacity as Taoiseach or as Minister for External Affairs.  I am glad, therefore, and I am sure my feelings are shared by other members, that the Taoiseach will, on this occasion, be available to defend not only the activities of his own Department but the policy of the Ministry as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The King of England can, if he thinks fit, tour America or other world countries without any bad effect upon the Government in his own country or on the Dominions over which he presides. He can, for instance, leave England, leaving a Prime Minister and a Cabinet behind him who have a clearcut policy which has been put before the people, which is understandable to the people, and which has been ratified by Parliament.  That Government is prepared to carry on while the King is away.  The same position does not obtain in the case of the Taoiseach, especially if he proposes to leave the country for a lengthy tour in another country.  The Taoiseach, when he leaves this country, as far as I can see, leaves a body of men behind him who will merely mark time while he is away, and will wait until he comes back to take orders from him in connection <Col N="841" /> with any serious matters that may have arisen during his absence.</P>
    <P>Now, in regard to the proposed tour, I would like, first of all, to ascertain from the Taoiseach whether the tour has been definitely cancelled or merely postponed.  In any case, I think I am entitled to ask the Taoiseach to give the House and the country information and justification as to why, when the tour was originally proposed, it was decided to bring with him such a large army of highly-paid civil servants.  I take it that the tour was not intended to serve a purely Party political purpose, and that, therefore, it was undertaken in the national interest.  I would like to hear the real reason and objective for engaging on such a lengthy tour.  I would like to hear from the Taoiseach why, for instance, he proposed, as he did originaly, to take with him the Deputy Director of Broadcasting. Surely, the Deputy Director of Broadcasting here was not going to be allowed to use the broadcasting machinery of America to throw out over the wires there whatever speeches might be made on this tour.</P>
    <P>I would also like to hear the reason why it was intended, as I believe it was originally, to bring on that tour the head of the Information Bureau attached to the Taoiseach's Department. I have personally advocated in this House as well as in another place &mdash;and all the members of our Party have supported the idea&mdash;the establishment of an information bureau.  It is not to be taken that my query in regard to this particular matter is put up because we are opposed to the establishment of an Information Bureau attached to the Government&mdash; in this case attached to the Department of the Taoiseach.  I should like to get from the Taoiseach some typical cases where this Information Bureau has served the national interests since it was established and attached to his Department.  Has this Information Bureau, or the head of the Information Bureau, been put there merely for the purpose of collecting and circulating information, or has he been put there for the purpose of suppressing the circulation of useful information? If he has been put there for <Col N="842" /> the purpose of collecting information for the guidance of the Government, of the Taoiseach and of his Ministry, then we should get some indications of cases where work of that kind has been done.  It is possible that we may have been reading something from this particular Department in some newspaper under a title which we could not identify.  I do not know.  At any rate, I certainly have not seen any great use made of this particular service, which ought to be a useful service from the national point of view.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Government, as the Taoiseach has explained here and elsewhere quite recently, is to work for the abolition of Partition.  Has he ever asked the head of the Information Bureau to get and give him information disclosing the extent to which the taxpayers of Great Britain have to maintain an army of occupation in the Six Counties, and to subsidise the various public services in the Six Counties?  If he has been given information by the head of the Information Bureau, then I say he should give it to every Deputy of this House and to the people of the country, who are prepared to back the Government in endeavouring to get rid of Partition as soon as possible.  If, for instance, information of that kind were circulated to the British people&mdash;apart from the value of its circulation to the Irish in America, or to the American people or the people of the world as a whole &mdash;it would force the British taxpayers to come to their senses, and to come up against the question as to whether the game is worth the candle.  Has the head of this Information Bureau ever been asked to supply the Taoiseach or the Government with information showing the comparative benefits that are given by the Government now carrying on in the Six Counties to persons who are unable to find work, to the aged poor, or to widows and orphans, or to supply information concerning the cost of living there as against here?  It would be a very useful thing for the Government if such information were asked for and given.  If it has been asked for and given, I say that we, as Deputies of this House, are entitled to that information.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="843" /> The Information Bureau attached to the Department of the Taoiseach is costing the taxpayers of this country, according to the Estimate which I have before me, the sum of £1,531 and bonus.  On many occasions here in this House, and in correspondence also, I have attacked the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance for the failure of his Department to provide miserably mean, small sums for the carrying out of relief works in my constituency, and I have always got the answer: &ldquo;The money is not available.  Where is the money to be found?&rdquo;  I am sure that every Deputy in this House who takes an interest in the affairs of his constituency has had the same experience. If we have to find £1,531 and bonus for a Department of this kind &mdash;which might be made a useful Department&mdash;it should serve some useful purpose.  As far as I am concerned, and I am speaking for this Party here, I say that up to the present that Department has not shown any evidence that it is serving any useful national purpose.  If there is a case to be made for its continuance, let the Taoiseach make it in his reply. Let him defend the existence and the continuance, as well as the cost, of this particular section of his Department.</P>
    <P>In connection with the agitation for the abolition of Partition, could not this Department be asked to supply not alone the Taoiseach but Deputies of this House with information concerning the victimisation of the Nationalist minority in the North by the six-County Government?  Many statements have been made on this subject on public platforms in the Six Counties and in this State, statements which some people say cannot be backed by facts, but I am sure the head of the Information Bureau&mdash;who is a very competent man; he is a very highly qualified journalist&mdash;could, if he is given the permission or the order, get information of that kind and circulate it to the different bodies which are standing for the abolition of Partition, as well as for the purpose of trying to secure for our Nationalist <Col N="844" /> fellow-countrymen in the North a fairer living than they are apparently getting there at the present time.  We should like to have information of that kind.  The Taoiseach and his Ministry and those who sit behind him here in this House are not alone in their endeavours to remove Partition.  Every Deputy sent into this House has been sent here with a mission to help whoever wants to remove Partition.  I listened to the Taoiseach on a recent occasion in College Green when he spoke as if no Deputy and no Party in this House, except the Fianna Fáil Party, was in favour of doing away with Partition.  We know that he is in favour of doing away with Partition, but we are not quite sure as to the method by which he has decided to achieve that very desirable purpose. Is Partition going to be removed by sending up the Minister for Defence with his Army of 30,000 to fight those who occupy the Six Counties against the will of the majority of the people of this country?  I dare say the Taoiseach will answer, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;  Is he going to abolish Partition by applying the method of economic pressure?  I dare say the Taoiseach or his Government is not in favour of the activities of those who are carrying on another kind of operation in another country at the present time.  At any rate, we are entitled to know&mdash;especially when the Taoiseach proposes to go on a tour to America for the purpose of dealing with this particular question&mdash;what is the policy which the Government has adopted for the purpose of removing Partition.  Whatever it is, at any rate he will get the support of every member sitting on these benches in his endeavour to wipe out this unnatural boundary within the country.  If we had information of the kind I have suggested supplied to us through the head of this Information Bureau it would help those who are willing to go on platforms for this purpose to make a better case than is being made at present for the abolition of the Border.</P>
    <P>In regard to the cost of living in the Six Counties as against the Twenty-Six Counties, the figures are very interesting to those who are concerned in matters of this kind.  Within the last few days, I have taken the trouble to look <Col N="845" /> up authentic Government publications and documents of an international character which contain figures dealing with the cost of living here as compared with the Six Counties.  They showed that the cost of bread here is 24 per cent. higher than in the Six Counties. Those who have to live by bread are naturally not going to go out of their way to help to wipe out Partition when that item of domestic necessity is against them.</P>

      <P>The cost of flour, about which Deputy Dillon knows more than I do, is 21 per cent. more in this State than in the Six Counties.  There may be some justification given in cases of that kind for an increased cost here as against the cost in the Six Counties because we are making most of our own flour here, or a very high percentage of it, and that may explain it to some extent, but when one comes to the cost of rice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the Vote for the Taoiseach's Department, particularly when there is a motion to refer back, matters of general policy for which the Government as a whole is responsible, and not matters of detail which might have been and in fact were raised on the various Estimates, should be discussed.  The price of bread or rice is too detailed a matter to dwell on in connection with whatever question of policy the Deputy desires to discuss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy had not been so irritated by the cost of commodities which he probably does not consume, I would have come to the point I want to make.  I could give him the comparative cost of commodities which he probably does consume, and he would probably take a different <Col N="846" /> view, and would not draw your attention, Sir, to the fact that I was doubtfully out of order on the matter.  However, the point I want to make with regard to the prices which I have given is that members of this Party, including myself, have in this House on the Estimate for the Minister for Industry and Commerce protested against his failure to take the necessary steps to regulate the cost of living within reasonable limits.  The Taoiseach is responsible for his appointment as Minister for Industry and Commerce, and I am raising now, as a matter of public policy, the excessive cost of living in this State, because, as Minister for Industry and Commerce, he is not doing his duty according to our view.</P>
      <P>Deputy Moore does not want me to read down the list, which might be very annoying to him.  At any rate, I hope the Taoiseach understands the point I am making.  The excessive cost of living is the cause of a considerable amount of agitation in this country at the moment.  Demands have been submitted to the Minister for Industry and Commerce, and to the Government as a whole, that steps should be taken to deal with the excessive profits of the flour millers and the bacon curers, and nothing has been done up to the present.  I hope the Taoiseach, in his reply, will defend the inaction, if he can defend it, of his Minister for Industry and Commerce in matters of this kind, or indicate, on the other hand, if action is likely to be taken to limit in some way the excessive profits which the flour millers, the bacon curers, and other people of that kind are making at the expense of the community as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter of policy to which the Taoiseach has been referring in recent speeches outside this House.  I have no reason whatever to doubt his sincerity on this matter, but his sincerity on the question of the extent to which Irish should be a subject for advancement in the Civil Service is a matter that can be tested by figures and facts.  On a recent occasion we had a discussion in this House as to why certain persons looking for certain public positions should have a competent knowledge of Irish <Col N="847" /> and be capable of conducting the business of this House and the other House of the Oireachtas in the Irish language. That can be taken, I admit, as an indication of the viewpoint of the Government on the matter, although their action in regard to one certain proposal is a very doubtful one. I understand that one man who was nominated for the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle of this House had a knowledge of Irish.</P>

      <P>I am referring to his reply to a question of mine with regard to the Irish Sugar Manufacturing Company.  We were told in this House some time ago by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is quite capable of making a very persuasive bluffing speech, that we were the representatives of the taxpayers in this country.  But when I ask for information from the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce in regard to the operations, or the financial arrangements, of the Peat Development Board, the Irish Sugar Manufacturing Company and the Industrial Alcohol Company I am told that it is not in the public interest to give the information which any representative of the taxpayers would get at an ordinary meeting of the shareholders of a tontine society, much less a meeting of the shareholders of the State.  As a matter of fact, I might say for the information of the Taoiseach, if he does not know it, that similar information to that which I asked for quite recently&mdash;not for any political purpose, as can be well understood&mdash;was given to Deputy Dillon in 1936, while information of the same kind was refused to me by no less a person than the eloquent Minister for Finance quite recently.  I say that a Minister for Finance and a Minister for Industry and Commerce who are capable of conducting themselves like that are not fit to occupy their position, and the Taoiseach is bound to answer for their activities in these matters on this Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="849" /> The Minister for Finance drew that from me.</P>
    <P>The principal reason why I am moving that this Vote should be referred back is because I am fully satisfied, and the members of this Party are satisfied, that this Government will never carry out the policy which they propose to carry out, so far as one can understand it, unless the existing policy of our banking institutions is completely changed. Does the Taoiseach, as the Head of a Government elected in the most democratic way by the people of the country, believe that he can solve the problem of unemployment within the existing banking system?  He said on one occasion that if he could not solve the problem within the system he would go outside the system.  I am taking advantage of his Estimate to ask him whether, after an experience of seven years, he can now make up his mind whether he can do what he promised to do within the existing banking system.  Almost all the wealth of this country comes from arable land, and the land, for reasons unknown to me, is worthless as security for a loan to many of the so-called bankers at the present time. Does the Taoiseach know the value of the arable land of this State in millions?  Does he know that it is not worth a brass farthing to any bank as security for a loan?  How then can the Minister for Agriculture or other Ministers expect farmers to work harder and to produce more if they cannot get working capital or credit facilities to enable them to do so? That is the problem this Government must face up to after their seven years of office.  A Banking Commission was set up in 1934, and it sat for four years, and made a number of reports during that time.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance sat like a dummy when his Estimate, the Budget, and the Second Reading of the Finance Bill were before the House, when I put questions to him as to whether the Government had made up its mind as to what it was going to do on the various matters that arise out of the Banking Commission's report.  The Minister made no attempt to answer and, in <Col N="850" /> view of his failure to give the House and the country an indication as to the future financial policy of the Government, it is the duty of the Taoiseach to try to do so.  The land, which is the source of so much wealth, has not alone to produce food for the people, but the surplus that has to be exported to balance our economy with another country.  The land is now, and will be, in the future, to greater extent the source from which the raw material will have to come for our new industries, but as security it is now worthless to the banking institutions, the moneylenders and the gombeen men.  It is a terrible state of affairs, after having the power to elect a Government, of which the Taoiseach is the head, that some 40&mdash;not more than 50&mdash; people outside this House, who have no association with the Government, can dictate financial policy.  It is time that state of affairs was brought to an end, and it is time that the Taoiseach and his Ministry, as well as the machined majority behind them, took their courage in their hands and studied the evidence submitted to the Banking Commission.</P>
    <P>I am the son of a farmer, and, all belonging to me are associated with the farming community.  I know the way the farmers, particularly in my constituency, are suffering as a result of the existing banking system and its operations. The banking policy carried on here is dictated from Threadneedle Street, through College Green, and they are left by the Minister for Finance to operate at their sweet will. It is good policy for those who dictate financial policy from College Green through Threadneedle Street to prevent the development of this country in any direction that will interfere in any way with British interests.  If we are going to get the farmers to work hard and to produce more food for people who are hungry or half-hungry at home, or to produce more for export to a neighbouring State, in order to balance our national economy, the question of providing capital and credit will have to be tackled.  Farmers must be provided with working capital and credit if they are to be expected within reason to respond to the call of the Minister for Agriculture. <Col N="851" /> What is the position in connection with the banks?  The poorer the people grow the higher are the dividends paid to the shareholders of the banks.  Figures available from the report of the Banking Commission prove that.  The paid-up capital of Irish banks operating within this State amounts to £8,262,000, while the reserves, apart from the dividends, amount to £9,170,000, so that to the original shareholders according to these returns, the Irish banks are in a position to repay every eight years the amount of the original capital invested by them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Their legal successors are there.  Banks operating here pay in dividends 12 per cent., 16 per cent., and up to 20 per cent. to the shareholders free of income-tax. Where is that money coming from?  It is coming from the land, but the banks will not lend a brass farthing to those on the land, although the Minister for Agriculture and the Taoiseach say that it is necessary to do so.  The rates of interest charged by these banks are prohibitive&mdash;they are next door to those charged by Jews&mdash;from the point of view of overhead charges.  That accounts for the bank's reserves as well as the high rate of dividends they pay.  According to returns the amount of money shown to be invested by the banks operating here is £86,000,000. That money was made out of the soil of this State.  How is it invested? They have £7,000,000 invested within the State and £79,000,000 invested outside it.  The assets of these same banks are shown in the report of the Banking Commission to be £196,000,000 but £130,000,000 are outside this State and £66,000,000 within the State.  I dare say these figures explain, to some extent, the anti-Irish operations of the people who, at present, dictate our whole financial policy.  I wonder has <Col N="852" /> the Taoiseach, who I understand, is a very deep reader, read anything that might interest him about the Government of New Zealand since the present Labour Government came into office. For instance, has he studied the position that the Labour Government of New Zealand were confronted with on the part of the bankers when they came into office some years ago?  Has he seen how very successfully they countered the operations of people who had a hold of the money machine when Mr. Savage's Government came in?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy had some contact with people from New Zealand recently, and I am sure if he was interested he could have asked questions about that.  If he did he would have got an answer.  I could not answer.  It would be interesting to Deputies who dislike the existing banking system to read the recent history of the operations of the New Zealand Labour Government, to see how they faced up to the problem in that country.  The problem there was far greater than any the Taoiseach has had to face since he came into office. There was an idea amongst some people associated with the Government that we could not pay anything more than 30/- a week to an unskilled labourer and not more than £2 5s. od. a week to a transport worker.  The Government should look up the rates of wages and conditions of service for all classes of workers employed in New Zealand and also look up the figures concerning the cost of living and compare these figures with those prevailing here.  A worker in New Zealand can buy more for 17/10d than a worker here can buy for £1.  These figures are quoted from returns issued by the International Labour Office.  I presume the information supplied to that office by the Department of Industry and Commerce here is similar to that supplied by the same Department of the New Zealand Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whether the Government accepts what I say or not in regard to the operation and the influence of the banking <Col N="853" /> institutions on Government policy, they must face up to these facts, that there is a shortage of working capital and a complete lack of credit amongst the farming community.  There is a certain acreage of arable land derelict. Does the Taoiseach know to what extent arable land is derelict, and the reason for that position?  Does he know that during the past 12 years many of those who were landless men and uneconomic holders were not able to get the advantages that they should get, simply because they could not get cheap money or, in fact, money at any price?  They will not get money from the banks, and the Government is doing nothing, except in very exceptional cases, to provide money at ridiculously high rates through the agency of the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  That corporation is just as bad as any of the ordinary banking institutions in that respect.  The rates of interest, and the machinery that has to be gone through to get even one loan, out of every ten applications, are ridiculous. No Deputy on the Government Benches will suggest that the facilities provided through the Agricultural Credit Corporation for getting capital meet the reasonable needs of the farming community.</P>
    <P>I know of many cases in my constituency for a period of years where the best men that could be found got holdings from the Land Commission, and they had to let that land in some cases to the landlords from whom it was previously taken.  I quoted one case here a couple of years ago where eight landless men, who got land from the Land Commission on one particular estate, had to sub-let their land to the grazier from whom it was originally taken.  I am sure there are other Deputies who can quote similar cases. I merely quote those cases to support the plea to the Taoiseach, and through him to the Ministry as a whole, that this question must be faced and dealt with without further delay. The longer you delay taking a decision concerning the provision of better credit facilities for the farming community, the nearer they are going to bankruptcy.  I would be the last person to say that this country is <Col N="854" /> becoming bankrupt.  This country has unlimited resources for development, but apparently the people who are going to say whether these resources will be used or not, are the people who control the banking system and who have no direct connection with the Government here.</P>
    <P>The Government can provide money for some things whenever they think fit to do so.  They went to the country last year and asked for a public subscription to the Financial Agreement Loan in order to pay to the British Government a sum of money which was previously stated not to be due.  That loan was over-subscribed.  I daresay it was over-subscribed by people who would prefer to subscribe to a loan to repay England rather than subscribe to a loan for the development of their native country.  It is a peculiar mentality, but the fact remains that that loan was over-subscribed.  In this year's Estimates we have provision made, at the request of the Minister for Defence, for expenditure under various Army services of a sum of £10,000,000.  If we can get £9,000,000 or £10,000,00 to buy guns and bombs and bayonets from the British&mdash;and I daresay they are being bought from the British more than from any other country&mdash;for the purpose, if you like, of defending this country&mdash;and nobody knows who is going to attack us&mdash; surely it would be a much more deserving thing to provide money for the purpose of increasing our food supplies and enabling the people who live on the land to make a decent livelihood.</P>
    <P>We can provide endless sums of money for pensions for able-bodied men, although the Taoiseach said at one time that he would see to it that pensions would not be given to able-bodied men.  There have been two pensions provided in some cases for certain persons when they decided to retire from political life.  That is the information contained in records recently submitted to me by the Minister for Finance, and those records include the names of a considerable number of Deputies who sit across there on the benches behind the Government. There are three pensions in some cases.</P>

How can we solve unemployment unless we remedy the position of the people who work on the land?  Certain figures have been quoted&mdash;their accuracy has not been challenged&mdash;to show that there has been a decline in the number of persons employed on the land of £43,000 inside the last few years.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or who listened to the gloomy reception which our new colleague received to-day might come to the conclusion that Fianna Fáil were down and out.  That they are slipping is certainly true, but they are not down and out, and they are not down and out because they have, as leader, one of the astutest politicians in Europe. He has been greatly disgruntled and considerably alarmed, and he is now busily engaged in investigating the contents of his political bag of tricks, and he will bring something out of it; do not be a bit uneasy about that! My heart really bled for the disheartened colleagues of our new and very welcome recruit to-day, and I thought it only right, as soon as I could, to bring them that message of encouragement; they are only slipping; they are not done for yet.  They should take heart, and I suggest that, at the conclusion of the Taoiseach's observations, when he is replying, they might show what they can really do in the way of giving a good hand for a good performance, just to show the world that their spirit is not altogether crushed by the first of what are going to be many electoral reverses.  While they may very well take courage from the knowledge that their leader, the Taoiseach, is a pastmaster of political manoeuvre, I think it right, on this occasion, to remind the House that, while political manoeuvring may do much to retrieve the fallen fortunes of a political Party, it can do very little indeed to retrieve the fallen fortunes of a nation or to avert the inevitable consequences of economic error.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin, to-day, gave us the benefit of his views on banking, and as I listened to Deputy Davin in 1939, I could not help being reminded of Deputy MacEntee in 1929.  One saw every weather-beaten old bird of economic heresy, which was released by Deputy MacEntee in 1929, flapping drearily over from Deputy Davin's extended hand to light upon the shoulder of the Minister for Finance to-day, and the Minister winced as each bird perched.  Now, I think it is quite true, and I think the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach are beginning to realise it, that the <Col N="860" /> economic state of this country is now extremely precarious, and my purpose to-day, is to provide the Taoiseach with an opportunity of telling us what the Government proposes to do about it.</P>
    <P>Public expenditure in this country has gone up, since 1931, from £31,852,000 to something in the neighbourhood of £45,000,000 per annum at the present time.  That represents the national expenditure and the expenditure of local authorities.  Undeniably, that has resulted in an acceleration of the circulation of money, and the banknote issue has expanded, largely, if not entirely, due to that public expenditure. The national income has materially decreased; but in addition to those two extremely alarming features in the national balance sheet we find that our liabilities are rising and our assets are dwindling, and the Minister for Finance, very prudently, in his Budget statement, directed the attention of this House and of the people to that fact and warned them that we were straitened and in stringent circumstances and that he was battling desperately with a very grave financial emergency which must end in disaster if certain contingencies, over which we had no control, came to pass. I am sorry to say that it is pretty generally accepted now that the contingency of a European war will come to pass before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>What are our liabilities?  They have been set out very cogently in the Banking Commission report, and, much as that document is contemned by certain Deputies in this House, at least it will be agreed that it is a very valuable repository of information.  In paragraph 511 of the report, the commission directs the attention of the country to the fact that we are building up a growing liability with every acre of land we distribute.  Prior to 1933, the distribution of land was an economic operation except for the Improvement Grant.  Since 1933, every acre of land we distribute involves the State in a burden of 50 per cent. of its entire value, and the more land we distribute the greater becomes our dead-weight debt.  In addition to that, we <Col N="861" /> have accepted the policy of migration from the West to the central plains of Ireland, the expense of the administration of which is positively terrifying, and if it is to be pursued we have got to recognise that it is going to involve us in an ever-increasing burden of dead-weight debt.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies, when they read the Estimates and see them rising, seeing the administrative expenses of each Department of State increase, forget that that is only part of the story; because in this country we have made no actuarial provision at all for the pension rights of our civil servants or any of our public servants.  Now, we started out in this State with an average age level in the Civil Service. For the first 15 years of the State, with the exception of the Treaty rights which were claimed, we had little normal superannuation from public services.  But now we are going to have the normal requirements of the Civil Service, with the result that in place of every public servant that we now have, when they retire, we are going to have two, one pensioned and one doing the work that that servant was doing before he retired.  Now, remember that the contingent liability for the pensions of all those public servants is a very formidable sum which is going to accumulate into a larger and larger annual charge for the next 15 or 20 years.</P>
    <P>Deputies often here speak quite cheerfully of borrowing to balance the Budget or borrowing to meet services that they think very necessary and desirable.  Do they ever recall that every £ you borrow imposes an annual charge upon the Budget?  Do they realise that in 1924 our annual debt charge was £120,000?  That is all the public debt of this country cost us in interest charges.  In 1937 the annual debt charge is £2,377,000 and will very shortly approach £3,000,000. If Deputies will go a little further, I think they may be astonished to discover the dead-weight debt of this State.  We started without any debt at all.  In 1921, when this State was launched, we had no public debt at all, and we got under the impression then that our debt position <i>vis-á-vis</i> other <Col N="862" /> countries similarly situated to us was peculiarly advantageous.  We have thrown that whole advantage away. Our gross public debt has grown from nothing to £79,000,000 in the last 15 years.  Remember that is the gross debt.  Against that we hold assets, but even our dead-weight debt has risen from nothing to £37,262,000.  And remember that when you value assets you very frequently put upon them a very optimistic valuation; when you value debts they are there in black and white.  There is no escaping from them.  Certain it is that some day we have got to pay somebody £79,000,000 and, in the meantime, we have got to pay interest on the loan.  It is true that we have certain assets upon which a value has been put, but what those assets will realise if they ever come to be realised is quite another story, and what they may pay to us from year to year to meet the charges on the gross debt is highly problematical.</P>
    <P>That is not all, because, over and above the direct debt charges of which we know and the contingent liability for superannuation payments to which I have referred, we have also established legal machinery whereby the State guarantees certain loans.  The liability under that is a fluctuating one, but in 1937 it was known to amount to £2,308,000.  If any of those loans should default the State will have to find funds to redeem it.</P>
    <P>Amongst the assets which we set against our gross debt there are shares in companies such as the Industrial Credit Company which, in my opinion, are worth little or nothing.  If it is hard to arrive at any correct valuation for them, it is at least right to realise that our liabilities at present are immense, considering our resources, and that they are growing and must grow.</P>

      <P>Before I turn to the assets side, let me here interpolate that when you get a Deputy like Deputy Hickey, the Lord Mayor of Cork, who is a responsible man and a prominent man, facing the picture that I have <Col N="863" /> drawn with murmurs about changing the system, and Deputy Davin talking about banks, knowing as much about banks as my foot, we realise the full measure of the Government's iniquity because they have drawn well-intentioned and honest men into the temptation of trying methods to relieve the country from the disaster that that Government has brought upon it, which those who understand economics and banking realise will bring far greater disaster upon us.  When the Minister for Finance tries to explain to Deputy Hickey and to Deputy Davin the perils of the courses they advocate he will find he is talking to an absolutely blank wall&mdash;and I mean no disrespect to Deputy Hickey or Deputy Davin.  But difficult, impossible, as the task may be of explaining to them the perils of the courses they advocate, it is nothing compared with the difficulty of explaining those perils to the mass of the electorate of this country who are invited by responsible, honest, well-meaning men to adopt radical methods to deal with admitted evils and who are assured by those well-meaning men that those methods will provide the key to solve the problem.  The Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach, having brought the country into the position when we begin thinking of such methods, find themselves charged with the task of explaining the perils to the public and discover that they might as well be addressing them in Sanscrit or Persian for all the impression they can make upon their minds.  That is one great crime with which I indict the Taoiseach and the Government at the present time, not only for having pursued courses the logical conclusions of which are national bankruptcy, but for having brought our people within the range of the temptation to resort to uncontrolled inflation and wild economic experiments which must ultimately react upon the poor of this country and virtually upon the poor alone because, as I have pointed out in this House before, the rich will go and take their money with them, just as they did in Australia, just as they did in New Zealand and just as they did in Newfoundland, and will leave the <Col N="864" /> poor behind to suffer.  When the suffering is over the rich can come back and collect the spoils.</P>
      <P>Look at the other side of the balance sheet&mdash;our assets side.  We heard Deputy Davin raving about the holdings of the banks, the profits they made, as if no bank had any deposits at all, and that they had invested all their profits outside the country.  One of the grimmest features of the present situation is that the banks' holdings and securities outside this country have been steadly dwindling.  The net external assets of the joint stock banks of this country began to dwindle three years ago and they have never stopped. Up to last year they were dwindling slowly and steadily.  In the last six months they have begun to fall catastrophically, and the Minister for Finance knows it.  Remember this, that as they fall one of our most valuable invisible exports falls with them&mdash;the interest that we got on those investments from the countries where we had investments.  Those external assets are to this country the same property as that which makes Great Britain wealthy in her own right. What is it that makes Great Britain the greatest mercantile State in the world?  What is it that gave her trade in all five Continents, and makes her to-day the only rival of the greatest military power in Europe?  It is the external assets of her citizens.  We were one of the only small countries in the world that had wealth comparable with that wealth of England, and we see it dwindling rapidly as it is dwindling to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that the people of this country who had high standards of living are going to have forced upon them a lower standard of living, inevitably and certainly, coupled with the fact that the joint stock banks of this country are becoming choked with Government paper.  The time has passed for discreet silence: now is the time&mdash;while there is still a chance to save the situation&mdash;to speak frankly. The banks of this country have taken up as much of the Government paper as they can with safety take and we find £5,000,000 of short-term loan unfunded.  At this moment, £5,000,000 is outstanding on short-term loan and <Col N="865" /> we have got to look for money wherewith to fund it.  That short-term loan is at present saddled on the joint stock banks who already have in their portfolios an undue proportion of Government paper.  The Minister for Finance knows that.</P>
    <P>What is the result of the 5/6 income-tax? One of the first results is, that it has stopped saving amongst the people, because there is no surplus to save.  People save only after they have provided themselves with that standard of living to which they have been accustomed.  If you impose upon them an altogether unprecedented income-tax rate, they are not going to reduce the standard of living overnight: they simply stop saving.  If that is allowed to become a permanent factor in our life, it may be that we shall find it hard to re-establish a margin of saving for years to come. For some time after the first impact has had its effect people stop saving, and saving in this country has now stopped.</P>
    <P>Anyone who is trading in rural Ireland knows the condition of trade. There is no shopkeeper in rural Ireland at the present time, I believe, who is earning his expenses.  I doubt if many farmers are making profit.  Unemployment is rising.  It is true that the published figure is kept in some control by the tide of emigration flowing to Great Britain but remember that, after years of that steady flow, they are going still.  They came up with me on the train to-day&mdash;they were emigrants for England.  If that tide were not flowing, the unemployment figures would be absolutely staggering. But, even with that immense exodus of young people&mdash;some of them going in the knowledge that they are in danger of being conscripted in Great Britain &mdash;we still have an immense army of unemployed.  I do not think anyone driving through the streets of Dublin will deny that poverty is still widespread. Drive through Buckingham Street, Rutland Street, Mountjoy Square or Gloucester Street, or most parts of that constituency where we had a by-election so recently, and you will find plenty of poverty still, never mind that poverty which we all know <Col N="866" /> in rural Ireland, which never is as arresting or cruel as the poverty of city life, because it is tempered by the charity of neighbours.  Not, indeed, that charity is unknown in the tenement houses of Dublin: perhaps there is more charity there than in many places in the country, but unfortunately they have not got the same resources to help neighbours as are happily still surviving in rural parts of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The transport system has broken down.  Railways are bankrupt&mdash;and that, after we have passed drastic legislation, five years ago, which we were sure was going to save the situation for all time.  I have got here the balance of trade figures.  We used to be told that the adverse trade balance of £11,000,000 on a total trade of £95,000,000, spelt bankruptey.  We were told that by the present Minister for Finance, at a time when our invisible exports were substantial.  To-day we have an adverse trade balance of £16,000,000 on a total trade of £67,000,000; and it has been as high recently as £22,000,000 on a total trade of £60,000,000.</P>
    <P>There is, however, a far more sinister and dangerous fact existing than those deplorable figures relating to the trade of this country.  When we had an adverse trade balance of £11,000,000 on a total trade of £95,000,000, we had a steadily increasing quantity of invisible exports.  What is the position in regard to those invisible exports now?  Remember that the invisible exports of this State&mdash;if we are to judge by the returns of the joint stock banks from year to year&mdash;were more than enough to cover the visible adverse trade balance prior to 1931. What are the principal invisible exports of this State?  They are the interest from investments abroad, the receipts from emigrants' remittances, the sweepstakes, the British pensions and the tourist traffic.  All of these were on the up-grade in 1931, and they were more than enough to extinguish the adverse trade balance, and they were increasing.  What are they now? I have not by me at the moment the figures for the external assets of the joint stock banks, but I may have them <Col N="867" /> before I sit down.  They are going down rapidly, and as they go down the interest on our investments held abroad must go down too.  It is common knowledge that it is.</P>
    <P>Emigrants' remittances have virtually stopped.  Eight years ago we derived an astonishing annual income from the remittances of those who went out to the United States of America.  Anyone who understands that business, or who lives amongst the people, realises that the history of that remittance business was that the emigrant who went to America sent home a portion of his earnings to his parents&mdash;or her parents&mdash;for the first ten or 12 years of his sojourn in the United States.  By that time the emigrant married and settled down and the remittances tended to dwindle away&mdash;certainly as an annual amount. But, as the remittances of one flight of emigrants dwindled away, another flight of emigrants took their place; and so a constant stream of remittances was maintained and did, in fact, become a very substantial invisible export of this country.  With the cessation of emigration to America which took place during Mr. Cosgrave's régime, that stream of remittances began to dwindle, and, as it is now approaching ten years since emigration stopped, the stream of remittances has almost completely ended&mdash;and there is no sign of its beginning again.  It is true that some money comes in from England, but it is nothing to compare with the remittances that came in from the United States in the past.</P>
    <P>There can be little doubt that the sweepstakes will not yield the same return in the future as they have yielded in the past.  With every public disturbance the world over their interest and fascination for the world tends to dwindle.  They will progressively decline over the next ten, 15 or 20 years.  We had a very large income in this country from the pensions payable to persons who had been in the British service and who are now resident in Éire.  These people are dying off, and others are going to live in England, with resultant loss of that invisible export to this State.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="868" /> Another item, to which I do not think even the Banking Commission has directed its attention, is that we are acquiring an invisible import, a liability, because a great many of the old people who owned land in this country, and who were bought out under the Land Acts, had their life and being in this country, but they educated their children in England, and, as they are dying off, the younger people who have made their lives in England, do not come to live here and the income and property of their parents is distributed amongst the young people, all of whom are living abroad, with the result that if the old people held British securities, we lose the invisible export of the interest payments which they received.  If they hold Irish securities, those securities are transferred to external ownership and become for us, in the matter of trade balance, an invisible import which will tend to grow.  The tourist traffic, we were led to believe, would provide a substantial asset, but if we are to continue blowing up the post offices of the British people, and generally creating pandemonium, and painting the blank walls of Killarney with: &ldquo;Damn your concessions, Enland,&rdquo; and &ldquo;To hell with Great Great Britain,&rdquo; I cannot see the tourist industry in this country developing on a very handsome scale.  We must pay the price of our patriotism in the economic consequences of our own acts.</P>
    <P>I take this occasion to say to the Taoiseach who, after all, is ultimately responsible for the policy of the Government: &ldquo;What are you going to do about it?&rdquo;  We, the Opposition, perpetrated one serious error in the last five years, that is, that we foresaw the present situation too soon. Five years ago, we told the Taoiseach that his policy must inevitably end in the bankruptcy of this country, and I do not deny that that superbly astute political operator extracted considerable kudos from going out and saying: &ldquo;We are not `bust' yet; they have been telling us that we are going `bust,' but we are not.  Look at us&mdash; we are blooming.&rdquo;  His colleague, the Minister for Finance, has been growing a little gloomy, however, in the <Col N="869" /> last few years.  The Taoiseach is still radiant and quite cheerful, but I notice that the Minister for Finance slumps a little lower in his chair every time he returns to the charge, and I do not blame him.  The trouble of it is that when he and the Taoiseach were in optimistic humour together, they were in step.  Unfortunately, they have got out of step now, and the Minister for Finance is learning more quickly than the Taoiseach, and woe betide any colleague of the Taoiseach who ever lets him see that he thinks he knows more than the Taoiseach, because Jonah never went down the whale's throat more quickly than that colleague of the Taoiseach will go.</P>
    <P>So long as you sit at the feet of the god and adore, you are quite welcome to share in the reflected glory, but start to climb up towards his knees, and a very different tale will be told. The <i>Irish Times</i> need lay no soothing unction to its soul that if they secure the support of the Minister for Finance, the day is won.  Little they know the Machiavellian operator they are conspiring against.  The dagger in his sleeve is quite as ready as the gentle word, and so long as the gentle word will persuade the <i>Irish Times</i> to assure the residents of Pembroke that Mr. de Valera is not as bad as he looks, the gentle word will be forthcoming, but if they imagine that, by capturing the Minister for Finance, they can stay the Taoiseach's career, the dagger will emerge from the sleeve with equal certitude and lethal effect.</P>
    <P>I want to try to open the eyes of the Taoiseach to the emergency into which he has brought this country, and to ask him what is he going to do about it. Deputy Davin wants him to do what New Zealand did.  I told him, four years ago, that he would find himself confronted with the dilemma of Newfoundland. Newfoundland had to call the British into Newfoundland, and New Zealand had to send its Minister for Finance to what Deputy Davin calls Thread-the-Needle Street, and he is there now, and he will stay there until he gets money from the British Government to stop the leaks which his policy have put in the bottom of the <Col N="870" /> ship of New Zealand finance.  Are we going to Thread-the-Needle Street, or are we going to invite British Treasury officials over here to run this country?  God forbid that that day should ever come; but, as certainly as we are standing in this House, if measures, and active measures are not taken soon to correct the economic position of this country and to re-establish its finance on sound foundations, to Thread-the-Needle Street the Taoiseach will have to go, and he can bring Deputy Davin with him.</P>

      <P>He will never bring me. I have a warm regard for the British people in their own country.  They have great qualities, but God forbid that I should ever appear a beggar at their gates.  No one belonging to me ever brought this country there in that capacity.  It is left to the latter-day patriots to do that, and they know it. If they bring a financial crisis on this country, in the present state of the world, that is the fate that awaits us. Enemies, aye, and misguided friends, of this country have often said in public that they wished this country could be induced to declare a republic, because if it had the experience of the economic consequences of that isolation, it would be only too glad to crawl back into the Empire in a couple of years.  That has been said in this House and it has been said by men who really loved this country, but who little understood it, and it is being said now by the enemies of this country in Great Britain.  I have heard them say it.  The very individuals whom Deputies on the benches opposite think are clinging to this country and desirous of binding it with bonds of steel to Great Britain are, in fact, at this moment, clamouring to get this country to declare a republic, so that they could enjoy its subsequent humiliation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that is the point to which we are being brought by the Government in office at the present time.  It will be a solace and a joy to everybody who has belied this country in the past and to everybody who hates it now to have <Col N="871" /> the country brought to this point. Imagine the feelings of our people the world over, imagine our own people here in Ireland and what their feelings will be if this country goes burst. Conceive the feelings of people in America, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and all over the world who have held their heads high and boasted of their Irish extraction and gloried in the fact that when our own people here got control of Ireland that they would make this country happy and prosperous. Imagine their feelings now when we are made public fools of by our own financial ineptitude. Remember this, that democracy is but poorly qualified to deal with finance and financial matters. Therefore, there rests upon the public men of our country the responsibility to deal capably with these financial matters and not to bring the people into the danger of seduction by the hair-brained inflator who is often an honest, decent fellow trying to deal with dynamite, the nature of which he does not understand.  But once you get inflation going, you reach a state that no government can control.  Do not imagine that if we had inflation in the morning its effects would be seen immediately and that the danger it would be and the injuries it would inflict on the country would be seen at once.  If we had inflation in the morning it would be a pleasant experience for many of us.  We would find that all our assets, all that we possess, would have an increased money value. More money would be spent and there would be at once a relaxation of the strain that at present exists.  It is only when we are hell-bent for disaster that we will begin to feel the real evil of it and then we can do nothing to check it.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the question of the net external assets.  For the information of the House, I direct attention to the fact of what our net external assets were in 1934 and what they were in December, 1938.  The year 1934 is the first legitimate date to which I may refer because at that time the American &ldquo;hot&rdquo; money had gone out of this country back to America.  The net external assets of this country in <Col N="872" /> December, 1934, were £72,000,000; in December, 1935, £71,000,000; in December, 1936, £72,000,000.  In December, 1937, they dropped to £67,000,000, and in December, 1938, they dropped to £61,000,000.</P>
    <P>Now, I do not want to see this country forced into the position of Newfoundland on the one hand or New Zealand on the other hand.  If Deputies care to refer to the Minority Report signed by Deputy O'Loghlen of Clare, in his capacity as a member of the Banking Commission they will see that he is fascinated and dominated by the New Zealand experiment and his ideas run largely along the line of the New Zealand plan.  The New Zealand plan has gone burst.  Everybody knows it has gone burst and nothing can save it now but the British Treasury. Remember that so long as you are standing on your own feet with your own money you can talk to the money markets with confidence.  So long as you are good for a loan, lenders are coming to you offering their money. Go burst and ask them for a loan and they will prescribe their own terms; they will keep the screws on until you learn their lesson.  New Zealand will learn that to her cost.  It will not be a Government or a Government Department that will put on the screws on New Zealand.  It will be the people who control the money.</P>
    <P>Now whether we like it or not we are living in the world.  We are not living in Mars.  We are not living in a vacuum.  Things may have been different when it took three days to get to London and six days to get to New York.  Now it takes three hours to get to London and 20 hours to get to New York.  You have got to realise that it is no longer possible for us to isolate ourselves from the rest of the world.  We have got to take the world as we find it and protect our own people as best we can in that world in which we are fated to live.  We are strangely fortunate in our position, and if we submit our people to the same tyranny as that to which the people of other countries have had to submit in the past, we have got no one to blame but ourselves.</P>
    <P>I have been trying to open the Taoiseach's eyes to what he is doing <Col N="873" /> in the hope that even at the eleventh hour he may have the courage to restore to us that economic independence founded on solvency without which political independence can never be enjoyed in this country.  We have got to do two things.  We have got to economise on our administrative expenses and we have got to increase the national income.  We can increase the national income of this country immensely by resorting to the expedients which I have outlined.  If we do that we can get a higher standard of living for our people than the people have in any other country in the world. We can then show, as those who fought for the freedom of this country said and hoped we could, how a Christian country should be run.  With the maximum income which our national resources would yield if the country were properly run, we can enjoy a moderate general prosperity rather than riches on the one hand and destitution on the other.  This is not the time nor the occasion to elaborate that.  I have spoken of it on previous occasions.  I do not wish to go into it now again.</P>
    <P>There are two other matters to which I wish to refer briefly.  Deputies in this House and outside it not infrequently consider it to be some duty imposed on them by patriotism to denounce the Commonwealth and everything belonging to the Commonwealth. Recently we have altered the form of our passports, and we now call on everybody in the name of Eamon de Valera, the Taoiseach, to let our nationals pass without let or hindrance. I think the form of the passport matters very little, but I loathe and detest the futile deception of our people by our own Prime Minister.  The Taoiseach himself brought into this House a Bill and with his majority passed it into law making the King the instrument of international usage between us and other States.  The prime document of international usage, in so far as it affects the citizens of the State, is the passport, just as a diplomat's credentials are the prime instrument of his authority to represent his country.  We have altered the form of that passport in order to deny the fact that the King is the instrument of <Col N="874" /> our association in the Commonwealth. This thing deceives nobody.  It is a weak-minded, and a futile thing to do. It is a denial of what the Taoiseach thought right to do when he presented the Bill which subsequently became the External Relations Act of this Assembly.  It does not make much difference one way or the other, but it is just that kind of dishonesty with our people which debauches us all&mdash;those deceived and those who do the deceiving.</P>
    <P>On the wider issue as to what the attitude of this country&mdash;Ireland&mdash; should be to the Commonwealth of Nations, it does behove the Taoiseach to say a word.  Leave out of the question all sentiment.  I do not believe that there are many people in this country will ever love England.  There can be in our generation no attachment to Great Britain founded on sentiment or affection.  There can and, so far as I am concerned, ought to be, a relationship with Great Britain founded on mutual respect and recognition by each party of the other's virtues and qualities.  Over and above that, there is the plain, inescapable, economic issue of our interest&mdash;Ireland's interest&mdash;in the Commonwealth of Nations.  Have those who throw their bombs or make their speeches ever asked themselves what is going to happen to the people of this country if Great Britain, in fact, ceases to be a great power? Suppose the British Commonwealth of Nations was broken up&mdash;and it can only be broken up on the assumption that Great Britain is overthrown and reduced to the status of a third-class power in Europe&mdash;what is going to happen to this country?  This country depends for its present immunity from external attack on the fact that any country desirous of attacking Ireland knows that it will be attacking England too.  By virtue of our membership of the Commonwealth of Nations, we are not only delivered from attack by Great Britain but, by the constitutional fictions of the Commonwealth, we are actually in a position of equality with England.  By the constitutional facts of the Commonwealth, we are in actual political equality with England because England knows that, <Col N="875" /> if she attempts to touch us, she involves herself at once in constitutional and political complications not only with us but with Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa as well&mdash;not because those countries love us but because our status is their status and a precedent established by interfering politically with us would be one which might subsequently be used to permit Great Britain to interfere with them.  When the beflowered Parliamentary Secretary stops twittering, I shall go on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Over and above that political independence of England, which no other small nation adjoining a great nation enjoys, we also have the extraordinary market with which Great Britain provides us.  If we lost the British market and were driven to seek a market for our produce outside Great Britain, as we certainly would have to do if Great Britain became a pauper State, an impoverished country unable to deal with us on the terms on which she is glad to deal with us now, this country would become one of the poorest agricultural countries in the world, unable to afford our people the same standard of living enjoyed by the peasant peoples of Central Europe.  Do responsible people in this country ever advert to that?  Do they realise that, in desiring the destruction of the Commonwealth and of Great Britain, they are really desiring the reduction of our people to the level of the most miserable peasants in Europe?  I do not expect the fools to understand that but I know the Taoiseach understands it and I know the Minister for Finance understands it.  Have they the moral courage to say so or are we to go on for ever bewildering and deceiving and lying to our own people?  Are we to go on for ever telling them that it is patriotism &mdash;and the only patriotism&mdash;to deny <Col N="876" /> those facts?  Nobody suggests that we should compromise fundamental principles or sell our convictions for money.  But where a course of international conduct safeguards our honour, protects our integrity, achieves every ideal that reasonable men can have in mind&mdash;the sovereignty and independence of our State&mdash;and, at the same time, gets for our people unrivalled prosperity and an unrivalled standard of living, are we to go on urging our own people to destroy themselves?  That is what many people on the far side of the House do.  If they do it deliberately, knowing what they do and wishing people to understand it, that is their democratic right. But if they do it praying to God that that which they advocate will never come to pass, then they prostitute their freedom more horribly than any person I ever thought could and they will ruin the country.  We have got responsibilities now and we ought to face them.  A very heavy responsibility rests on the Government at present to tell the people the truth and invite them to face it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last subject on which the Taoiseach ought to speak is Partition. I crossed swords with the Taoiseach in this House once on Partition because I said that he deliberately, for political reasons and for the advancement of his own Party interests, raised hopes which he knew could not be fulfilled. I believe that was true.  I believe that, by the policy he has since pursued in regard to Partition, he has destroyed, at least, one glorious opportunity for making a very real impression upon it.  I believe that, immediately after the London Agreement, we could have got the skids under Partition and, but for the Taoiseach's folly in indulging in public pyrotechnics, I believe we would have done it.  That opportunity is now lost, and I want to ask the Taoiseach if he proposes to continue demanding that Great Britain shall re-enter the arena of Irish public life and act as arbiter between North and South.  Does he persist in the invitation to Great Britain to reinterest herself in that matter?  Does he demand the cooperation of Great Britain in imposing <Col N="877" /> upon our fellow-countrymen in Northern Ireland something which at present they do not want?  If he does, he is doing a grave disservice to this country.  We got the British out of this country, and our advice to them now should be that the only duty they have is to stay out.  There is no use in imagining that we can satisfactorily undo the wrong that has been done unless we undo it with the consent of our people on both sides of the Border. There is no use discussing the merits or demerits of, or the responsibility for, the wrong that was done in 1922. It is there and it is our job to remedy it, if we can.  The only basis on which we can remedy it is by winning the goodwill of the people of Northern Ireland.  Ulster, with a resentful, bitter, disillusioned minority in it, would be far more a liability than an asset. Ten years or 20 years is a short term in a nation's life.  We have had one civil war in this country.  God forbid that, by our own ineptitude, we should precipitate another.  Remember, the Taoiseach may make certain speeches meaning to go no further than his spoken word.</P>
    <P>But those speeches will be taken as a justification by others for going much further and for starting a conflagration which the Taoiseach could not stop.  If it should start, it is no defence before his own people or posterity, to wring his hands and say that he never foresaw it.  If he starts, or if he be the cause of starting, civil strife in this country again, his name will be cursed for ever by succeeding generations of Irish people.</P>
    <P>Like it or dislike it, the people of Northern Ireland, the Protestant Orange people of Northern Ireland, are Irish and war between them and us is civil war.  There is no use pretending that they are foreigners and that we are natives.  They are just as Irish as we are; they have just as good a claim to be in this country as we have. They have just as much reason to be proud, and so far as I am aware they are just as proud, of Ireland as we are. The only satisfactory basis upon which we can get rid of Partition in this country is to reach the masses of the <Col N="878" /> people of Ulster and create here in Éire such a state of affairs as will induce the plain ordinary people of Ulster to forbid Craigavon to keep them out of their native country any longer.  That may sound Utopian, incredible and impossible.  The Deputy from Donegal shakes his head in doubt but the alternative is civil war.  Neither Deputy Breslin nor I am old enough to remember the spirit that prevailed in East Donegal or in North Monaghan 50 years ago.  If anybody got up 50 years ago to advocate conciliation and forbearance amongst the Orangemen of North Monaghan led by territorial magnates in defiance of the forces of law, to assassinate the Catholic population of that area, he would have been met with the same incredulous head shaking as Deputy Breslin visits upon me now.  Patience, forbearance and courage have produced in East Donegal and in North Monaghan a situation where Catholic and Protestant, both loyal to their profound convictions, can live in peace and good neighbourliness one with the other, where the thought of violence, hatred or recrimination is as dead as Queen Anne.</P>
    <P>It may take time and patience&mdash;it will certainly take courage&mdash;to face the task of carrying that spirit across the Border into Northern Ireland. Violent speeches, inflamed by hatred in this part of Ireland and attempts to defame and derogate from the character of our own people in Northern Ireland, are not calculated to hasten that day.  Deputy Davin does no service to this country when he suggests that our publicity services should be employed to paint our own countrymen as dastards or as deeply dyed ruffians.  I do not deny that outrages they have perpetrated and violence they have been guilty of, but we can do nothing to abate these evils by offering recrimination for recrimination and hatred for hatred.  That way we shall only deepen and intensify the bitterness that already exists.  I do not want to pretend for a moment&mdash; I know it is not true&mdash;that I have any better appreciation of Christian principles than any other Deputy in this House but it is ludicrous for us to be <Col N="879" /> talking about Christian principles, about the obligation to love our enemies and to forbear from injuring those who injure us, if at the same time we preach at every street corner that because Orangemen and Protestants have been guilty of certain outrages we must take similar measures against them.</P>

      <P>I did not apply that to the Deputy.  Those who have to do with the North and who understand the difficulties of our people in the North realise the deplorable effect that that whole attitude to our problem involves, because you put on our people in Northern Ireland almost an obligation to be more extreme than we are, and any hope of arriving at a <i>modus vivendi</i> for our national problem is made more difficult because of that attitude.  I do not deny that Sir Basil Brooke's language is outrageous.  I do not deny that when the Northern Premier speaks of a Protestant Parliament for a Protestant people, it is an outrage on our people, but there is no use in meeting that kind of language with the same kind of language.</P>

      <P>Unhappily, it is done.  I do not want to labour this matter further, because I am profoundly convinced that conciliation is the ultimate effective key to this business.  I do not deny the difficulty of achieving conciliation. I do not deny that it must sound Utopian in the ears of another.  I assert, however, that, taking the long view, it is the right attitude.  I do not deny its difficulty.  I do not deny the difficulty of not only practising these principles, but of persuading those Catholics, who are actually suffering under that daily tyranny, of the possible efficacy of such a course.  I admit all that.  Nevertheless, it sometimes takes very great moral courage to do the right thing.  I know it is far easier to go to our people who are suffering under a sense of great grievance in Northern Ireland, to urge them to extreme lengths, and to say that in <Col N="880" /> any action they take, no matter how extreme, they will have our sympathy. That is the easy thing and the popular thing to do.  That is the type of oration that will win praise, and that will persuade the unthinking masses that the man who expresses himself in that way is their true champion.  But the right thing to do, the far-seeing thing to do, is now, in this dark and difficult time, to preach the language of conciliation, to ask our people to recognise that those people who are at present affronting them are still their fellow-countrymen and must be ultimately conciliated to the conception of a united Ireland.  I am convinced that that can be done.</P>
      <P>I think we would be astonished by the reaction which we would get, not from the leaders of Orangeism and violence in the North, but from the plain, ordinary people.  I think we would be astonished to discover that those who appear to be so intractable, dark and irreconcilable would be an asset in our struggle for conciliation, that we would draw from our present enemies some of our best friends and that by meeting violence and injustice with patience and forbearance, we would tear from under the leaders of ascendancy and intolerance in Ulster, the very foundations upon which they at present stand&mdash;the common people, the ordinary artisans, farmers, merchants and professional men of Northern Ireland.  Having won them, we could look forward with confidence to the passing of the political passions that at present separate these people from us and to the emergence of a united Ireland where they would be free to differ as deeply as they wished from us, in the certainty that equality of treatment and equal respect for every loyal citizen would be forthcoming in such a State as a united Ireland must, and should be.</P>

      <P>I should like to say that I know of no Government that has had better opportunities of solving the problem that confronts us than the present Government.  As one who has a very high opinion of the Taoiseach, I want to say quite candidly that I am disappointed at the way in which he has dealt with the problem that confronts <Col N="881" /> us since he came into power. When I think of the conditions of the poor in this country, of the old-age pensioners and the windows and the &ldquo;means&rdquo; test that is employed in their cases, I want to say to the Taoiseach and his Government that they are not facing up to their responsibilities as they should.  I do not want to repeat some of the things said by Deputy Davin.  I want to say what I have often said before, that as long as we do not control the credit of this country we will not be able to solve the problems that confront us.  I do not know of any Government in the world that has a better opportunity of doing that than the Government we have here.  The Taoiseach has the backing of the people, he has the necessary machinery and the full support of this House: he has all that if he is prepared to tackle this problem that confronts us.  As one who has a full knowledge of the poverty in which many of our people live, I want to say that in my opinion the Taoiseach is not facing up to that problem.  The sooner he is prepared to do so, then the sooner we will be in a position to show a headline to the Governments of the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>After the wild and exaggerated statements that we have had from Deputy Dillon on the national situation in this country, it is time, I think, that a more balanced picture of that situation should be given to the House and to the country. We have been told that the country is on the edge of bankruptey: that the banks are unable to absorb the short-term loans offered to them by the Government: that the country is about to suffer a severe reverse of its financial fortunes.  I am certain that Deputies know that all those statements are wildly exaggerated.  They must also know that statements of the kind can do immense damage to a State such as ours, particularly at the present time when we are beginning to tackle the questions created by the economic war: when we are beginning to have some very evident restoration of our finances through our increasing exports to England, of an increase in our general turnover in trade as well <Col N="882" /> as in respect of the amount and the value of agricultural production in the country.  I honestly believe that Deputies like Deputy Dillon should think twice before they ruin what is good in their arguments and destroy what is valuable in their criticism by making outrageous statements which can do no good to the credit of the country.  I think that we should examine the question realistically and fairly, and see if we can arrive at some form of policy which will secure the credit of this country, and which will prevent, beyond any chance, any of the evils happening to the country which have been portrayed by Deputy Dillon.</P>
      <P>I, speaking on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party, make no apology for all that we did in connection with the economic war.  I make no apology for the fact that we carried out a certain form of financial policy which was aimed at bringing about the end of most of our political problems with England.  I make no apology for the fact that when we found when we came into office that the administration which preceded us had gone too far in the opposite direction in maintaining for the poorest citizens in the community the lowest possible level of existence: that it had not developed our secondary industries to enable us to fall back on other methods of employment should our system of economy change, that we set out to change all that, nor do I need to make any apology for the very large increase in social and national expenditure designed to offset the worst effects of the economic war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The economic war was like any other economic depression such as other countries throughout the world have experienced.  Other countries, just as ours, adopted the same methods to fight and to overcome those difficulties. Other countries increased their social services.  They increased the taxes for the purpose of providing money for those social services.  Other countries attempted to provide employment through alternative methods of production, and we did the same.  By ending the economic war we effected a very large saving in our debt to England <Col N="883" /> in the form of a remission of £88,000,000, but beyond that, what has been of untold value to this State is that we solved a great many of the difficulties between ourselves and England. From the financial standpoint, that has been of incalculable benefit to us and will be more so in the future.</P>
    <P>We have done those things, and, as a result, the country has incurred a certain burden of dead-weight debt. As a result we have lost a certain amount of our external assets.  I need not repeat all that has been said by Deputy Dillon, but we know that the country has had to pay for the economic war.  One of the things that I think should be learned by members of the Labour Party more than by the members of any other Party in this House is that you cannot produce money out of nothing: that, if your total turnover of trade and your total of agricultural production decline, the country inevitably becomes poorer. The fact that we financed the economic war by special means does not mean that, in the end, we shall not to some degree suffer for the loss sustained, just as other countries have suffered loss because of the economic processes through which they went.  The sooner we face that issue the better.  Failure to face it on the part of any Party in this House would, in my opinion, be fatal for this country.</P>
    <P>We have been told with the greatest possible exaggeration, with a straining of every point to its uttermost limit, of what the cost of the economic war has been, and of the present financial results, and we arrive at the point when we must ask ourselves: what are we going to do now?  I regard the policy of the economic war, to a large extent, as a special policy devoted to a special purpose for the attaining of a special end.  Now that the economic war is over it is quite obvious that between now and the next five years, or between now and the next 12 months perhaps, the Government's financial policy no doubt will receive careful consideration with a view to the future.  One of the worst features I think of our life in this country is <Col N="884" /> what I might describe as the attempts at escape from reality by the advocates of social credit theories as enunciated by different people.  I cannot think of anything that is worse in the character of the people, having regard to what they have gone through, than to have advocated as a solution of our difficulties special forms of credit policy: the idea that by expanding currency and changing the banking system you can get over the inevitable difficulties of human nature. All these policies involve in one way or another social credit.  The idea that politicians can manage credit better than the professional bankers: the idea that by huge credits given out by the State you can give employment and solve unemployment: the idea that you can advance money for the purpose of production without being sure that the returns from that production will pay, all those ideas I compass in the general term &ldquo;social credit.&rdquo;</P>

It is well, when people get up in this House and talk about solving unemployment by changing the banking system, that the ordinary people in this country should be made aware that in other countries those policies have, to a large extent, been forgotten, because they have not worked where they have been tried.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>For example in the case of New Zealand&mdash;a magnificent example of what happens when you attempt to tamper with currency in a country.  It is well that the people of this counry should know the facts about New Zealand.  I will begin by <Col N="885" /> surprising the House; I will read an account of New Zealand finance.  It is from <i>The Round Table</i>, a quarterly review of the politics of the British Commonwealth.  It is a very impartial report, written by a man who obviously was trying to make the best he possibly could out of the situation.  It reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;At the end of 1938 New Zealand was able to look back upon a year described by the Prime Minister as one of record prosperity.  Whether or not `prosperity' is the right word to use, it seems clear that the combined effect of the Government's policy and several satisfactory export seasons had produced a year in which internal wage levels, business activity, employment, and individual spending were higher than ever before.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That looks grand.  But we go on a little bit, and there we find:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Nevertheless there were other signs&mdash;signs that the fates would not be so kind to the Government in its second term of office as they were in its first.  The excess of deposits in the post office savings bank, which had taken place in 1937, had changed by the end of 1938 to a substantial excess of withdrawals; exports were declining not only in value but also in quantity; advances to the Government by the reserve bank for purposes other than marketing were rapidly increasing; and the latter part of 1938 saw a rapid fall in the sterling funds held in London by the reserve bank and the trading banks. It was apparent that the country, as well as its citizens, had been drawing on its bank balance; and the close of the year was marked by the gazetting of the export licences regulations and the import control regulations&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, at the end of a year under the system advocated by certain members of this House, and by certain people outside, New Zealand had lost a great part of her financial liberty.  Already, currency was controlled; imports were radically controlled, and New Zealand will now have to go through in her own way <Col N="886" /> exactly the same sort of control which takes place in Germany and Italy, where similar methods were tried in a different form.  Luckily for New Zealand she has vast resources. Luckily for her she has a small, highly competent and well educated population, producing an enormous amount per head, and she can suffer probably for many years the result of a new policy without serious effect, just as we could in this country no doubt if social credit were to be practised here. Speaking of other countries which have adopted another form of expansionist economic theory, let us take the United States of America.  Pump primers!  We hear from the Labour benches the idea that by spending money and giving huge loans you can solve the problem of unemployment. There is hardly a competent economist in the United States to-day who will not tell you that one of the reasons why unemployment is so high there is because they pump primed far too much; because by rapidly increasing taxation, by removing income normally spent by individual citizens, by spending vast amounts of credit a lot of which became absorbed in administrative expenses, recovery in America was delayed, and in actual fact less employment is given at the present time in public and private enterprises than would have been given if they had been more careful, if they had tightened their belts and proceeded more cautiously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>Then you have the same example in France.  In France the Government of Monsieur Blum got the idea that the banks were doing wrong; that the regents of the Bank of France were having far too much control.  Maybe they had.  The regents' control was removed.  The Government took over control, and at the same time they decided that the whole country could afford a very large increase in wages, a large reduction in hours of work and a general expansionist programme.  What was the result?  The result was that one of the <Col N="887" /> crises which occur habitually in France, through overspending and overborrowing, took place.  At the end of a few years the French Government was forced to go back, so that the Socialist programme advocated by Monsieur Blum is in operation only in certain industries.  The reason France is able to go ahead to-day is because confidence has been restored in the public mind in regard to finance.  I need hardly go on to give the example of Germany and Italy, as countries where credit expansion was indulged in extensively, in order to show the Labour Party that it is not advisable for this country, because no one in this country would tolerate 10 per cent. of the control in private life or in public finance or in commercial finance which has been in operation in Germany and Italy, and I may add, Sir, that the end is not yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us then take this country.  I am simply regarding this country as being at a parting of the ways.  The economic war is over.  At the present time there are very heavy expenses, and at the end of 12 months the Government will have to make its decision as to where it stands.  I take, in contrast, the countries of Sweden, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway and Holland.  If you examine those countries&mdash;whether you examine their prosperity in the light of the income per head of the population, of the proportion of good housing to bad housing, of the increase of housing during the past ten years, of the relative amount of permanent employment amongst the young people, of the extent of social evils, or no matter what criterion you take&mdash;it will be found that they are the most prosperous countries in the world to-day, and those are countries which have gone as far away as possible from the policy advocated by members of the Labour Party.  Those countries have been controlled for years and years by downright radical-socialist Governments.  It is a strange thing to reflect that those countries whose finances are most sound had radical-socialist Governments, Governments elected by the workers of the country. It is those Governments which have <Col N="888" /> conserved finance to the greatest possible degree.  We go a little bit further on, and find France going back to a more conservative system of finance.  We find democratic politicians in America forcing President Roosevelt to adopt a more conservative attitude to finance.  We find that one of the reasons why it was so necessary for Germany to absorb Austria was because Austria, although she was bankrupt in 1919, by 1937 was one of the most conservatively managed countries in the world from the point of view of finance.  A great deal of their economic problems had been solved because their finance was conservatively managed.  We find Portugal occasionally spoken of as a country which has gone in for expansionist plans involving a departure from orthodox finance, but as far as Government finance is concerned it is strictly orthodox.</P>
    <P>We have heard the Banking Commistion Report abused in this House by members of various Parties.  I should like to say here and now, and I commit myself to it, that I believe in the major implications of the Banking Commission Report.  I also agree with the Minority Reports as presented by Mr. Hurson and Mr. Colbert.  I think there is a great deal to be said for them.  They state that the housing policy must go on at all costs.  I agree. I do agree with the major implications of that report.  It has been far too much criticised in this House, and, now that we are discussing Government policy, I think it is only fair that it should be mentioned here that one of the people who wrote that report, Professor Per Jacobssen, is one of the greatest living experts on finance to-day. His advice given to at least four Governments has resulted in the resuscitation of those countries, and the lowering of unemployment there. No report written by him can be lightly discarded by any Party in this House. No one suggests that we need observe 100 per cent. of the implications of that report.  Now that the economic war is over, now that we have saved £88,000,000 in the land annuities and have restored agricultural exports to a certain degree, no one suggests that we <Col N="889" /> need observe all the severe strictures in that report.  But, so far as that report says that we must pay our way as far as we can and to a greater degree than we have done in the past six years, there is evident commonsense in its remarks.  I have no doubt in my own mind that this Party before the end of 12 months, or before the end of 24 months, provided no crisis has affected us which will alter the whole situation, will have taken the correct part.</P>
    <P>I should like to say here something which has not been said by anybody so far, that it is my honest belief that it is neither the banks nor the members of any Party in this House who control credit policy in this country&mdash;it is the ordinary common citizen.  As long as we carry out a capitalist economy in this country, the citizen who spends his savings, the citizen who builds a house, or improves his house, or paints his house, the vast majority of the citizens who have savings, whether great or small, the use of these savings by the citizens, the use of their income, the purpose to which they put it, will ultimately dictate the financial policy of this country, and no other agency will ever dictate financial policy.  One of the things we have to bear in mind in connection with financial policy is the fact that we cannot control the actions of our citizens who spend their savings and who have a very tremendous effect on the whole financial policy of the country.  If ever we were to change the financial policy to a more drastic form of expansionist policy, one of the first things we will have to do is to close the ports and regulate every individual citizen's bank balance, because we have a free country and we have ordinary capitalist economy practised freely.  People who get up and advocate forms of social credit should remember that in the long run the ordinary citizens control credit, neither the banks nor anybody else.</P>
    <P>It we were to get a Party into power who started advocating wild-cat schemes of radical credit expansion, the first thing that would happen would be that citizens would withdraw their money from the banks.  The second thing would be that the people whose <Col N="890" /> income is enormously valuable to this country would leave this country and go to England if given the chance.  The third thing would be that people who normally spend sums on improving their position in life would not spend these sums, and gradually unemployment would increase.  So long as the majority of the employment in this country is given by private citizens, this country must be democratic and observe orthodox financial methods; otherwise dictatorship is inevitable.  I think everybody in this House will recognise that fact.</P>
    <P>We had from the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement a clear warning that the limit had been reached in connection with expenditure, again assuming that we had ordinary conditions.  I think it is well for Deputies to bear in mind that the Minister gave that warning and the suggestion that he had it fully in mind. Although I believe that the whole policy of the Government should be continued in the shape of social services, industrial production, and agricultural development, I trust that within 12 months the gap will be bridged as far as possible, that we shall, as far as possible, pay our way, and that we shall, as far as possible, do what is urgently necessary at present&mdash;give encouragement to the investment of private capital in ordinary business.  I am absolutely convinced that the expenditure of the Government caused by the economic war is not having the effect any longer of transferring the surplus from the rich to the poor; and, in addition, that a certain proportion of the money secured in taxation has the effect of disemploying many citizens in the country.  That was perfectly all right during the economic war.  But, now that the economic war is over, I trust the whole House will agree on one thing&mdash;that, as far as possible, private capital should be attracted to new ventures. That is the essence of modern economics.  It is what President Roosevelt failed to appreciate.  It is what the French Government failed to appreciate.  It is what half-a-dozen Governments in Europe who were faced by special difficulties, by severe <Col N="891" /> depressions, failed to appreciate&mdash;the necessity for getting new capital working with the idea of giving employment in industry and in agriculture.</P>

      <P>We have listened to a speech which was, in many respects, very interesting, and, viewing things from Deputy Childers' point of view and from the point of view of those for whom he speaks mainly, one might understand his point of view.  But, I should like Deputy Childers to reconcile his speech with the speeches and promises which have been made by the Taoiseach and by other leaders of the Party of which he is a member.  Deputy Childers tells us that he has discovered now where the various Prime Ministers in France went wrong; that he has discovered the fatal and fundamental error of President Roosevelt. If he had only been consulted in the matter they might not have made the mistakes which he alleges they made in dealing with very big matters affecting their own countries.  However, with that declaration by him this evening, I am sure there will be a very considerable demand for his services either from America or from France.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But Deputy Childers quoted for us here this evening an article&mdash;he did not give us the name of the author&mdash; in a Commonwealth paper which he described as &ldquo;The Round Table,&rdquo; purporting to give a picture of the conditions in New Zealand.  I do not propose to discuss New Zealand at any length.  I think a much more interesting problem for us is to find a solution of the problems and the evils which confront our own people at home.  But, since Deputy Childers has dealt with New Zealand and has drawn a certain picture from what he has read, let me give him some official statistics which are obtainable from the <i>Official Handbook of New Zealand.</i> In 1935, the total production of New Zealand was £97,000,000.  At the end of 1938, the total production was £135,000,000, an increase of almost 40 per cent.  In 1935, farm production in New Zealand was £59,000,000 and in 1938, £83,000,000, an increase of over 40 per cent.  Electric power units produced <Col N="892" /> in New Zealand in 1935 totalled 12,000,000, and in 1938 19,000,000, an increase of 60 per cent.  Exports&mdash;and these were mainly to the British market&mdash;in 1935, amounted to £46,000,000, and in 1938 to £58,000,000, an increase of 25 per cent., and that during the years when our exports to the same market fell catastrophically. In New Zealand the marriage rate is twice as high as the marriage rate in this country, and as between 1935 and 1938 it increased by 25 per cent.  The increase in money wage rates, on an index basis, between 1935 and 1938 in New Zealand, was 27 per cent.; and the increase in retail prices during the same period, on an index basis, was 13 per cent.  All these figures clearly indicate that one would like the application of these conditions to Ireland, notwithstanding the gloomy picture of New Zealand which Deputy Childers erroneously quoted for us this evening.</P>

      <P>We will have chatter from the Minister afterwards.  I want to direct the attention of the Taoiseach to conditions which ought to concern him as head of the Government.  The outstanding matter to which I want to direct attention is the very serious position of our unemployment problem, and the apparent complete inability on the part of the Government to evolve any scheme which is calculated, not merely to solve the problem, but even to diminish its present gigantic proportions. As evidence of the fact that unemployment is not merely a passing problem, it is only necessary to go back a few years to find the extent of it, to observe its continuance, and the manner in which it persists in remaining with us.  According to Government statistics there were in February, 1937, 91,000 persons registered as unemployed at the employment exchanges; <Col N="893" /> in February, 1938, 106,000; in February, 1939, 105,000; and on the 11th of April last, 107,000.  About February last those registered as unemployed numbered 105,000 persons, and of these 38,000 persons were employed in the notorious rotational schemes, getting work for three or four days.  Probably half of the 38,000 got wages for only three days' work.  In spite of seven years of Fianna Fáil government we have now an unemployment problem of well over 100,000 persons, and the most the Government can offer to that large mass is employment on rotational schemes for three or four days per week at a low rate of wages and under intolerably degrading conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not by any means a full picture of the poverty that exists in this country to-day.  According to Government statistics, 80,000 persons were in receipt of home assistance in December last, and, I am quite sure, from reports which have since appeared in the Press, that the numbers have not diminished. There are 80,000 persons eking out a miserable existence on home assistance, and well over 100,000 persons satisfying the rigorous test regarding unemployment at the exchanges.  We have before us two pictures of poverty and misery for which the Government is unable to find any solution.  The position would even be worse were it not for the fact that Britain has embarked on a large-scale armament scheme, and is to-day vigorously and feverishly organising her armaments output.  As a result of the British policy in that connection, tens of thousands of citizens who, if they remained here would be unemployed, are going to Britain to try to find there the work which is not available for them here.  In the ten years from 1926 to 1936 we exported 166,000 people to Britain.  This small country, with a population of 3,000,000, exported to Britain 166,000 persons in that period.  In fact, statistics will show that for every three persons who died during these years, we exported one to Britain to find work, and there is no indication in the Government's industrial or agricultural programme that it has any notion in the world what it will do to stop that appalling drain on the manhood and womanhood of the country.  In the same period, <Col N="894" /> between 1926 and 1936, the excess of births over deaths amounted to 163,000, so that what we did during those ten years we did more vigorously during the last few years of that decade, and gave to Britain not merely the entire natural increase in the population, but we added between 3,000 and 4,000 people over the natural increase.  One looks in vain for the slightest indication that the Government realises what an appalling drain there is on our manhood and womanhood, and on the vitality of this country, by permitting a situation of that kind to continue.  The drain is going on, and the Celt is going more rapidly to Britain than ever before.  One has only to go to the harbours from which boats sail to Britain to see the type of people who are leaving every day in the week in order to find employment there that they cannot get here.</P>
    <P>In the rural areas a problem that, in my view, is of very grave concern to the nation is the very considerable decline in population.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce recently committed himself to the declaration that it did not matter if the population were leaving the rural areas and going to the towns and the cities.  A well-known Bishop, realising not merely the moral side of the question, but observing very critically the economic repercussions, promptly pointed out that anybody that made a statement of that kind was really living in a fool's paradise.  One has only to go through the rural areas to witness the conditions that exist in respect to decline of the population. One has only to look at the official statistics to see that not merely is there a drift from the rural areas to the towns and cities, but there is still more of a drift from the cities and towns to Britain in search of employment which cannot be got here.  I should like the Taoiseach, who is head of the Government that is responsible for permitting such conditions to continue, to indicate on this Vote what he proposes to do to remedy the situation.  If we pass from unemployment, from emigration, and from the falling population, particularly in the rural areas, in order to ascertain what is normally regarded as an indication <Col N="895" /> of the virility and progressive nature of the nation, namely, the marriage rate, we get from official sources statistics which are terrifying in their implication, so far as safeguarding the nation is concerned.  According to these statistics there are 460,000 males between the ages of 25 and 50 years, and 250,000 of these are single, representing 54 per cent.  They are compelled, in the main, by economic necessity to remain single.  The plight of agriculture is appallingly portrayed in the statistics applicable to that industry. In the agricultural areas 82 per cent. of males between 25 and 35 are unmarried, and when one contemplates the plight of the farming community, with understocked holdings, inability to purchase seeds and manures, low prices for produce compared with the high cost of living, one can foresee not only a continuance of such unsatisfactory conditions, but an intensification of them.</P>
    <P>These are serious aspects of our national life to-day.  They are an indication that the nation is sick.  These are external abscesses, and they indicate that, within the nation, the scheme of organisation is far from healthy.  When you have a veritable state of unemployment within the State itself, when you have all the destitution that is revealed by the gigantic home assistance figures, when you have that appalling tale of what misery is exacted from our people, and added to that the fact that the tide of emigration outwards is rivalled only by the rising cost of living within the country, one can get some real picture of what they are suffering to-day.</P>
    <P>The Government, by their general policy, by their unwillingness to regulate or control prices in an effective way, have permitted a situation to develop whereby it is harder than ever for the ordinary people to purchase the necessities of life.  In November, 1933, the cost-of-living index figure was 156. In November, 1938, it had risen to 176, an increase of 20 points in the five years.  I said before, and the truth of it is so obvious that it is scarcely necessary to say it again, that the Government <Col N="896" /> have no plan whatever for dealing with the unemployment problem, no plan whatever for taking off the employment exchanges the tens of thousands of people who are forced to go there in order to get a miserable pittance under our Unemployment Assistance Acts.  In fact, developments in the past 12 months have all indicated that the Government have good reason to feel uneasy at the position of our industrial development and the position of our unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers talked about the success of the economic war.  This nation was not defended by the Government Party alone during the economic war and it is far too early for us to pat ourselves on the back and be satisfied with the industrial sections of the London Agreement. Every manufacturer in this country has expressed concern that the effect of the London Agreement will be to afford a lesser measure of protection to our industries and that the result of the investigation which is being carried out by the Prices Commission may well mean a substantial contraction in employment in Irish industries.  The contraction has already started.  I have here some figures indicating the number of persons insured in each of the years from 1930 to 1938 under the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  The increase in 1931 was 12,000; in 1932, 20,000; in 1933, 45,000; in 1934, 21,000; in 1935, 19,000; in 1936, 12,000; in 1937, 17,000, and in 1938, only 5,000.  That means that less insurance books were exchanged in October last than in any period since the Department of Industry and Commerce was established here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to discuss it.  All I want to point out to the Taoiseach, in case he does not know it, is that as a result of the Agreement there has been a substantial contraction in employment by reason of the fact that the British manufacturer can get our tariffs reviewed and this House is bound to accept the award of the tribunal on the application made, in the first instance, by the British manufacturer. I mention that to emphasise that an already serious unemployment position will become still more serious as a result of the consequences which will flow from the industrial sections of that agreement.</P>
      <P>In the good old days, when the Taoiseach was in Opposition, we used to have speeches from him on the subject of unemployment.  The Taoiseach was then a kind of economic Messiah. He had all kinds of schemes for solving the unemployment problem.  In fact, he believed that the solution of the problem here was easier than in any other country.  If one is entitled to say that the Taoiseach was then speaking seriously and sincerely, the measure of his guilt and responsibility in the matter becomes all the greater.  Here is an extract from one of the Taoiseach's speeches.  Speaking in this House, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The cure for unemployment lies in supplying ourselves with manufactured goods which at the present moment we needlessly import.... The solution of unemployment is easier in this country at the present moment than it is in any other country facing the problem.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When the Taoiseach was in Opposition we had that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach had a plan for solving the unemployment problem and, after seven years' application of the plan we now have, according to unemployment figures taken on the 11th April last, 107,000 people unemployed and we have people going to Great Britain at the rate of 30,000 a year in order to get away from the plan and the consequences <Col N="898" /> of the plan.  In the same debate the Taoiseach worked out for the House the cost of unemployment to the nation.  After intimating that there were 60,000 unemployed in the country, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These 60,000 people if they were employed and distributed even in the present proportions between the agricultural and the manufacturing industries, would produce yearly something like £6,750,000 worth of wealth. So that our loss by the continuance of these people unemployed, the gross economic loss, the loss to the community in deprivation of wealth is something like £6,750,000 per year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was then concerned with this appalling loss of £6,750,000 per year because 60,000 people were unemployed at that time.  Between the date on which that statement was made and the present time the cost-of-living index figure has increased by approximately 14 per cent. and the number of unemployed has gone up from 60,000 to 107,000.  If we adjust the higher cost of living to the larger number of unemployed, and take the Taoiseach's method of calculation, we find that the loss to the nation to-day is not the £6,750,000 which the Taoiseach deplored, but it is no less than £13,500,000.  It was a grave loss to the nation to lose £6,750,000 when the Taoiseach was in Opposition, but it is apparently a matter of the most blissful indifference that we are losing to-day, on the Taoiseach's own basis, no less than £13,500,000.</P>

      <P>Is it possible, by making the most humble approach to the Taoiseach, and undertaking not to say one word in reply to anything he might say, to ask him what he intends to do in the way of solving a problem which, in 1931, he said was easier of solution in this country than in any other country in the world?  When the Taoiseach used to be on the hustings, campaigning in the past, before 1932, I think he went on record in Westport as saying that he would solve the unemployment problem within the present system and, if he did not, he would solve it outside the system.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach came into the House subsequently and, with all the responsibility of office, told us that, if the problem could not be solved within the system, it would have to be solved outside the system. Then, of course, we had the Taoiseach quoting these sartorial examples of what his economic policy was going to be: that he would not stand for a policy of silk shirts, but that, if necessary, it would be a policy of hair shirts for the mass of the people.  Well, there are very few silk shirts circulating among the working-class people or among the unemployed people who attend at the labour exchanges. In so far as the latter are concerned, it is not even hair shirts that they have to be content with, but porcupine shirts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Bad as the economic situation is, the worst feature of it is that the Government seem not to be able to put forward a plan to deal with the problem. During the discussion on a motion submitted by members of this Party in the House recently, Deputy Flinn, who is supposed to be in charge of the question of unemployment, or employment &mdash;or whatever you may care to call it, at his hands&mdash;said that the problem to-day was not a problem of getting money, but a problem of trying to find work to do.  Did anybody ever hear a more irresponsible statement than that, outside a lunatic asylum?  He said that the problem was to find work to do.  And that in a country where the social amenities are as backward, in many respects, as any in the Balkan States; a country where the national <Col N="900" /> estate is poorly kept and scandalously underdeveloped and where so many people are denied the ordinary social amenities which are the hallmark of ordinary progress in Europe.  Deputy Flinn, however, says that it is not a problem of getting money, but of getting work.  Is that the Government view on this question of unemployment? Will the Taoiseach accept the view that that is the only difficulty now &mdash;the difficulty of getting work&mdash;and that there is no difficulty in getting money?  There are 6,000 or 7,000 building-trade workers idle in this State to-day.  They are idle in Dublin, Cork, and in every other city and large town in the country, not because there is no work available, but because the municipal authorities concerned cannot get the money to enable the houses to be built.  Unless the Taoiseach takes a keener interest in that problem he is going to find that, in this city in particular, by December next a very serious situation will arise in consequence of the complete close down of the municipal housing schemes in this city through inability, apparently, to get money except by paying the ransom which is being demanded by the lenders of money and which ransom is going to compel the tenants to pay an exorbitant rent for the new houses.</P>
    <P>There is never any difficulty, of course, in getting any money that we want for armaments.  We increased the Army Estimate this year very substantially, and now we are embarking on an air raid precautions scheme&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>And do not know anything about the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and do not know the extent of the scheme or of its cost, nor have we got any explanation from the Minister as to what the scheme is. Without the slightest difficulty, however, five and a half million pounds can be raised, seemingly, for fresh armaments. There is no shortage of money there.  When you ask for money for armaments, it can be got, but when you ask for money for the provision of work, or when you ask for money to be provided in order to enable Christian rates of unemployment assistance benefit to be paid to unemployed <Col N="901" /> people, then there is no money available. The larder is always full when the advocate of armaments knocks there, but when the unemployed people ask for money in order to provide them with a decent amount of sustenance during a period of involuntary idleness, they are told that there is no money for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not so long ago, the House enacted a Constitution, and one of the declarations in that Constitution was that the Government, or the State, by its efforts, would endeavour to ensure that everybody would be able to provide for his domestic needs and to discharge his responsibilities to those who depended upon him.  The Government Party and the Government Press organ told us that this was a very Christian Constitution, enshrining everything that was good, virtuous and Christian, and that there was going to be breathed and sprayed all over the nation a new spirit of Christianity towards everybody and, in particular, towards the unemployed people.  Let us see how it is working out, and let us test the application of the Constitution to the unemployed people in this country.  It is all right to have flowery phrases in constitutions&mdash;written or printed constitutions, which are kept in cupboards or book-cases&mdash;but when you come to test the value of a constitution it is not the elegant phrasing or the terse terminology that is used that matters: it is what it means in regard to a decent standard of life for the people who have to live under that constitution.  Under our Unemployment Assistance Acts we give a man, a wife, and six children, if he lives in a town with a population of less than 7,000, 14/- per week.  If he has five children, six children, or ten children, we give him 14/- a week.  Let us assume that he has a wife and six children.  That is 14/- a week for eight people, which is very much less than 2/- per day, and if you work it out on a meal basis, you will find that, with all the talk of the Christian Constitution and the Government's Christian social policy, all we give that man is a penny for a meal, a penny for a meal for his wife, and a penny for a meal for his children.  That is the Government's <Col N="902" /> Christian social policy.  There is the silk shirt policy or the hair shirt policy, or whatever you wish to call it.</P>
    <P>The fact is, the Government have no industrial policy whatever.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, at one time, believed that it was only necessary to let him get at the unemployment problem in order to be assured of its speedy solution.  We were told of the plan that he and his Party had under which 100,000 people were going to be employed, and furthermore, after a stricter scrutiny, he led us to understand that the only danger of that scheme being sabotaged was that you could not possibly get enough people here in the country to do the work that would be available as a result of his policy, and that it would be necessary to have a comb-out of the cities and towns of America in order to bring back our people there to help to work out this famous plan.  At that time we were going to bring them back from America, and we have now reached such a stage of perfection with that plan that we cannot stop them going to England much less beg them to come back from America.</P>
    <P>I want to say to the Taoiseach that I do not think his Ministers can deal with this problem.  I do not think it is being handled properly.  I do not think anybody is thinking nationally about this problem.  I think they are thinking departmentally about this and every other problem.  There is nobody thinking nationally.  Nobody is making any effort to plan a co-ordinated industrial and agricultural policy.</P>
    <P>The House was asked recently to devote its time to a Bill dealing with town planning.  That may be an estimable pastime.  It may be a very desirable thing to do, but there does not seem to be very much sense in planning the disposition of furniture in a house when the roof is on fire.  We are proceeding to pass Bills dealing with town planning, desirable though they may be in their own way, while we do nothing whatever in the way of national planning.  We plan buildings in towns and cities but we do nothing whatever towards planning a national economic structure which, in the long run, will give to our people more security, more safeguards and freedom <Col N="903" /> from the poverty and misery which many thousands of them endure to-day.</P>
    <P>On other occasions here I asked the Taoiseach&mdash;and I make another appeal to him now&mdash;to try to create some machinery whereby somebody with responsibility, energy, brains and intelligence will survey the country's requirements, ascertain the extent of our poverty, the extent of our unemployment, the extent of our under-employment, the potentialities of the nation and what schemes of industrial development and agricultural stimulation are likely to yield the nation the quickest and the best possible results. Nobody is doing that to-day.  Nobody is thinking on those lines.  It is essential that thought should be given to a subject of that kind if we are ever to get out of the bog of misery and poverty in which tens of thousands of our people are compelled to toil to-day. I hope the Taoiseach will no longer treat this question of unemployment merely as a departmental matter.  I fear that it is being dealt with as a departmental matter.  I feel that there is no adequate appreciation of the fact that this problem has been with us so long.  The tendency is to say that it is no worse in 1939 than it was in 1938, that it is keeping steady and not increasing. According to the Taoiseach when he was in opposition, it should not exist at all.  It is existing in spite of him and continuing in spite of him. The continuance of the problem is accompanied by indescribable misery and privation for a very large number of our people.  In time of war, in time of emergency or of anticipated danger, we will mobilise all the resources of our people to defend the country against attack.  Why cannot we mobilise all our resources to-day to deal with the unemployment problem because it represents to the people of this country an even greater menace than an enemy at a distance.  While we do nothing whatever to grapple with the menace of unemployment, which entails hunger, destitution, a weakened and debilitated nation physically, we can get quite alarmed and raise all the money necessary for a war that may never come or a menace that may in fact never reach us.</P>
    <P>I hope the Taoiseach will get back to <Col N="904" /> some of the radicalism of other years and do some of the things he indicated in 1932 he would do without the system if he could not do it within the system. In any case, the Taoiseach owes it to the House and even to himself to tell us why, if unemployment could be solved more easily in this country than in any other country, it has not been done after he has been seven years in office.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I want to refer on this Estimate and that is the position of our citizens in Great Britain.  The Taoiseach rightly protested&mdash;and when he did so he represented the viewpoint of the whole nation&mdash;against our people in Britain being made liable for military service there under the British Military Service Act.  But the British Government has apparently taken the view that, notwithstanding the alleged co-equality to which Deputy Dillon made reference earlier this evening, we cannot as a mother country give to our people a separate citizenship and separate nationality.  The British Government has taken the view that our citizens are also British citizens and that, as British citizens in the opinion of the British Government, they are liable for military service in Britain.  Of course, if the British can get away with that contention we ought never to have passed or need never have passed the Citizenship and Nationality Act. That Act was designed to confer on our people a separate citizenship and separate nationality.  Yet, the British, notwithstanding the fact that we, positively, by legislation, conferred that right upon our citizens, intend to dispute our right to do it and to deem our people here and in Great Britain British subjects for the purpose of their conscription laws.  The Taoiseach has said that the British action in that regard was a breach of international usage and at variance with the Hague Convention.  I think the Taoiseach did right to make a protest of that kind to the British, but it is not sufficient to leave the protest where it is, particularly as our people in Britain of the military age prescribed by the British Bill are now being called up for service in the British Army, even though they are Irish citizens and even though we by legislation have conferred <Col N="905" /> Irish citizenship and Irish nationality on them.</P>
    <P>I would like, therefore, to ask the Taoiseach what further action he proposes to take in this connection?  Has any further representation been made to the British Government on the subject, or has the Taoiseach given consideration to the question of endeavouring to find a tribunal, either through the machinery of the League of Nations or otherwise, by which he can get our viewpoint vindicated in view of the fact that, in his opinion, and in the opinion of well-known international jurists, the British attitude in that matter is in conflict with international usage and with the Hague Convention? Or is it merely intended to leave the matter there and to allow our people of 20 to 21 years of age in Britain to be conscripted into the British Army?  While it is 20 to 21 this year, it may be from 20 to 30 before the year is out, and it may be from 20 to 40 even before the year is out.  We are not fighting to-day on the narrow issue of conscripting our people of between 20 and 21 years of age.  If Britain is involved in a war, we may be faced with a situation where every single Irishman in Britain may, under the British contention, be dragooned into the Army to fight in a war in which he probably has no interest whatever.  I would like, therefore, that the Taoiseach should give us some indication as to his further proposals in that regard, so that we may be in a position to ascertain what those further steps are, and whether he is going to resist by every means available to him the British contention that they can confer citizenship on our people even though we have conferred a different citizenship and a different nationality on them.  This whole question of the Citizenship and Nationality Act deserves much more attention than apparently it has received so far.  If one is to judge by Press reports, it is being availed of very largely by all kinds of foreigners to secure naturalisation.</P>
    <P>The daily papers constantly report that citizens with unpronounceable names have been naturalised as Irish citizens.  Is that the only purpose for <Col N="906" /> which we passed the Act, and has it no more significance for us than that? Now, in the recent discussion in the British House of Commons on this question of conscription and its applicability to Irish citizens there, when the Act was passed by this House and a discussion on this debate ensued in the British House of Commons, it was then contended by British Ministers that, notwithstanding the provisions of the Act, Irishmen still possessed the status of British citizens.  That has all kinds of dangerous complications for us in war time.  I would like to know from the Taoiseach whether the Government have taken any steps to acquaint other Governments of the fact that our people are no longer British citizens under our nationality laws?</P>
    <P>When Europe was in a ferment last year&mdash;last September&mdash;over Munich, when armies were marching in Europe and the danger of a conflagration was very close at hand, certain seamen left the port of Dublin in an Irish registered vessel but flowing the British red ensign; and, as it looked that they might get to Hamburg at a time when Germany had declared war on Britain over the events in Czecho-Slovakia, the Secretary of the Seamen's Union tried to ascertain from the Government what was their position if they got to Hamburg after Germany had declared war on Britain.  He could not get any satisfactory explanation as to the status of the Irish seamen on an Irish-owned and Irish-registered vessel flowing the British ensign.  If there were a Norwegian or a Swede on that boat and the boat docked at Hamburg and Germany had declared war on Britain, the Norwegian or the Swede would have been repatriated&mdash;would have been sent back to his own country.  Under the interpretation that our people are British subjects, our people stood in danger of being arrested when the ship docked at Hamburg and of being interned there as if they were citizens of a country at war with Germany, even though we might have made no declaration of war on Germany.</P>
    <P>We have been appointing Ministers to various countries.  We appointed a Minister to Italy a short time ago, though the cost of maintaining the <Col N="907" /> service there is more than Italy buys in goods in 12 months.  We did it, at all events; and I would like to know did we ask, as a condition of accrediting our representative to the King of Italy and Emperor of the forcibly annexed Ethiopia, that he would have to recognise that representative there and our people in time of war as separate Irish citizens, with a different and distinct nationality from British nationality or British citizenship.  Has any effort been made at all to bring notice of the Act formally before the various Governments in Europe with which we are likely to be involved in a conflict in the event of Britain going to war with those countries; and has any effort been made to extract from those Governments an assurance that they recognise our citizens as Irish citizens, and that no declaration in the British Parliament can possibly deprive our people of that separate citizenship and separate nationality?  Or, is the position to be that the Citizenship and Nationality Act is to be allowed to fall into disuse?  Are Bills to be passed through this House as a form of window-dressing, to be talked about and regarded as one of the folklore things that we did a few years ago? Are we going to accept the British conception of our position as British subjects?  I think the Taoiseach should take an early opportunity to tell the House what his views are in that regard.  I would like, in particular, to know whether, when we are appointing representatives to other countries and receiving representatives from those countries here, any endeavour has been made to extract from them an acceptance of the position that our people are not British citizens and that statements in the British House of Commons do not make them so.  The Taoiseach owes a statement on that issue to the House, and it is very important that it should be made now, well in advance of any complicating international situation which may make it less possible to remedy whatever misunderstandings or misinterpretations exist now.</P>
    <P>These are some of the views which I wanted to express on this Estimate.  I think it is not often that we get the Taoiseach in the House, and it is very desirable that he should know from <Col N="908" /> members of the House other than the members of his own Party, the problems that concern the country.  It is very desirable, above all, that, as head of the Government, he should know the heavy responsibility which devolves upon him.  It is very desirable that he should know&mdash;no matter what his Ministers or supporters may tell him&mdash;that the economic position of the country is alarming, that the industrial position is far from satisfactory, that employment is decreasing, that industrial production has decreased and will decrease more, that the agricultural position in the country was never worse during the past ten years than it is to-day, that farmers are finding it extremely difficult to carry on and that thousands of young agricultural labourers who ought to be able to find employment in a well organised agricultural country are fleeing the land and trying to find employment in Britain.  These are factors for which the country and the Taoiseach are responsible.  We ought to be able to have a declaration as to whether he is going to allow this state of affairs to drift, as Deputy Childers advised him to do&mdash;to drift on as it is&mdash; or whether he is going to take steps in accordance with his earlier declarations to solve the unemployment problem in the easy way which he contemplated in 1931, and whether he is going to apply himself to an effective solution of many other problems which press with such rigour on our people to day.</P>

      <P>This debate, I think, should create a nation-wide impression. It is one of the most significant debates that I have listened to since I came into this House&mdash;significant in two particulars.  Firstly, this is one of the very few occasions in the course of the year where the head of the Government has an opportunity within the Parliament of the country to announce and elaborate and explain his policy on all-important matters.  For the first time, as far as I know, we have the Vote for the head of the Government introduced by the head of the Government, like the passing of a vote of condolence, in complete silence.  The Taoiseach is as noisy as the rest on public platforms outside of this House in shouting about his policy and his <Col N="909" /> intentions, but on the appropriate occasion when money is being asked for and there is a specially arranged opportunity to tell the Parliament and the nation what his policy is, we have spectacular silence.</P>
      <P>In that respect it is a remarkable debate; but perhaps it is even more remarkable by virtue of the fact that it is the first time I have seen complete and absolute unanimity within this Parliament.  We have heard spokesmen of all Parties, including the Government Party, join in together in the course of this debate&mdash;united only in condemnation of the Government's policy, of the evils flowing from it, or of the absence of policy.</P>
      <P>I think it is due to Deputy Childers to congratulate him on the particularly courageous speech which he made here to-day.  Certainly he is not open to the accusation of having made his speech in any Party spirit.  His speech was delivered in a sincere and detached, impartial way.  The net point in his speech was to give the Government 12 months to mend its ways, to give up its nonsense, to quit folly, and to get on to a road of sound policy.  That, coming from a member of the Government Party, is certainly rather historical, and I am glad that speech was delivered on an occasion when the head of the Government was present, because I think there is a lot too much business of a kind being done in this House without any attention from the head of the Government; and without falling over myself in confidence in the head of the Government, I think that if he were present when Bills are introduced by some of his Ministers it would become as clear to him as it is to us that there is not, in many cases, serious attention or close study being given in advance to measures introduced here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a rather humiliating exhibition last week when we had a Bill of a rather novel kind for this country, of immense possibilities with regard to cost and certainly a type of Bill that would create a lot of mental disturbance in the country, namely, the A.R.P. Bill, introduced by a Minister who quite obviously had scarcely read it and was not in a position to answer, <Col N="910" /> or make an attempt to answer, any reasonable questions put to him. I put it to the Taoiseach that if we are to support a Bill of that kind, everyone of us is on the defensive when he goes down to his constituents.  I deplore the fact that nine out of every ten people in the country regard all this A.R.P. business as so much nonsense, and I stated that I belong to the 10 per cent. who do not regard it as nonsense, but, in supporting a Bill of that kind, when I, and any other Deputy, go down to our constituents, we are asked what the approximate cost of the Bill will be and when we reply: &ldquo;I do not know&rdquo;, we are asked: &ldquo;Why did you not ask the Minister&rdquo;, to which we must reply: &ldquo;The Minister would not answer.&rdquo;&ldquo;To what extent is the Bill going to affect your constituency?&mdash;I do not know.&rdquo; We are asked: &ldquo;Why did you not ask the Minister?&rdquo; and we have to reply &ldquo;We asked the Minister and he would not answer.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am availing of the presence of the Taoiseach to protest against that type of discourtesy to the House.  That Department has been characterised by one type of major blunder after another during recent years, by calculated discourtesy and offensiveness, not only to people inside this House who disagree with the policy, but to everybody outside who ventures to have a slight difference of opinion with the head of that Department.  Certain allowances can be made for a Minister who is not able to grasp the details of the legislation he introduces, but no allowance can be made for a Minister who deliberately refuses to give the House information, when he is asking the House to pass a Bill which is going to cost the country dear.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 4, line 2, section 4 (3), to delete the word &ldquo;five&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;seven&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I move this amendment because I recognise that practically the success or failure of this effort will depend on the board.  We have had from the Minister no indication&mdash;I gather that he does not yet know&mdash;as to who he is going to have on the board, and I must accept that innocence on the part of the Minister.  I should be satisfied, however, if I thought that there was at least one good man on the board, and it is merely because we have been left completely in the dark as to the personnel of the board that it struck me that I might be a little more hopeful <Col N="912" /> of getting that one good man, if seven were chosen instead of five.</P>
    <P>The House is asked to pass legislation giving almost unlimited powers, in some respects, into the hands of the board.  They register hotels, they register guest houses, they register camps, hostels and so on; and yet we do not give them the slightest hint, and nowhere in this debate have I heard the slightest hint, as to what is a hotel, what is a guest house, what is a hostel and what is a camp.  Everything, therefore, will depend on the personnel chosen by the Minister.  If, as I say, I were sure of getting one forceful, good man on the board, I would feel a little more confident.</P>
    <P>This is the only way in which I can draw attention now to what is in my mind, after listening to the debate on the Committee Stage of the Bill, namely, that we have decided practically nothing on the major issues in regard to this Bill.  We are passing legislation, and we give not the slightest hint of our views in regard to the most important matters connected with it.  In reality, as I put it the last time, and as, I think, the Minister agreed, in substance, it would come to this: &ldquo;Let me appoint the board and let the board do what it likes within certain limits.&rdquo;  But it is a peculiar thing that we tell the board to draw up a register of hotels and a register of guest houses&mdash;I will return to this, possibly, later&mdash;and we do not know what either of these things means.  We do not know whether the board will make any distinction, or can make any distinction, because the board is not there.  We do not know what is in the Minister's mind.  This is purely to see whether we can get clarification; it was in the hope that we could get at least one good man if there were seven on the board, that I put down the amendment. There is a better chance of getting one good man out of seven than getting one good man out of five.  That is what I had in mind when putting down the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I underline the point made by Deputy Professor O'Sullivan.  The same difficulty has arisen in the case of a number of Acts passed by this House in the last few <Col N="913" /> years&mdash;the difficulty of definitions.  In the Shops Act and other Acts of that kind there were laid down general regulations for different classes of persons, and in practice it became extremely difficult to solve what the class of persons were and to whom the Act applied.  One definition applied to shop assistants, another to domestic workers and so on.  It became extremely difficult to draw up a definition as to what workers went into each different category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad of this opportunity to acknowledge gratefully the readiness of the Minister's Department to assist, in so far as they could assist, by suggesting what the probable true interpretation of the statute is.  But even when the Department is good enough to do that, it is then found that the average citizen painfully learns that the courts are not bound by any interpretation of the statute by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  The courts themselves say that they have no statute at all defining the meaning of the word.  They may suggest probably a true meaning.  For these reasons it is very necessary where practicable that we should incorporate in the text of the statute as comprehensive a set of definitions as is practicable so that the average citizen when he comes to determine what his obligations in law and what his liabilities are, may adapt his premises to what the words of the statute require.  Otherwise he is in the unhappy position of embarking on some expenditure for the equipment of his premises, expenditure which brings him under a part of the statute which he never meant to come under. He may then find himself faced with liabilities which are far in excess of what he would willingly accept.  I, like Deputy Professor O'Sullivan, fully realise the practical difficulties of preparing a comprehensive set of definition clauses, but definition clauses which go as far as is practicable are better than none at all. Therefore, I invite the Minister in this case to accept Deputy Professor O'Sullivan's suggestion and attempt a definition clause which would segregate hotels, guest houses, holiday hostels, youth hostels, etc., so that anyone starting would know precisely <Col N="914" /> what he has let himself in for when he holds himself out as an owner of a guest house, hotel, etc.  I think the Minister will find that he will get very willing assistance from anybody in this House who would care to suggest definitions. I am sure the House will take an intelligent view if the Minister tries to produce definitions that may produce certain results.  When these results manifest themselves, I do not think the Minister would meet with any serious criticism if he finds it necessary to come back to the House to correct some misinterpretation of the clauses in the Bill when it passed the House.</P>

      <P>I take it the suggestion is that some addition should be made to the board so as to have a greater chance of bringing in somebody on the board who would have a practical knowledge of the business.  It is not within the rules on this amendment to suggest anything about definitions, but in passing I might say that when this board is formed and when it is set up some difficulty about definition will arise.  This is a very easy way for the House to evade its duties.  We are legislating here, and when we purport to legislate we should legislate. On this matter of the number of the board, a number of questions will arise. These are questions which will need to be solved at an early date, because until this grading takes place a whole lot of people will be in the position that they will not know where they are.  The question will arise when people are starting to do repairs or decorations as to whether these will be done in first-class style or otherwise. I think personally that the board should be constituted at an early date, and that some steps should be taken to indicate what the board is to do, irrespective of what the number on the board should be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be suggested that a very small number may be a more efficient board.  We are dealing with a matter that will occupy a considerable time, at least for the first year or two after the Act comes into operation.  A very small body of men can give all their time to that work.  In the first year they are going to have a very extensive job of it in the matter of grading hotels and guest houses.  There will be thousands of applications from all sorts of hotels. It would be a big job, in the first place, and it would be essential that it should be carried through in as short a time as possible, so that the people who own these houses which are to be segregated should know precisely where they are.  It is a question of opinion whether five is better than six or seven, or whether a smaller number would be better.  My idea, when I put down this amendment, was that if the Minister were going to choose five lay people, this provision would give him an opportunity to put on the board in a consultative capacity somebody with expert knowledge of the hotel business. It may be that he will select somebody with experience of hotel work who has no connection with any of the existing hotels.  Unless that is done, I do not see how this work of grading can be carried through.  I do not know how people without professional knowledge of hotel work would be able properly to distinguish between hotels, guest houses and hostels.  It is, in my opinion, imperative that this board should include somebody with technical knowledge, though it may be difficult to get a man who is completely independent.</P>

      <P>One argument has been advanced in favour of this amendment. That argument was advanced by Deputy O'Sullivan.  He said that if seven persons were appointed, there would be a better chance of getting one good member on the board than if only five were appointed.  I do not think that Deputy Dillon referred to the amendment at all.  Deputy McMenamin gave me the impression that he only began to think of arguments in favour of the amendment when he got on his feet.  Let us deal with the one argument we have got in support of the amendment, and see if there is any force in it.  If it be true that, by increasing the size of the board from five to seven, you increase the chance of getting one good member, why stop at seven?  Why should you not go on to 70, or even 500?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall answer the Deputy's point, because that is the sole issue&mdash;why we should stop at five.  I am disposing of Deputy O'Sullivan's argument, in the first instance, because, to me, it seems that there is no force in that argument.  There is no reason why we should stop at seven if the idea be to get one good member, irrespective of the total number of members of the board.  It is the board and not the members which will function.  The board, and not the members, is the important consideration. You have got to get a board which will be compact, efficient, capable of meeting at short notice, capable of arriving at expeditious decisions, of having continuity in its decisions and a logical sequence in the development of its policy.  Because of these reasons&mdash;efficiency, compactness and convenience&mdash;we decided to limit the membership of the board to five.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a business board.  It will carry out business functions.  It will be entrusted with considerable resources in money and it will have wide powers.  I want to ensure that it will exercise these powers and expend this money in the most efficient manner. The question is: what is the most efficient type of board we can get?  It is not a question of getting a good member or a bad member, and it is not a <Col N="918" /> question of whether we shall have hotel keepers or people with other qualifications on the board.  The question is whether, taking the board as a whole, it is going to be an efficient instrument for the carrying out of the work.  In our opinion, a board not exceeding five members is necessary for the efficient discharge of the functions which are being given to this body under the Bill.  It must be capable of meeting at reasonable intervals, of meeting at short notice, of dealing with the various matters that will come before it in a reasonably efficient way and it has got to be of such a character that it can act as a whole.  It is because of that latter consideration that I resisted, and will resist, any proposal to put on the board persons in their capacity as representatives of other people.  We do not want representatives on this board.  We want a body which will have a certain unified character and which will not consist of persons whose interests or loyalties will be concerned with some other organisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such proposal in the Bill.  We are not confined even to selecting persons resident in this country.  The intention is to get a board capable of carrying out the functions given to this body by the Bill efficiently and well and of ensuring that there will be a reasonable balance of qualifications amongst them, so that the organisation as a whole will be able to work efficiently.  On that account, I think it would be unwise to increase the membership of the board.  Increased membership would, in my opinion, reduce its efficiency and make it less capable of acting in the manner we contemplate.  Therefore, I ask the Dáil not to accept the amendment.</P>

He would have great difficulty in getting that done.  A man may have other appointments for the day on which he is summoned to Dublin to a meeting of this board.  These men will not be at the beck and call of the secretary of this body.  They will be men of affairs and they will not be waiting in glass-houses for a post card from the secretary to attend a meeting of the Tourist Traffic Board.  They will not be able to make off in an aeroplane to Dublin when they get such notice.  There will be difficulty in getting a quorum.</P>

He will admit that the Bill merely says that a board shall be appointed and that they shall be allowed to do pretty well what they like so as to improve the tourist industry.  The Minister says that we shall have five businessmen on this board who will conduct its affairs.

      <P>This amendment is incomplete because it did not seem to me necessary to go through the whole Bill and produce all the consequential amendments necessary to this as that can be done in the Seanad, if this amendment be carried. What is involved here is the withdrawal from the board, after it has been appointed, of the invidious task of choosing its own employees.  The Minister has told us now that for the vacancies, five in number, which are available on the board, he has 55,000 applications, more or less.  He is to undertake the Herculean task of considering 55,000 applications and rejecting 54,995 of the applicants.  I have no doubt that Deputy Moore, Deputy Allen and Deputy Briscoe will be active to assist the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;and that he will do the best he can for them.  If the Minister for five positions has received 55,000 applications, by adopting the formula employed by the Minister, but mostly by the Taoiseach himself, in other matters, and by multiplying the number of positions available in this instance by the appropriate multiplicand, we discover that for 15 positions there will be 165,000 applications.  If these applications are going to be sorted, examined and checked, and the representations of the friends of the applicants heard, the poor five members of the board will have no recourse but to retire to Portrane Lunatic Asylum or to Grangegorman, where they will certainly rapidly go if applications for positions under this body are anything like as numerous as the Minister received for appointment to the body itself.  I therefore, harmlessly enough, offer to members of the board, the unfortunate five, a ready escape by placing a statutory obligation on them to refer all appointments to the Appointments Commission so that when the army of 165,000 advance to the fray they can simply divert them to the boardroom of the Appointments Commission.  Let the Appointments Commission select the 15 employees required and pass them on to the board.  The board, of course, would have a perfect right, if these 15 employees did not come up to expectations or did not do the job as they wished it to be done, to dispense with their services and to instruct the Appointments Commission to get a new staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="923" /> Everybody knows that if we do not do this, the board will become very largely the resort of jobbers.  Everybody who has been on a local authority knows that unless you have power to refer an appointment to the Local Appointments Commission your life is a misery.  If a wardsmaid has to be appointed in the Roscommon County Home, people are knocking at my door at all hours of the night.  As a matter of fact, they spend more money travelling round the county canvassing than the successful applicant can ever hope to earn in a lifetime of service. Why they do it I cannot imagine but everybody who has been on a local authority knows that that is true.  If you are going to subject these five unfortunate members of the tourist board to the representations of 165,000 applicants every time 15 people will have to be appointed, no work, except that of holding the ravenous hordes at bay, will be done.</P>
    <P>I find, on the other hand, that where we refer an appointment to the Appointments Commission no difficulty or no undue delay arises.  Speaking as a person who has had experience of the patronage of a public authority, I say without hesitation that the most welcome news that has ever come to us on a public authority is when the secretary tells us, that we have the right, and even better still, the obligation, to refer an appointment to the Appointments Commission.  Remember this, if you have the right but not the statutory obligation to refer an appointment to the Appointments Commission&mdash;there are some temporary appointments or some minor positions where you have the right to send to the Appointments Commission or to act yourselves&mdash;and if you are left a discretion in the matter, you are far worse off than if the Appointments Commission were not mentioned at all, because you are first canvassed not to send the appointment to the Appointments Commission.  There is a fight that 40 can join in about that.  When that is determined and you have been overruled and they have decided not to send the appointment to the Appointments Commission, the canvass begins by the several candidates for the position. <Col N="924" /> I can see no reasonable objection to having all applications for positions under this board sent to the Appointments Commission.  I am perfectly satisfied that the efficiency of the members of the board will be increased by placing a statutory obligation on them to send all such applications to the Appointments Commission.  In fact, I think the members of the board would be deeply indebted to the members of the Oireachtas if such a statutory obligation were placed upon them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon said that this is an amendment to deprive the board of the power to appoint its own officers.  That is a fair description of it. I think it would be most unwise to deprive the board of that power.  We discussed this matter at great length when the Bill was in Committee, and I expressed my views on it then.  I thought we had disposed of this point in Committee, but apparently there was no amendment actually moved such as we have now before us.  This is a business body.  It is not a local authority, and the experience of local bodies has nothing to do with this question.  The people who sit on this board will not be elected by popular vote, and therefore will not be open to be influenced by candidates or their relatives.  It will be its job to appoint a staff to carry out its work, and it will be at complete liberty to dismiss, remove or reappoint any member of the staff as occasion requires.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is essential to get, in a business organisation, full and complete control over staff by the executive authority.  I think that without that full and complete control you will not have the discipline and the efficiency, which comes from discipline, and which success requires.  I could easily visualise cases in which it would be a quite practicable line for the board to take to utilise the machinery of the Local Appointments Commission to recruit its staff.  Certain classes of staff, or even, in the course of time, the whole of its staff might possibly be recruited in that way when the formative years had passed, and when knowledge had been acquired as to the qualifications that were best suited in particular grades of officers, and so-forth. <Col N="925" /> In the beginning, however, I think that we must give the board the same freedom which our predecessors found it necessary to give the Electricity Supply Board.  This section, as Deputies know, is taken word for word from the Act which set up the Electricity Supply Board.  The members of that board were also given the power to utilise, if they so desired, the machinery of the Local Appointments Commission.  They had never utilised that machinery.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They set up an exactly analogous machine of their own.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They decided that was preferable from their point of view in their particular case.  It was open to the Electricity Supply Board under the Act, to employ the machinery of the Local Appointments Commission for the recruitment of, say, clerical officers.  Those entering that grade must have certain educational qualifications, and, as the Deputy knows, are selected <i>en masse</i> by the Civil Service Commissioners to fill positions in the Civil Service.  But it is only in such a grade that this method of recruitment is particularly suitable.  The case is different where you are dealing with a business concern.  Persons required to fill positions of executive responsibility in a business concern must, I think, be picked individually by those who have to carry responsibility for the manner in which they discharged their duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not prepared, however, to modify the section in the manner suggested by the amendment.  I think that we should give this board whatever power it decides itself to avail of in the matter of the appointment of staff control of staff and dismissal of staff.  I do not think it would be at all a suitable arrangement to require it to utilise the machinery of the Local Appointments Commission in respect of all grades of officers, whether or not that machinery was suitable from their point of view or not.  There may however, be certain classes of staff employed by the board in respect of which the Local Appointments Commission machinery would be <Col N="926" /> suitable.  We are giving the board power to call upon and utilise that machinery if they think it is suitable, but if they do not think it is suitable then they can proceed otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the Minister is so obstinate in this important matter.  Listening to him, I should not have recognised the Local Appointments Commission.  He spoke as if the Local Appointments Commission had only one way of recruiting staff&mdash;by examination.  His whole argument was directed to show that there are certain cases in which that is not suitable.  Surely, the Minister is aware that there is another method open to the Local Appointments Commission, one that is frequently employed. In the case of certain appointments, the Minister mentioned that certain scholastic qualifications are necessary, and, therefore, that for them the procedure of the Local Appointments Commission would be suitable for selection <i>en masse.</i>  But here you have to choose employees individually. I think that was how the Minister put it.  In answer to that, may I say that the Local Appointments Commission is doing that every other day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>And for all sorts of businesses conducted by local authorities.  The idea that a local authority is to conduct itself in an unbusinesslike fashion was voiced by the Minister the last day, and again to-day. I cannot see what the objection is to the amendment.  The Minister implied to-day, as he did the last day, that, if a person is recruited in this particular way, it deprives the board of power over him: that the person so appointed is less disciplined.  I fail to see it.  The Minister did not bring forward the slightest argument in favour of that. I must say that from the point of view of the government of this country it would be an outrageous assumption, because both the Local Government and the Central Government of this country are open to the objection the Minister raises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>May I interrupt the <Col N="927" /> Deputy?  I think that, from the point of view of the local authorities and of the Central Government, the power of direct appointment of staff would lead to better discipline and more efficiency, but there are objections to that procedure, objections that were voiced by Deputy Dillon.  There is the objection that the individual members of local authorities and individual members of the Dáil are elected by popular vote, and consequently cannot afford, and sometimes are not allowed, to apply considerations that the board of a business concern would apply.  The Local Appointments Commission would never have been created but for the objections to that method of appointment by individual members of local authorities to which Deputy Dillon referred.  It is because these objections were there that the Local Appointments Commission was set up, but these objections do not exist in the case of this board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad that I gave way to the Minister, because the statement that he has just made is a very extraordinary one coming from a member of the Government &mdash;that the main thing that can be said in favour of the present recruitment by the Civil Service of officials under local bodies, is that you prevent open, downright and wholesale corruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement practically amounted to that.  If the Minister will allow me to interpret him, does he think that because the board appoints a man that they are not likely to be canvassed? He himself has already been canvassed. Surely he knows perfectly well that any body of men, no matter how they are appointed, whether they are elected or not, are liable to be canvassed.  Does the Minister think that the only consideration with a man who is a member of a board of that kind is his future election or non-election; that if he had not that before him, he would not be amenable to pressure of that kind?  The Minister knows perfectly well that <Col N="928" /> there will be a tremendous amount of canvassing.  The mere fact that you appoint a board, and that the members of it are not elected, is quite irrelevant. Canvassing will be quite a consideration in this as in the case of any other board.  The Minister knows perfectly well that those five people will be liable to continuous canvassing. You will have that situation going on from one end of the year to the other. It will go on all the time&mdash;not merely when appointments are to be filled.</P>
      <P>Not long ago the county council of the county that I represent indicated that they would get rid of the system of collecting the rates by means of the post office, and appoint ratepayers to do the work.  The Minister for Local Government indicated that he would not give his consent to any such step. The result is that the whole county is alive and buzzing with canvassers for the jobs that are not in existence.  Is the Minister simple enough to think that those five people, merely because they are his nominees, are going to escape that?  He may answer that they have the power to ask the Local Appointments Commission to act. They have, but they will not do that. They will be urged, as Deputy Dillon has pointed out, not to use that power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister seems to have forgotten that there are two ways of making appointments.  One is by means of examination.  As regards clerical appointments, the Civil Service and the Electricity Supply Board in some cases do not require candidates to do their examination before appointing them to positions.  Instead, I understand, they take the results of the candidates' leaving certificate examination. But when it comes to the individual qualifications for certain technical jobs, that is precisely the thing which is foreseen in the Civil Service Commission Act and in the Local Appointments Commission Act, namely, a selection board of people who would be acquainted with the precise qualifications required, and in connection with whom there is a distinct disqualification of any candidate who attempts canvassing.  That is a tremendous safeguard which you have not at the present moment in the Bill. For that reason, I am sorry that the <Col N="929" /> Minister thinks it necessary to be so obstinate with regard to this particular matter.  I am convinced that, no matter what Government is in power and no matter what Minister makes the appointment, there will be a much more effective working board if they are relieved of this very invidious task which the Minister now throws upon their shoulders.  That is the reason I put my name to this amendment.</P>

Is it not true that the higher civil servants are all chosen <Col N="930" /> by selection board?  I am only advocating for this comparatively insignificant tourist body the procedure whereunder the civil servants who constitute the permanent Government of the State are chosen.  Surely, the procedure suitable for choosing the most responsible public officers in the country ought to be suitable for choosing the underlings of the tourist board.  Deputy Moore seems to think that, having chosen five suitable persons to sit upon this board, we have exhausted the possibilities of tourist experts in Ireland.  The Minister tells us he has 55,000 clamorous experts &mdash;11,000 boards; he can have 11,000 boards with a different personnel for each board.</P>

      <P>Each of those autonomous bodies had the right, if they wished, to go to the Local Appointments Commissioners or to select their own staff.  This new board which is to be set up by the Minister will be so corrupt, in the minds of Deputy Dillon and Deputy O'Sullivan, that they will be incapable of selecting an efficient staff.  On the question of the Local Appointments Commission and the official staffs that they produced for local authorities, I will admit right away that they got good staffs, but they got no better staffs than those local authorities got before the Local Appointments Commission came into existence&mdash;no better in any way.  There were just as efficient staffs there before the Local Appointments Commission came along as any that the Appointments Commission produced.  I am prepared to back my opinion against that of Deputy Dillon.</P>

      <P>I desire to support the view expressed by Deputy Professor O'Sullivan.  The Minister will, I am sure, admit that the very fact that he nominates or appoints five members of this board would place on those men, I do not say responsibility, but some kind of obligation to bear in mind anybody that he, the Minister, might wish to recommend to them for appointment. The Minister is not so simple as to tell me that he will not be canvassed for the purpose of making an approach to members of the board in favour of some applicants who can bring sufficient political pressure to bear on the Minister.  That, I am sure, will not be denied.  That is the natural course of events in cases of this kind.  I can see a good case&mdash;and I believe it is likely to happen&mdash;for all authority being handed over to the permanent member of the board; that is, for the chairman, or the chief executive officer, whoever he may be, having a considerable say in the selection of the staff who will have to work under him subsequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this scheme as visualised by the Minister the whole of the board will have the responsibility for making appointments.  I say that there is a loophole there.  I am not making any allegation of corruption against the Minister in connection with this or any other case.  There is there a method of approach to the Minister, and people are in a position to bring sufficient pressure to bear upon every Minister of every Government to get him to say a word on behalf of some applicant to a member of a board that he himself has appointed.  The member, in turn, would regard himself as being under some obligation to the Minister, who appointed him, to pay particular regard to any recommendation which would go to him in that way.  I put that point in favour of the suggestion put forward by Deputy O'Sullivan, without, I sincerely say, making any <Col N="933" /> allegation of corruption against whoever will be the members of the board.</P>

      <P>I should like to know what are the circumstances in which the board might consider it desirable to refer any particular appointment to the Local Appointments Commission. So far as I can see, discretionary power is to be given to the board only for the <Col N="934" /> purpose of relieving them of an awkward situation such as, say, when there might be an exceptionally large number of applicants for a particular position.  I fail to see why they should have discretionary power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment I was deploring the fact that it has become the fashion for Ministers to walk in here with important Bills, many of them Bills calculated to cost the country considerable sums of money, without either understanding or studying the Bills themselves, and certainly without giving Deputies any information with regard to them.  I instanced one in particular.  The peculiarity is not confined to one Department. On general questions of broad policy of the greatest magnitude, and of immense importance to everybody, but of particular interest to thinking people, we have a deliberately calculated policy to try and withhold from the people, as much information as possible.  We had the comedy of the various Defence Votes in the Dáil, where so much was said by the Taoiseach, and practically every statement made by him was contradicted subsequently by the Minister in charge of the Department of Defence, and finally we had a kind of weak and watery compromise, apparently between two conflicting points of view, put to the country; and in exchange for the watery compromise, that was really a conspiracy to tell nobody anything, we were asked to put up the biggest individual sum ever asked for in the history of this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to that weak and watery compromise we were in the position of asking the people, not only to give money which they can ill afford to give, but to give their sons as well.  The position is this&mdash;and both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Defence happen to be present&mdash;that it is <Col N="936" /> within the memory of every Deputy that, on what I may call the first big defence debate we had some six or nine months ago, we had an announcement from the Taoiseach to the effect that neutrality, or a policy of neutrality, for this country was so much nonsense; that it was utter folly, and not practical politics if we proposed to continue to export food to Great Britain.  I think on that occasion the Taoiseach was congratulated from this side of the House for having faced up to facts, even though these facts might be unpleasant, and for having laid down, in the face of facts, a plan or proposal or theory that might be politically awkward or politically difficult.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, and at a later stage of another debate with regard to the same subject, we had the clear cut policy put forward by the head of the Department of Defence, that the policy of the Executive Council, and the defence policy of the country, was a policy of neutrality.  If we were to accept the words of the Taoiseach, that is a policy of folly.  None of us has the amount of information that is at the disposal of either the Taoiseach or any of the Ministers, and I am not staking any Minister, or attempting to stake him to one particular line or one particular policy, but I am entitled to ask on such an important matter of broad national policy, which is the policy of the Government, and what are the reasons in support of that particular policy?  If the original statement made by the Taoiseach is correct, then there is no justification for the immense demands that are being made on the country.</P>
    <P>If neutrality is a policy which it is merely politically expedient to preach, but which, in our hearts, we believe is merely a very temporary policy, and if, as the Taoiseach said, the export of food to a belligerent country would be regarded as contraband and that we would be involved in the war, then it is a policy we are entitled to try, for no matter what very limited or very short space of time; but at the expiration of that short time, we are entitled to know what country or what combination of countries would be likely to attack us.  A soldier fighting without <Col N="937" /> arms is useless; a soldier fighting against his conscience is worthless.</P>
    <P>Because of political expediency, we are drifting into a very serious position in this country.  We are drifting into a position where, whether they be many or few, every second man joining the Volunteers is joining with a different aim in view, with a different outlook, and with a different interpretation of Government policy.  I know that five Volunteers within the last fortnight were asked: &ldquo;If a war comes, do you think we will escape?&rdquo; and the answer of all of them was &ldquo;No, we might escape for a month or so, but we would be involved, we would be into it, certainly within a very short time.&rdquo;  They were then asked against whom they would be fighting. Two of them said Ulster, one of them said Great Britain, and two of them said the Axis Powers.  I believe it is nothing short of sinful to be recruiting young men in blinkers to that extent.</P>
    <P>We in this country, irrespective of the sides we are on, have, or should have, a higher conception of the gravity of taking human life than is found in many countries.  We have a certain teaching, that in war we are entitled to take life provided our conscience directs us in that direction.  On that particular question we have what I, at least, consider is a studied and deliberate attempt not to take either the Parliament or the public fully into our confidence.  We are talking about air-raid precautions and the dangers that are threatening our country, but we are afraid to say from where. From what point is danger threatening?</P>
    <P>I believe, and the same responsibility is not on me as on people sitting opposite, that in a world war there is only one danger point as far as this country goes, and that is attack from central European Powers, because of our immense value to Great Britain in supplying her Fleet and her Army with food in time of war.  Popular or unpopular, I am prepared to say that that is my belief and if I were sitting on the opposite side of the House I would be recruiting men specifically to make provision against attack from that direction. I would not humbug myself or allow anybody else to humbug me to <Col N="938" /> put on a soldier's uniform and a soldier's belt by appealing to sentiment along the line that we were going to await our opportunity to attack our traditional foe, or to use our arms to invade or attack the Irishmen in Ulster.</P>
    <P>Whether with or without the knowledge of the Government, whether with or without the approval of the Government, three conflicting doctrines are being preached at the present moment. A perusal of the speeches made from the Government Front Bench will lend strength to any one of the three gospels.  On that all-important matter there has never been a courageous, clear-cut statement of policy, never a clear statement of what are the most obvious or the most likely dangers.  If the recruiting is not as rapid as any of us would like, I want to put it to the head of the Government, to the Minister for Defence, that it is not because the youth of this country are selfish; it is not because the youth of this country are cowardly, but it is because the youth of this country, the same as the youth of any other country, are entitled to know, before they prepare for fight, against whom they are going to fight and alongside of whom they are going to fight.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach may smile, but he knows as well as I do, every bit as well if not better, that I am painting a perfectly fair picture and I am not painting it in a Party way and I am not springing it on the Government.  In every debate since danger appeared clearly on the horizon, I put exactly the same point of view and I have asked exactly the same questions, and only on one occasion did we appear to get an answer, and that was from the Taoiseach himself.  Every statement, every speech made since, was a repudiation of that answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies here, and the people outside, parents of children, and particularly the young men, are entitled to get a clear answer.  They are entitled to know whom they are likely to be against, and if there is any secret recruiting <Col N="939" /> on the basis of the starting of another civil war, this time against people who are as Irish as ourselves but different from us in religion, that should be clearly discouraged and definitely repudiated.</P>
    <P>I can see nothing but harm to the country, nothing but harm to the hopes of the people who wish to see us all living our lives in harmony as a reunited family&mdash;I can see nothing but harm resulting from the whispered propaganda of a coming civil war or a conflict between ourselves and the people in the North.  If such a situation did arise, it would not matter a thrauneen who won that civil war; we would be a more permanently divided country at the end of it than we are at the moment.  Whatever divisions are there at the moment are antiquated historical divisions and modern artificial divisions, but there is no real division.  Nothing would make a greater division than by bringing the quarrels of a century ago up to date and starting off another century with the bitterness of a civil war.  It is true that throughout every county of the twenty-six that whisper is going round, and I raise the point in order to get the whispering discouraged.  I am not suggesting that that whispering is emanating from a Ministerial chief or from a Party organisation. The whisper, however, in itself, is assisting in the mental confusion that there is at the moment on this important question, and the Taoiseach's silence and the contradictory statements from the Government Front Bench are further encouraging and lending countenance to the whispers.</P>
    <P>Now, every debate on defence over the last 12 months can be diligently thumbed by the staff of the Taoiseach. I have listened to most of them, and I have read every one of them, and I have never got one statement that clearly stated what would be the likely position in which we would find ourselves in the event of war, or, in the war that appears to be imminent, whom we are likely to be opposed to.  On the one hand, we are told that we cannot hope to be left out of that war, that our food supplies are too important <Col N="940" /> nowadays.  On the other hand, on a subsequent occasion, we are told that our policy is neutrality.  Now, it appears to me, at least, that the two statements are contradictory to the mind of the man in the street.  Any statements can be reconciled by quibbling in a debate.</P>
    <P>This whole matter, however, is a lot too serious for verbal word-spinning, for evasion, or for quibbling; and there is a responsibility on the Government to be frank, open, and candid with the people, and there is a very particular responsibility on them when they are asking the youth of the country to join the Army, or asking the parents to send their children into the Army.  Now, I should like to be taken in that respect as speaking purely as a citizen, and not as a speaker from a Party bench.  This morning, by post.  I got a couple of circular notices, asking me to stick them on my motor car, and the effect of these notices was to ask the youth to join the Volunteers.  I want to say frankly, whether it be popular or otherwise, that I would not ask one Christian boy to join any army in the whole world, at a time when war appeared to be imminent, without knowing on what side that boy was likely to be called upon to fight.  Not only that, but I would go further, and I would say that, as a matter of conscience, anybody that is in at the moment in a voluntary capacity, if he did not get an answer to that question, should get out.  If they have any deep convictions, or if they have any deep principles with regard to the things that appear to be at stake, they should not be left for one moment in doubt as to whether or not they are fighting in defence of those principles.  We heard all those speeches here in this House, and we heard speeches outside the House, and we have heard speeches across the radio night after night.  I should like to invite anybody to point out to me any one of these speeches, whether made inside or outside Dáil Eireann, which took the public in any degree into the confidence of the Government on that important matter.  So much for that.</P>
    <P>I said, earlier in this debate, that it struck me as rather extraordinary that, <Col N="941" /> at a time like this, the Vote for the head of the Government should be introduced without availing of the opportunity to give any announcement with regard to policy, to give any explanations with regard to the failure of policy or policies, or to give any hope whatsoever to the people at a time when many hopes had been blasted and when most of the people were either completely disillusioned or absolute doubters.  It is the first time that the Taoiseach introduced his Estimate, I think, since the cessation of the senseless economic war.  In itself, it would appear to be an occasion when we are entitled to expect some statement of policy or plan.</P>
    <P>In the past, there seemed to be a lot of confusion between promises and policies, and I think that both the members of the Party opposite and the great mass of the public outside have learned at least this much: that there is a vast difference between a mass of promises and either a sound policy or a considered plan.  The period of what I might call enthusiastic ballyhoo and dumb support has passed&mdash;definitely passed&mdash;and with the passing of that period the time is gone, too, when any Minister, no matter how influential in the past, can afford to come in here and ask this Assembly to vote money without having a good case in support of that claim; but we had the Taoiseach's silence here to-day.  There was another occasion, or other occasions, when he had very full opportunity for giving some particulars with regard to his policy.  We have just gone through a contested by-election in the capital of this country, and the Taoiseach was an active participant, just as we ourselves were, and he was facing the first contested by-election of this Parliament.  He was facing that by-election at a time when every one of his promises had become a joke, when every one of his plans had collapsed. I notice that the Taoiseach smiles.  There were references here by speakers, such as Deputies Davin, Norton and others, to the fact that when the Taoiseach took over responsibility as head of the Government we had an unemployment problem, and that, even according to the Taoiseach's <Col N="942" /> own estimates at the time, we had 60,000 unemployed human beings in this country.  We had that deplorable situation, according to himself and admitted by us; but at least we had it at 60,000, and we also had emigration to America&mdash;not to Great Britain&mdash;down to the figure of about 9,000 per annum. We also had a trade figure, which was considered unsatisfactory by Deputy de Valera, as he then was, in 1931, when he was over here on those benches; and we had a taxation figure which he and his lieutenants said was crippling trade and industry and bending the backs of the strongest men in this country.</P>
    <P>That is just seven years ago.  We have to-day an unemployment figure of over 100,000.  We have the crushing taxation increased by roughly 40 per cent, and we have emigration multiplied by 4, but into Great Britain, and we have a shrinkage of trade of from 40 to 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach smiles when I make a suggestion that the promises have not been kept or that the plans have not been a success.  Assuming for a moment that the promises were sincere and well intentioned, then the only other explanation is the complete collapse of the plan or plans.  Let us be sufficiently charitable to say that there were plans, and in an equal spirit of charity allow that the plans miscarried. One would think that, either here or outside, there would be something put before the people either by way of explanation or apology for the present situation and the present facts that cannot be disputed; but on the two occasions when the Taoiseach had an opportunity of addressing the electorate in the City of Dublin there were no further promises, there were no further plans either to stem the hæmorrhage of emigration, to reduce the numbers of unemployed, to relieve the pressure of taxation or to increase the volume of trade.  There was the old attempt of the cheer-raiser, the last desperate effort to introduce ballyhoo once again into Irish politics.  We were told that the only two things that remain to be done were the ending of Partition and the revival of the Irish language.  I would say this, that if there was one foul blow struck at the <Col N="943" /> hopes for national unity inside and outside our shores, it was when any political leader, particularly the political leader who happens to be head of the Government, attempted to make Partition an issue here in Southern Ireland.  There are people outside our shores who read our news, who are not as closely in touch with things here as we are, and when they see any political leader calling for support for that purpose, what is the implication?  The implication is that the others are opposed to that.  There is no division down here in the South between any Parties or any classes or any creeds on the desirability of ending Partition and  unity, and it is a foul thing for anybody for political advantage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to attempt to imply that there is division on that question.  Let us get down to brass tacks with regard to Partition.  We are all agreed that it is a very important and outstanding problem.  We are all agreed that it is a state of affairs which it is highly desirable to terminate. The Taoiseach has been sitting over there for nearly eight years. During those eight years what has been his contribution to the restoration of the country into a territorial unit? What is his contribution to the reduction or termination of Partition?  At least this can be said, that before we changed places here there was a very determined and continuous effort being made to bring about conditions here which would be better than the conditions which existed on the other side of the border.  There was a very continuous and courageous effort, in spite of all the clap-trap that was poured out then from these benches, to keep the taxation per head down here lower than taxation per head in the North, to keep income-tax down here at a lower figure than obtained up there, and generally, to bring about greater conditions down here than existed in the North, and failing all that, at least, to erect no new barriers between this portion of Ireland and the portion of Ireland that is cut away.  The Taoiseach <Col N="944" /> says unity is the one supreme issue ahead of us.  What has been the seven years' contribution made by his Government?  We have the cost of living of every family down here artificially forced on to a considerably higher plane than the cost of living of a family in the North.  Leaving politics on one side, does any thinking man believe that you are going to induce any Northern family to come in here on the plea that by coming in it will cost them very much more a week to live than it costs them up there?  His Ministers, every single month since they became Ministers, have been laying one brick on top of another brick, building a high impassable tariff wall between this country and the North.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach think, in all fairness, that the industrialist up there, who has no tariff barrier in his way when he is purchasing his raw materials from abroad, is going to come in here in order to spend his time trying to jump a tariff barrier, in order to pay more for his raw materials, in order to reduce the profits of his industry? Does the Taoiseach think, when he and his Ministers scoffed at the proposal to take the rates off the land in Éire, that the Northern farmer, who has no rates to pay, is going to be induced to come in here in order to have the pleasure and benefit of paying rates to this Parliament?  The Taoiseach may argue that as against rates there is a reduction of annuities.  As against the reduction of the annuities there is a loss down here&mdash;and well he knows it&mdash; that will never be equated, even if there was complete abolition of annuities.  The contrast between the farmer north of the Boundary and the farmer south of the Boundary is as great a contrast as that between black and white.</P>
      <P>Let us take the economy on the farm. We all sell in a common market, the farmer in the North and the farmer in the South.  We have an artificial state of affairs brought about here by political experimenters, which produces the result that for feeding stuffs or any of the raw materials that go to produce our export article, the farmer down here has got to pay twice as much as the farmer in the North.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="945" /> It may be argued that those things were desirable, that they were even necessary, but ask any sensible person, as far as the ending of Partition goes, what was the effect of any one of those things towards achieving that particular end.  Leaving political acrobaties out of it entirely, leaving aside the political strife and the political tension that have been deliberately introduced down here in the last seven years, can the Taoiseach or any of his Ministers point to one practical step, even one, or one piece of legislation that would have the effect of bringing unity nearer or shortening the duration of Partition by as much as one minute?</P>
    <P>I have enumerated a number of things that at least make the ending of Partition more distant.  We have created an immense vested interest down here whose material outlook would be against the abolition of Partition. Now, it is all very well for any of us to go out and make cheap political speeches dealing with the matter of the national importance of a united country, but sincere people want something more than speeches.  It is actions that impress people rather than speeches, but at the end of seven years under the men who had a plan, the plan boils down to this that &ldquo;We will tell the world about it.&rdquo;  The world heard of the Partition of this country before ever they heard the yells of the Fianna Fáil Party, and in spite of the world knowing of it ever since it was first effected, there was very little assistance from the world towards terminating it.  No matter how we squeal to the rest of the world we would be giving greater evidence of sincerity, greater evidence of our detestation of Partition, if we made some little contribution ourselves, some little sacrifice, or some little practical step calculated to terminate Partition.</P>
    <P>One of the most shameful things in a bad record of seven and a half years is, that the Government have exploited Partition and used Partition for selfish political purposes, but, behind the smoke-screen created by fiery speeches, practically every second action can only have the effect of making Partition more permanent than it appears to be <Col N="946" /> now.  We heard a fair statement from speakers on this bench and on my right with regard to the state of affairs existing at the moment, with regard to how much conditions in this country have been worsened in the last seven years.  We heard a speech by Deputy Childers&mdash;a new and enthusiastic member of the Government Party&mdash;warning the Government as to where they are going and giving them 12 months to get on the correct road. Speeches of that kind have been made from these benches for six and seven years past.  Seven years ago&mdash;six, even five years ago&mdash;there was a tendency on the Government Benches to scoff at that type of speech, to make a jeer out of any warning, to pour derision on the man who attempted to suggest that the path of the Government was the path of the rake.  It is far more impressive now to have that coming from a Deputy of the Government Party, and it is particularly valuable that that particular declaration from that particular point of the compass should have been made in the presence of the Taoiseach on the Taoiseach's own Estimate. I would ask the Taoiseach to be more expansive in winding up this debate than he has been in opening it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make a few remarks on this Vote, and would like to say at the outset that I was greatly disappointed that the Taoiseach did not see his way to make any explanation in introducing this Vote. We, on this side of the House, are left, unfortunately, in the position that we can only guess at what the opinion of the Government is on matters that they ought long ago to have made up their minds on.  Now, the first point that apparently arises&mdash;and I do <Col N="947" /> not know whether the Government have yet made up their minds about it or not&mdash;is our attitude in time of war.  I take it that our people do not want to sacrifice their children to Moloch.  We would like to get out of a war if we can do so and keep our self-respect.  Nothing has been said from the Government Benches as to the moral issue in a time of war.  I think that if war were threatened here this country ought to try to look at the moral aspect.  I do not profess to look at it from any higher standard than any other Deputy in this House; but I merely mention that the question of whether a war would be right or wrong has apparently not entered officially and publicly into the Government's conclusion.</P>
      <P>I would like to ask the Government if they have made up their minds that &mdash;no matter what it involves us in&mdash;we are going to supply Great Britain with food in time of war.  I think, having regard to the figures of our trade, we would be left in the position that, involve what it might, we would have to supply food to Great Britain or leave it to rot here.  That brings us to another matter which, in my opinion, is equally important.  Where have we arranged for supplies of goods essential for our industries to come from in time of war?  In this debate there seems to be a ghastly air of unreality hovering over the whole discussion, because certain things that are perfectly obvious have not been admitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not profess either to be a strategist, or to have any information which is not available to any Deputy, but I think it quite certain that, on the outbreak of a major European war, ships from any country other than Great Britain would largely disappear. Where are we going to get our essential supplies?  I do not mean so much food as things like rubber, turpentine and various other things that come in via Great Britain.  It seems to me that the Government ought to have made some calculation.  I know they have made a calculation in respect of being anxious to see stocks of many essential commodities increased here, but I put it to the Taoiseach that apparently no <Col N="948" /> provision has been made for the insurance of these goods against the air attack when they are here.  The Taoiseach may argue that things are not going to be in great danger here, that this country is really a backwater and that we are quite safe, but if the Government, on the one hand, are urging people to hold bigger stocks and have not made up their minds as to how security for the trader against air attack is to be provided, on the other hand, it lends an air of unreality which I think the Taoiseach will agree requires to be dealt with.  One has only to stand on one of the bridges and look at the ships arriving in the river and ask himself: &ldquo;Are these all coming in for fun?  Could they all be prevented and could we do without them?&rdquo; to arrive at the conclusion that the major portion of these supplies would be essential in peace or in war.</P>
    <P>In the last war, most people can remember that certificates were issued according to priority, but that only people for whom it was important to get supplies got them.  If the British learned anything, we will find that what it took them months in the last war to make up their minds about, they will make up their minds about now in minutes, and that from the very outbreak of a major European war, unless this country has come to some bargain with somebody as to essential supplies, we will be starved industrially.  I am not throwing cold water on what the Minister for Industry and Commerce has done in the way of promoting industries, but everybody engaged in industry knows that all one can hope for is to advance things by stages, and that the finished product of one trade is the raw material of another.  There are hundreds and thousands of things in respect of which, from the outbreak of a major war, this country would be slowly starved into either making some bargain or exporting all its exportable man-power. There is another matter which lends itself to this air of unreality.  I will merely refer in passing to the Air Raid Precautions Bill.</P>

Apparently, men, women and children, in modern warfare, may well find themselves in the line of fire, and I ask the Taoiseach to give us some line as to the Government policy on these essential matters: Are we going to send our food away; are we going to get our supplies in, or make the best bargain we can?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I can show you, Sir, that it comes under this Vote. Questions have been addressed to me on the subject, and that is the only reason I raise it.  I do so, not so much in the spirit of criticism, as for the purpose of eliciting information.  I am entirely in favour of anything that raises the status of this State, and which shows that it has a complete and separate independence of its own, dissociated from any other State, and therefore I consider that the reception <Col N="950" /> of foreign representatives here is one of some importance as showing our position and status, both towards these representatives and as far as we ourselves are concerned.  The question which has given me some difficulty is that, so far as I can make out, after the Napoleonic wars, and as a result of the Treaty of Vienna and the Treaty of Aix la Chapelle, foreign diplomatic representatives were divided into three classes which, since then, international usage has adopted.</P>
      <P>First of all you had the ambassadors and nuncios who were in the same class &mdash;legates or nuncios.  You then had ministers and envoys accredited to the sovereign heads of the State.  You had three classes.  You had the resident minister and lastly you had the <i>chargé d'affaires</i> who was accredited not to the sovereign head of the State but to the Minister for External Affairs or whatever was the name of the Minister to whom he was sent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past year or so we have had an official head of this State.  We now have the President who came into being as a result of Article XIII of the Constitution which was enacted by the people.  He is the first citizen of this State and one would naturally assume and be entitled to assume that when a Minister is accredited to the State from a foreign State he would present his credentials to the first citizen of the State&mdash;the President here.  It was with considerable astonishment that I and a number of other people&mdash; in fact a great number of people who have taken an interest in the matter&mdash; saw that when a foreign representative was being received here it was not by the head of the State.  He was received by the head of the Government &mdash;by the Minister for External Affairs, the Taoiseach.  I think it is due to these foreign States with whom we have an international change of representatives that we should be told exactly where we are in a matter of this kind, and to assume that the status of the Minister who comes from a foreign State to this country is that of a Minister accredited to the sovereign head of this State.  I suggest to the Government that the proper person to whom he should present his credentials <Col N="951" /> and the person who should receive that Minister on his arrival here is the President and not the Prime Minister or Taoiseach, because I think it lowers our status and the status of the representatives coming in here if they are treated as <i>chargés d'affaires</i> only; and that appears to be the way they have been treated.  It might be said that the Taoiseach in receiving Ministers from foreign States is receiving them as head of the Government&mdash;as Prime Minister.</P>
    <P>I only rise on this Vote to try to elicit information as to whether the Ministers of foreign States are first of all being received as Ministers accredited to the head of the State or merely as <i>chargés d'affaires</i> and if they are received as Ministers accredited to the sovereign head of the State whether they should be received by the President or by the Minister as head of the Government or Minister for External Affairs.</P>

      <P>I have a complaint to make on this occasion, similar to that which I had to make on two or three occasions of the same kind, namely, that a convention which had been more or less accepted here in the past has been departed from; that was a very useful arrangement, by which the Government would be told in advance what was the main subject of criticism.  In that way an opportunity would be given to the Government to examine the details which might be expected to arise on such an occasion.  That has been discontinued this year and for some years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I beg the Taoiseach's pardon.  I, personally, was approached by the Chief Whip of the Government Party who asked me what were the particular matters to be raised, and my reply was that as far as we were concerned they would be economics and finance.  Two-thirds of the points raised by me were economics and finance.  We are not responsible for the Labour Party.  I am sure that the Chief Whip of the Government Party will not deny that that was the information given him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;Economics and <Col N="952" /> finance&rdquo; do not give much information as to what the chief points were to be. The Deputy might as well say Government policy, and Government policy covers almost every activity of this State.  Is it to be expected that there could be anything like a reasonable debate, lasting over a reasonable time, in which we could treat such matters? These are questions, every one of them, which would deserve close debate, not wild statements, but close debate in which facts and figures would be adduced by the speakers in support of their arguments and not wild assertions. We have had raised to-day a series of questions, every one of which on account of its importance might justify a debate lasting a day or two. I do not say for a moment that we would not be better employed discussing these questions than dealing with many other matters that might arise here.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the point at all.  The point is that I would have to speak for several hours to deal adequately with the points that have been raised, many of which could have been very well put down as Parliamentary questions and to which answers could be given.  Let us try to have a survey of some of the things that have been raised here on this debate.  First of all, there has been the suggestion that I should have given at the start, if I had followed the custom, a general outline of Government policy.  That has never been the case so far as I know and I have been longer in the House than Deputy Dillon has been.  The usual procedure has been that of having the Vote formally moved with, perhaps, a few remarks on the items of expenditure, explaining a reduction here and an increase there in the various items. It was left to the Opposition, in their criticism, to outline a particular subject from a particular angle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To-day I have been accused, first of all quite wrongly, of departing from <Col N="953" /> custom, and another complaint made was my absence from the House.  I am always at the disposal of the House.  There has never been a question addressed to me of which I have not myself personally taken charge. If a responsible Minister is here in charge of a Bill he represents Government policy.  He puts Government policy before the House on that particular matter and he is quite competent to do it.  The policy behind the measure has been discussed by the whole Government.  He is the Minister responsible for the administration of the particular Department concerned with the Bill and he speaks on that matter with the voice of the Government.  What would be the point of having two voices?  If the House wants me at any particular time, they know very well that I am in a room here all the time while the House is in session.</P>
    <P>There is no point in two people sitting down here, particularly when anybody interested in the debate has the Official Reports available to him.  That being the case, there is no point in a second Minister sitting here doing nothing.  If the Official Reports were not available for consultation there might be a point in the complaint made.  If the Official Reports were not available it might make a difference, as possibly Government policy might be raised.  But that is not the position. Every member of the Government who wants to know what has been said during a debate on any particular measure has only to go and get the reports on any particular matter in which he is interested.  There is, therefore, no point in the criticism or complaint that I am not available for the House.  I am always available.</P>
    <P>With regard to the criticism about the introduction of the Vote, I say this is and always has been an occasion in which the Opposition has taken the lead in criticising Government policy. My main difficulty this evening has been that the debate has ranged over every possible topic of importance.  If I were to give anything like a satisfactory answer to the questions raised, I would have to take a whole day after adequate preparation of the details, to <Col N="954" /> answer even a small selection of the points raised.</P>
    <P>The whole history of the past has been raised in the allegation that we have broken our promises.  I deny that we have done so.  According to custom, it is only what was done in the past year which should be under discussion, but I deny that we have broken promises made in the past.  I claim that we have a record of achievement within the past seven years which is strictly in accord with our programme as published during the different elections.  Our programme had political, social and economic aspects.  We have worked out the political side of our programme to the point that, as I said in a recent speech referred to this evening, the big national objectives which still remain concern the ending of Partition and the restoration of the national language.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Why not unemployment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be dealt with in its own place.  The question of unemployment is part of the national work.  Whatever Deputy Davin and others, who think only of the material side, may hold, it is the people with national ideals who made it possible for this Parliament to deal with unemployment and other matters. Our attitude has been that, in the work to be done by this Government or any other Government that may come to office, there are certain objectives which can be classified.  I have been accustomed to classify them for many years and I shall repeat the classification. These objectives have political, social, economic and cultural aspects. I have said, with regard to the political and cultural aspects, that our programme has not been completed so far as the Irish language and the ending of Partition are concerned.  Because I pointed out these as national objectives, it was stated this evening that I was trying to make Party capital out of them.  I have never denied that there are people on the opposite benches as anxious for the restoration of the Irish language as I am.  My great hope was that that was one of the things in respect of which <Col N="955" /> there would be common agreement. We might not agree about methods but, so far as the objective was concerned, I took it that, if put to a vote, that was a thing on which we should have a larger majority than on anything else.  I have said the same thing with regard to Partition.  I have never denied that the ending of Partition is an objective about which members of the Opposition are as anxious as we are.  That does not prevent me from having to say, as Head of the Government responsible for the settlement of national objectives, that the restoration of the Irish language and the ending of Partition form part of the objectives which this Government or any other Government which may come into office would seek to attain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before we got to that point, there were a number of other things to be done, things that were dividing our people, things on which those on the opposite benches had very different views from those which we held.  I regard as a very great achievement, indeed, that we have been able to bring about a situation in which we have finished the quarrel with regard to certain other things and in which we have arrived at a common level with regard to the main national objectives.  Again, we may differ about the means of achievement.  We have removed the oath of allegiance.  We have ended the position in which our Supreme Court was not supreme at all. We have ended a number of other things which created difficulties in the past between us and we have got to the point in which, as regards the main national political objectives, there is agreement.  That was not possible until we had done the work which we have done during the last seven years.  I do not want to go into that because there has been a very strong difference of opinion with regard to methods and with regard to the desirability of what has been done.  But it is ridiculous to say that this Government has failed in its promises in that regard.  The fact is that we have fulfilled every one of them.  We have, in fact, gone farther than we said we would go.  We have a Constitution which, admittedly, <Col N="956" /> is an Irish Constitution, made by the Irish people themselves&mdash;submitted to and approved by the people.  That does give us a basis for unity and united action which was quite impossible before.  Why will people exaggerate to the extent of saying that the promises we have made have been set aside and broken?</P>
    <P>Let me pass on to some of the other questions.  It has been said here this evening that I said we had a plan for ending unemployment.  I have nothing whatever to say against the speeches that have been made here to-night on that subject.  I think that this is a most important and serious question. From the economic point of view, it is the principal question at the moment. I welcome at any time criticism of what the Government is doing, or not doing, or suggestions from anybody as to how the problem should be solved. Before we came into office, I have been reminded that I said there were 60,000 unemployed.  That was the number mentioned here to-night.  I have not had time to look the matter up and see if that is an accurate representation of what I said at the time.  My own recollection is that we were able to point out that if we were able to build up industries which, we thought, ought to be established here, there would be employment in these industries in producing goods which we needed here, and which were being unnecessarily imported, for a greater number than the number of unemployed at the time. What do we find?  We find that some 74,000 persons have been absorbed in employment.  There are 74,000 more people employed now than there were when we came into office.  If there were, at the time, unemployment to that extent, there is no doubt that what I pointed out then to be possible has been proved, in fact, to be possible. Somebody mentioned a figure of £6,000,000 which I gave at that time. The close approximation of these figures, given in anticipation to what has actually happened is remarkable. Deputies will find that production in industry has gone up from £18,000,000 to £25,000,000, roughly.  There has been an increase in output to that amount, and increased employment has <Col N="957" /> been given in industry to the amount I have indicated.  It is true that, notwithstanding the figures of employment in the protected industries, which I pointed out as a cure for the then existing number of unemployed, we have an unemployment problem to-day. If we want to tackle that problem, we must know the facts.  There is no use in quoting as comparable figures which are not comparable.</P>
    <P>The figure of 106,000 or 107,000 was mentioned to-day:  As a matter of fact, the present figure is about 93,000. Everybody knows that the basis of these figures is different from that which obtained when we were talking about 60,000.  The figure of 60,000 was given before 1934, when the Unemployment Assistance Act was passed. Everybody knows that, under that Act, the State took responsibility for keeping a register of all persons out of employment or only partially employed, and that it includes classes that did not appear in any register before that at all.</P>
    <P>Before we came into office, to a large extent, no note was taken of rural unemployment.  It was only those who were entitled to unemployment insurance who were registered.  There was no inducement to register under the old conditions at all.  The number we have to-day reveals not only unemployment amongst wage-earners, as it used to, and those who were in insurable occupations, but it represents underemployment in a number of other ways, which were not revealed formerly.  I am not saying for a moment that it is wrong to reveal these.  I think it is right, but again let us face this problem as it is, and let us examine these figures exactly for what they are worth without exaggeration.  It is said that we have no cure for it.  I admit without any hesitation that we have not solved that problem, and the difficulty is that there is no country apparently that has been able to do it.  We have here not exhausted all channels through which employment might be provided, because there is some £20,000,000 worth of goods coming into the country even yet which I think might be substituted by home-produced <Col N="958" /> articles, and the substitution of which by home-produced articles would give more employment.  I do, however, agree that we have skimmed the cream of the employment that is likely to be created through the development of industry here, but it is along these lines that you can get a satisfactory solution.</P>
    <P>People tell us about productive employment being available if we use it.  The Government has been looking in every direction for the productive employment to which these people can be put, but it is not there.  It is not easy to get it.  Where are these people to get it?</P>

      <P>If Deputies want to have a full dress debate on the Banking Commission and the question of credit they can have it.  Let them put down a motion to have a full-dress debate.  We are quite prepared for it. That is the Government's business.  We were courageous enough in the middle of a serious economic war, when our people were under a severe strain in order to get what was their right&mdash; something which we felt should not have been given away&mdash;to set up a Banking Commission&mdash;I think it was in 1934&mdash;to examine the whole position of national finance and economy.  We did not pack it in either direction.</P>

      <P>The trouble about these things is that when you hear an exaggeration from one side and when you want to blow this exaggeration sky-high as it should be blown, you put yourself in a position in which you may be misrepresented by the other side.  I believe in certain fundamental principles in regard to social economy and the regret I have in regard to the whole Banking Commission Report is that some of the questions which ought to have been put in for early discussion, were only put in at the end.  Some of them should have been debated before that.  Particular questions that were only knit on the last day of the commission should have been put in and knit <Col N="960" /> earlier, and the result is that we have not got for the guidance of the Government, and definitely knit, issues which were raised between the Minority and the Majority Reports. We have got a Minority Report which, according to the chairman's report, was only put in at the last moment and which they did not have an opportunity of discussing.  We have to knit the issue between these separate reports.</P>
      <P>I want to say quite definitely, as far as Government policy is concerned, that the principles that were, for instance, enunciated in the third report are based on fundamental social principles which in general we accept. It is quite a different thing, however, to admit general principles and fundamental principles and to accept some particular scheme which is put forward and which is said to be in line with these principles&mdash;to accept that as a practical good solution.  We have to deal with the matter from a practical point of view.  If the Labour Party or any Deputy wants to have a full dress debate on social credit and the policy of the Government, we should like to have it too.  We should like, of course, to have a certain amount of notice, but we shall get that if the motion is put on the Paper in the ordinary way.  Let us hear in a close-knit debate all that is to be said in favour of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact is that I feel that these things have been put forward and statements like these have been made by people who do not seem to think that the Government have any responsibility and that it should go blindly ahead on this matter.  These people talk wildly on what is one of the most difficult and serious subjects that one could talk about.  That is the sort of thing that annoys anyone who tries to get a serious solution.  That must not be taken as indicating that the fundamental social purposes which some of the people describe in the Minority Report are not our purposes.  They are.  We have stated that many a time.  Many of the principles that have been set out in these reports have been stated by us time after time on public platforms as representing the viewpoint <Col N="961" /> of the Government, on what the good of the community should consist in and as representing the viewpoint that animates our work.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We shall give you Government time.  I think it is high time that some of these questions were examined closely and not left in the vague condition in which they are at the moment.  I have been led into this digression from the main line of the discussion because of this question about money.  I do not want to spend the whole of the debate on that question, but I challenge the Deputy to put down a motion and we shall talk about money as closely as he wishes us to talk about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the problems are problems of productive employment: of finding means of using the existing wealth in such a way that when it is used there is more after it has been used and not less.  The difficulty is to get these means.  Looking over these reports of various kinds in the complete report of the Banking Commission, I myself have been rather disappointed that the fact as to how these means are to be got has been glossed over.  As well as I remember, we have been told about forestry.  Since we came into office we have been trying to get as much land reafforested as it was practicable, and to make headway.  We have made remarkable progress in that.  We could have a very useful debate here on the whole question of reafforestation: as to how far it is practicable and as to how far it is economic.  When I say how far it is practicable, I want to know what the difficulties are so that we may be able to let the people know the difficulties there are in acquiring suitable land: whether it is, or is not, a fallacy to think that you can plant the whole of the western seaboard, and whether those areas which some people think should be planted can, in fact, be planted, and whether, in fact, they will grow trees.  I myself have been personally <Col N="962" /> in contact with the expert who is directing reafforestation.  His sole instructions are to try to find ways by which some of those areas will be planted.  I know what his views on these things are.  If anybody thinks that we should get other experts and obtain their views for confirmation of this we are quite prepared to do it. Our desire is as strong as that of anybody who mentions forestry here to acquire suitable land, and to reafforest as soon as possible.  We think it would be a good economic proposition to reafforest suitable land.</P>
    <P>We have been told again that there are questions like the question of the reclamation of land and of the bogs. We have put the development of peat as one of our policies.  Various methods for the practical utilisation of peat have been considered.  I may say that a remarkable development in that particular line has taken place.  This is one of the things that I have been personally trying to push.  I believe that as rapid progress has been made in that direction as is possible, having regard to the fact that there had to be at the start a good deal of experimentation. As far as the reclamation of land and of the bogs is concerned, it certainly does not seem to me to be a practical proposition to revert to some suggestion that may be found in the report of a commission that sat many, many years ago&mdash;some suggestion such as taking the high bogs and making them available for agricultural purposes. I think that would be a waste of our economic resources.  Our aim is to use the bogs, in the first instance, for the fuel which they contain&mdash;to use the peat which is the source of power, and leave behind you, as much reclaimed land as you possibly can.  The work in that way would have a double value.</P>
    <P>We have been told about drainage. Everybody in the Board of Works knows perfectly well that I have been pressing for the development of drainage schemes since we came into office. As regards drainage, we know from past experience that it cannot be done in, a haphazard manner: that if you want good work in regard to drainage, and if you want to get real results, the work has to be done in accordance with <Col N="963" /> a definite plan.  In the first place, it has to be examined as an engineering proposition.  There are quite a lot of difficulties to be considered as everybody who knows anything about drainage is aware.  We have set up a commission precisely for that purpose. Yet, we are told that there is no question of planning of any kind.</P>
    <P>These, as well as I remember, exhaust the examples of productive employment which we were told was available. I know of course, that we could increase the amenities for the whole community: that we could bring water supplies into villages, that we could have better sanitary accommodation in small towns and so on; but does anybody think that that is productive in the ordinary sense?  It is not.  It helps, if you like, to increase the amenities for the community, and as such it is a thing that ought to be undertaken if the resources of the community permit it.  Are the resources of the community being used to their fullest extent at the moment?  I do not want to say that they are.  But what I do say is this, that the people who talk about these not being used ought to show us exactly in what way these resources are available.</P>
    <P>We have been working within the system.  I have said, on a previous occasion, that if we cannot, within the system, get a solution we will have to try without it.  But I have never said, or suggested for one moment, that trying without it was not going to be a matter of considerable risk, and that anybody who attempted to do it would have to carefully consider what was going to be the result of his experiment because it would be an experiment. We have had experiments of this kind tried in various places.  It is perhaps too soon to pass judgment upon them, but my own feeling in regard to these things is that fundamentally it is not merely a money matter.  There is something else much more important than money, and that is the matter of organisation.  I know that one often hears the argument &ldquo;Oh, well, you cannot travel in a train if you have not got a ticket&rdquo;. If it is necessary for one to have a <Col N="964" /> ticket to travel in a train, then certainly you must have the ticket in order to travel, but what good is a truck-load of tickets to you if the train is not there to take you?  So that organisation is as necessary as money. If you are able to get the proper organisation, in my opinion the money would be forthcoming within the system. I may be wrong about that, but I have yet to come up against the situation in which I will find that the money is not available within the system.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to the amenities, there obviously is a limit to which we can go.  Suppose that you liken the nation to a large family, and that this large family owns an estate.  They cannot hope to last indefinitely if they spend their time simply beautifying the estate, in making avenues, fish-pools and all the rest of it.  All that may improve the general appearance of the estate and make it more beautiful.  It may add to the amenities of the estate, but they cannot last indefinitely unless there is some production out of which they are to be maintained. As I have said, I would rather deal with all these matters on a definite motion.  I can only touch on them slightly in a general debate of this sort.</P>
    <P>Coming back to unemployment, I admit frankly that it is a problem.  I have not said that at the moment we have a solution for it, but I say that nobody else is going to show us a solution for it either.  I believe that we all are anxious to attain the objective, to work in accordance with principles that we have enunciated many a time here, and some of which, for instance, find themselves in those minority reports.  I believe that we are as anxious and are trying as hard to solve it as any other people could. If the people of this country are to be asked to decide between us and our method of doing it at any particular time and others, the usual opportunities will be afforded to the people, and the Labour Party if they have a solution that they can stand over are quite free to go and give it to the people.  We, at any rate, <Col N="965" /> will go as fast as we can go with safety.  That is with reference to the criticisms from one side.</P>
    <P>We then meet with criticisms from the other side because we have gone a certain distance in trying to give effect to our social ideals in regard to the right of the community to have certain amenities given to them.  We, in common with the Opposition and the Labour Party, agreed here that it should be the national policy to try to secure work for everybody, or else that there should be maintenance.  In regard to the maintenance, all the time, like the amenities&mdash;I do not want to suggest that getting necessary food is merely an amenity; it is not&mdash;the same sort of argument has been used against us, that we have not given to those who are unemployed as much as would be necessary to give them a decent standard.  We can only plead that, even to the extent to which we have gone, we are putting a very heavy burden upon the community.  Of course, with every step we go in that direction, we have people on the other side pointing out:  &ldquo;You are putting the country to such and such expense.&rdquo; The trouble here is that every individual, except those who are on the Government side and committed to a definite policy, can talk from his own angle in criticism.  Those who want to criticise because certain things are not done can point out the things which have not been done.  Those who want to criticise from the point of view of expense will tell us what has been the cost of doing the things we have done. There is no objection to the cost being considered if it is considered in relation to the things that have been done. Things cannot be done without cost. There are two sides to the account always.  In regard to everything that the Government does, there will be two sides to it&mdash;the advantage to be gained from what has been done, and the disadvantage that will follow in the nature of costs to the community.  The Government, as the main guardian of the common good, has to try to get the best balance it can.  It has to balance the cost of the disadvantage and the cost of the advantage that is to be secured, and, having balanced the <Col N="966" /> advantage and the disadvantage, to see whether it is, in their opinion, in the interests of the community that the disadvantage should be incurred and the advantage gained.</P>
    <P>If people want to criticise Government policy properly, and if they want to talk of the increase in taxation, they must at the same time take account of the services that have been rendered to the community.  They must take account of the disasters, perhaps, from which the community has been saved, and ask themselves whether in fact those advantages could have been got at a lesser cost.  If they can show that, they are making a genuine argument. If they think only of the cost, and close their eyes to the advantages that have been gained, then they clearly are not arguing to the point at all.  They are not arguing as they would argue if they themselves were members of the Government.</P>
    <P>This debate, as I have said, has ranged over everything.  I could spend an hour probably in replying merely to the questions which have been raised on the side of our external relations.  Those, I should have imagined, could have been raised on a recent debate in which I was the same person, the same Minister.  In those matters, when I am Minister for External Affairs, naturally I cannot dissociate myself from being also the Taoiseach and the Head of the Government. Those questions could have been raised quite properly at that particular time, and I could have spent much more time in answering them than I can now.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us take a few of those questions which have been <Col N="967" /> raised.  I do not know whether it was Deputy Dillon&mdash;I think it was&mdash;who spoke about the passport as some gross deception of our people.  I do not know how he makes that out.  That passport is an expression of the fact that the Government, in accordance with the Constitution, is the responsible authority for external policy, and that in regard to it there is an External Relations Act which settles certain things.  But if the Deputy only goes to the trouble of reading that particular Act he will see that the question of passports does not come in.  In fact it is questionable, from the moment the Constitution was passed, whether the old form of the passport was legal at all, or in accordance with the Constitution at all.  I know it can be argued the other way&mdash;that there is just a question of a doubt about it&mdash; but the existence of the passport in the other form was constantly used to misrepresent our real international position.  If nothing else were to be gained but a clarification of the fact that external policy is a matter for the Government, that in accordance with the Constitution it is by or with the authority of the Government that external acts are done, and that the External Relations Act applies definitely to a restricted number of things, it is an advantage to have the passport in its new form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not in an unusual form.  It is in precisely the same form, for example, as the passport of the United States of America.  The passport of the United States of America is issued in the name of the Secretary of State; it is not issued in the name of the President.  Our passport, therefore, is quite in accordance with a recognised form.  If it prevents misunderstanding, should it not be welcomed by everybody? I was very glad indeed to be able to put it in that form, and to put it in that form without any practical loss to our people.  I am sure that the people who did not want the altered form, or a number of them, did want some of the advantages that we have at the present time in getting&mdash;in places where we have not our own representatives&mdash;assistance for our <Col N="968" /> people from British representatives.  If the people do not want that, the Government is free to use other methods.  I think, instead of suggesting that it was some attempt to deceive the people, Deputies on the opposite side, if they were anxious to try to get a greater degree of unanimity of opinion here about various matters, would have welcomed it.  They would have said: &ldquo;That is another cause of disagreement amongst us, and misunderstanding here at home, gone.&rdquo;  I was very glad on a previous occasion when every Deputy in the House, on a matter of vital importance to the country, supported the Government in the attitude it was taking.  I was hoping that we might get rapidly to the time when&mdash;whatever criticism there might be of ways and means&mdash;in certain fundamental things there would be a general welcome of an advance which means unity here, and is of tremendous importance for the development of the country.  So much for the passport.</P>
    <P>The question of my visit to America was raised.  I must say that I thought the speech which was made at the beginning was a very petty contribution indeed.  It went on very petty, poor lines.  Considering the big questions that had to be raised, it was petty to talk about the army of officials I was supposed to be taking to tour America.  I was taking no army of officials with me, highly paid or otherwise. I was taking the minimum number that would do the work which I had intended they should do.  The Deputy who spoke like that knows as well as I know the work that was to be done and that remained to be done by me in the United States.  The larger section of the Irish race outside this country is in the United States. They were the section who helped us when we wanted help, and the section of all others on whom we can rely if we are in any difficulties to give us their moral, and if we should need&mdash; I hope we will not&mdash;their material support.  Anybody who wanted to think fairly at all would realise why I was going to America and would see why every single official who was to go with me was chosen to accompany <Col N="969" /> me.  I was taking with me people who knew the United States, people who had previous experience of it and who had met our friends there.  I knew perfectly well that if we were to have proper contact with our friends there on a short visit of that sort I could not be expected myself to establish all the particular contacts that had to be made.</P>
    <P>I am asked why we were taking the Director of the Information Bureau. Then there was a ridiculous talk about the things the Information Bureau was supposed to do.  The head of the Information Bureau, as the Deputy knows, is the chief contact we have with the Press, with the foreign as well as with the home Press.  He is there to co-operate with the Press.  But, if we have a hostile Press that tries to misuse the Information Bureau, because the Information Bureau will not give information that it is not in the public interest at the moment to give, it is abused.  The head of the Information Bureau is the principal contact we have with the Press.  It would be of tremendous importance for him to have met first-hand on a visit to the United States the Press people there.  He has met some of them already here and to re-establish these contacts would be of great national advantage.  In the United States, besides those I was going to meet directly and have personal contact with, or whom I might address at a public meeting, there were a number of others who would not be in the particular cities I would be visiting and who would only be got in touch with by the Press.  Anyone who wanted fairly to criticise the Government and get an explanation why I was taking certain people would see very clearly why the Director of the Information Bureau should be one of the group.</P>
    <P>As I say, the main purpose I had in the selection was to have those with me who would be able to complete the contacts which I personally could not hope to do in the short time at my disposal. I make no apology of any kind for the people who were to go with me. Neither do I make any apology from the national point of view for undertaking that visit or that tour.  It was <Col N="970" /> a tour which was to be undertaken in the national interest.  Any Deputy who knows what was done in the past and who knows the help we got and the help we can expect to get if we are in any difficulties can appreciate full well why it was that that tour was going to be undertaken.  The circumstances at the moment were of such a serious character that I was not able to go, but I hope to go in the autumn, and I hope to go as part of a definite Government policy with regard to establishing contacts with sections of our people who are outside this country.  It was said that this Vote would have to be moved in my absence.  Everybody knows that it would not have to be moved in my absence, as I hoped to be back before the session closes.</P>
    <P>With regard to the functions of the Information Bureau, I think I explained them when it was being established.  These functions have been continued.  I sum them up mainly as being the principal contact between the Government and the Press, and, through the Press, the public, in regard to matters which formerly were dealt with by individual Departments with loss of time to the officials.  Now we have it centralised so that any information which the Press want to get they can get it if it is in the public interest to give it.  Sometimes it is not in the public interest, before a thing has matured and is ripe, to publish it.  If there are negotiations with other people, if there are a number of things of that sort, whether internal or external things, which are not completed, sometimes it may not be in the public interest to give information before the time is ripe when it can be given profitably from a public point of view.  As I have said, the points raised by the first speaker were of a petty character, things which could have been more properly asked in a Parliamentary question, and I do not think I should spend any more time on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is undoubtedly a good excuse.  If I asked the Labour Party, for instance, when they would be in council about some particular matters, or dealing with some other group, to give an account of what they had in mind, or what they were doing about them, they might say that it was not in their interest to give it.  The Government have an interest in the public welfare.  We have to be the judges of whether the public welfare would be served by premature, communications or not.  Some of the communications which have been given have been harmful because they were premature.  It is an excuse that is very rarely given by me.  In my whole seven years in office I can remember at the moment only one occasion on which I had to say definitely that it was not in the public interest to give information for which I was asked.  As a matter of fact, I try to go to the utmost limits to give information to Deputies whom I regard as equally responsible with Ministers for the public welfare&mdash;perhaps not equally, because they have not immediate responsibility, but having a share in it and having a right to get information which would enable them to decide certain things they might have to decide&mdash;I am always sympathetic with that point of view and do try to give it.  We do the same with the Press. But the Press are more or less the sleuth hounds who are all the time looking for some advance information. They want to know everything in advance, whether it is or is not in the public interest.  Their interest is not the same as the public interest.  Their interest is to get information of one kind or another, and the more sensational it is, and the more premature it is, the better from their point of view.  We cannot, therefore, always satisfy the Press.  They hear that something is going on.  They add more than two and two&mdash;they add two and two and make five of it very often.</P>

      <P>The information in 1936 and the information to-day may not be the same thing.  This does not happen to be 1936.  I cannot judge whether the point the Deputy mentioned was a good one or a bad one. I say that 1936 is not 1939.  The position might be different from what it was in 1936.  There may be other circumstances.  The position is that I would want to know all the facts before committing myself to an opinion one way or the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to external affairs, I was asked about another important matter, the answers of the British Government in regard to our Citizenship Act and in regard to their Act.  I pointed out at a very early stage that as long as the British Government took the view, in accordance with their law, that they were taking, and that we took a different view, there was bound to be a clash in certain circumstances.  There is a clash.  In examining the question, it would be well for all concerned to see it clearly.  We have the right to determine who are our citizens.  As a recognised international right, we exercise that right in accordance with our Citizenship Act.  I used rather harsh words, I think, when the Act was passed, in describing the attitude of any Government that would take it upon itself to regard our citizens other than as ours.  I am not in a position to <Col N="973" /> change British law.  That does not mean that I accept British law.  It does not mean that their decision is the right decision.  There is a clash of views.  We have made our protest, and that protest will be continued in regard to the fact that the British Government, under the title of &ldquo;British subject&rdquo;, assumes to make their law applicable to our citizens.  That is on the question of the way in which it is done.  If, for instance, the British Government had passed a conscription law to apply to all people who were for a certain time resident in that country, I do not think we would have any particular grounds for complaint. If people go to any country and become resident there for a certain length of time, there may be differences of opinion as to what length of time would justify residence, and therefore identifying themselves with the community, but I think most people will admit, as a matter of common sense, that if people go to another community, live there for a considerable time, and identify themselves with that community, they cannot have it both ways.  If they are getting the advantages of living, as members of that community, they cannot expect to escape the obligations.  I want it to be clearly understood that, while there might be justification if the British passed an Act, applicable to all people resident there, whatever country they came from, and resident there for a particular period, and said that they were going to conscript these people, we might have differences of opinion, and negotiations and consultations as regards the length of time.  But that is not the position.  The position is that they have assumed to claim these as British subjects.  We have made our protest in that regards, and I want clearly to have our protest distinguished from what our protest would be, and what our case would be, had they proceeded on different lines.  If they said of people ordinarily resident for a certain period, no matter where they came from, that they claimed the right to make them undertake the obligations of citizens, when they accepted the advantages of citizens, we could understand that.  But the difficulty is <Col N="974" /> of a different type.  The difficulty is the question whether the Act, which is restricted in its application to British subjects, should be binding under that title on our people.  We claim that it should not.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton was anxious that we should make other nations understand our position in that regard.  I should like to point out that these countries have their Ministers here.  We are responsible for our laws, and if there is any question of our citizens being at any time involved it is we who make the representations.  For example, there was the case last September that Deputy Norton mentioned.  The position is that we would immediately make representations that these people were clearly our citizens.  If we were able to prove that they were our citizens, had any attempt been made to retain them, we would have made representations immediately.  I do not think other countries would worry at the present moment.  Except they took steps for some other purpose they are not going to take steps in that matter. In a case of that kind we would rely on our international position as we see it.  The Deputy seems to think there is some court to which we could appeal to settle a question of that kind.  Unfortunately there is not.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no way that I can see.  That reminds me of suggestions that were made formerly about trying to bring the question of Partition to the League of Nations. There are certain questions that the League of Nations will refuse to deal with.  They have enough problems which definitely and clearly come within their scope, but it would be extremely difficult to get them to deal with that.  In regards to matters of that kind, there is no use trying to move unless you can see your way to success, and get your cases properly brought forward.  It is not enough to say that there is a case if you cannot get them to deal with it.  Consequently, I do not think there is any solution along these particular lines. You would have to get the agreement <Col N="975" /> of both parties, probably, to allow it to be brought forward.  There is no international court able to enforce its will on two international States if there is disagreement, or if one appears and the other refuses to appear.  There is no way that an international court can impose its decision, and, therefore, it is vain to try in matters like that to begin in that particular way.  We have to try another way.</P>
      <P>Those who were interested in the Citizenship Act know that because of the privileges and advantages our people got by being treated in Britain without discrimination between them and citizens of Britain, we have provisions by which there are mutual reciprocal concessions.  It is along lines of reciprocal concessions of that kind we have to deal with this question. We cannot expect to have it both ways, any more than we will not allow others to have it both ways.  The only way you can have an arrangements is to have an international agreement on the lines of reciprocal arrangements.  If they give advantages which we consider are useful to our citizens, we can give reciprocal advantages of a similar type.  That is the line on which we are trying to solve the question.</P>
      <P>The next question, more or less international, was the whole question of defence.  I cannot hope to deal with that here as part of several questions. On a previous occasion I spoke on defence, and the Minister for Defence on more than one occasion dealt with the subject.  However, the statement made by Deputy O'Higgins was a very serious one.  He raised a question of principle, and raised a question of importance and of practical bearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to principle, I do not agree with him at all.  I cannot imagine an army of a State being built up on the basis that the soldiers were to be told in advance what particular use was going to be made of them.  I think that would be impossible.  It is quite impossible to foresee clearly what are the circumstances under which a State might have to use its army.  I think <Col N="976" /> that foolishness is behind a lot of the difficulty which has arisen here with regard to the Government's attitude. There are people prepared now, in advance of the circumstances in which an outbreak might take place, to say what the national attitude should be. I have indicated what the Government policy will be, and that is that we will try, in so far as it is possible&mdash;the aim of all our policy will be&mdash;to keep this country out of a war, to save this country, if we can, the horrors of being in a war.</P>
    <P>Once we are clear about that, that that is to be genuinely the aim of our policy, we have to go into it and consider a number of other matters around it.  But, before I talk in this connection&mdash;and now that the matter has been raised, I suppose I had better deal with it&mdash;I want to talk about the general principle on which the Army is based.  The Army is the instrument of the Executive, and the Executive is subordinate to the national control in connection with all questions of the use of the Army.  Is that clear?  That is what it is, and what it must be.  If you tell any members of the Army that they are enlisted for this, that or the other purpose, then you are going to make the Army, sections of the Army, the people who are going to determine whether or not they will allow themselves to be used as an army.  That is clearly putting the Army above the civil authority.</P>
    <P>Any army, whether it be a volunteer or a regular army, must be the servant of the Executive, just as the Executive is the servant in a representative assembly of this sort&mdash;the servant of the Parliament as a whole.  This Government cannot have any policy which will not have the approval of the majority of the elected representatives of the people.  If we are clear upon that basis, we can talk about other things, but I desire that we should be clear upon that.  If we are asking for recruits to join the Army, it must be clear that they become soldiers when they join and that they are there to carry out the orders given to them by their legitimate authorities in regard to any defence that there may be of national interests.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="977" /> I think Deputy O'Higgins, by his talk, is helping to create a tremendous amount of confusion in the country on that particular head.  Nobody should join&mdash;and I believe the people have a duty to join&mdash;with the idea that he will be used for this, that or the other purpose, because then you would have a purely sectional army and you would have an army that was not at the disposal, as it must be, of the Executive, in the defence of national interests in accordance with the judgment of the Executive, which itself has to submit its policy and judgment to the Parliament as a whole. I hope, then, that everybody in the Army itself, and outside the Army, will remember that in this matter they are not the judges.  The judges of how the Army is to be used are the members of the national Parliament, and that is so in accordance with the Constitution, and it is in accordance with the general practice wherever we have really representative government.</P>
    <P>A soldier cannot determine for himself what is the particular type of action in which he will engaged and what is the particular cause that he will defend.  In general, he surrenders his will in that regard to the Parliament and the Executive.  As an individual, there are certain moral questions which arise which a man can determine at his own risk from the disciplinary point of view.  But he will run a very big risk.  There are certain questions from a moral point of view in which he has to be the judge and master, in which, according to his own conscience, he has to be the judge and master.  If he was asked to do something against which his conscience directed him, he would do it at his own personal risk.  It would be quite impossible to have an organised army, to defend the national interests, at the disposal of an Executive, if each individual were to have the right to be the judge of what particular cause he would or would not engage in.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that the views put forward by Deputy O'Higgins, in so far as I understand them in that regard, are completely disruptive and would make any sort of real army impossible in any country.  With regard <Col N="978" /> to the rumours that he says are going around, I do not know whether they are or not.  But if he says we are asking people to join because we want to use the Army against the North, there is no ground whatever for that suggestion. I think the attitude of the Government in regard to the application of coercion, as far as any section of our people in the North are concerned, has been stated for many a long year and we have never departed from that position.  Our trouble with regard to Partition is that there is at this moment a coercion which is not justifiable, a coercion of a certain section of our people, and we claim that, in regard to these people, by no right whatever should they be coerced. We claim that they are coerced and held against their will by a small minority of people in an area to which they do not want to belong.  I do not want to go into the whole aspect of Partition here again.  I have already done so in the Seanad, and what I have said on that occasion I stand by, and if any Deputy wants to know my views, they are there to be read.</P>
    <P>With regard to any definite and immediate plan, if you rule force out of it, I think there would be no plan, because I have the same views as to what would be the result, finally, as the Deputies on the opposite benches have. But if you talk of any particular and immediate plan, I do not think anybody can point definitely to a plan that will inevitably produce this result.  We have done many things in our time&mdash; I mean many things were done in the time of members on the opposite benches as well as here&mdash;but a definite plan that could make certain of ensuring results could not be pointed to. You had to move in a certain direction, taking advantage of certain circumstances that arose, to advance you along the line you wanted to go. Deputies opposite say that some of our actions put us backward rather than forward.  That is a question on which we will agree to differ.  Our plan has been to try to get issues, on which we were divided here, removed, on the political side, as quickly and as far as possible, and we have done that very largely, and we have almost isolated <Col N="979" /> this as being the specially remaining political objective.</P>
    <P>We think this can be said, that we have a common objective, that there is nobody arguing that it should not come about.  We may argue as to whether the steps we are taking will advance or retard the day we all hope for.  We have done this, we have put this as the supreme objective before the Irish people, whether they are here or in any other part of the world, in other places abroad where prejudices that have been fostered are not as strong as they are here, immediately at home, in the northern area particularly. We hope that these will be of help to us, in breaking down the prejudices that exist here.  The fact that old Unionists abroad are proud of Ireland is going to be a great help to us in breaking down these prejudices. They are anxious to see the Irish nation figuring as largely as possible in the world.  I am talking of those living abroad, who were in the past associated with what used to be the Unionist element, but what is now, unfortunately, the partitionist element. Everyone of them has an interest and a pride in this nation as a whole and they know that, with any division, that pride which they can take in this country and its achievements cannot be as great as if we had a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have never held out undue hopes, and I think Deputy Dillon was wrong in that, and misrepresented me&mdash;and it was not the first time that I called his attention to the fact that he was misrepresenting me.  He said that I held out hopes to the people at the time of the British Agreement, hopes which I knew could not be fulfilled.  I was most careful at the time not to do anything of the kind.  I wanted the British people and the British Government to realise that this was a fundamental issue as far as the relations between the two countries were concerned.  I had to put it in the forefront because, in fact, it was the most important issue that was dividing the countries.  How was I going to do it?  Was I to keep silent about it?  Because I put it in its proper place, some people misrepresented my <Col N="980" /> attitude and suggested that I had put it there in order to hold out false hopes to the people in the North that I knew could not be fulfilled.  I said that I would make no agreement if that agreement was going to retard the unification of the country, and, we accepted agreement because we believed that it did not retard the unification of the country.  It is quite false, however&mdash;I do not want to use any stronger words&mdash;to suggest that, because I put that in the forefront as one of the things that was an issue between Great Britain and ourselves&mdash; the most important issue, as it was&mdash; I was holding out, by doing so, hopes to the people of the North that there was going to be an ending of that question.  I was trying to do my best to make it an issue, if I could, and to get it settled, if I could; and I think that the British Government were very foolish in neglecting it and not giving it the prominence it deserved instead of more or less avoiding it, because as long as the issue remains it shall be the duty of Governments here and the interests of the people here to bring about a settlement of that issue and to see that any possibilities of doing so will not be neglected.</P>
    <P>I do not think I should go into the question of Partition any further, but I did touch on the question of defence, and I think I should continue on with it a little bit further.  I tried to point out what an army has to be and to point out that the members of an army &mdash;those who join an army&mdash;must surrender their right to judge as to what cause they should fight for.  Now, there will be people who will say: &ldquo;Oh, well, then, we will do our best to prevent people from joining an army for national defence on that basis; we will tell them that, unless the Government is going, in advance of all the circumstances that may arise, to tell them exactly in what particular manner they are going to be used, they should not join.&rdquo;  As I have said, if the Government were to do so, and if circumstances came around that they had not anticipated, and a world war took place&mdash;of course, some people may think that they can judge of these things in advance, but I do not claim that clairvoyance and certainly will <Col N="981" /> not claim to say what may be the circumstances connected with a world war of that magnitude&mdash;the Government policy and aim will be to try to keep this nation out of war, if it can. It would be all a simple matter if our will were going to determine the matter and if what we want to do in connection with defence were going to settle the matter once and for all, but everybody knows that neutrality is effective only if you have the power to defend it: if you are strong enough, in other words, to prevent anybody interfering with you or to prevent anybody from making you side with them rather than with somebody else.  The difficulites of that situation can be seen by anybody who has studied the last war and considered the position of the smaller countries in the north of Europe, when each of the two contending parties in such a war, as in the last war, will be striving to use all the resources, or the armies, if you like, of the neutral countries and trying their best to get the neutral countries on their side.</P>
    <P>Again, with regard to the rumours, I have said that there is no justification whatever for the rumour that this Army is being recruited with a view to engaging against our people in the North.  There is no basis whatever for that suggestion.  The main purpose, and the only purpose&mdash;the comprehensive purpose, I meant to say&mdash;for which the Army is being recruited is for national defence, defence of this nation's right to maintain whatever policy the nation decides to be in its own interests.  That is what the Army must be recruited for, and for nothing else.  Deputy O'Higgins says that he wants to recruit an army to be used against the Axis Powers.  I say that our Army should not be used against the Axis Powers unless they attack us. If they did attacks us and interfere with us and our liberty of action, then we would have to defend ourselves and, under these circumstances, there would be action by our Army against whatever nation might attack us to that extent.  Is there any other direction in which they could possibly be used?  I say that they are there as a protection to this State, so that the State will not <Col N="982" /> be involved in a war in which it does not want to be involved, in so far as our added strength would enable us to keep out of war and enable us to prevent our being used in a way in which we do not want to be used&mdash; again, in so far as our strength would make that effective.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to goods or trade, I think it was Deputy Dockrell who mentioned the question of whether we are going to continue our trade with Great Britain in the case of a war.  My view is that that trade is essential for the life of this nation&mdash;absolutely essential.  Deputy Dockrell pointed out that the cattle we sell to England would have to be killed off or destroyed if there were a war, if that was not undertaken as a war measure.  That trade is our ordinary mode of trade, and whatever Powers might be at war with Great Britain might hold that that trade would be detrimental to their hopes of winning.  The Central Powers have been mentioned, but I prefer in these discussions, as far as possible, not to mention particular countries.  However, if it were held by say, Great Britain, that the continuances of our trade with some other country was detrimental to their hopes of winning the war, it is possible that they might try to stop it; but that trade is our life, our economic life at the moment, and we would insist on our right, in the first place, of sending out these goods that are necessary for the continuances of our economic life, and we would try, naturally, to have a bargain so that the goods which we need, in return for the goods we send out, would be got in the only way in which they are being got at present, which is mainly through Great Britain, that is, the supplies of certain raw materials and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall discuss that. Give me time and I shall come to that in a moment.  I say&mdash;and I made it quite clear on the first occassion on which I spoke on the subject&mdash;that that was a thing we would have to do. <Col N="983" /> We are not going to be the people who are to determine whether or not that can be done.  It is not we who will be responsible for determining whether we are to be permitted to do that. Clearly the British will not object to it.  At least, I do not think they are likely to.  Those who might be at war with Great Britain might object to it. We hold, however, that it is essential to our life, our economic life, and that the hardship that would be caused to our community by anything that would stop it would be so great that we would have to resist and continue it. If that is made an issue we will have to defend our right, that is all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is quite certain.  Any other Deputy in the House can take any view of his own and déan deimhin dá thuairim fhéin&mdash; make certain of his own opinion.  His opinion is only his own opinion.  It is possible that the Deputy may be right but what we want to do is, by having as strong a force here as we can, to make it unprofitable for an enemy to try to interfere with our right in that regard.  They may regard it as an unfriendly act, but it is not in fact an unfriendly act.  It is the continuing of what, in the circumstances of the location of our country and the conditions of our economics, is a necessity of our life.  It is we who would have the grievance, not they.  The fact that some people on the globe may be at a disadvantage to other people is no reason why those people should be wiped out.  Consequently, as far as we are concerned, we intend to regard the maintenance of these things, which are necessary for the continuance of our <Col N="984" /> life here, as normal trading relations, which have taken place in peace time and which, as far as we are concerned, would have to be continued in war.  If any other power chooses to quarrel with us on that basis we will have to do the best we can to defend ourselves on that issue.  You have to put yourself in the position of another power in a case like that and any power which is going to think of that will have to balance the pros and cons and, if they think the advantage would not be worth while they may not do what the Deputy suggests, but we have to put ourselves in a position in which we are best able to defend our right.</P>
      <P>I believe in talking very frankly and freely and I have never hesitated to talk frankly on this matter.  At the very first time it was mentioned I pointed out that some people have got the foolish notion that merely declaring your position of neutrality will preserve it.  That is a foolish notion.  You must be able to preserve it and put yourself into a position in which it will not be of advantage to the enemy to interfere and try to compel you to change it.  It is for the general defence of the national interest, to put the nation in as strong a position as possible to maintain its right, that we want to have our Army as strong as we can make it, in accordance with our resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know if there is any other aspect of the question that I have to deal with.  The point is that I am not going and the Government are not going and no sensible body of people with responsibility, in a time like this, are going in ahead of time to anticipate and say that, under all sets of circumstances we are going to do so and so. That would be ridiculous.  It would be dishonest because, as a matter of fact, you cannot determine in advance of all the circumstances what it would be in the national interest to do.  We are here to safeguard the national interest at every period of time at which we are in office and we have to give account of our stewardship to the majority of the House.  I hope that it will be clear to everybody here and to any people who may read what I am saying what the Government attitude is in regard to this whole matter.  Our aim would <Col N="985" /> be to keep this country out of war if we can and our chance would be improved the stronger we are to maintain the position we would regard as our right.  That ought to be clear, I think, to everybody.  It has been said that the most we can do would not be sufficient.  It is an old argument to do nothing because you cannot guarantee that all you can do would be effective. The truth is, of course, that if there should be big hosts arrayed against each other&mdash;I hope there will not&mdash;but if there should be, in comparison with any one of those, our strength would be a small matter.  But, the two hosts will not be against us&mdash;that we can hope for at any rate.</P>

Therefore, there is good commonsense reasoning why we should ask the people of this country to undertake the obligations for defence which every other nation in the world has to undertake. My chief criticism of the Opposition&mdash;I am not talking about other criticisms outside&mdash;is that they are making it difficult for the nation to get at this particular time the forces that may be absolutely necessary if we are to maintain that which we have secured at a very great cost.</P>

That was not helpful.  I do admit that when he said <Col N="986" /> at one particular point that he was raising this matter to give me an opportunity to dispel the doubt he was doing useful service.</P>

It is like Deputy Norton asking us to go and tell other Governments this, that and the other thing when the other Governments know.  They well know our position, and if they take any action which would be contrary to the position as we state it, they will do so because they want to take up an unfriendly attitude against us or to ingratiate themselves with other people and adopt a friendly attitude towards some other power.</P>

That might be a serious matter too, you see.  When views like that are put forward one ought to look and see what would be the consequence of anything of that kind.  I would not like to see a partisan army here.  I would not like to see an army established here that would consider that it had duties if one set of people were in power and did not have duties if another set of people were in power.</P>

      <P>I am accepting that, too.  As a matter of fact, it was proved. One of the best things and one of the things that will stand out in the history of this country is the fact that when there was what would appear to be a revolutionary change of government here, such as probably has not happened in any other country in the world, there was not a question from the moment we got into office of the loyalty and obedience of the Army&mdash; there were rumours and distrubing rumours for perhaps the first week or so of office&mdash;but there was no question of the loyalty and obedience of the Army.  I think it is a thing that we as a nation can be proud of from the point of view of representative government, and I hope it will be that way and continue to be that way no matter who is in office.  Now, I do not know whether I have dealt with all the points that have been raised or not, because I have had to run from one point to another according as they were raised.  I do not know how many other points I have left untouched.  I was trying to distinguish between the external matters and the internal matters.  On the internal side I am quite willing to admit that the serious problem which we have got to face is the problem of unemployment.  That is easily the foremost and most important problem.</P>

      <P>With regard to the farmers, the position which they are in and the position of the unemployed are not the same.  I do not think that the Deputy will contend for one moment that the average farmer&mdash; there may be occasionally cases of very grave hardship&mdash;is, or ought to be, an immediate care of the Government, except in so far as his general prosperity is concerned.  The more important problem, to which the Government must lend its attention, is that of ending unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not forget that. The Government, until it has the solution for a problem, does not come and tell of its anxiety and of the efforts made to solve the problem before the actual solution is put before Parliament. The fact that a solution has not sometimes been produced is not to be taken as an indication that the Government is careless about these things.  It is not careless.  With regard to our agricultural industry, all we want to claim is that, in relieving the agricultural industry of its share of the big burden which was pressing upon the community as a whole&mdash;of which the agricultural community is a part&mdash;and which was particularly affecting the farmers of this country, the burden of £5,000,000 per year&mdash;or at least the £3,000,000 which was the real burden on the farmers&mdash;we have given a great relief to the farming community, a relief which has gone into every single farm and which was probably the best form of immediate relief that might be given.  If there is any way in which we can stimulate production in agriculture, we will do it.  That is the business of the Department of Agriculture and it is at it every day.  But, you cannot have it both ways.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Statistics alone do not prove anything.  Are you going to say that that fight should not have been fought; are you going to say that we should have continued paying the £5,000,000 per year, not only over the last few years but for the next 60 or 70 years?  Do you think we would have been relieved of that if we had not fought for it, and if we had been beaten in the fight it was goodbye to any chance of having a fiscal policy of our own.  We cannot have it both ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are Deputies in this House who want to have it both ways.  They want social services and do not want to pay for them; they want works of national importance and do not want to pay for them; they want industries established and do not want to pay for them.  They complain of the increased cost of living, of the increased cost of certain articles because we are protecting those industries here and are giving employment.  If we had opened the gates and allowed the wholesale dumping of products of other countries, every industry in this country would have been ended.  We are in a better position now with regard to flour milling and a host of other industries; but if Deputies on the other side of the House want to open the gates and want to have a free trade policy, let them have it: we do not stand for it.  If the majority of the people stand for the policy of the big ranch in which modern farming is carried on with tractors, the big ranch with its herds of cattle and herdsman, people who have capital will be able to buy cattle and get a quicker turnover. But that policy, as it was the policy in the past, did not bring any good fruits. We have heard many people talking <Col N="990" /> about that policy and showing the difference in the present situation to what it was in the past and how that policy brought destruction to our nation.  If people think that we must concentrate only on trying to compete in foreign markets, if they are thinking only of raising cattle.  I say that the present population of this country cannot be maintained in that way, and if there is a reduction in population it will be the fault of that policy.  I say you cannot have it both ways.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am willing to admit&mdash;and have admitted before&mdash; that the present economic state of the farmers could be better.  From the point of view of prices they are not getting the best of it, but they are not getting the worst of it.  There is a depression in the agricultural industry all over the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all; I do not agree with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Then let the Deputy look at the state of affairs in America, for example.  Deputies who are talking like that clearly know nothing about it.  The fact is&mdash;and it is an incontrovertible fact&mdash;that we have here in this country, taking it as a whole, from the point of view of the world to-day, one of the communities which is best situated in the world: I was going to say one of the most prosperous, but I do not care to use so strong a word.  Yet we have been listening to the jeremiads that we have heard from Deputy Dillon and the rest.  In this country for the last seven years, when we have been trying to save this money for the people, they were trying to break the will of the people by those jeremiads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farmer got, as a result of our policy, £9,000,000 for wheat during that period, the stabilisation of prices gave him £5,000,000, and in regard to beet there was, I think, over £7,000,000. Deputies have made no allowance for that, nor for the help that the farmers <Col N="991" /> have received in the remission of the land annuities.  If they think that they can have a paradise on earth I say we cannot do it and we have not pretended that we could do it.  As compared with the problem of the unemployed, the farmers' problem&mdash;while it is serious&mdash;is not the most urgent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>How many votes do you expect by that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Those who want to get votes can do so.  With regard to the farming community, it is the principal productive industry of this country and is of supreme importance.  I am not denying that.  I am talking about the urgency of certain problems, and the one at present engaging the Government's attention&mdash;the most urgent and most vital&mdash;is the question of unemployment.</P>
      <P>With regard to emigration, I do not think that anybody here will contend &mdash;if he is fair&mdash;that, if you have an exceptional position in a neighbouring country where attractive wages are being offered for attractive work, you can stop that sort of emigration.  You cannot.  There is an abnormal position in certain directions on account of the British desire to build up their armaments, and there is an abnormal demand being met by offering high wages.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Most people who went to America went to stay.  They broke entirely with this country and had the idea in their minds that they were going for ever.  The Deputy knows the scenes which took place at the trains when young people were leaving their parents and going to America.  Those were sad scenes.  I say, however, that they are not being duplicated to-day.  Why?  Because the circumstances are different.  They do not now feel that they are going away for all time, they are going only for a temporary period and they are being attracted only for a temporary period.  It may happen that, when they get into their new surroundings and begin to establish themselves there, they may continue there; but the fact is, that the circumstances are of a different kind and of a different character from those which obtained in the case of the old emigration to the United States.  I do not want to make a big point of this, because I know it may be argued that there were a good many features of similarity.</P>
      <P>I see that it is now half-past-ten and the question is whether we will take the Vote or not.  I think it would be better to end and let the Vote be taken.  I am prepared at any time to deal with any of the matters that have been raised.</P>

The figures for 1937-38 are not included in the table for the reason that a considerable number of assessments remain to be made for that year.
