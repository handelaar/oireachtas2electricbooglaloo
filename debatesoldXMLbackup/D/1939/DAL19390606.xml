    <Title>Public Assistance Bill, 1939-Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward) Francis Constantine (Dr.) Ward">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill proposes to consolidate the existing law relating to the relief of the poor by local authorities, <Col N="519" /> amending it to suit present conditions, and repealing provisions considered obsolete or inapplicable in existing circumstances.  The Bill contains very little that is new in principle.</P>
      <P>To realise the necessity for this Bill, reference may be made to the condition of the law as it exists at present. Outside the City and County of Dublin, the relief of the poor by local authorities is administered in pursuance of county schemes adopted or approved under the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923.  That Act was a temporary one passed, as stated in the Preamble, to make provision to remedy more serious defects in the law and to legalise the county schemes until such time as a comprehensive reorganisation of the law could be prepared and submitted to the Oireachtas.  The Act of 1923 has been continued from year to year and it is very desirable that this position should be terminated and that the law should be placed on a permanent basis.</P>
      <P>Another strong reason for proceeding with this Bill is the great difficulty of interpreting the law under the present complicated code of enactments. A person wishing to ascertain the law on a particular point must first refer to and study the county scheme relating to the area with which he is concerned and then study the Poor Relief Acts.  This latter code is based on the old system of workhouse and outdoor relief.  It has become very involved by reason of many amendments and alterations.  The extent of the code of Poor Relief Acts is indicated by the First Schedule to the Bill under consideration where provision is made for the repeal or partial repeal of 34 enactments. The ascertainment of the law under existing circumstances often requires considerable research.  In addition it involves the solution of many difficult questions of interpretation arising from modifications impliedly made in the Poor Relief Acts by the county schemes.  It is obviously desirable that for the guidance of local authorities and of officers engaged in administration, the law should be set out in a clear intelligible form to which reference may easily be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="520" /> Before entering into an explanation of the provisions of this Bill, I would like to explain that it is proposed to accompany this Bill with a Local Government Bill which will deal with matters not considered suitable for inclusion in this Bill, or which relate to subjects of wider or more general application than public assistance matters.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to continue the present system of supervision by the central authority.  No change is proposed as regards the local administrative areas which the Bill proposes to continue.  Those areas will be called public assistance districts.  As regards the local authorities for the purposes of administration, the position will be that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  where a public assistance district consists only of a county borough the public assistance authority will be the corporation of the county borough.</P>
    <P>(b)  where the district consists of a county borough together with a county or part of a county the public assistance authority will be a board of public assistance elected by the corporation of the county borough and the council of the county, and</P>
    <P>(c)  in all other cases the public assistance authority will be the county council.</P>
    <P>The proposal to make the county council the public assistance authority has the advantage that it puts responsibility for expenditure on the rating authority.  If any particular county council feels that the administration of this measure involves a too onerous addition to its duties it will be open to the council to exercise the power given in Section 11 to appoint a committee or committees.  Another point in favour of the county council as the public assistance authority is that, as already intimated to the Dáil, a Bill is contemplated to provide for counties the system of local management which at present operates in county boroughs, and should that measure be passed by the Oireachtas, its implementation will be greatly facilitated by the unification of local government <Col N="521" /> control which the present Bill proposes. As before mentioned, each local authority is to have power to appoint committees, and there is provision for the appointment of joint committees by two or more authorities for any particular purpose.</P>
    <P>The Bill will define more clearly than has hitherto been done in any Act the persons who are eligible for public assistance.  The definitions are contained in Section 17, and they follow the lines of those given in the county schemes.  A poor person who is unable by his own industry or other lawful means to provide the necessaries of life (other than medical, surgical or dental treatment or medicines, and medical, surgical or dental appliances) for himself and the persons whom he is liable under the Act to maintain, shall be eligible for general assistance, which means the provision of the necessaries of life.  A poor person who is unable to provide by his own industry or other lawful means the medical, surgical or dental treatment or medicine, or medical, surgical or dental appliances necessary for himself and the persons whom he is liable under the Act to maintain shall be eligible for medical assistance.</P>
    <P>It will be laid down as a duty of the local authority to provide public assistance, which includes both medical and general assistance for every person in their district who is eligible therefor.  The assistance which the local authority will be empowered to provide may be broadly classified as indoor and outdoor.  The indoor assistance will consist of maintenance and treatment in hospitals and other institutions which may be directly under the control of the local authority or hospitals and institutions not maintained by the local authority.  The outdoor assistance will consist of home assistance or what was hitherto referred to as outdoor relief, and dispensary assistance or medical treatment, advice and medicines supplied through dispensary officers.</P>
    <P>The local authority will be required to provide such homes, hospitals and other institutions as the Minister shall direct and they will be required to restore, alter or enlarge these institutions <Col N="522" /> to provide and improve their drainage and ventilation, and provide fixtures, fittings, furniture and appliances as directed by the Minister. Provision is also to be made for the discontinuance of an institution whenever the Minister thinks proper. Similar provisions are included in relation to the provision of dispensaries and their maintenance.</P>
    <P>The Bill will provide extensively for the protection of children assisted by local authorities.  The circumstances under which the public assistance authority will be given or may assume the rights of parents over children in their charge will be set out, and also the powers of the local authorities to place out children at nurse, to board out children, to send them to special schools, and to place children at service or in a trade, calling or business.</P>
    <P>It will be observed that in the Bill the age up to which a child is regarded as a dependent is 16 years.  Under the existing Poor Relief Acts it is 15 years.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill as regards finance scarcely call for comment.  No change is being made as regards the areas of charge or the method of raising the funds required by the public assistance authorities.  The moneys required will be raised equally over each public assistance district.  It is not proposed in this Bill to deal with borrowing powers as this matter will be dealt with in a general Bill applicable to all local authorities.  The borrowing limit for purposes of expenditure by public assistance authorities is, however, fixed in this Bill at one-fourth of the valuation.  This is the limit hitherto in operation.</P>
    <P>The powers of the public assistance authorities under the existing law to acquire land are to be continued.  It is proposed to re-enact the provisions of the Public Assistance (Acquisition of Land) Act, 1934, which empowers public assistance authorities to acquire land for the purposes of their powers and duties either by agreement or compulsorily. In all the matters above referred to the Bill diverges little in principle from the law as at present in operation.  It might be well at this stage to refer in more detail to some <Col N="523" /> of the proposals in the Bill, particularly those which are new or which may be of interest.</P>
    <P>Section 12 proposes to provide for the establishment of joint committees for two or more public assistance districts for any purpose connected with the administration of public assistance where it appears to the Minister that joint administration would tend to reduce expense or be otherwise of public or local advantage.  It might for instance be desirable in the opinion of the Minister to establish a hospital which would cater for two or more public assistance districts or to establish for the accommodation of some special class of poor persons an institution which would be available for several public assistance districts. Section 12 would enable such an arrangement to be made and a committee to be set up for the management of the joint institution.  The principle in this clause is not new as the Poor Relief Acts empowered boards of guardians to combine for the purpose of establishing joint schools for the education of children from their workhouses, and a special Act provided for the establishment of a central hospital in Galway managed by a committee appointed by the boards of guardians in the county.</P>
    <P>From Section 20, it will be observed that it is proposed to continue the power given to public assistance authorities by the Public Assistance Act, 1937, to assist societies for relieving poor persons.  That Act it will be remembered was passed to legalise an experiment by the Dublin Board of Assistance by which they provided financial and other assistance to aid a charitable organisation which did remarkably useful work in assisting and reforming certain classes of destitute persons.  If a public assistance authority was satisfied that a society for relieving poor persons afforded or proposed to afford relief to such persons by providing food or lodging in premises under the control of the society within the public assistance district, the public assistance authority with the consent of the Minister and subject to any limitations or conditions <Col N="524" /> which he might impose, could give assistance to the society by contributing to the expense incurred by the society in affording such relief, by supplying the society with fuel, light, food, water or other commodity for use in affording such relief, by permitting the society to use premises by executing alterations and repairs and supplying furniture and fittings for such premises, and by providing premises with all requisite furniture and fittings for use by the society in so affording relief to poor persons.</P>
    <P>Section 21 of the Bill under consideration embodies a new proposal by which a public assistance authority will be empowered to provide land for any public hospital or infirmary within their district.  Before the public assistance authority can provide the land there must be a request from the governing body of the hospital or infirmary, the public assistance authority must be satisfied that useful aid is being or will be rendered to the administration of public assistance in the district by the treatment given in the hospital or infirmary to persons eligible for medical assistance, and the governing body must show to the satisfaction of the public assistance authority that the land is required for the efficient performance of the functions of the hospital or infirmary.  The public assistance authority may as a condition precedent to providing the land require the governing body to undertake to defray the whole or a specified part of the cost.</P>
    <P>Section 22 of the Bill proposes to empower a public assistance authority, on the application of a person eligible for assistance, to pay the reasonable expenses of the removal of such person from their district to some other place if satisfied that the removal is likely to enable the person to support himself and his dependants by his own industry or other lawful means and is generally for the benefit of such person and his dependants.  There might be circumstances in which it would be very useful for the public assistance authority to have this power.  By sending a poor person to a place where he would be able to get employment they would confer a great benefit on him and his <Col N="525" /> dependants.  A similar power was given to local assistance authorities in Dublin City and County by the Poor Relief (Dublin) Act, 1929, but it could not be exercised in the case of a person who was resident in Dublin City or County or both for a period extending beyond two years.  Outside Dublin City and County, no such power has hitherto existed.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) of Section 23 enables a public assistance authority where a person eligible for assistance from them dies outside their district to bury him outside the district or bring the body into the district and bury it. Although public assistance authorities have often brought the bodies of poor persons who died in extern hospitals home to their district for burial they have hitherto had no legal power to do so.</P>
    <P>Section 25 contains a new proposal to empower the Minister to prescribe methods of determining the cost of different kinds of public assistance. This is intended to simplify proceedings when steps are being taken to recover the cost of assistance.  Hitherto there was no such provision and when proceedings were taken to recover the cost of relief the question as to what was the actual cost had to be argued out in court.  This would be much more inconvenient in future when there will be so many different kinds of assistance. It is very desirable that the methods of calculating the cost of the various kinds of assistance should be prescribed and set out in regulations.</P>
    <P>Section 29 sets out the circumstances under which a public assistance authority may appropriate money, securities for money and property for the purpose of reimbursing themselves the cost of public assistance.  Though the provisions of this section are new in this country it might be mentioned that it is customary with some public assistance authorities to reimburse themselves the cost of assistance out of moneys which they may find in possession of persons who may enter institutions such as workhouses or county homes, and the section will therefore legalise a practice which to an extent already exists.</P>
    <P>It will be noted from Section 30 that <Col N="526" /> the proposals as regards the provision of institutions are more elastic than those in the Poor Relief Acts, which bound the authorities concerned to provide a limited class of institutions. They had no power to provide institutions other than those authorised. Section 30 will permit of more freedom, and it will not restrict the growth of any ideas which may develop in future as to the most suitable institutions for the accommodation of poor persons.  As regards Section 38 which deals with the formation and alteration of dispensary districts, I might point out that, under existing law, there is no power to divide a district electoral division when altering or rearranging dispensary districts.  That limitation will not exist when this Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>There are some new proposals in Section 40 which relate to the provision of dispensaries.  A public assistance authority is to be required to provide at least one dispensary for every dispensary district and they shall provide in every district such and so many other dispensaries as the Minister shall direct.  Under the existing law they are not required to provide more than one dispensary in each district though in fact they do so.  The public assistance authority is required to keep every dispensary in proper condition and repair to the satisfaction of the Minister. At present the Minister has no power to require a public assistance authority to keep a dispensary in repair. The provision in the section as regards the use of a dispensary for two adjoining districts is intended to legalise an arrangement which is already in existence in several places.</P>
    <P>By sub-section (1) of Section 41, the Minister will be empowered to direct a public assistance authority to provide a residence for a dispensary doctor. This power will be new; as will also be the power contained in sub-section (2) of this section.  Under this sub-section, the public assistance authority may, with the consent of the Minister and shall, if he so directs, provide and maintain in connection with or as part of a dispensary a residence for a midwife or other officer.  Hitherto there has been no direct power to provide such accommodation for midwives.  A <Col N="527" /> midwife could only be so provided for if she were a caretaker of a dispensary. In that case she could be given the apartments of a caretaker in the dispensary building.</P>
    <P>The proposals contained in Section 42 of the Bill are new.  The section provides that where an orphan or a deserted child is maintained by a public assistance authority and has not attained the age of 16 years all the rights and powers of the parents of the child shall vest in the public assistance authority.  The parent, however, may claim the child for the purpose of maintaining it, and in such a case the public assistance authority have no power to detain the child. Under the existing law if a public assistance authority desired to have the rights and powers of a parent over an orphan or deserted child they had had to follow the procedure set out in the next subsequent section (Section 43) and assume those rights and powers by resolution.  The public assistance authority had power to rescind that resolution and a court of summary jurisdiction could determine it.  The law in force hitherto also provided that a child under the age of 15 years without a parent relieved in a workhouse was subject to the authority of the board of guardians in the same way as it would be subject to its parents if living with them except that the guardians could not interfere with the religion of the child.</P>
    <P>Under Section 43, if a public assistance authority assume by resolution, the rights and powers of the parent of a child belonging to one of the classes referred to in the section, they retain those rights until the child reaches the age of 16 years, except they previously rescind their resolution or the resolution is terminated by the District Court.  Hitherto the parental rights and powers vested in the public assistance authority until the child reached the age of 18 years.</P>
    <P>Section 45, which relates to certified schools, contains a slight change in the matter of inspection.  Under the existing law, the public assistance authority may appoint any one of their body to <Col N="528" /> visit and inspect a certified school. Paragraph (c) of sub-section (3) of Section 45 will empower the authority to appoint any suitable person to visit and inspect any such school to which they have sent a child.</P>
    <P>Another new provision is that proposed by Section 48 which will empower a public assistance authority with the consent of the Minister to contribute to the support, maintenance and education in an approved institution of any child who is deaf, dumb, blind, imbecile, idiot, epileptic or crippled and whose parents are unable by reason of poverty to provide adequately for the training of the child. Numerous cases have come to the notice of my Department where parents who could not ordinarily be regarded as eligible for assistance were unable to provide the cost of the education of defective children in suitable institutions.  The local authorities, though willing to assist, were not legally empowered to do so.</P>
    <P>Another section containing an entirely new provision is Section 62 which will give power to a public assistance authority to authorise an officer or agent to enter on land for the purpose of ascertaining whether it is suitable for acquisition.  The officer or agent will be empowered to survey the land, make plans, take levels, make excavations and examine the depth and nature of the sub-soil.  Consent must be obtained from the owner or occupier who if he objects to the entry on the land may appeal to the District Court.  There are provisions for compensation for damage.  I consider that this is a very useful and essential provision.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the only other section to which I need now refer is Section 84 which will enable the Minister to abolish any of the remaining county infirmaries.  This power is not new. The Minister could abolish a county infirmary committee by amending a county scheme under the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923. Only seven such institutions remain, and in at least two cases it is understood that the local authorities desire their abolition in the interests of better <Col N="529" /> hospital organisation.  It is considered desirable to retain the power to abolish county infirmaries, so that the necessary machinery may be available in any case where the improved coordination of hospital services renders it necessary.</P>
    <P>It will be observed that the Bill contains very little about the appointment and duties of officers and nothing at all about the powers and duties of inspectors.  These matters will be dealt with in the general Local Government Bill which is to accompany this Bill. All through the Bill an effort has been made to avoid the use of the obnoxious words and phrases which were a feature of the Poor Relief Acts.  In this respect, the new Act will be more in keeping with the sentiments of our people and the dignity of the poor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a cause of some surprise that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health has introduced this Bill at the present time.  One wonders why the Department has considered the present an opportune time for bringing in the Bill.  When we consider what the Parliamentary Secretary has just said, it merely increases our astonishment.  We have here a Bill of 89 sections and three schedules.  The Parliamentary Secretary rightly says that the law as contained in the Bill differs very little from the law which is being administered at the present time.  In his explanatory leaflet, the Minister tells us that the Bill cannot be operated until two other measures are passed by the House.  I wonder, therefore, why the Bill is introduced at this stage.  All these clauses have been in cold storage in the Local Government Department for years and now we have them brought before us on the eve of the summer recess.  That seems to me to be putting the cart before the horse. We cannot operate the Bill if we pass it and it is not going to be operated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very good case can be made for codification of the entire law relating to public assistance.  I agree with the Parliamentary Secretary in that, but that codification cannot be given effect until other machinery is provided.  The Bill is not going to get the detailed examination at the present time which <Col N="530" /> it ought to get.  We are taking a plunge in the dark in dealing with a Bill of such huge dimensions at this stage. There has been no outcry for it.  As a matter of fact, the real want in connection with local government at the present time is a remedy for the overwork placed upon the boards of health. This Bill will not lesson that work because it cannot be operated.  If the Minister had brought in his Bill relating to the managerial system, we could examine it and have it put into operation. That would relieve the local authorities of a lot of work, but why this Bill is brought in now beats me.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, before he sat down, made the important statement that the Bill contained nothing relating to officers or rating. Of course not.  These are the important things, and they are to be dealt with in another Bill.  We ought to be given that other Bill.  If the House agrees, as I presume it will, to the Second Reading of this Bill, we ought to leave the further stages over until we get the other Bills.  Then we shall know where we are.  Codification of the public assistance law, and, indeed, of local government law, is necessary. As the Parliamentary Secretary said, legal men have to engage in a vast amount of research in order to ascertain what the law is, but this Bill is not going to simplify anything.  The Minister ought to bring in the other two Bills, particularly the Bill relating to the managerial system.</P>
    <P>In this Bill provision is made for the county council being the public assistance authority instead of the board of health.  I do not see much in that except in so far as it will take work off the board of health through the county manager system.  The whole thing goes back to that.  We cannot operate the Bill and we are not presented with the machinery by which it is to be operated.  The only new principle in the Bill&mdash;it is one which we all welcome-is that which relates to the right of the local authorities to assist in various ways voluntary societies working for the relief of the poor.  I think that is a very good provision, but the Parliamentary Secretary should tell us what purpose he <Col N="531" /> hopes to achieve by bringing in the Bill now.  He ought to tell us, too, that when the House gives this Bill its Second Reading, he will leave it over until the other two Bills which are necessary to operate it are ready.</P>
    <P>The whole principle of the Bill is the principle of codification, and the picking out of laws relating to public assistance from Acts containing other matters.  As the House will see in the Schedule, the Bill repeals a large amount of legislation, but not all the existing legislation relating to poor law as the Minister has explained in his covering leaflet.  I do not see any point in bringing in the Bill without introducing the other Bills to let us know exactly where we are.  We want to give this Bill due consideration.  There does not seem to be any hurry about it.  It has waited for years upon years, and, as I stated a while ago, the only demand that I see amongst local authorities is to take some of their work off them.  They are not able to deal with all their work.  This Bill is not going to relieve them in that way. I would strongly advise the Minister to bring along some of those other Bills which are much more important than the present measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a very comprehensive measure containing as it does eight parts.  It repeals no less than 20 existing statutes and amends no less than 14 others.  I think, with Deputy Brennan, that this is hardly the time of the year that the House should be asked to deal with a very comprehensive Bill of this kind, assisted only by a very perfunctory and not quite understandable memorandum which was issued by the Department presumably for the purpose of explaining the provisions of the Bill.  Nobody who has read the memorandum can pretend that it is any real index to the contents of the Bill or that it explains in any detail the wide character of the changes indicated in the Bill, nor does it enable one to understand the general structure on which the Bill is based and generally reared.  In the main the Bill, of course, is a machinery Bill and possibly most of the discussion would <Col N="532" /> be more appropriate on the Committee Stage but there are some matters which I should like to raise at this stage in an endeavour to obtain some elucidation which, so far, I have been unable to gather from the memorandum, or from the Bill itself.</P>
      <P>Under Section 17</P>
      <P>&ldquo;a poor person who is unable to provide by his own industry, or other lawful means, the necessaries of life for himself and the persons whom he is liable under this Act to maintain shall be eligible for general assistance.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>General assistance, presumably, in that context means the necessaries of life. One thinks of the necessaries of life as fuel, food, clothing and shelter.  These can be said to be the necessaries of life.  If one has them, one need not necessarily have coinage or currency in order to pilot one's way through life. But, in fact, the recipient of assistance from a local authority finds it necessary to have cash for the purpose of meeting the demands of his family which arise from day to day.  It has been the practice to administer relief in the form of cash payments, leaving to the recipient the responsibility of husbanding whatever grant is made in the most frugal way and spending it to the greatest possible advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary whether it is intended that the assistance to be rendered under Section 17 shall be rendered in kind, and not in cash, and whether it is intended to disturb the existing practice which enables the local authority to grant relief in cash to persons who benefit from public assistance at the present time.  I should like, in particular, to know whether this section in any way restricts the right of the local authority to make payments in cash instead of in kind, if the local authority decides to do so. Both in the Bill, and in the course of the speech of the Parliamentary Secretary, it was indicated that a person who is entitled to receive general assistance is one who is unable to provide, by his own industry or other lawful means, the necessaries of life for himself and the persons whom he <Col N="533" /> is liable under the Act to maintain. That person can receive general assistance under the Bill, but I noticed that the only person, according to the strict reading of the section, who would be eligible for that benefit is a poor person and for those for whom he is unable to provide.  Would that apply, for instance, to a poor person who has no dependents, who is a destitute person, a person who is eligible for assistance at present and who will be a poor person when this Bill is passed, if he be eligible for such general assistance as is provided for under this Bill? It seems to me, from the way in which the Bill is drawn, that it is necessary for a person to be, not a unit but a group.  He must not only himself be poor but he must also have persons dependent on him, for the maintenance of whom he is responsible.  I should like if the Parliamentary Secretary would clear up that ambiguity.</P>
    <P>It is provided in Section 24 that persons may be required to work for such assistance as they are receiving, and the stipulation in the Bill is that if a person does work for the assistance which he receives, then the relationship of master and servant shall not apply and a contract of service shall not be deemed to be in existence.  We may have a situation&mdash;in fact the Bill provides for the creation of a situation &mdash;whereby, for instance, a public assistance committee might decide that it would give general assistance to a certain number of poor persons and, in return for that general assistance, it might ask them to whitewash buildings at the county home.  In the course of carrying out these whitewashing operations, some of these recipients of public assistance might meet with accidents.  If they do, according to the Bill, the relationship of master and servant does not apply. These may not be persons who are being maintained in the institution.  A person who is receiving public assistance outside might be brought in to assist in whitewashing operations.  He might fall off a ladder and suffer some permanent disability but, if that happens, the relationship of master and servant does not apply.  There is to be no contract of service under which he <Col N="534" /> can sue his employer.  There will be no stamps affixed to his card and he will not be eligible, since there is no contract of service subsisting, and since the relationship of master and servant does not apply, to benefit under the Workmen's Compensation Act even though he may be permanently maimed and prevented from contributing in future towards the maintenance of those whom he is liable under this Bill to maintain.</P>
    <P>It seems to be an extraordinary provision in a Bill of this kind, that because a person is poor and without any resources, because he is compelled to seek public assistance in the manner contemplated under this Bill, we then deprive him of the protection which goes hand in hand with such valuable pieces of social legislation as the Workmen's Compensation Act, the National Health Insurance Act, and the Unemployment Insurance Act.  Above all, we deprive him of the right to go to a court and to have the equity of the circumstances in which he met with the accident determined by the court. The local authority may provide very inadequate scaffolding for the whitewashing operations which are to be carried out.  They might be held in a court of law to be guilty of the grossest negligence and an ordinary person employed under such circumstances might be able to sustain in law a case against the local authority but because a person is poor, we take steps in this Bill to ensure that we make him poorer still, and to humiliate him further, by depriving him of the rights and remedies which are afforded to an ordinary citizen.  I would like to hear the Parliamentary Secretary tell us on what grounds it is possible to defend a provision of that kind, particularly in relation to very poor people.</P>
    <P>In the section of the Bill dealing with institutions, the Minister has power to direct that particular classes of persons must not be assisted otherwise than in a district institution.  I would like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary what class of persons is an order of that kind to apply to.  Is it to apply, too, because of any peculiar poverty, because of any peculiar disability?  Is it because of their <Col N="535" /> residence in a particular geographical area that they are to have applied to them an order that they can get no assistance except in a district institution. I do not believe that the provision of institutional treatment under the poor law system improves the physique of the person receiving the treatment, whether it is in the form of food or in the form of medicine.  I would much prefer to see a scheme devised by which, as far as possible, persons would be allowed the comfort and the security of their own homesteads. But here we have the Minister taking power to ensure that certain classes of persons may not get benefit unless they go into a district institution. At one time the landlord garrison said to the poor in this country: &ldquo;You go to the workhouse or you stay on the roadside.&rdquo;  That is a long time ago, and the folk who issued these instructions are not in power to issue similar edicts to-day.  I would like, therefore, to hear from the Parliamentary Secretary on what grounds it is proposed to insist that certain classes of persons cannot get benefit or relief except they submit to such institutional attention as is provided for them in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill repeals the Poor Relief Act of 1851&mdash;the relevant section of it&mdash; dealing with vaccination.  It also repeals the section in the Local Government Act of 1923 dealing with vaccination.  Under both these sections there was the right on the part of poor persons to free vaccination. It is intended now, apparently, that vaccination will continue to remain compulsory, but there is no provision in this Bill for ensuring that in the case of poor persons there will be the right to free vaccination.  I do not know if that is an omission, or what induced the Minister to amend the sections in previous Acts which provided the right of free vaccination.  I would like to have an assurance that it is not intended to mulct the poor people by requiring them to pay a fee for vaccination if vaccination is to remain compulsory in the country, as presumably it is.</P>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary, in his <Col N="536" /> concluding remarks on the Bill, said that all obnoxious phrases had been removed, and that care had been taken not to use them or to repeat them in so far as they were embodied in previous legislation.  To me it does not seem to be a matter so much of obnoxious phrases as the maintenance of what one can only describe as a very obnoxious system in very many respects.  You altered the title of &ldquo;workhouse&rdquo; to &ldquo;county home.&rdquo; Anyone who has inspected some of those county homes cannot pretend that there has been more than a change of name, or that these are places in which the State or the community, whichever you care to call it, takes special care to succour the aged and the invalid poor.  These institutions stand there as workhouses, even though we have now altered the name and given them the more polite title of county home.  All the codification which this Bill may bring about will mean really nothing unless we try to breathe through our whole system of relieving poverty a human feeling and a sympathetic understanding.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 1 of the explanatory memorandum is well worth reading in order to get the background, as the Department sees it, of the grant of relief in Ireland.  It says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Since the year 1838 relief has been given to the poor of this country under a system based on the Poor Relief (Ireland) Act, passed in that year.  That system was modelled on a similar system in existence in England.  It gave primary importance to the principle that the receiving of relief must involve an appreciable amount of hardship and humiliation so that poor people would not be deprived of an incentive to support themselves by their own efforts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There is the whole conception of our poor law system in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh!  Oh!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the whole conception of it as visualised by the Department: To put hardship and humiliation on poor people so that they &ldquo;would <Col N="537" /> not be deprived of an incentive to support themselves by their own efforts,&rdquo; as if any of them could possible imagine that the incentive to use their own efforts would be neutralised by the miserable scale of assistance which they receive from many of the boards of health or boards of public assistance throughout the country.  I know counties where home assistance is administered on a very inadequate scale.  It is extremely difficult for any family in distress to get more than 10/- or 12/- a week at the very most from the local authority, and that can only be got when it is patent to everybody that the family is in a state of extreme poverty.  If the family can get it, it may succeed in keeping it for awhile, but even during that period there is a constant inquisition going on with a view to ascertaining whether in fact the sum it is in receipt of cannot be cut down further.  But who would imagine that people would destroy and imprison for all time their incentive to rely on their own efforts merely because they have to exist&mdash;taking into account the present high cost of living&mdash;on a scale of benefit represented by a payment of 10/- or 12/- a week for a family of four or five people, including adults?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the value of this Bill is not so much related to its smooth running machinery as to the necessity for a sympathetic understanding of poverty, and a sympathetic understanding of the evils and hardship which go with it and flow from it.  The present scales of allowances are absurdly inadequate. They are very much below the standard payable either in the Six Counties or in Great Britain, or in any other country which does not regard poverty as a crime.  Here in this country, both in our approach to the workhouse system and to the manner in which we distribute relief, as well as in the low scale of relief which we provide, we proceed to assume, I am afraid, in our approach to that problem, that poverty is something on which you are entitled to upbraid a person.  Many of those people wish that they were wealthy and were capable of maintaining themselves, but adversity and misfortune of one kind or <Col N="538" /> another prevents their doing so.  If we find them in the condition where they are unable to maintain themselves by their own efforts, the least we ought to do is to recognise their inalienable human right to a decent standard of sustenance.  We ought to ensure that that is guaranteed to them in conditions which do not impose upon them the traditional hardship and humiliation on which these Poor Relief Acts were first conceived.</P>
    <P>After all, we are paying very sub stantial pensions to people in this country who are not in poverty, and very substantial allowances and gratuities of one kind and another to others who are not in poverty.  The public subject themselves to taxation of one kind or another for the maintenance of people who are not in poverty-stricken circumstances.  What objection can there be, therefore, to recognising the right of a certified poor person to a reasonable scale of allowance in time of adversity?  I would wish that this Bill were used for the purpose of improving the whole administration of the poor law system as we know it in this country to-day, even though it may masquerade under another title.  In my opinion it is low in tone, and there is very little real effort made to raise either the conception of life or the conditions of life of those who are unfortunately compelled to resort to it for sustenance.  If the Bill is passed in its present form I hope one of the effects will be to improve the administration of poor relief.  If it does, it will have the good wishes of those who want to see that system&mdash;capable of many amendments of a beneficial kind &mdash;substantially remedied in the interests of those who are unfortunately the victims of poverty to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, we greatly appreciate the memorandum which accompanied this Bill.  The procedure of preparing those memoranda is one that leaves itself open to what I must characterise as abuse, and I regret the necessity of referring to what I consider to be the very grave abuse by Deputy Norton of the courtesy extended to the House by the Minister <Col N="539" /> in having this memorandum prepared. It begins with a clear heading: &ldquo;Historical Survey,&rdquo; and it sets out the fact that in 1838, 101 years ago, the poor relief system was modelled on a similar system in existence in England. The memorandum goes on to say:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It gave primary importance to the principle that the receiving of relief must involve an appreciable amount of hardship and humiliation so that poor people would not be deprived of an incentive to support themselves by their own efforts.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>That is an historical fact, but it sets out that fact in order to contrast it with the spirit which inspires the relief of the indigent and sick to-day.  It sets out that fact merely to emphasise that we cannot think of approaching this problem in the spirit in which they did approach it then, because we have learned something since then.  It does no service to the State or to the Labour Party or to anybody else to misunderstand a paragraph of that kind, and to give open expression to that misunderstanding, when the speaker is the Leader of the Labour Party.  I feel sure that Deputy Norton, when he peruses this memorandum again, will come to realise that he has entirely misunderstood it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another story. What the Deputy said was that that memorandum showed that that was the spirit in which the Department of Local Government and the Minister approached this problem.  That is not true.  The Deputy may legitimately say: &ldquo;In whatever spirit they approached it, the result is accurately described by that paragraph,&rdquo; but it is quite another thing to say that they set down that paragraph to represent their state of mind to-day.  They did not.</P>
    </Speaker>

I said: &ldquo;Here is the approach to the Poor Law system as conceived by the Department.&rdquo; I am not attributing that responsibility to the Department to-day, although I do not see any difference between the conditions there described and the conditions under which many people try to get that relief to-day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Out of appearing evil good has come, because now we have all cleared our minds and we are all agreed.  I entirely agree with the Leader of the Labour Party that that approach to the problem described in the first paragraph here was deplorable. We are happy to think it is an approach which was abandoned 60 years ago, and we are all concerned now to ensure that whatever approach is made to this problem it will not end up with the result adumbrated as a consequence of the attitude of 1838.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have listened, Sir, to the debate so far, and I cannot help asking again the question which Deputy Brennan asked: &ldquo;Why dig this up now?&rdquo;  This Bill was in draft in Deputy Mulcahy's office eight years ago, and it was laid to one side before the General Election of 1931, awaiting a whole series of additional Bills which were designed together to reform the system of local government obtaining in this country. The general election put the Government of which General Mulcahy was a member out of office, and this Government came in.  Why, at the end of the summer session of their seventh year in office, did they suddenly dig out of a pigeon hole a draft Bill which is a small part of a general scheme adumbrated by their predecessors, and present it to us?  I think it is largely for the purpose of giving the <i>Irish Press</i> to-morrow morning an opportunity of having a leading article on how the heart of the Taoiseach forever beats with the poor.  As there are about 90 sections in this Bill, neither the poor nor all the readers of the <i>Irish Press</i> will have time to discover what it is <Col N="541" /> that is making his heart beat.  However, when they learn that it is Deputy Mulcahy's seven-year old Bill they may begin to think he has palpitation, and they will not be far wrong.  However, if this Bill in its several sections can do little good, it at least provides us with an occasion for, I think, a very necessary stock-taking.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton has said that he regards the immediate basic requirements of a human being to be food, fuel, clothing and shelter.  I agree with him, and I think it is time we faced the fact that the absence of any of those things may, without exaggeration, be described as destitution.  I think we have got to face the fact that either we in our day conquer destitution in this community to which we belong, or destitution will conquer us. I have listened for a long time to people on all sides of this House paying their tribute of sympathy to the poor, and I think most Deputies in this House are sincere in that. They are greatly distressed to think of people suffering under the burden of destitution, but I think the time has passed when we might content ourselves with paying tributes of sympathy.  I think it is time to do something, and I think the something which requires to be done is quite deliberately to make up our minds that the first charge on the national income of this country is the protection of every good citizen against destitution. If, instead of approaching the problem in a piecemeal way, we gave it the priority to which it is entitled, approaching it in the resolve that we were going to dispose of it whatever the cost, I am not at all sure that we would find the cost to be very materially greater than what we are at present spending.  Take the social services at present obtaining in this country&mdash;national health insurance, home assistance, old age pensions, widows' pensions, unemployment assistance, free meals in schools, the maintenance of refuges and other places for the destitute poor, labourers' cottages, municipal housing, minor relief schemes; those are only a few of the social services operating, and each of those social services means a separate <Col N="542" /> administrative bill to pay.  Each of these social services has attached to it flocks of inspectors, clerks and administrators, with the result that a great deal of money intended for the alleviation of destitution is, in fact, absorbed in administrative expenses. That is not peculiar to this country. If you examine the social services of any country, it is often surprising to discover how large a share of the money appropriated to the relief of the poor is in fact spent in paying administrators to distribute it.</P>
    <P>I therefore feel that, instead of producing the Public Assistance Bill, 1939, the Government would be very much better employed if they set their minds to the task of co-ordinating the social services of this country, of bringing all the services I have named and any others whose primary function was the relief of poverty or destitution under the control of one body, with, if necessary, a Minister for social services or, alternatively, a division of the existing Ministry of Local Government and Public Health.  Having done that, and brought together under one head all the methods of relief from public funds, and having made sure that every person with a claim on the social services was getting his due from them, and having made sure that any fraudulent beneficiary under the social services was excluded from further benefit, they can then determine how far the provision made is falling short of the abolition altogether of destitution from our community.</P>

      <P>The Deputy must advert to the fact that the matter before the House is the Public Assistance Bill.  The Deputy now advises the Government to scrap this Bill and substitute something very different, that is to amalgamate the social services and place them under one management.  That is quite different from this Bill, and it is the Bill which is to be considered.  The Deputy seems to be proceeding on lines which he followed recently in advocating family allowances.  However desirable that may be it does not seem to the Chair to be relevant.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is aware that this Bill aims at codifying the law relating to public assistance. It does not alter the area of charge or the method of raising the money. It simply codifies the law, with a few minor exceptions, such as in Section 21 or Section 25.  It does not deal with the raising of the money, the amount raised, or the amount given in home assistance.  It is not concerned with other departments of social service to which the Deputy refers and which are, therefore, outside the scope of the measure.  The Deputy will have to seek some other opportunity of outlining his scheme.</P>

I am arguing that this Bill is perfectly futile and that you might as well introduce a Bill containing the words of Ta-ra-ra-boom-di-ay. I want to delete the whole Bill except the Long Title and to substitute a complete new series of sections which will more effectively generally amend the law for the relief of the poor.  It seems to me that unless I am permitted to do that I am bound to this absurdity.  I think all this Bill is absurd nonsense, further fooling while Rome is burning, and is going to achieve nothing but the expenditure of more money for a perfectly futile purpose. If we are going to amend the law generally relating to the poor, I think we ought to be allowed to suggest what lines we think it ought to follow.  I think I could outline now for the House a plan which will effectively amend generally the law relating to the poor, thus fulfilling the purposes of the Long Title:</P>

      <Col N="546" /> I direct attention to the fact that I have here a schedule of 32 Acts of Parliament going to the root of every branch of the question and, in these 32 Acts reference is made to dispensaries, poor law, home assistance, and pauper children.  Every branch of poor relief and every branch of public assistance is referred to.  There is not a single matter relating to public assistance and social services to which I cannot find a reference in one of these Acts.  Surely if we are to deal with that whole schedule of public assistance legislation, it is apposite and relevant to advocate them in a Bill that is to substitute them, and to quote from Acts of Parliament.  How else could it be possible to debate a measure of this kind?  I put it to the House that this Bill is going to spend money but that there is a chance, within the scope of the Long Title where, by spending less money, this will do the job.  How is it out of order to suggest to the House that it should adopt that plan in preference to the Minister's?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  Provision is made for the repeal of the Pauper Children (Ireland) Act, 1898.  That was an Act under which local authorities were empowered to take certain steps for the relief of juveniles who were destitute.  It is proposed to abolish that Act and to substitute something instead.  I think that the old provision for dealing with juveniles who are destitute was altogether wrong, because in 1839, or as Deputy Norton has said in 1938, it was regarded as a kind of crime to be poor, and children and families who were poor were penalised for their poverty.  The families were broken up, the children were taken from their parents, and the parents provided for in the workhouse. It is proposed now to end legislation arising from that outlook, and to substitute for the children <Col N="547" /> something else.  There is provision in this Bill controlling and regulating the attitude to be adopted by local authorities. In taking responsibility for children, I want to put it to the House that there is a much better way of dealing with the problem than by giving the local authorities any power to take a child from its parents for the purpose of providing for it.  I believe that the principal evil of poverty in this country is that poverty which makes parents see their children hungry.  When I say hungry I do not necessarily mean that they are quiescent.  I mean that in addition to children who are literally starving there are other children who are just as much hungry, because their parents cannot afford to give them the kind of food they ought to get.  I regard that problem of poverty as one of the most formidable, first, because I believe it gives rise to indignation among the poor, which is amply justified.  It places the comparatively well-off in an absolutely indefensible position, because no man in any community has a right to enjoy luxury while his neighbour in the same community is hungry.  It does not seem to me to be distributive justice that any Christion man or woman would desire, or could justify the enjoyment of a surplus while a neighbour, and particularly a child, was hungry.  That gives rise to the creation of fertile soil for the agitator, for persons who propose revolution, social disturbance, civil commotion and those activities generally designed to destroy the institutions of the State.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy would concentrate on the fact that this is a codifying Bill, that it only repeals certain Acts in order to embody them in a slightly different form in the Bill before the House, that it does not deal expressly, or even by implication, with the abolition of poverty.  It deals with the administration of certain funds, poor relief in the main, and contains no clause making further provision, except in minor matters.  Legislation to come will, I presume, deal with the problem the Deputy desires to discuss.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point in connection with this Bill to which I wish to draw the Parliamentary Secretary's attention.  It is more or less a local one in connection with employment. We have a peculiar position in Cork.  This position arises particularly in the case of the South Cork Board of Public Assistance.  I would like to draw the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary especially to this particular section, so that it might be changed in order to give the contributing bodies to this joint board of assistance some relief from their present position.  In the case of the South Cork Board of Public Assistance you have really a joint board made up  members nominated by members of <Col N="549" /> the Borough Council of Cork and members nominated by the Cork County Council.  An anomaly arises in connection with the rates spent by this joint body.  The city portion of the contributing area gives one-third of the funds administered by the board; the county area supplies two-thirds.  But when it comes to expenditure, the city absorbs two-thirds and the county area gets only one-third&mdash;that is, the county area administered by the joint board. That is a very anomalous state of affairs and I think a remedy is called for.</P>
      <P>In connection with the joint board there happen to be in the South Cork Board of Assistance area five or six urban areas, Kinsale, Macroom, Youghal, Midleton, Cobh and Passage. These bodies contribute out of the poor rate to funds to be spent by that joint board, but none of these bodies has the slightest voice in the striking of the rate and they have no voice in the spending of the money, because they have no representation on the board. I do not know if that problem exists in any other place except in that portion of County Cork.  There are five urban districts situated in the area of the South Cork Board of Assistance, there are two in West Cork, Clonakilty and Skibbereen, and there are two in North Cork, Fermoy and Mallow.  I think things ought to be fixed in a more even fashion, so that Cork City would not be able to absorb two-thirds of the whole expenditure for home assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not at this stage want to raise a question with regard to the way discrimination enters into the expenditure in the city area as against the county areas.  I merely want to avail of this Second Reading to bring under your notice this general question of the disfranchisement of certain areas with regard to the administration of poor relief.  The county council asks them for a definite sum.  They must provide that as a net sum.  The urban area must pay the cost of collecting it and it must also be responsible for any arrears that may arise.  These fall back again as an additional burden.  In that particular area it is certainly a problem, <Col N="550" /> one that can be, I think, dealt with on a further stage of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPatrickKelly" hpid="Mr. J.P. Kelly Mr. J.P. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J.P. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 23 of the Bill deals with the burial of deceased persons and it is not quite clear if it is the intention to confer authority on boards of health or other public assistance authorities to defray the expenses of the burial of deceased persons in their native districts when they die in institutions within the jurisdiction of the board of public assistance.  I understood that the board of health had no statutory authority previously to send the remains of deceased persons from the institution where they died to their native districts for burial.  Section 23 gives the right to the public assistance authority to defray the expenses of burial when they die within the public assistance district.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (2) gives the right to defray the expenses of burial and the removal of the person from outside the district for burial inside the area of the public assistance authority.  It has happened in the past that poor people, when they died in an institution, were buried within the grounds of that institution when their relatives were unable, through poverty, to defray the expense of removal to their native district. I remember when the amalgamation of the boards of guardians took place.  At that time it was certainly not the intention that such rights should not be conferred on the boards of health.  I merely ask the Parliamentary Secretary if such rights are conferred upon the public assistance authority and, if not, perhaps he will consider the advisability of having something included during the Committee Stage which will cover that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputies will appreciate the desire of the Parliamentary Secretary to bring about some co-ordination of the various regulations and Acts that govern poor relief generally.  Anyone conversant with local authorities, particularly boards of assistance, is of opinion that the various Acts and regulations are rather complicated.  This is a rather <Col N="551" /> comprehensive measure and the few points I want to make, deal with its omissions rather than with what is in the Bill.  For a long time I have been interested in social work in the city. There are many points about which we find ourselves in difficulties from time to time and we have no authority to deal with them.  I believe it is the intention to cover these matters now.</P>
      <P>Section 29 deals with the appropriation of property.  I do not know what is in the Parliamentary Secretary's mind on that particular point, but it would seem to me that the section is giving power to the local authority to appropriate the property of a poor person who might, for instance, come into the Dublin Board of Assistance, into one of the hospitals under the Dublin Board of Assistance, with savings, which might amount to a considerable sum.  I have in mind the money that some poor people would put on one side for burial purposes. It would strike me, according to the Bill, as it is drafted, that that money could be appropriated under the Bill, and I do not think that that ought to be the case.  I quite admit that, in many respects, it may be necessary for a board of assistance or a local authority to try to recover moneys which might be spent for maintenance or otherwise, but there are cases of that kind, and I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to consider that point, because my attention has been drawn to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, with regard to Section 48&mdash; assistance of defective children&mdash;I would like to endorse what has been said by some of the previous speakers, and that is that, in view of the fact that, according to the Parliamentary Secretary, other Bills are to be introduced in connection with this matter&mdash; referred to in this explanatory memorandum that has been circulated to the House&mdash;it is not giving the House the opportunity, of which, I think, the Parliamentary Secretary ought to avail in connection with this Bill, which is very important to all of us, to deal with the matter properly.  In that connection, I would suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary ought to consider seriously the suggestion that has been <Col N="552" /> made of postponing the Committee Stage of this Bill until such time as we would have all these other Bills before us, to be considered in relation to one another.  My reason for saying that is that I do not think this is the correct course for the Parliamentary Secretary to take.  I think that the Parliamentary Secretary when he makes up his mind to introduce a Bill, ought to take the House fully into his confidence, and he should not introduce such important matters as this in a piece-meal manner, because I think that in a Bill of this kind, which is a very important Bill, he will find that the House will be quite willing to help him so long as the House knows what he intends to do with regard to these various other Bills.</P>
    <P>Again, with regard to Section 48, I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to see that that particular section should apply to the County Borough and County of Dublin so as to enable the Dublin Board of Assistance to send defective children, other than inmates of the workhouses, to suitable institutions, and also to make provision for the sending of adults to suitable institutions. Perhaps I should have said at the beginning that good progress has been made from time to time under the various regulations and Acts that have been introduced and that are going to be repealed by this Bill; but I should like to say that, with regard to the particular case to which I have referred, we have, at the moment, I think, roughly, between 80 and 100 inmates of the mentally deficient or epileptic type, and we are not able to deal with them in the manner in which we should like.  We are very anxious that the law should give us the opportunity to deal with such cases in a proper way and have them sent to suitable institutions, and I would ask the Minister to deal particularly with this matter in the Bill, even if he were to do nothing else.  There are over 20 of the sections of the Bill which we would like to see applied to Dublin, but if the Parliamentary Secretary would sanction the inclusion of that particular section so as to give the Dublin Board of Assistance, and probably other boards in the County Dublin, an opportunity to deal with <Col N="553" /> these particular cases, of the kind to which I have referred, I think it would be very satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Now, I should like to refer to Section 17, which has to do with persons eligible for public assistance.  Perhaps I should have referred to it earlier. Deputy Norton has referred to this matter, about the payment either in kind or in cash.  Having had experience of both systems, I suggest that the Parliamentary Secretary ought to consider the point of view of leaving some discretion with the local officer as to whether such payments should be made either in kind or in cash.  I think it is quite obvious that there are cases-and I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary, if he thinks it over, will realise it&mdash;in which you could make the payment in cash with a certain amount of satisfaction, whereas you could not make the payment in kind with anything like the same amount of satisfaction and, <i>vice versa</i>, in other cases, payment in kind may not suit every applicant because the circumstances may be quite different.</P>
    <P>I said a moment ago that there are well over 20 sections in this Bill which could be applied easily to the City of Dublin, and for that reason I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to try to take the House into his confidence and, when he is dealing with this whole matter, to give us the opportunity of seeing how far the three Bills, which he proposes to introduce, will be in keeping with the one now before the House.  I think that if he does that he will go a long way to bring about a very important piece of legislation.  It will be of considerable assistance to the House if an opportunity is given to the House to discuss this whole matter in all its lights; but I do say that now, coming towards the end of the session, this is hardly going to get the proper consideration from the House that such an important piece of legislation merits, when it is introduced in the manner in which it is now being introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to agree with the last speaker with regard to his remarks to the effect that the Parliamentary Secretary, in introducing <Col N="554" /> this Bill, is not giving the House a clear idea of what are the broad outlines of the reforms that are intended to be introduced.  It is absolutely impossible for any Deputy, studying either the Bill or even the explanatory memorandum, to get a clear grasp of what is intended to be achieved.  The chief objection that I would be inclined to make to this Bill is that it has been introduced either two or three months too soon or eight or nine years too late.  We have had the statement made that the Bill was drafted eight or nine years ago; but yet it has been held up for that long period, and the Parliamentary Secretary's Department, seemingly, has not been able to devise anything to improve upon it.  Now, in the last seven or eight years, vast sums have been spent on hospitalisation throughout the country, and this Bill makes provision for reorganising assistance areas and, perhaps, joining together two or three counties for the purpose of providing hospital institutions.  It seems to me that a very serious mistake has been made in not introducing this measure at an earlier date, or before such vast sums of money had been expended on hospitals which, at a later date, may become absolutely superfluous.  For that reason, I think that the Parliamentary Secretary, having delayed so long, should have deferred, in fairness to the House, the introduction of this measure until a complete scheme of local government reform had been devised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are various objections to certain sections of this Bill, but the principal objection that I find to it is that it does not deal with the relief of poverty at all.  Now, the first and most elementary step towards the relief of poverty would be the provision of work for those who are destitute; and yet, in this measure, I think there is no provision in that respect except that public assistance authorities, as Deputy Norton has pointed out, may send those in receipt of public assistance to whitewash the local institutions or do minor works of that kind.  I do not suppose they are allowed to splash any whitewash upon the members of the boards of assistance or upon the <Col N="555" /> officials or even upon the Minister, but it seems to me a very tinkering method of dealing with the problem.  To my mind, there should be no need for public assistance for any section of the community except the aged and infirm and children.  There should be no need for public assistance for any other section of the community.  Yet we find a Bill now being introduced to provide public assistance.</P>
    <P>We have been told that obnoxious terms have been completely discarded but I think the Title of this Bill is a rather obnoxious one.  At the present time there are altogether too many people forced or encouraged to depend upon public assistance of one kind or another.  Until such people are encouraged to depend upon employment there will never be any satisfactory reform in the social conditions of this country.  As I have said, there are certain sections of the community who are entitled to the fullest possible measure of State assistance&mdash;the infirm, the aged and children.  With regard to the infirm, attention has been drawn to a section which, I think, compels persons in receipt of assistance to enter certain State institutions. If the object of that section is to compel people suffering from various infectious diseases to enter the institutions provided for them I think it is very desirable and that it is about time effective measures were adopted to compel people suffering from infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis or anything of that nature, to take advantage of the institutions provided for them.  If, however, it is intended to compel people who are not infirm but who may be destitute through unemployment, to enter what is known as the county home, it is a very obnoxious provision.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the fact that it is a great reform that obnoxious terms have been discarded, that we have changed the old workhouse or union to the county home.  I do not consider that that is any far-reaching reform so long as the nature of the institutions remains the same.  So long as miscellaneous sections of the community are herded together in those <Col N="556" /> institutions, I think the system is altogether wrong.  I think the Bill will be doing some good if it enables the Minister to reform that system, if it enables the Minister to separate the various types of people who are at present committed to the county homes and have them treated in institutions specially designed to give them the most effective treatment.</P>
    <P>Decent people who have worked all their lives and who have been in the habit of earning their living cannot be expected to go into an institution, no matter by what name it is called, so long as that institution is also open to other sections of the community.  For that reason, I think the county homes, if they are to be continued at all, must be confined exclusively to one section of the community, that is the aged and infirm.  Other institutions must be provided for the various other types of people who are treated in those county homes.  It should be possible to provide other institutions.  I think this Bill will help to make that possible by enabling various counties to be amalgamated for that purpose.  Therefore, while I agree that the House is not being treated fairly in not having all the Minister's plans put before us, I think no Deputy would be inclined to vote against the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make very brief reference to Section 46.  I regret to say that there is an unfortunate omission from this section, inasmuch as there does not appear to be any attempt made to bring pressure to bear on local authorities to use rural homes and so forth for the boarding out of children rather than institutions. There is a very unfortunate tendency amongst local authorities to place children in institutions rather than in suitable homes.  I have given the matter considerable attention, and I am sorry to say I am forced to the conclusion that the people who are responsible for the placing of these children are concerned more with the interests of the institution and keeping up the numbers of children in these institutions rather than with the actual welfare of the children themselves.  It should be emphasised, in connection <Col N="557" /> with this matter, that the cost to the ratepayers in regard to the institutional housing of those children is considerably more than the cost of placing the children in homes.</P>
      <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary to give this matter very careful attention, because I can assure him that in connection with the Dublin Board of Assistance and the Pelletstown Institution the children are being placed from that home in various other institutions of a similar type throughout the country, even though there are applications from hundreds of homes throughout the country which I would consider suitable for those children.  I sincerely hope that the Parliamentary Secretary will look into this small point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to deal briefly with a few small matters in connection with this Bill.  In the first instance, I consider that all able-bodied persons should be fully provided for under the Unemployment Assistance Acts.  With those Acts in operation and with whatever improvements may be effected in them, I do not think able-bodied persons should be eligible for home assistance.  I also think that the National Health Insurance Acts should provide for all benefits for employed persons without throwing them on the rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one particular matter contained in this Bill that amazes me. Under Section 7, power is taken to divide the area to which the Act applies into public assistance districts. Since the amalgamation scheme was brought in, six rural districts have been amalgamated with Cork City.  That is an amazing position, when Dublin City is an area in itself for the purpose of home assistance.  Waterford City, I understand, is also a separate area for the purpose of home assistance. The position in Cork is that although the rural areas subscribe two-thirds of the total amount subscribed, the city spends two-thirds of the total amount and the county obtains only one-third.  That is, one-third of the total money is spent on the people in the six rural districts; and Cork City, <Col N="558" /> which subscribed only one-third, spends two-thirds of the total money in Cork City area.  That is an injustice that, in my opinion, should be remedied under this Act.</P>
    <P>There is ample opportunity there, in Sections 7, 8 and 10.  I think Section 8 should be amended to enable the Minister to remedy that injustice in this Bill.  I see no reason whatever why an injustice like that&mdash;which has been repeatedly pointed out over a number of years, has been repeatedly protested against by complaint to the board of assistance concerned&mdash;should be allowed to continue when the Department and the Minister come in with a new Bill.  The opportunity is there now, and in my opinion the injustice should be remedied.  If the Minister would be prepared to accept amendments, I am prepared to draft them and send them in; otherwise, I would prefer he would introduce amendments himself.  Sections 7, 8 and 10 should be changed so as to take that load off the backs of the rural people in those six rural districts in Cork&mdash;the load of having to pay two-thirds of the total rate and getting back only one-third, and Cork City paying one-third and getting two-thirds back in home assistance.</P>
    <P>If there is any difficulty in connection with the ownership of hospitals that might easily be settled on a capitation basis.  There is no reason whatever why unfortunate farmers and ratepayers of the county should be mulcted in order to provide for people in the city who are very well able to look after themselves.  I would appeal to the Minister, now that he has this opportunity, to remedy that injustice to the people of Cork.  If he would look back his files he will find at least 30 protests from the rural areas of South Cork&mdash;protests against that injustice&mdash;covering a period of from ten to 12 years, ever since the city manager handed over the reins of the South Cork Board of Assistance to the Joint Committee.  Ever since, protests have been sent in yearly and regularly, and the matter has been raised here in this House on at least two or three occasions before.  I think the Minister should remedy it now.</P>

      <P>As this Bill does not seriously interfere with or propose to change the present law very much, I had not intended to speak; but I think the statement just made by Deputy Corry is very serious, in so far as able-bodied men are concerned.  He has just suggested to the Minister that he should take some powers to prevent able-bodied men from being eligible to draw home assistance.  I am surprised that Deputy Corry should make such a suggestion, especially when I understand that he is a member of the county board of health or of the county council in Cork.  Deputy Corry ought to know that there are certain periods in the year when men are off the unemployment assistance and they have, of necessity, to go to the county health boards in order to get home help to tide them over that period.  I am sure he is familiar with the situation in districts where certain people, with evil intentions, send anonymous letters to labour exchanges indicating that certain persons have a certain income or are doing work.  Immediately on receipt of a letter of that kind, invariably the recipient of unemployment assistance is cut off from the labour exchange.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; and he must, of necessity, go to the county health board in order to receive assistance. In cases of that kind three or four weeks&mdash;and in some cases a longer period&mdash;is needed for investigation, and their only source of succour would be to go to the county health board. I am sure Deputy Corry was not aware of cases of that kind or he would not have attempted to suggest what he has just suggested.</P>
      <P>I quite agree with him that the Unemployment Assistance Act should be in such a degree of operation now that it should not be necessary for any able-bodied man to seek home assistance but, unfortunately, the machinery is not as perfect as Deputy Corry visualised.  I would ask the Minister to be very careful in what he does in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="560" /> In some cases, also, it is necessary&mdash; and it has been done&mdash;that unemployment assistance be supplemented by home help.  In some cases it is absolutely necessary because of the delicacy of children, or matters of that kind.  If able-bodied men were declared ineligible as far as home assistance is concerned, it might prevent them getting milk under the tuberculosis scheme providing milk for delicate children.  I do not suppose that the Deputy meant it in that way, but I am only trying to prevent the Minister doing something detrimental.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly raised the question of the burial of poor persons, including their removal from hospitals to their homes.  I would like to ask the Minister what is the position of a poor person who is an inmate of a mental institute.  We have had cases in our county where very poor people died as patients in a mental hospital and whose people would have liked them brought home for burial in the family burial ground; but the mental hospital had no authority or power to pay the expenses of the removal of such persons.  I submit to the Minister that when a person dies under these conditions&mdash;destitute, and their people destitute&mdash;there should be some provision to enable the committee of management of a mental hospital to pay for the removal of the remains of the person and for the funeral expenses, in the same way as would be permitted in the case of a county home or the county hospital.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the point made by Deputy Norton when he drew attention to the phraseology used in Section 24, sub-section (2) which reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Where a public assistance authority requires under this section a person to perform work, neither such requisition by such authority nor the performance of such work by such person shall operate to create or imply the relation of master and servant or a contract of service between such authority and such person.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That seems to me to be deliberately evading Section 5 of the Workmen's Compensation Act of 1934, which <Col N="561" /> defines what a workman is; and prevents a man, when he is working for a public authority, from having either his National Health or his Unemployment card stamped.  As Deputy Norton pointed out, under certain conditions that man might be called upon to do work, and during the course of that work he may be involved in an accident.  In County Wexford about 15 years ago, there was a case of that kind where a man was employed by the county health board and in lieu of receiving home assistance he was called upon to do certain work, during the course of which he lost an eye.  The case was brought to court, and eventually to the Supreme Court, but that man could get no satisfaction because of the operation of whatever Acts have been in operation up to now. Here it is laid down very explicitly that a man does not occupy the same position as a man does in regard to an ordinary employer, and I submit that that is very unfair.  Here is a man who is offered employment because he applies for home assistance.  He does certain work which we must assume is work which is required to be done by the local authority.  If, in the course of that work, he meets with an accident which will prevent him from working any further, I submit that he ought to be insured in the ordinary way and that the Compensation Acts should apply in his case.  A man of that type might meet with an accident which would prevent him from following any avocation afterwards, and, if he meets with such an accident, and is not entitled to compensation, it means that he is going to be something tantamount to a pauper all his life.  That is not a very good term to use, I admit, but, unfortunately, a great many people will look upon him as a person of that kind.  I appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to give careful consideration to the couple of points I have raised before Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are all in agreement that a codification of the existing law is very necessary, but we are not too sure that the provisions in this Bill should be made the law before the other Bills which have been promised come before the House, so that <Col N="562" /> we may know exactly what amendments of the existing local government law are proposed.  There is no possibility of knowing what the local government law is likely to be in the future, until we have the other Bills before us, and I agree with other Deputies who have suggested that the Parliamentary Secretary should postpone this Bill until the other Bills have been circulated.  There are certain new provisions in this Bill which visualise a county manager system and, in that respect, I think there is one weakness at the very beginning.  Public assistance committees will go out of existence when the county manager system comes into operation and the county council will then be the public assistance body.  The Parliamentary Secretary, in his opening remarks, said that it is also provided in the Bill that if a county council cannot administer public assistance, they are empowered to call on persons outside to do so.  I think that is an admission that the county manager system is not going to be the right system, because if that body, the county council or whatever other body it may be, is not capable of administering public assistance the system breaks down there and then, because if you call in outside persons, they will act without any responsibility. That is one serious defect in this Bill and it should not be allowed to pass.  While you may get very admirable persons to act on local committees, when they have no responsibility for the raising of rates, they act without responsibility in a great many cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another provision with which I do not agree is that which allows the making of grants to charitable bodies. We know what happened under the Public Charitable Hospitals (Sweepstakes) Acts&mdash;when the sweepstakes became available for the voluntary hospitals, charity became dried up.  I am afraid that if these very admirable bodies, which are doing great work all over the country at present&mdash;the St. Vincent de Paul Society and other societies&mdash;find that they can get large grants from public authorities, their work will mainly depend, in the end, on what they can get from public <Col N="563" /> authorities.  I think that is the tendency all over and if the public get to know what they are contributing in another way, they will not contribute as much in charity as they did.  I think it is not a sound principle and that it should be changed on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>As I said in the beginning, this Bill depends on the bringing into operation of the managerial system and I believe that we will also want a Public Health Bill&mdash;we cannot get on without it&mdash;and I think we ought to have all the proposals before us before we can make up our minds as to whether it will be a good system for the country or not.  I will go further and say that it is a pity, when the local government law is being amended at all, that the Government did not go further and evolve something more in keeping with the times than this Bill.  We have at present several authorities administering assistance to able-bodied men.  We have the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Board of Works, the Local Government Department, and the Minister for Agriculture is already planning to provide similar assistance, so that almost every Department of the State will be providing assistance to able-bodied men in some form or other. I think that one authority, whatever it may be, should provide that assistance in the matter of giving work.</P>
    <P>I do not at all object to the provision for the giving of assistance to able-bodied men in case of necessity.  It is often very necessary but if you had one central authority providing work, assistance or whatever is necessary, it would solve the problem.  There would then be no need for a Public Assistance Bill, or public assistance committees because all this work could be done under public health.  Most of the home assistance given at present&mdash;and I think Deputy Corish will agree with me in this&mdash;is given to people who are infirm in some way and very little is given to able-bodied men.  You would need no public assistance authority if you had one central authority dealing with the unemployed and giving assistance to them, whether in the shape of work or money.  I think the Government <Col N="564" /> should go further than they have gone in this Bill and devise a scheme whereby there would be a great saving in the matter of administration.</P>
    <P>On the question of National Health Insurance, a certain amount of money paid by local authorities in home assistance at present goes to families which are getting a very small amount of National Health Insurance, and I think that all that should have been examined before this Bill was introduced. I believe the Parliamentary Secretary would be wise not to press this Bill through all its stages at present, until the Dáil has had an opportunity of understanding what local government law will be like when it is amended to the full extent to which it is proposed to amend it. There are other matters which can be dealt with more fully on Committee Stage, but I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to keep in mind the fact that the giving of the power to a committee of the county council, whether there are some members of the county council on it or not, to expend public money will be found not to be in the interests of anybody in the end, and, also, that the giving of grants to charitable bodies which are doing charitable work at present will be to the detriment of those bodies, in that it will dry up all charity, as it did in the case of the voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I wish to state that I think this codification of the various public assistance Acts into one Act is long overdue.  I have heard the arguments put forward for and against the postponement of the present measure until other Bills are first introduced.  As far as I can see, I do not gather what useful purpose can be served by that postponement. After all, this is only dealing with public assistance, and not dealing with the question of who is actually to be put in charge of the machinery in the different areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point in this Bill to which I am personally very much opposed.  That is interference with the able-bodied persons who at present may be entitled to public assistance. We have here words in Section 17 (1)&mdash; the words which set out that &ldquo;a poor <Col N="565" /> person who is unable to provide by his own industry or other lawful means the necessaries of life...&rdquo;  Now, in that connection when you come to the question of an able-bodied person I would like to draw the special attention of the Paliamentary Secretary to (2) of Section 17, which says that &ldquo;a poor person who is unable to provide by his own industry or other lawful means the medical, surgical or dental treatment, or medicines, or medical, surgical or dental appliances necessary for himself and the persons whom he is liable under this Act to maintain shall be eligible for medical assistance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is all right as far as it goes. But we have in the rural areas a special type of people who form a very large section of the community, namely, the small farming type, that is the farmer who may have from ten to 20 acres of very indifferent land, people who in the dairying districts may carry from three to six or seven cows, sometimes more.  A very awkward and serious problem confronts these people when they themselves or a member of their family get ill.  In the circumstances in which the Poor Law service is at present administered, these people do not get a ticket for treatment under the Medical Charities Acts.  They have to find some other means of trying to get hospital treatment for themselves or their families.  Very often they cannot get it.  In Cork the Cork County Council subsidises two charitable hospitals in the city to the extent of £750 annually to each hospital.  These subsidies are meant to help to cater for the type of persons I have mentioned and for other persons who may be able to pay portion of their medical charges at the hospitals.  But what is happening in practice is that the run of patients on these two hospitals exceeds the amount of subsidy four or five times.  The beds available at these institutions are never without patients at certain periods of the year and very often these unfortunate people have to wait their turn for hospital treatment for considerable periods.  In the meantime, you have the danger of the certain disease or ailment getting worse and worse.  I <Col N="566" /> would ask the Parliamentary Secretary when this Bill comes before the House at a later stage to take his courage in his hands and make some provision for the type of patient I have mentioned. This is a problem with which we in the Cork County Council and local boards of health are faced every day.  In practice, the present boards of assistance are not inclined to cater for people of that kind. Furthermore, the rules and regulations drawn up by certain boards of assistance are also acting as a hindrance to the getting of medical treatment for the type of person to whom I refer. I agree that these rules and regulations are drawn up with very worthy motives.  It would be well if in this or in some other Bill, provisions were made for the smoother working of giving hospital and dental treatment to these persons.  I submit to the Parliamentary Secretary that it is a very serious problem and I look upon it as one for which a remedy is long overdue.  The people who really can pay for themselves do not need assistance from the local authority or from the Central Authority.  The people who are clearly entitled to the benefits of the Medical Charities Acts are also pretty well catered for.  But, unfortunately, the type of people whom I have mentioned seem to be nobody's children.  Their lot in life is a hard one, especially as regards getting hospital or dental treatment when they meet with the ills and ailments from which people are likely to suffer. I would like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to reconsider his views on that matter and try to make provision for the cases of the people that I have mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to deal with the points made in the criticisms on the Bill largely in the order in which they have been raised in the House.  All the Deputies seem to have one line of criticism in certain respects.  We have had complaints from all sides of the House that the time is not opportune.  As to why the time is not opportune nobody has made a convincing case.  It seems to me that there has been some failure to grasp the purpose and intention of this <Col N="567" /> Bill.  Deputies who read the explanatory memorandum in connection with this Bill must have realised, if they read that document at all, that the public assistance legislation operating in this country at the present time is in an absolutely chaotic condition and that it is almost beyond the wit of man to determine what is the public assistance legal code in certain respects at the present time.  Deputies ought to bear in mind in relation to this Bill that what it purports to achieve is a codification and co-ordination of the existing poor law code with very few new innovations or additions to the legal code as it stands.  It is palpably true to say that this Bill cannot operate until certain consequential or collateral Bills are introduced or passed through the House, but surely it must be conceded that a beginning has to be made sometime, that the production of any one of the collateral measures, as we may call them for the purpose of debate, involves a considerable amount of the time of the technical staff, the legal officers and the draftsman's office and that we cannot come along and present to and conduct through this House three or four complicated measures at the same time.  We must begin somewhere and we have begun here.  The other Bills will follow as soon as it is possible to get them from the draftsman's office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I need scarcely mention to Deputies who have been taking an intelligent interest in this Bill that it does not become operative until the appointed day.  The Minister will fix the appointed day and the appointed day must be fixed in relation to, and in consideration of, the time when the other Bills will be submitted to this House and passed.  If, by any chance, that contemplated legislation should be rejected by the House, it is clear that this Bill cannot become operative at all.  I should like to make one other point.  Strange to say, I did not anticipate that the discussion would take the line it has taken&mdash;that is to say, criticism because of the introduction of this Bill before the introduction of those other measures.  I should like to make the point that, before this Bill <Col N="568" /> can become operative, regulations&mdash; complicated, extensive regulations&mdash;requiring a tremendous amount of technical attention and involving difficulties of draftsmanship, will have to be drawn up.  The Bill must be passed before we can even get down to that complicated question of drafting the necessary regulations arising out of it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton, in discussing Section 17, seemed to have some doubt as to whether public assistance could be afforded in cash or in kind.  I gathered from his remarks that he had come to the conclusion that, under the terms of Section 17, public assistance could be afforded only in kind&mdash;in the form of institutional treatment.  I think that he slightly misunderstood the section.  Perhaps, on a closer scrutiny of it, he will be satisfied that public assistance in general can be administered either in cash or in kind. Under existing regulations, there is a limit to the amount of public assistance that can be afforded in kind to able-bodied people but 50 per cent. of the assistance can be administered in kind or in cash.  The Deputy seemed to have some anxiety, also, as to whether a poor person without dependents would be eligible, under Section 17, for public assistance.  I do not think that there is anything in that point but I shall have the section further examined to ensure that the intention will be achieved.  It is the intention of the Bill to ensure that a poor person, with or without dependents, will be entitled to relief.</P>
    <P>On the question of the contract of service under Section 76, both Deputy Norton and Deputy Corish had a great deal to say.  I must confess that they have advanced a strong case for further consideration of that particular aspect of the Bill.  Between now and the Committee Stage, I shall avail of the first opportunity to go into that matter with a view to amending the law regarding the contract of master and servant unless there is some insurmountable difficulty which I cannot, at the moment, see.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon said, amongst other things, that the time was past when we could content ourselves with sympathy <Col N="569" /> for the poor.  I do not think that even Deputy Dillon would contend that we are contenting ourselves with sympathy for the poor.  When he says that the poor must be the first charge on our financial resources, I find myself in complete agreement with him, and I think members on this side of the House will be in full agreement with that sentiment.  But we cannot completely remove destitution overnight. Insofar as our financial resources will permit, we are setting up the necessary machinery to work towards a satisfactory solution of that problem.  I shall only say in relation to that particular line of criticism that it is very interesting and that, personally, I find myself in agreement with a great deal of it.  The question of family allowances is one that has attractions and ought to be carefully examined.  But it must be borne in mind that any increase in our social services will lead to increased expenditure and, when Deputies get up in this House and advocate extensions of our social services, they should not be too critical of us if we have to inflict additional taxation on our people to find the necessary money to finance those schemes.  I shall not pursue that point further.  At all events, Deputies ought to be logical and, if we are to have increased and extended social services, let us go to the public and say, &ldquo;We have got to tax you to provide those increased social services which we consider desirable.  It is not a Party matter.  All Parties are agreed on it.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Nothing substantial. Deputy Dillon spoke of the desirability of co-ordinating our social services.  I am sure the people in Monaghan will be staggered, if not alarmed, when I say that I find myself in agreement with Deputy Dillon on this point, too. They will wonder what is happening and they may think that I am in agreement with him on too many points.  The Deputy will, however do something outlandish soon, which will give me an opportunity of disagreeing with him and recovering lost ground. By all means, co-ordinate social services <Col N="570" /> as soon as it can be done.  It would be a huge undertaking to co-ordinate all social services but, at all events, we are making a beginning by co-ordinating poor law services.  That appears to be more pressing and more appropriate to the discussion of this Bill than the general question of the co-ordination of our social services.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Neill's principal anxiety in relation to the Bill arises out of the perpetuation of the existing machinery of administration of public assistance in Cork City and South Cork area.  He would like to see some relief from the cost of public assistance, particularly as regards the rural part of that joint area.  The Bill does not propose to afford any relief. Deputy Corry spoke on the same matter.  All that I can say on that point is that it is a purely local matter. I am sure that I shall probably hear more from the Cork representatives but the position in Cork is the deliberate creation of the Cork people themselves. This joint scheme was submitted under the 1923 Act, approved of, and it has been since in operation. All this Bill is doing in relation to it is to perpetuate the existing condition of things.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Doyle is considerably concerned about the City of Dublin in relation to the Bill.  As Deputy Doyle knows, this Bill does not affect the position of Dublin.  Deputy Doyle says that it is a rather attractive Bill and that there are about 20 sections in it that he should like to have operated in the Dublin area.  There are some sections, of course, that are more attractive to him than others but to give Dublin area the benefit of certain sections, without giving them the benefit of the whole Bill, is not just as simple as it appears, as Deputy Doyle fully understands.  Public assistance as far as Dublin is concerned is administered under a special code under the terms and conditions of the Act of 1929 and the old phrasing has been maintained.  While relief is described throughout this Bill as &ldquo;public assistance,&rdquo; it is referred to in the 1929 Act as &ldquo;outdoor relief,&rdquo;&ldquo;workhouse relief&rdquo; and other forms of relief.  Although that may not seem a big point to Deputy Doyle, it does constitute a considerable difficulty in attempting to graft a particular section of the Bill on to the conditions obtaining in Dublin.  Having heard from Deputy Doyle that there are some 20 sections of the Bill that are attractive and that he would like to see in operation in the area he represents, I should like to hear from him&mdash;I quite realise that he has not an opportunity of telling me now but perhaps he could convey it in some other way&mdash;what are the objectionable features of the Bill inasmuch as I would be favourably disposed towards considering the <Col N="572" /> possibility of repealing the Act of 1929 and having this Bill applied to Dublin in the same way as it applies to the rest of the country.  Personally I cannot see any fundamental objection to that line of action.  I think it is quite a logical and proper approach to the position but Deputy Doyle might possibly be able to put forward some reason why that should not be done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Doctor Hannigan, discussing Section 46, expressed a desire that children should be boarded out to a greater extent and that institutional care should be avoided as far as possible. With that sentiment I quite agree.  I think it would be much more desirable, if suitable surroundings could be found, to board out these children so that something approaching normal home conditions could be provided for them.  That is a matter, however, that will be dealt with by regulations arising under the Bill.  It can be adequately and fully dealt with without amending the framework of the Bill in any way.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a difference of opinion, even on this side of the House, on the question of the provision of machinery to afford public assistance for able-bodied men.  That difference arises in Cork.  Deputy Meaney disagrees strongly with Deputy Corry. This time I find myself in agreement with Deputy Meaney, so I hope that if Deputy Corry gets troublesome about the other contentious question Deputy Meaney will back me when we come to deal with that question.  As Deputy Corish pointed out in relation to this question, there often is a long interregnum between an application for unemployment assistance and the actual receipt of the assistance. Various questions arise sometimes that cause a considerable delay in the determination of a claim and it is necessary that some machinery should be available to provide public assistance during that period.  In certain areas, where the claimant to public assistance is the father of a large family, he has a big number of dependents and the amount of unemployment assistance may not be sufficient but, at any rate, the amount, if any, of public assistance to be awarded in such cases is a matter <Col N="573" /> entirely within the discretion of the local authority.  I do not think that in these matters local authorities are particularly irresponsible.  I think they are conservative enough.  I think it can be safely left in their hands to determine each case on its merits and to say whether or not, in the circumstances, an able-bodied man is or is not entitled to assistance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen is disturbed at the thought that county councils may appoint committees to administer public assistance.  Again, there is no compulsion on them to do that.  If county councils appoint committees to administer public assistance, or to discharge any of their other functions under the Bill, they do that as a deliberate act to relieve themselves of a certain amount of work.  It is very hard to please everybody, but if the Central Government were to take responsibility for determining and deciding these matters then we are accused of being dictators.  We are told that it is not a democratic thing to do, and so on.  When we say to the county councils: &ldquo;Well, use your own judgment in this, you are the local people, you are living on the spot and ought know what is best&rdquo;, there is objection taken to that, too.  At any rate, I do not think that the power that we are giving to the public assistance authorities under this particular heading is likely to be abused.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen also objects to grants to charitable organisations and societies. His experience of the effect of the Hospitals Sweeps in drying up charitable donations alarms him as to what may happen under the provisions of this Bill whereby a local authority can make certain money advances and make certain other provisions for charitable organisations to discharge certain functions in relation to the poor.  Well, there is probably some foundation for that anxiety.  But in so far as we have had any experience of the work of such charitable organisations&mdash;our experience is limited, unfortunately I would say&mdash;but in so far as we have had experience, it has been a very encouraging experience.  Personally, I should like to see an extension of that charitable work.  I do not <Col N="574" /> think that the encouragement that will be given to it under this Bill will in any way curtail the activities of those organisations or dry up their resources. I do not anticipate that local authorities are going to be as generous as the Hospitals Trust Fund is to the voluntary hospitals or to the hospitals of the local authorities for that matter; but, at the same time, I do not think that the extent to which this power will be availed of by local authorities will in any way dry up their resources from charitably disposed people.</P>

I think, from what I have heard from Deputies on every side of the House&mdash;that is if they expressed themselves here as I have heard them express themselves outside on this particular question&mdash;they would say: this is a very desirable step to take, and that if I indicated to the House that I had any intention of wavering on the matter I believe there would be protests from all sides of the House.</P>
      <P>Deputy Meaney is not altogether satisfied with the definition of &ldquo;a poor person&rdquo; as set out in Section 17.  In sub-section (1) of that section a poor person is defined as a person &ldquo;who is unable to provide by his own industry or other lawful means the necessaries of life.&rdquo;  Deputy Meaney did not indicate what improvement could be made on that definition.  We, in the Local Government Department, would be quite prepared to accept any better definition if we could get it, but it seems to me that it is very comprehensive. A considerable amount of thought has been given to that, and we have not been able to find any better definition of &ldquo;a poor person&rdquo; for the purpose of this Bill at any rate. Deputy Meaney seems to think that a small farmer might be held not to be entitled to public assistance within that definition.  I do not agree with his interpretation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>But if they are it is because of the interpretation given to the definition by the members of the local authority.  Within the framework of that definition there is ample scope for the local authority to determine, regardless of the size of his farm, whether a particular person is, in all the circumstances, able to maintain himself and his dependents.  If he is not, then he is entitled to relief.</P>

      <P>The same line of argument applies to admission and treatment in an institution.  Small farmers who are not completely destitute and are not ordinarily looked upon as destitute persons&mdash;people who may, in fact, be able to contribute part of the cost of their maintenance in an institution&mdash;may, within the framework of the Bill and under the regulations that will be made under it, be admitted to any public institution as a part-paying patient&mdash;a small farmer, an artisan or as a member of any other class in the community.  I think that covers all the points made on the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put one or two points to the Parliamentary Secretary? In his reply he dealt with some of the remarks I made on the measure. My anxiety with regard to some of its provisions being applied to the County Borough of Dublin is not to be taken as implying that I wanted the whole Bill to be applied to the City of Dublin.  I referred to the fact that over 20 sections in it are applicable to Dublin.  I simply want to stress the point, which was also made by other Deputies, that I believe the House is anxious to help and facilitate the Minister in this matter so that we may have, if possible, a complete co-ordination of our social services.  I suggested that the best way to deal with that would be to postpone the Committee Stage of this Bill until we had the three other Bills before us.  The House <Col N="576" /> will then be in a better position to approach this whole question of the co-ordination of our social services. That result cannot, I believe, be achieved by taking this legislation in a piecemeal fashion.</P>
      <P>The matter that I want to point out to the Parliamentary Secretary is that, at the moment, the Dublin Board of Assistance have demands before them in relation to 100 unfortunate people that they are not able to deal with. If all the legislation that has been foreshadowed were before the House we could deal with all these cases in a comprehensive way.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that the Committee Stage of the Bill be postponed until the autumn to enable that to be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not gone sufficiently into this to be able to say.  We have had the Bill in our hands only for a week.  As I have said, there are over 22 sections that will affect the Dublin Board of Assistance in its administration.  What is to be the position if they are made applicable to Dublin.  Going back on a point I made earlier, we have cripples and all kinds of people coming into the Dublin Union.  We have to take them in and make paupers of them in order to be able to send them away to suitable institutions.  We send them to Cabra and other institutions, but we cannot send them to homes for epileptics.</P>

      <P>New section.  In page 6, before Section 11, a new section inserted as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>11.&mdash;(1)  Whenever the Minister for Justice is of opinion, in respect of a newspaper or other periodical publication ordinarily printed outside the State, that a particular issue of such publication either is seditious or contains any matter the publication of which is a contravention of this Act, the said Minister may by order, if he considers that it is in the public interest so to do, do either or both of the following things, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  authorise members of the Gárda Síochána to seize and destroy all copies of the said issue of such publication wherever they may be found;</P>
      <P>(b)  prohibit the importation of any copy of any issue of such publication published within a specified period (not exceeding three months) after the publication of the said issue of such publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The Minister for Justice may by order, whenever he thinks proper so to do, revoke or amend any order made by him under the foregoing sub-section of this section or any <Col N="581" /> order (made by him under this sub-section) amending any such order.</P>
    <P>(3)  It shall not be lawful for any person to import any copy of an issue of a periodical publication the importation of which is prohibited by an order under this section, and all such copies shall be deemed to be included amongst the goods enumerated and described in the Table of Prohibitions and Restrictions Inwards annexed to Section 42 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, and the provisions of that Act (as amended or extended by subsequent Acts) relating to the importation of prohibited or restricted goods shall apply accordingly.</P>
    <P>This amendment is necessitated by the fact that in the case of certain newspapers circulating in this country the printers and publishers are outside the jurisdiction of the State.  As the Bill stood, if you wanted to prosecute a newspaper which infringed the provisions of the Bill the only way you could proceed was by prosecuting the distributor. It is felt that it would be a great hardship on a reputable distributor that he should be held liable, while the newspaper could get off.  A reputable distributor is not expected, or should not be expected I think, to act as a sort of censor over all the publications that came before him.  We gave this matter a good deal of consideration. It was represented by newspapers here that they were put in a very unfair position as compared with newspapers outside, particularly newspapers which produced special Irish editions&mdash;that they could offend, and perhaps get away with it, whereas newspapers here were liable to pretty severe penalties.  The only way we have been able to meet that is by this amendment, giving discretion to prohibit certain newspapers which offend against the provisions of the Bill.</P>

      <P>Section 11.  In page 7, at the end of the section a new sub-section added as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="582" /> (5)  Where the proprietor or the editor or other chief officer of a newspaper or other periodical publication receives a document which appears to him to be a treasonable document, a seditious document, or an incriminating document and such document is not published in such newspaper or periodical publication, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  if such proprietor, editor, or chief officer is requested by a member of the Gárda Síochána to deliver up such document to such member, such proprietor, editor, or chief officer may, in lieu of so delivering up such document, destroy such document and every (if any) copy thereof in his possession in the presence and to the satisfaction of such member;</P>
    <P>(b)  if such proprietor, editor, or chief officer destroys under the next preceding paragraph of this sub-section such document and every (if any) copy thereof in his possession or of his own motion destroys such document within 24 hours after receiving it and without having made any copy of it or permitted any such copy to be made, such destruction shall be a good defence to any charge against such proprietor, editor, or chief officer of an offence under any sub-section of this section in respect of such document and no civil or criminal action or other proceeding shall lie against such proprietor, editor, or chief officer on account of such destruction.</P>
    <P>This amendment was put forward at the request of the Dublin newspapers. It is intended to cover the case of a newspaper which innocently receives a treasonable document.  The newspapers feel that they would have to observe a certain amount of secrecy, and they do not want to give away their correspondent.

      <P>Before moving that the Bill be read a <Col N="588" /> Second Time I should like to call attention to three mistakes made in the explanatory memorandum for which I have to apologise as we were in a hurry to get it out.  The first is in page 5. The third last paragraph which reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The clause is made retrospective as from the passing of the Land Act, 1936,&rdquo;</P>
      <P>refers to clause 20 and should come after the next paragraph referring to that clause.  The next is on page 8 and is a printer's error.  In clause 29, line 9, the words:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;had already been varied once, the result would give a variation&rdquo;</P>
      <P>should be deleted and the following substituted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;section, however, did not provide for the case where one variation&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>should be deleted and the following substituted:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;pays a funding annuity on his old holding&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Then the last word on the page &ldquo;his&rdquo; should be &ldquo;this&rdquo; and the first word on page 10, instead of &ldquo;liabilities,&rdquo; should be &ldquo;liability&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The need for further land legislation arises mainly from the retarding effect on the Land Commission of two judicial decisions bearing on the construction of the Land Acts, 1923-36.  In the course of their operations the Land Commission have been faced with unforeseen objections to the legality of some of their proceedings. These objections have been upheld by the courts, and if the acquisition and division of untenanted land are to proceed the powers of the Land Commission must be clarified and assured. It is only in practice that defects in legislation come to light.  Every care is taken in the framing of the statutes to make their provisions represent clearly the intentions of the Oireachtas, but it is difficult to guard against every possible contingency in such highly <Col N="589" /> complicated legislation as is set out in the Irish Land Code.</P>
    <P>Before discussing the sections of this new Land Bill in detail, I propose to explain how the legal difficulties in the cases to which I have referred have held up the work of the Land Commission. The first case concerned the objection of Thomas E. Potterton, a tenant on the estate of Lord Darnley, to the resumption of his holding by the Land Commission.  In the hearing of the case a question of law was raised as to what body had the power to make an order for resumption, and it transpired that two sections of the Land Act, 1933, which dealt with resumption, appeared to be contradictory.  Section 11 of that Act purported to transfer to the Appeal Tribunal the powers of the court for resumption originally given under Section 5 of the Land Act, 1881, whereas Section 31 purported to make it obligatory on the Appeal Tribunal to order resumption upon the certificate of the Lay Commissioners of the Land Commission.  The Judicial Commissioner held that Section 11 must prevail, as the powers of the court in connection with resumption are judicial powers and the vesting of such powers in the Lay Commissioners would be <i>ultra vires</i> to Article 64 of the Constitution then in force.  That was the decision of the Judicial Commissioner.</P>
    <P>It was held by the Supreme Court in confirmation that the notice of resumption to be given by the Land Commission to the tenant must specify the particular power of resumption, and the particular purpose for which resumption is required, and that the certificate of the Lay Commissioners which, under Section 31 of the 1933 Act takes the place of evidence, must be as specific as such evidence should be.</P>
    <P>The second case concerned the objection of Mrs. K.M. Maher and Another to the acquisition of their estate of untenanted land by the Land Commission. In the hearing of the case by the Appeal Tribunal a question of law was raised as to whether the Certificate of the Lay Commissioners declaring the lands to be required for their purposes involved the signature by only two of the six Lay Commissioners <Col N="590" /> as had been the practice, or by all of them.  The Judicial Commissioner held that, as the wording of Section 25 of the Land Act, 1936, prescribing the procedure requisite for the compulsory acquisition of land by the Land Commission, mentioned &ldquo;a certificate by the Lay Commissioners&rdquo; without specifying the minimum or maximum number of such commissioners who should sign the Certificate, signature by all of the Lay Commissioners was legally necessary.  The effect of these decisions has been to bring almost to a standstill the compulsory acquisition of land by the Land Commission and this situation calls for remedy.</P>
    <P>These are the main points which have made necessary the introduction of a new Land Bill.  The Bill also contains suitable amending sections to clarify expressions and remove doubts in various sections of previous Land Acts, and, in addition, the opportunity is taken to remedy a number of minor defects which delay or obstruct the progress of the work of the Land Commission. Taking the sections of the Bill in their sequence: the first four sections do not call for comment being merely the usual formal provisions relating to Title, Definition, Rules and Expenses.  Section 5 provides that the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Acts shall not apply to dwellinghouses of which the Land Commission are landlords. It is inserted to ensure that the Land Commission may be able to get possession of dwellinghouses let on land acquired by them, in all circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 6 gives to the Land Commission priority for debts due to them, in line with the general rights of the State in this respect.  Such priority has hitherto been assumed for Land Commission claims but having regard to a recent decision restricting these rights to cases covered by Section 38, sub-section (2) of the Finance Act, 1924, it is advisable to have specific statutory authority for the rights and privileges of the Land Commission in respect of moneys due to them.  Section 7 gives specific authority exempting the Land Commission from payment of fees on first registration of title to holdings or <Col N="591" /> parcels in certain cases.  Such fees have never been paid or demanded, but hitherto there has not been explicit statutory authority for this exemption.  Exemption does not apply where the lands concerned have been bought from the Land Commission by public auction or private treaty.</P>
    <P>Section 8 extends the provisions of Section 27 of the Land Act, 1927, which enable the Land Commission to incur a loss on resale of land, to cover losses on resales of sporting and other rights. There is no case, so far, of loss on resale of sporting rights, etc., but it is well to provide for such a contingency. Section 9 authorises the grouping of 4½ per cent. land bonds of smaller denomination than £100 into units not exceeding £100 for the purposes of any drawings for redemption.  This is just a matter affecting the convenience of the arrangements for the redemption of the bonds.  Section 10 proposes to repeal sub-section (3) of Section 21 of the Land Act, 1931, which provides that dividends on land bonds for the time being retained as a guarantee deposit shall be paid out as they accrue to the persons entitled thereto, and provides instead, that such dividends shall be retained with the land bonds forming the guarantee deposit and utilised for the purposes of such guarantee deposit, except in cases where the Judicial Commissioner sees fit, on application, to release the dividends for payment to any parties entitled thereto.  That is a charge.  The section also simplifies the procedure for dealing with excess land bonds in the guarantee deposit.</P>
    <P>Section 11 adapts Section 36 of the Land Act, 1931, which directs payment of interest at the rate of 4½ per cent. to claimants against the purchase money of an estate, to the cases where the purchase money is payable in land bonds other than 4½ per cent. bonds, by providing that the interest shall be payable at the same rate as that which the relevant land bonds bear.  That is to say that where bonds bear 4 per cent. interest, as at present, interest bearing claims upon the purchase money such as mortgages shall be paid at the 4 per cent. rate also.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not mentioned here.</P>
      <P>Section 12 is intended to enable the Judicial Commissioner to treat as a single fund where necessary the three separate Costs Funds which now exist in respect of the issues of 4½ per cent. land bonds, 4½ per cent. new land bonds, and 4 per cent. land bonds. In practice the costs awarded in small estates are proportionately much higher than in the large estates, but the saving on the large estates pays for the excess on the small ones, provided relatively large amounts are involved. The need for giving power to the Judicial Commissioner to treat, in effect, all the Costs Funds as one arises out of the smallness of the Costs Fund applicable to the new 4½ per cent. bond issue.  There will be plenty of money in the Costs Funds applicable to the old 4½ per cent. bonds and the 4 per cent. bonds now in operation, but on the small issue, totalling approximately £592,000 of new 4½ per cent. bonds&mdash;which comes between and is now almost finished&mdash; the rate of 2 per cent. has provided only a small Costs Fund which will not suffice for costs being allowed at the usual rates unless the Costs Funds jointly can be drawn upon as a whole.</P>
      <P>The method that is proposed for adoption in the future is to authorise payment of costs to be made in cash as well as in bonds, the cash being provided by the sale of any of the three classes of bonds that the Judicial Commissioner may direct.  With a view to strengthening further any particular Costs Fund, it is proposed that the Minister for Finance should be empowered to invest the interest from Land Bonds in the purchase of Land Bonds of any denomination and is not to be restricted to investing the 4½ per cent. interest, for example, in 4½ per cent. bonds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 13 is intended to meet cases where the owners of land acquired by the Land Commission defer giving possession, <Col N="593" /> although the purchase money has been actually paid to credit of the estates.  As the law stands, the charges referred to in the clause can be recovered only as a personal debt from an owner, whereas they should properly be a charge against the purchase money.</P>
    <P>Section 14 is intended to put beyond question the power of the Minister to determine the quorum of Lay Commissioners necessary for the performance of the functions of the Land Commission, and to rectify the position created by the judicial decision in the Maher case already mentioned, in which the legal force of the wording of Section 25 of the Land Act, 1936, as construed by the Land Commissioners, was successfully challenged.  It would be waste of commissioners' time, and a serious bar to progress if every item of acquisition had to be referred to every commissioner, and such reference was never the intention or the practice.  Furthermore, the law as it stands would compel the two Appeal Commissioners, who are and must first be Lay Commissioners, to sign certificates in cases with which they may subsequently have to deal in connection with appeals on questions of price or of law.  The two Appeal Commissioners should not, and do not, deal with the acquisition of land unless and until a case reaches them on appeal; nor do they deal with such matters as the fixing of standard purchase annuities on which there may be an appeal from the decision of the other Lay Commissioners.  The section is drafted so as to assert retrospectively the authority of the Minister under Section 6 (3) (b) of Part II of the Land Act, 1933, to arrange the distribution amongst the Lay Commissioners of their work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyway we can deal with that better in Committee.  We could stay here all day discussing those points. Section 15 provides for a general right of appeal on law to the Appeal <Col N="595" /> Tribunal and abolishes the right of aggrieved parties to have questions of law stated while preserving that right to the Lay Commissioners.  The abolition of the unnecessary and almost obsolete right of parties to demand a case to be stated as authorised by Section 48, sub-section (2) of the Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881, is overdue.  The new section provides instead that parties feeling aggrieved on questions of law may appeal from the decision of the Land Commission to the Appeal Tribunal.</P>
      <P>It is considered desirable, at the same time, to preserve for the Lay Commissioners the power given in sub-section (8) of Section 28 of the Land Act, 1891, enabling them to submit a point of law for the consideration and decision of the Judicial Commissioner: this power is useful as a means of domestic help on law points arising in the course of Land Commission operations.</P>

      <P>It is obsolete and useless and it is embarrassing.  It has been the cause of undue delay, and it might give the lawyers too much to do. These are some of the reasons.  Section 16 empowers the Lay Commissioners, in their absolute discretion, to award compensation to persons who have incurred costs or expenses in relation to proceedings leading to orders made by the Land Commission.  It is only fair to recompense parties who are put to expense by proceedings initiated by the Land Commission.  Section 26 of the Land Act, 1936, which this new section proposes to repeal, provides only for compensation on objection to a provisional list of land proposed for acquisition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 17 empowers the Lay Commissioners to award costs to any party to proceedings before them, as against another party in the same proceedings, and this enables costs to be obtained by persons put to expense by, for <Col N="596" /> example, the unreasonable objections on unsustainable applications of other persons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Lay Commissioners do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Lay Commissioners, yes.  I believe they had that power before and they dropped it.  They are taking it again.  Section 18 covers a matter of procedure.  It enables the Land Commission to amend a list of vested holdings without notice to the parties, when such amendments are merely the consequence of some order of the Land Commission or of any court.  The object is to prevent parties objecting twice on the same point, as they will have due opportunity for objection later, on the consequent publication of the vesting order.</P>
      <P>Section 19 is introduced to cover cases of purchasers of untenanted land failing, within a reasonable time, to take up residence in the dwellinghouses provided by the Land Commission for them on their new holdings. It is contrary to the interests of economy, as well as to the general policy of Land Settlement, that houses which have been provided at considerable expense should remain vacant. This section empowers the Land Commission to recover possession from the purchasers in such areas.  As the law stands, the Land Commission have power to recover possession of lands where the allottees are letting them or failing to work them properly, but a man may be working his land well while leaving his new house empty or letting it for profit and the Land Commission cannot deal with him as he should be dealt with.  I think that is a reasonable provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 20 is mainly a re-enactment of Section 9 of the Land Act, 1936 (which it will repeal), in order to extend the application of the section to funding annuities and annual or additional sums, which were not specifically mentioned previously.  The wording of Section 9 of the 1936 Act covered only &ldquo;default in the payment of the purchase annuity charged on a defaulter's holding,&rdquo; and this might be held to <Col N="597" /> limit the power of the Land Commission to cancel arrears of annual payments other than purchase annuities, on resale of the holding.  The section further enables the Land Commission to cancel arrears on a holding or parcel taken up for any reason other than default.</P>
    <P>Section 21 is intended to meet a difficulty arising out of the operation of Section 33 of the Land Act, 1936. Undertakings by allottees to purchase parcels of untenanted land have sometimes to be signed before the Land Commission get actual possession of the lands, for example, in cases where they make an offer to purchase land subject to their being able to obtain undertakings from suitable allottees. And such undertakings have to be utilised occasionally when the Land Commission themselves hold land only under a letting prior to formal acquisition. In direct compliance with Section 33 of the 1936 Act an annual sum equivalent to annuity would be accordingly set up as from the gale day next after the signing of the undertaking and would be applicable to land which the Land Commission did not actually own at the time.  This situation needs to be rectified.  The new section provides that the parcel shall be deemed to have been included in a list of holdings of untenanted land only as on the gale day next after the date on which the parcel became vested in the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>Section 22 empowers the Land Commission to pay the costs of transferring parties losing their employment on land acquired by the <Col N="598" /> Land Commission to parcels allotted to them elsewhere in compensation for their loss of employment&mdash;in like manner as the expenses of transferring migrants can be allowed under Section 48 of the Land Act, 1931.  The power is to be retrospective as from the 1st of January, 1937.  These cases are few; but it does sometimes happen that the Land Commission are unable to provide for a former employee on the estate where he was engaged and if they offer him a holding at a distance the costs of transfer impose on him a burden greater than he can bear.  There was an actual case where a man had to be transferred from County Cork and there was no power to pay expenses.</P>

      <P>Do not jump to that conclusion.  You might be quite wrong. Section 23 is intended to cover the alienation without the consent of the Land Commission of a parcel provided for a purchaser for the enlargement of his original holding, prior to the holding and parcel being consolidated. After consolidation, of course, he cannot legally sub-divide without the Land Commission's consent.  That is a very necessary power.</P>
      <P>Section 24 enables the Land Commission to partition commonages held by purchasers under the Land Acts, without the consent of the co-owners. It may be desirable to effect such partition and some of the co-owners may seek it but, as the law stands at present, the Land Commission cannot act without the consent of all the owners.  All parties will be given an opportunity to object to the partition scheme before it is finally promulgated. That, at any rate, certainly is overdue. I know of cases myself where one person is holding up the work that all the rest want done.  There is a case in my own constituency and I think that Deputy Brennan knows about it also.</P>

These loans (of which only some 80 are still outstanding) were to be repaid, without interest, by instalments over a stated number of years.  It seems equitable that purchasing tenants should get the same reduction in repayments of loans made by the Congested Districts Board as has been given by the Act of 1933 in respect of repayments of advances made by the Land Commission.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 26 alters the date of revision from the gale day next after the passing of the 1933 Act to the gale day next preceding the making of the order for revision, and so avoids a retrospective <Col N="600" /> revision not contemplated in 1933.</P>
    <P>Section 27 provides that where the tithe rent charges and perpetuity rents have already been given the 50 per cent. revision of the Land Act, 1933, they shall not again be revised as a result of the redemption of a superior interest under Section 39 of the Act of 1923 or the admission to purchase benefits under Section 44 of the Act of 1931 of the land out of which they are payable.</P>

      <P>Section 29 amends Section 49 of the Land Act, 1933 (which contains special provisions relative to the variation of tithe rent charges or variable rents arising within the County Borough of Dublin) by altering <Col N="601" /> the incidence of variation from November, 1933, to November, 1938, and so avoiding retrospective variation. I frankly admit that I would prefer to deal with that one on Committee Stage, if that means anything to the Deputies opposite.  Section 30 deals with improvements and arises out of doubts in regard to the construction of Section 22 of the Land Act, 1927.  It is now made clear by this new section that the Land Commission have to obtain the sanction of the Minister for Finance to the making of free grants for the improvement of vested holdings only in cases where the expenditure is wholly or substantially for the benefit of the vested holdings, and that where expenditure is incurred on a vested holding for the benefit of unvested land, the Land Commission need not obtain the sanction of the Minister for Finance.  Sub-section (3) of the section is intended to provide that, wherever possible, any new annuity set up in connection with improvement expenditure shall be consolidated with the existing annuity on the lands concerned, but sometimes enlargements are given to small freeholds and, for the first time, power is now sought to charge these lands with the repayment of such improvement moneys as may be advanced.  The practice up to this has been that where an allottee, who had a small vested holding got an addition to it, the Land Commission could not spend money on the additional holding without going previously to the Minister for Finance.  In this case it is provided that, if the whole consolidated farm is to be improved and that the site would be better than on the old holding, it can be done without going to the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is right, and I thank Deputy Dillon for his correction. Section 31 is explanatory of Section 44 of the Land Act, 1933, which section allowed expenditure not exceeding £500 on the reconstruction of water-courses, drains, embankments and the like to be made by the Land Commission for the sake of expenditure without obtaining prior sanction by the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>The construction of Section 44 of the 1933 Act has caused difficulty to the Department of Finance and to the Comptroller and Auditor-General.  This new section seeks to clarify the method by which the amount expended on the work of reconstruction of watercourses, drains, embankments and the like, is to be calculated for the purposes of the section.  The trouble was that the question was where an embankment was being repaired and if, in one operation, it took £500, and the Land Commission were satisfied that that was all they were entitled to spend on that, as I understand it, the Finance people were inclined to add the cost of different jobs, whereas the Land Commission view is now accepted, and that is that the particular job is now taken into consideration, and not an aggre gate of jobs over a certain period. Section 32 extends the facilities for the exchange of holdings provided by Section 46 of the Land Act, 1923, so as to cover exchanges in connection with the resale of parcels of untenanted land to the various classes of allottees. Exchanges under Section 46 were confined to purposes of improvement.  This Section 32 widens, for the general convenience of all parties, the definition of the purposes for which exchanges may be arranged by the Land Commission.</P>
      <P>Section 33 empowers the Land Commission to ratify exchanges made by purchasing tenants of portions of their holdings.  It is an extension of the provisions of Section 60 of the Irish Land Act, 1903, which allowed, by order of the Judicial Commissioner, ratification of exchanges where tenants of holdings on adjoining estates were in occupation of portions of each other's holdings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section gives similar power to the Land Commission to ratify <Col N="603" /> voluntary exchanges of portions of adjoining holdings whether they are on the same or different estates, and is intended to save the necessity in such cases of complying with the complicated procedure which would otherwise be necessary before any amendment could be made in areas or boundaries on vesting.</P>
    <P>Section 34 is intended, for administrative convenience, to secure that funding annuities payable out of holdings purchased under the Land Acts of 1881-1889, which should be paid into the Local Loans Fund shall eventually find their way into that fund, notwithstanding that as a result of the transfer of the funding annuities (as in the case of a migrant) to a new holding purchased under a later Act they must, under existing legislation, be paid into the same fund as that into which the annuity on the new holding is payable. Eventually, however, they will find their way back into the Local Loans Fund.</P>
    <P>Section 35 deals with the exchange or re-arrangement of holdings charged with loans to various public bodies, and provides that such loans may be charged on the exchanged or rearranged holdings comprising the house, buildings or land improved, if of not less value than the original property charged with the loan.  Where such holdings are not of equal value, then the loans may be redeemed in whole or part by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>This section is intended to meet a difficulty which the Land Commission have experienced in connection with migration and rearrangement in the West.  A migrant who pays a funding annuity on his old holding carries his liabilities with him to his new holding, but in the case of a migrant, say, from the Gaeltacht to the Midlands, who has built a new house for himself in the Gaeltacht with the assistance of a grant and loan under the Gaeltacht Housing Acts, there is no power to transfer his liability from his old holding to his new holding.  The same applies to housing and improvement loans under other Acts.  Charges of this nature under the Housing Acts represent charges upon the county at large, and it would be clearly inequitable <Col N="604" /> and impossible to transfer such a charge from, say, County Galway to County Meath.  Under the terms of the new section the holding in the West, whether untouched or re-arranged, is still to be security for the loan charge; this charge will remain upon the original land.  If that land is no longer security (as a result of rearrangement, for instance) the unsecured portion of the charge would be redeemed by the Land Commission out of their Vote.</P>
    <P>The reason why the judicial commissioner, rather than the appeal tribunal, should determine questions arising in such cases of redemption is that intervention by the lay members of the appeal tribunal would debar them from dealing as lay commissioners with land division schemes involving provision for migration or the re-arrangement of holdings in respect of which improvement loans had been made by anybody other than the Land Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the position if the charge is on the house in that case?  If you cannot transfer the charge from the local authority in the West to the local authority in the East, what are you doing with the liability on the house in the West?</P>

    <P>Section 36 is intended to bring within the provisions of Section 37, sub-section (5) (b) of the Land Act, 1936, the power given to the Land Commission under Section 38 of the Land Act, 1933, to reduce the standard purchase <Col N="605" /> annuity of a holding which, in their opinion, is not security for the full advance. In regard to the date at which the value of land is to be taken in fixing the fair purchase annuity of new tenancies under Section 37 (5) (b) of the 1936 Act, the appropriate date is to be the date on which the order admitting the holding to purchase was made, instead of the 9th August, 1923, as prescribed in Section 38 of the 1933 Act.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (2) of the new section ensures that a grantee or lessee who becomes a purchaser under the Land Acts shall not be required to pay an annuity greater than the rent he has been paying under his grant or lease.</P>
    <P>Sub-section (3) of Section 36 is simply a repeal of sub-section (6) of Section 37 of the Land Act, 1936, for the purpose of legislating only for cases where the annuity payer has created the tenancies admitted to purchase under that section, and not for cases where lands have been vested in purchasers subject to head rents&mdash;which cases are provided for by Section 39 of the Land Act, 1923.  The sub-section does not enact anything new, but simply clarifies the intention of the 1936 Act, which was expressed in terms so wide that cases not intended to come under its provisions might be admitted.</P>
    <P>Section 37 makes fresh provisions for compounded arrears of rent and payment in lieu of rent in all cases of tenanted lands in which the particulars required by the Land Act, 1923, have not been furnished before the enactment of this Bill and for all cases of applications by fee farm grantees and long leaseholders to be allowed to purchase under Section 44 of the Land Act, 1931, in which the lands are not vested before the enactment of this Bill, as the provisions contained in Sections 19 and 20 of the Land Act, 1923, have been found unsuitable or not easily applicable to these cases. The new provisions are to the effect that compounded arrears of rent are to be calculated from the gale day preceding the furnishing of the particulars of tenanted lands (or the lodgment of the application in the Section 44 cases) or from such gale day prior thereto as will allow three years <Col N="606" /> arrears to be compounded, and are to be extended up to the appointed day. No payment in lieu of rent, therefore, will be payable, as this payment only continued up to the appointed day.</P>
    <P>It is also provided that all payments on account of rent made during the compounded arrears of rent period are to be credited against the compounded arrears of rent that would otherwise be payable.  These provisions follow, with slight modifications, those already relating to Section 44 cases.</P>
    <P>Section 38 extends the provisions of Section 10 of the Land Act, 1927, to tenancies created on or after 1st September, 1922, and before 10th August, 1923.  This is desirable owing to the fact that Section 10 of the 1927 Act (admitting to purchase tenancies on purchased holdings) only applied to tenancies created before 1st September, 1922, and Section 37 of the Land Act, 1936, admits such tenancies only if created on or before 10th August, 1923.  There was a gap left there and we are filling that up.  Those created in the interval were overlooked and left unprovided for.</P>
    <P>The section also enables subtenants of tenants on purchased holdings to have their claims for admission to purchase benefits heard or determined.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the preceding Section 37 as to the fixing of compounded arrears of rent by reference to the appointed day instead of the date of the passing of the 1923 Act are also made applicable to subtenants coming under Section 38.</P>
    <P>Section 39 is intended to govern the law and practice in regard to the resumption of holdings by the Land Commission in future.  It re-enacts (with some modifications) the provisions of Section 31 of the Land Act, 1933, making it clear that such provisions will apply notwithstanding anything contained in Section 5 of the Land Act of 1881 or Section 11 of the 1933 Act.  The difficulties of resumption which arose out of the Potterton case have been already explained, and it is necessary to clarify the procedure, which, in brief, will be: usual notice to the tenant of intention of the Land Commission to resume; hearing by the Lay Commissioners <Col N="607" /> (other than members of the Appeal Tribunal) of any petition against resumption which may be presented; if no petition is presented, or if petition is refused, certification by the Land Commission to the Appeal Tribunal that resumption is required; authorisation of resumption by the Appeal Tribunal.  In cases of urgency, possession of a holding may be taken by the Land Commission before the resumption price is fixed, as in the case of estates of untenanted land.</P>
    <P>Section 40 gives to the Land Commission the power of using their discretion as to whether further holdings should be admitted to the benefits of land purchase.  As the law stands, the Commissioners have no discretion if certain requirements are fulfilled, with the result that they have been compelled to admit to purchase holdings which are technically, but not in reality, agricultural land.  They already have this statutory discretion in dealing with applications for the admission of tenancies created since 1923, and they should have it in respect of the older tenancies also in order that the State may be saved considerable loss by the admission to purchase of small plots near or in cities or towns which are not properly agricultural land.  This section assimilates such cases to the conditions in which cases of new tenancies can be admitted under Section 37 of the Land Act, 1936.  In some cases tenancies had to be admitted that should really never have been admitted at all.  This section is to provide against that happening again.  There were people in Dublin City who were getting the benefit of the halving of the annuities and then proceeding to build on that valuable land.  It is to prevent that and to give the Commissioners discretion in respect of older tenancies in cases of that kind that we are making this provision.</P>
    <P>Section 41 empowers the Land Commission to extinguish rights, easements and minor tenancies on lands acquired by them, in order that they may get &ldquo;clear possession&rdquo; and be able to dispose of the lands freed from such interests.  That would apply to such <Col N="608" /> rights as turbary rights and grazing rights.</P>

    <P>Section 42 is intended to remove a difficulty which the Land Commission <Col N="609" /> experience in the sale by auction or tender of lands and houses of which they wish to dispose.  Under Section 16 of the Land Act, 1936, advances to purchasers in excess of a total figure of £3,000 are not to be subject to the 50 per cent. revision given by the Land Act of 1933.  Owing to this provision it has been impossible for the Land Commission in the case of auctions or sales by tender to set out in the particulars and conditions of sale what will be the annuity subject to which lands are to be sold, as this figure depends on whether or not the purchaser happens to be a person to whom advances have been already made.  This is a serious drawback to business, and Section 42 proposes that the purchasers in such sales will be (as they were before the Act of 1936) entitled to revision of the annuity on the full advance, irrespective of the value of the land they may hold otherwise.</P>
    <P>Section 43 empowers the Land Commission, when reselling lands subject to a purchase annuity or annual sum in lieu thereof, which have come into their hands for default or otherwise, to make an additional advance to pay off arrears of annuity, or rent, or rates, or costs.  It often happens that a purchaser who cannot put up enough cash to discharge the arrears of annuity and other claims of the Land Commission due in respect of a holding would be willing to have the whole or part of such arrears or other sums added to the purchase money and repaid with the annuity.  This section allows the Land Commission to accept such an offer and thereby reduce the loss on resale of defaulters' holdings and the like.</P>

    <P>Section 44 deals with what are termed &ldquo;committee cases&rdquo;&mdash;that is, lands bought by committees for the use of tenants or owners of uneconomic holdings.  Such committees were admitted <Col N="610" /> to the benefits of land purchase under Section 42 of the Land Act, 1927, but that section was repealed as regards further applications by Section 22 of the Land Act, 1936, as it was thought that the limit for such applications had been reached.  It appears that certain committees holding land were for various causes not in a position to apply previously under Section 42 of the 1927 Act, and this new section is intended to allow them in now, as a matter of grace, within a final time limit of three months from the enactment of this Bill.</P>

      <P>We know of one case, at any rate, and I understand the people themselves thought that the Act ruled them out&mdash;that the purchase was completed before the date set out in the Act of 1927; but, as a matter of fact, that was not the case: it was not until a couple of months afterwards that it was completed.  On account of representations made to me by several Deputies, I had the case inquired into. We think that there is only the one case, but there may be others.  However, this one was due to some misunderstanding. These things are hard to explain, but it would be rather hard that these people should not get the benefits they were entitled to in this case.</P>

    <P>Sections 45 and 46 further amend the law relating to the purchase of untenanted land held under fee farm grant or long lease.  The practice of the Land Commission in dealing with applications under Section 44 of the Land Act of 1931 has shown up the necessity of fresh provision to deal with various questions arising.  The provisions of that section have been amended and extended by Section 42 of the Land Act of 1933 and by Sections 42 and 43 of the Land Act of 1936; and Sections 45 and 46 of the present Bill are intended to round off this particular <Col N="611" /> legislation, and to assimilate the cases of fee farm grants or long leases to those of ordinary tenancies.</P>
    <P>Section 45 is mainly a redrafting of paragraph (c) of Section 43 of the Land Act, 1936, in order to make it clear that it applies to cases where the annuity payer has created the tenancies on the portion of his lands admitted to purchase, and not to cases where lands have been vested in purchasers subject to head rents&mdash;which cases are dealt with under Section 39 of the Land Act, 1923.</P>
    <P>Section 46 amends Section 44 of the Land Act, 1931, by providing that an application under that section may be granted notwithstanding that the Land Commission may require to resume it for purposes for which they are entitled to resume tenancies.  The Land Commission is, therefore, authorised to resume the holding after the application has been granted.  The conditions necessary for the granting of the application are also varied so as to conform with those necessary for the admission to purchase of ordinary tenancies.</P>
    <P>The section also amends Section 44 of the 1931 Act by providing that a purchaser under that section is not, in any circumstances, to be burdened with an annuity greater than the rent payable by him to his former landlord. That is to prevent a recurrence of a case raised here several times.  It will result in a more equitable distribution of the purchase money between the lessor and the owner.</P>
    <P>Section 47 proposes to extend to cases where the Land Commission purchase untenanted land by voluntary agreement the provisions of Section 18 of the Land Act, 1927, which allows arrears of rates to be treated as a charge against the purchase money of untenanted land acquired compulsorily by the Land Commission.  Owners generally have no objection to the deduction of arrears of rates from their purchase money and the enactment of this section will give the Land Commission priority for such claims.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will there be any limit there to the arrears of rates?  There is a statutory two years' limit: does this propose to affect that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No, except that in the case of voluntary sales they would be entitled to do what they are entitled to do in the case of compulsory sales.</P>
      <P>Section 48 repeals and rewrites Section 45 of the Land Act, 1936, which provided that drainage maintenance charges should be redeemed out of the purchase moneys of lands to which they are appurtenant.  It has been held judicially that this section applied only to lands vested in or resumed by the Land Commission after the date of the passing of the 1936 Act.  The new section applies the provisions of this section to all cases irrespective of whether vesting took place before or after 1936.</P>
      <P>Section 49 is merely intended to make explicit a power which has previously been regarded as implicit in the Land Acts&mdash;the power to redeem annual sums equivalent to land purchase annuities in like manner as if they were annuities proper.  The practice of redeeming these annual sums has not been questioned, but it is thought better to take the opportunity to put the matter beyond doubt. Section 50 allows a sub-tenant of a holding, particulars of which have not been duly furnished by the landlord, to apply on his own initiative to the Land Commission for an order requiring the landlord to furnish the particulars.</P>
      <P>Section 51 is needed to provide for the case of tenants of Congested District Board holdings, and the like, who are not covered by existing legislation, as to giving power to the Land Commission to appoint limited administrators. Where actual annuities are in question, the Land Commission have power to appoint limited administrators in cases of death; but legally this does not cover the cases of tenants on lists of congested districts holdings or on lists of holdings on untenanted land and the Land Commission are meeting with numbers of these who have not taken out, and will not take out, letters of administration, etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed to take power to appoint limited administrators in cases of disability or absence as well as of death.  There are numerous cases where the tenants are people of unsound <Col N="613" /> mind, and this new provision will be helpful not only to the Land Commission but to the representatives of these poor people.  Similarly, in case of the absence in other countries of parties with whom their relatives cannot get in touch.  These powers would also be applied to cases where the Land Commission make free grants.  Up to now such powers have applied only in respect of advances, but difficulty has been found in getting people from whom a valid or legal receipt can be taken in cases of free grants.</P>
    <P>Section 52 empowers the Land Commission to make new watercourses and drains on any lands where they are considered requisite for the improvement of neighbouring lands purchased or agreed to be purchased under the Land Purchase Acts, subject to reasonable compensation to the owner.  An appeal to the Appeal Tribunal is allowed to an objecting owner.</P>
    <P>Section 53 extends the provisions of Section 38 of the Land Act, 1931, which empowers the Land Commission to grant, for domestic and farming purposes, water rights on any land sold or agreed to be sold under the Land Purchase Acts.  The section also provides for the granting of rights of access necessary for the exercise of the water rights by the persons to whom granted.  Compensation is payable by the recipients of those rights to the owners of the lands on which they are exercised.  Section 53 of the Bill proposes to give to the Land Commission power to grant such rights over lands which have not been the subject of land purchase proceedings, as well as on lands which have been sold or agreed to be sold under the Acts.</P>
    <P>Section 54 empowers the Land Commission to acquire for a specified period any land or right over land, or to interfere with land for purposes of sand fixation.  Compensation would be payable to the owners in cash out of voted moneys.  In view of the damage caused by drifting sand in coastal areas, such powers are necessary for the benefit of the land and of the community.  It has been found that individual owners cannot successfully <Col N="614" /> combat the encroachments of blowing sand.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We can deal with that point.  Section 55 is intended to prevent damage to commonages coming under the Land Purchase Acts, by the undue removal of surface soil from bog-lands&mdash;commonly called <Col N="615" />&ldquo;scrawing.&rdquo;  The section empowers the Land Commission to make an order prohibiting this practice by individual owners or occupiers of such commonages to the detriment of the community, any contravention thereof to be an offence punishable by fine.</P>
      <P>Section 56 is intended to see that, in the case of lands purchased from the Land Commission by trustees (for pasture, turbary or tillage or for sportsfields, etc.) otherwise than by an advance, the conditions laid down in the Land Acts for the user of trustee lands are preserved.  In other words, the mere fact of such lands being purchased for cash is not to remove them from the category of trustee lands.</P>
      <P>Section 57 concerns the discretion of the Land Commission in regard to the user of allotments.  Sub-section (2) of Section 31 of the Land Act, 1923, requires that the Land Commission must be satisfied as to the suitability of applicants to work land given to them and as to their intention to do so, and not to sell, let, or assign it and further requires the insertion in the purchase agreement of a clause to the effect that the parcel must be worked in accordance with proper methods of husbandry and that possession of it may be retaken by the Land Commission for failure to work it properly. This sub-section as it stands is inappropriate to many of the allotments now being made by the Land Commission, such for example, as lands intended for sportsfields and school play grounds, and Section 57 leaves to the Land Commission the necessary amount of discretion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 58 enables the Land Commission to resell houses in towns and villages which may be wholly or partially sub-let, by means of advances under the Land Purchase Acts instead of for cash.  The Land Commission have on their hands several of these houses which were bought as part of large agricultural estates (mostly by the Congested Districts Board) and they have found it difficult or impossible to get their tenants to pay the cash needed for purchase.  Under the existing law they can only sell for cash and this section would empower them to sell by <Col N="616" /> means of advance and so dispose of these properties.  It is evident from what has been said that this Bill is really a continuation and clarification of the Land Bill, 1936.  That Act itself was mainly an extension of the prior land code rather than a measure introducing new principles and the same may be said of the present Bill.  It seeks to equip the Land Commission with adequate statutory powers for the difficult and complicated work of land purchase and land settlement, and to facilitate their operations in points of administrative detail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>This, in a way, is a very curious Bill, because there are 58 sections in it and no new principle.  It certainly does seem as if the Minister, no doubt aided ably by his predecessors in title, had succeeded in bringing land purchase in this country into a magnificent state of chaos, when it takes 58 sections to make up for 58, or more, separate and distinct blunders made in previous years in legislation introduced by the Minister and his predecessors.  There are things in this Bill, long as it is, which are remarkable.  I do not intend, however, to delay the House for anything more than a few moments in the remarks I have to make, because there are 58 sections, each dealing with some matter of detail, but there is no principle at all running through the whole thing.  In consequence there is no general principle, to my mind, which would, properly speaking, be the subject of a Second Reading debate at all.  I felt a certain amount of sympathy with the Minister when he was being catechised and when he sought refuge in &ldquo;Wait until the Committee Stage.&rdquo;  I think he was right, because we are not dealing with any principle of any kind in this Bill, and it is just as well for us to wait for the Committee Stage to deal with the various matters which come up for consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, however, one matter which is not dealt with by the Minister at all in the Bill, and it is completely and entirely impossible to find out where it stands, that is, what are the holdings of land which can, or cannot, be resumed compulsorily.  There <Col N="617" /> is a statute which laid down that certain classes of holdings which were tilled in a correct and proper fashion could not be resumed, and we were told by the Acting Minister for Lands &mdash;the present Minister for Defence&mdash; when bringing in a Land Bill that he had carefully drafted a section which would provide that if land was carefully tilled and giving adequate employment, unless there was congestion in the immediate vicinity and it was required for the relief of that congestion, it would be perfectly safe; but as soon as that section came before the sub-commission they simply blew it sky-high and remarked very quietly that if there was congestion anywhere in Ireland it was in that section.  The undertaking which the Minister for Defence gave the House has completely gone by the board.  I should like the Minister, so that people would know where they are, to say what is the class of holding that can be resumed for the purpose of relieving congestion and what is the class of holding that cannot be resumed.  If we get that clear, I think it would be much more use than a great number of these small and rather petty points, so far as a considerable number of them are concerned, which come into this 58-section Bill.  I shall have more to say about the Bill on the Committee Stage, but for the present I imitate the Minister and keep my remarks in reserve.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would certainly be a relief, as Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney pointed out, if we could have something definite of that kind from the Minister.  This Bill comes before the House primarily because of two happenings. These are the difficulties that have arisen with regard to the compulsory acquisition of land and the resumption of holdings.  These are two of the main reasons why this Bill has been brought before the House.  There is not any doubt whatever that land security in this country&mdash;land as security for debt or for loans&mdash;has been very largely interfered with and that has very largely interfered with production in agricultural business because of this right of compulsory acquisition <Col N="618" /> and resumption of holdings.  I do not want to assume the rôle of defending those who say there should not be compulsory acquisition or resumption of land.  But I do say this: that there is no use in the Land Commission endeavouring to set people on the land if, at the same time, they are destroying the farmers' credit and preventing them from getting that facility which is so often essential to the successful working of the land.  That is what has happened.</P>
      <P>At the present time nobody will deny that what is hampering the farmers is the matter of credit facilities.  Banks are not prepared to advance money on the security of holdings as in the past. Why?  Because of that very clause which was not operative in the past. Of course, it is the business of the banks and it is the business of every lending concern to ensure that they have security for the money they lend. This is very important to the farmers. Is there any security in land in this country at the present time?  Where can there be security when the Land Commission can walk in the following day and take up, irrespective of size or valuation or anything else, holdings of land, and say to the occupiers, &ldquo;We are going to resume these holdings; we have no regard whatever to the money that has been advanced on the security of this land; we want the land for a certain purpose, and we are going to resume it&rdquo;?  The result of that state of things is that many farmers all over the country are not working their farms and are not able to work their farms because of this want of credit. In fact, in many cases, neither annuities nor rates are being paid because farmers, through the lean period of the economic war, lost all they had.  They had to make inroads on their capital, and, when that capital was used up, neither the banks nor any lending concerns would lend them money because of this very clause.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Land Commission feels, if the Government feels, that it is necessary that a clause of that kind must be inserted in a Land Bill, and if it feels that these powers must be in the hands of the Land Commission in order to deal with land division in this country, <Col N="619" /> then some arrangement ought to be made to repay to the lenders whatever moneys had been lent by them on those holdings.  I do not think that is impossible. I do not think it is fair, on the part of the Land Commission in its efforts to establish the people on the land in this country, to deprive farmers of their right to credit.  Because that is what the Land Commission and the Government are doing so far as these two matters of compulsory acquisition and resumption are concerned.</P>
    <P>These are the two main matters in this Bill and these are the two matters which are striking straight at the credit of the farming community.  How are we going to remedy it?  Surely, it is the business of the Minister or of the Government, who are seeing the operation of that particular clause for the past two years, or whenever it was operated, even in a limited form, to put a stop at once to this destruction of the farmers' credit.  We have had right down through some years ample illustrations of the withholding of credit from the farmers because of this right of the Land Commission to walk in the following day and take the land. When we have that system applying to the large farms it has certainly reduced the market value of the land and pulled it down enormously.  The same thing affects the very small farmer&mdash; the man of ten, twelve or fifteen acres, the man who does not come into the same category as the large farmer from whom the Land Commission would be taking up a holding.  Nevertheless the fact that the larger holding is depreciated and that the owner of that farm cannot get credit facilities extends down the whole way.</P>
    <P>While this sort of thing is allowed to continue we have not any business in trying to re-establish people on the land.  We have no business asking for greater production and no business asking for a greater export trade in such circumstances.  We have no business whatever trying to get more out of the land in this country, when at the same time by the clause we are now putting into the Land Bill, we are directly working to deprive the farming people of credit facilities.  I seriously <Col N="620" /> put it to the Minister that the operation of this particular clause is nullifying the great work that has been done by the Congested Districts Board and by the Land Commission.  Certainly, great work has been done by these two Departments in the past.  Unless some kind of alternative security is found&mdash; and I say it is up to the Land Commission to find it&mdash;if they are going to impose a clause of that kind with the reactions which it has been creating, then it is their duty to see that some alternative credit facilities are given to the people.  It is, possibly, a difficult matter.  At present, my view is that these two clauses are ruining the chances of the people to make a living and ruining the chances of prosperity of the farming community.  The banks, the Agricultural Credit Corporation, and every other interested body want to see that the security they get for their loans is sound and, to a certain extent, lasting.  What security have they with clauses like these standing against them?  They have none.  No man in this part of the country can say that his land will be his own to-morrow.  Neither can the banks say so.  If that is necessary to deal with a certain situation, something else is necessary to deal with the credit situation. What is your proposal for it?  It is the business of the Government, and if the Minister does not feel that there is any obligation upon him to bring in some alternative security so that people will get crdit, then he ought to turn the matter over to the Taoiseach and the other members of the Government.  It is somebody's business to see that enactments of this sort have not unfavourable reactions and repercussions. We want greater production and greater credit facilities.  How are we to get them?  We are cutting right across any credit we had and, until we either restore that or find some alternative security, we shall never get a chance to put people back in the position in which they were some years ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. F. Lynch Mr. F. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney that this is a Bill which must be largely dealt with on Committee Stage.  A difficulty, however, presents itself in deferring <Col N="621" /> anything I have to say to the Committee Stage.  When we arrive at the Committee Stage and consider the putting down of amendments which we consider desirable, we may find ourselves faced with the difficulty that we are either contingently or otherwise proposing to put a charge on public funds.  Our amendments would, therefore, be ruled out of order.  That is why I stand up at this stage to put a particular type of case which came to my notice before the Minister.  If the matter is not dealt with in the Bill now before us&mdash;I myself think it is&mdash; I could not put down an amendment to deal with it, because it would be out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The type of case to which I refer is dealt with in the very excellent explanatory memorandum which the Minister circulated.  It comes under Section 36, though the type of case I have in mind was not dealt with under the provision to which Section 36 in this Bill relates.  I do not think that there are a great many of these cases. They are cases in which purchase or part-purchase took place under some of the very early Acts.  In other words, the tenant purchasers are not only paying purchase money either to the Board of Works, under the 1870 Act, or to the Land Commission under the later Acts, but they are also paying a fee farm rent or a perpetuity rent.  In the cases I have in mind, I think it is called a fee farm rent.  The Minister says that these cases can be dealt with at any time under Section 39 of the Act of 1923.  That is perfectly true. These fee farm rents can be redeemed. That might have been done at any time since the passing of the 1923 Act. Many of these persons are, however, very small farmers, and their annuities in most cases amount only to £2 or £3. Where they are as much as that, their proportion of the fee farm rent is about £12.  They were heavily in debt to the landlord to whom they paid that superior rent.  Section 39 of the Act of 1923 makes no provision for compounding arrears of rent.  If it did, they would naturally have gone under Section 39.  That is, obviously, the section under which they ought to go, but in the particular cases I have in mind the farmers were very heavily <Col N="622" /> in debt.  They had actually decrees issued against them in the Circuit Court for the maximum six years' arrears.  In some cases the amount went up to £70 or £80.  Counsel intimated to the Circuit Court that Land Commission proceedings were to be instituted, and a stay was put upon the execution of the decrees.  Proceedings under Section 39 would have been no justification for a stay because, even though the rent was redeemed under that section, they would still be liable for every penny for which they were decreed.</P>
    <P>These tenants did not go under section 39.  They proceeded under Section 44 of the Act of 1931 as amended by Section 42 of the Act of 1933 and Section 43 of the Act of 1936.  It was Section 43 of the 1936 Act which enabled them to be considered at all as coming within the category of what are known as Section 44 cases.  Clause (c), which is now being repealed and re-enacted in different form in this Bill, enabled these particular cases to ground their application to the Land Commission. Actually, their applications were heard by the Land Commission and they were admitted.  Where do they stand now?  Their application was allowed under paragraph (c) of Section 43 of the Act of 1936.  Although there are appeals from both sides pending, there is no appeal on the question of admission.  The only appeal is on the question of the standard purchase annuity and the standard price, so that the cases, so far as I am dealing with them, are not <i>sub judice.</i>  These were tenants who were paying an annuity to the Land Commission or Board of Works as well as paying a fee farm rent which, so far as they were concerned, was never revised.  If they had gone under Section 39 of the 1923 Act, they would have had the benefit of that revision.  Once the fee farm rent was redeemed and the annuity fixed, that annuity would be revised under Part III of the 1933 Act.  Their position at the moment is not quite clear. Once they have been admitted, as they have been, to the benefits of Section 44 of the Act of 1931, I think that the new provision&mdash;I want the Minister's assurance on this&mdash;which is contained in Section 45 of the Bill will not debar <Col N="623" /> them from the revision of the annuity they will pay under Part III of the 1933 Act, I mean the revision will take place.  They will not be debarred under the 1933 Act from revision of the annuity that they will have to pay, when that has been fixed by the court in the near future.</P>
    <P>Clause (c) of the 1936 Act says that &ldquo;any such application may be made and granted in respect of a parcel of land which constitutes or forms part of a holding purchased under any Land Purchase Act.&rdquo;  They were admitted because of the wording of that clause.  It is understandable that they should not be admitted to the benefits of Part III of the Act of 1933 if their annuities have been already revised. That is understandable but the persons of whom I speak never had that portion of their rents revised at all. The fee farm rent had continued and has never been revised at all.  I put it to the Minister, if it is not clear that these persons shall now have their annuities revised, that he should see to it, on the Committee stage, that they will, because it stands to reason that they should be put on the same footing as everybody else who comes within the Land Purchase Act.  I take it that the Minister's only anxiety in dealing with the exclusion of cases from the benefits of that portion of the 1933 Act is to see that persons should not have the annuities on their holdings revised twice.  I quite agree with the Minister in his aim to see that that should not happen.  As far as Section 27 of the Bill provides for that, I entirely agree with it.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong that any person should be placed in a better position than his neighbour.  That wrong will remain against the particular persons whose cases I have mentioned to the Minister because they, if it is not being provided for in this Bill, will be debarred from having their new annuities revised.  Unless the new Section 45 of the Bill gives them that right, they will be debarred from the provisions of Part III of the Land Act of 1933.  I am hoping that Section 45 of the Bill removes that bar to their coming within that portion of the 1933 Act.  That <Col N="624" /> was really the only point I wanted to make.  I wanted to make it at this stage because I cannot put down any amendment to deal with a matter of that kind.  Such an amendment coming from an ordinary Deputy would be out of order, as it would involve a contingent charge on public funds.</P>
    <P>I should like to stress a further point raised by Deputy Brennan and Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney in connection with the resumption of holdings and the question of credit.  I have heard of one specific case in which a man had completed a contract for sale of his farm.  The farm was situated in County Limerick, and the owner was a man in Kerry whom I know.  Just as the contract for sale had been completed, some local persons got busy and sent word to the Land Commission.  The Land Commission stepped in, sent down an inspector, and held up the sale for quite a considerable time.  The cheque had actually been sent by the purchaser to the vendor, but the purchaser's solicitor went into the bank and stopped the cheque because of the intervention of the Land Commission. I think that when an ordinary sale is taking place, the Land Commission should not interfere.  Let me say this, that in the particular case I mention, when the Land Commission learned of the facts they ceased interference and allowed the sale to go through.  The actual purchaser was a man who had five farming sons, and he wanted to settle one of them on this particular farm.  When the Land Commission learned the full facts, they refused to be rushed into interfering, but in the meantime they held up the sale for at least two or three months.  That, I think, is a very bad thing.  When a man has an ordinary purchaser for his holding on the ordinary market, it is not fair that the Land Commission should step in and interfere with the sale.  If they do, I suggest that they should at least give the price that has been arranged as between the original purchaser and the vendor.  If they did that there would be no particular &ldquo;grouse,&rdquo; but to go in when a man has sold his holding, and completely to wipe out the contract of sale is, I think, very unfair to the purchaser and the vendor.</P>

      <P>This Bill is described as an Act to amend and extend the Land Purchase Acts in divers respects.  It is remarkable in the number of respects in which it seeks to amend existing Land Acts, but it is even more remarkable in the various important respects in which it fails to amend existing Acts. We know that under existing legislation the right of fixity of tenure has been completely abolished.  Every member of the House is, I think, agreed upon that point.</P>

      <P>We have got to ask ourselves why we should not take advantage of this Bill to amend existing Land Acts so as to restore, so far as is humanly possible, security of tenure to the average peasant farmer of this country.  We are told, of course, that a farmer who farms his land property and who gives a certain amount of employment will not be interfered with; but we know, as far as the Land Acts are concerned, that there is no statutory provision to protect such a farmer.  We must ask ourselves why should it not be possible for the Minister, when introducing this legislation, to introduce such a statutory provision to protect any farmer who is endeavouring to work his land to the best advantage and who is providing a reasonable amount of employment. That would be a reasonable provision, yet it is a provision which the Minister has failed to include in this legislation. The result is that no farmer, whether his holding be large or small, has any security of tenure whatsoever. The Minister has not stated at any time why it is not possible to introduce a statutory provision that would protect the rights of the average farmer in cases where it is not the present intention of the Land Commission to interfere with those rights &mdash;rights which, however, could be interfered with by this or any future Government under the Acts now in force.  I think that such a clause is absolutely necessary in this Bill.  It could be inserted without interfering, to any extent, with the acquisition of land for the relief of congests.</P>

      <P>I will come to that later.  There is another amendment which is needed in this proposed legislation, namely, that where land is being divided there should be a statutory minimum acreage provided for each new holding.  At the present time you have new holdings in various parts of the country comprising three, four, five and six acres.  They are of no use to the tenant, the Land Commission, or the country in general.  There is no justification for them.  I know, of course, that the Land Commission will always be subjected to very strong pressure to divide a holding into the smallest possible divisions so as to meet the needs of the largest number of claims possible.  That kind of thing should be met by a statutory minimum acreage being laid down for each holding. In the Land League days we had the three slogans: Fair Rent, Fixity of Tenure and Free Sale.</P>

      <P>I suggest to the Minister that he should take advantage of this Bill to make provision for farmers who have been brought to a pitiful state of destitution, due to the conditions under which they were compelled to live during the past four or five years, by inserting a new section in it spreading their arrears of annuities over the entire purchase period.  When Deputies go to the Land Commission to plead on behalf of annuitants they are frequently told that the Land Commission are powerless to do anything for them inasmuch as the Land Commission are under statutory obligation to collect the annuities.  The most that they can do is to give short temporary relief.  The Land Commission claim that they are bound by statute.  Here the opportunity presents itself to the <Col N="627" /> Minister to get statutory power to deal with these exceptional cases.  Everyone realises that the years through which we have passed may never occur again and must never occur again in the history of this country.  That being so, why should it not be possible to revise these annuities.  The present annuities were fixed at the peak period, or, if one prefers it, at the deepest period of the economic war in 1933.  That was an abnormal period when conditions were absolutely hopeless.  That was a time when the annuities were being collected through devices other than the machinery of the Land Commission. The farmers at that time were unable to meet the demands made on them, with the result that arrears accumulated over two or three years.  The position at the moment is that while agricultural prices have slightly improved, and while it may be possible for farmers to meet the current instalments it is absolutely impossible for them to clear off the arrears which have accumulated.  Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that he should avail of this legislation to amend the 1933 Land Act, that he should revise the present annuities and spread the repayment of the arrears due over a considerable period.  In view of what the farmers have suffered, I do not think the Minister can give a valid reason for refusing to meet my request.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is correct when he anticipates from me a remonstrance in connection with Section 39 of this Bill.  Either the Land League leaders knew what was good for this country or they did not.  It is certainly true that 100 per cent. of the Irish people thought they did, and supported them.  It is certainly true that most social students of this country have commented on the rise in the standard of living of the farmers of this country since the doctrine for which the Land League stood prevailed.  I do not think that anyone who knows rural Ireland would deny that, from the day on which fixity of tenure, free sale and fair rent were established in this country the farmers began to get better off, and that that steadily continued until Fianna Fáil destroyed those three things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="628" /> Now, the decision in Potterton's case reimposed some restraint on the Land Commission in its promiscuous resumption of holdings under previous Land Acts.  It is now proposed to withdraw the protection conferred on tenants by the decision in Potterton's case.  I think that is a retrograde step unless it is accompanied by some declaration by the Minister for Lands that the Government are of opinion that fixity of tenure, fair rent and free sale should be re-established in this country on some basis.  If the whole land settlement in this country is to go back into the melting pot, it is going to destroy the enterprise of our people, and is going to end in chaos in rural Ireland.  Those who have no understanding of the circumstances under which our people live cannot be expected to appreciate that.  But if you fix every farmer in this country with notice that a Government agency can, at any time, take his land from him, although there is a statutory obligation to give him a farm of equal market value, it means that you are going to destroy every farmer's willingness to devote himself energetically to the improvement of his holding, and, consequently, to increasing the national income as a whole.</P>
    <P>I myself know that since the 1933 Land Act came to be appreciated in rural Ireland the fact is that, in a townland where there were one good farmer and seven bad ones, the seven bad ones deliberately started a Fianna Fáil club for the purpose of recommending to the Land Commission that they should inspect the good farmer's holding with a view to acquisition. That is common knowledge.  I do not say by any means that the Land Commission always do examine it, though they frequently do.  I have no doubt that in the vast majority of cases, after examining it, they abandon all idea of acquisition, but anyone living in rural Ireland knows the impression it creates in a small farmer's mind if a Land Commission inspector walks on to his holding for the purpose of inspecting it for acquisition.  It is a completely revolutionary idea and, say what you like to that man hereafter, nothing will convince him that <Col N="629" /> if he does anything further to improve his holding it will not be seized sooner or later.</P>
    <P>I know cases in which Fianna Fáil T.D.s have gone down to meetings of neighbours and exhorted them to try and grab their neighbour's holding, and, under the protection and encouragement of members of the Fianna Fáil Party, representations have been made to the Land Commission requesting them to grab that man's holding and distribute it amongst the modern emergency men.  In that parish you started a minor land war. We all saw what happened in Ballyhaunis. We had respectable farmers' wives out on the road battling with the Civic Guards, and general pandemonium in that parish, and you are going to have the same in every parish in Ireland if you once create the impression generally that the land grabber is now a just man, and that the decent farmer is going to be regarded in the future as a public enemy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the emergency men and the grabbers of this State are to be the favoured children of the Government Party, their numbers will increase, because many a man who is deterred from being a grabber or an emergencyman only by the knowledge that that class is loathed by the decent elements in this country reverts to type when he gets the assistance of a Fianna Fáil Deputy's protection to resist the pressure of public opinion. The 1933 Land Act set a premium on the grabber and the emergencyman in this country.  The Potterton decision checked that tendency, and we have now announced that it is our intention to override the Potterton decision so as to restore to that grabber and emergency man the charter of liberty he got in 1933.  The Deputy from Wicklow thinks that this occasion should be taken to amend the land code in order to correct that and to restore fixity of tenure to the farmers of this country.  That will not do.  There is no good amending an Act of Parliament to that end, because <Col N="630" /> once you have destroyed a great fundamental principle in the community's life, there is no use trying to restore it by passing an Act of Parliament, which is always capable of repeal.  Confidence is hard to create but extremely easy to destroy. Confidence in fixity of tenure in this country has been destroyed.  The country people no longer believe that you can, with safety, invest your savings in the land.  They believe that if you do the grabber will start a Fianna Fáil club and take your land from you for a tithe of what you paid for it.</P>
      <P>I do not only want to destroy the grabber; I want to strangle the grabber in this country.  In the old days the Land League strangled him effectively.  He was treated with more contempt and loathing than a leper. People held their noses when they passed him on the side of the road. The grabber's son and the emergency man's son are still marked in rural Ireland.  We tolerate them, but we only tolerate them.  Anyone would be ashamed to be known as the intimate friend of a grabber's son or an emergency man's son, but charity so far prevails that we tolerate them.  The only way in which you can destroy the grabber now is by some fundamental law which will not be susceptible to amendment by the grabber's friend in this House.</P>
      <P>We could get that law passed.  Any amendment of the Constitution proposing to grant fixity of tenure to our people in rural Ireland will be carried by a majority of ten to one if it is put to the people, and anyone who attempts thereafter to get that amendment repealed or withdrawn will get his answer from the people.  Far from seeking to override the decision of the Potterton case, I suggest to the Minister that we should now make up our minds as to what is the holding of land which this State considers is the maximum which may be guaranteed against interference.  You may fix that at 50 acres or 100 acres, or at whatever figure you like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You cannot get back to the old flexible principle which distinguished between a man's homestead and land <Col N="631" /> that he let.  The day you broke the landord's demesne wall you destroyed the fundamental principle of the land settlement in this country.  The Land League stood for the principle that the farmer's homestead was untouchable, but that no man would be allowed to hold land and let it to his neighbour. Because the cupidity of our people was stirred, they broke the demesne wall, and the day they broke the demesne wall they interferred with the landlord's homestead.  Up to that time the landlord and the smallest congest tenant in Ireland were equal before the law.  There was no distinction made between them.  The landlord had no privilege over the congest, and the congest had no privilege over the landlord. That was the right way&mdash;that all men be equal before the law.  The moment you went into the landlord's homestead, where he was living and working, you opened the flood gates to justify going into the large farmer in his homestead, and taking that from him. The next stage was the 1933 Land Act, when you took the right to go into any farmer's homestead, take it from him, and give him in exchange for it what you thought was good for him.  You now have the right to go into a farmer in West Cork and take his holding from him, and give him one in East Donegal, if it is of equal market value.  That means that you have Clanrickarde's right, Barrymore's right, to evict a man on the side of the road and offer him something in exchange which is no good to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is as far as fixity of tenure goes.  Let the Government make up its mind what is the maximum holding in respect of which we are prepared to restore fixity of tenure.  Let us incorporate that finding in a constitutional <Col N="632" /> amendment, put it to the country, get it carried, and restore fixity of tenure at least, so that we can get the people to put their savings into the land as they used to do, improving their holdings as they started to do in 1881, and building up the national wealth.  When we have done that, I put it to the Government that the next thing we ought to do is to restore free sale.  Mind you, one very largely flows from the other.  If you give them fixity of tenure, then they will have the right to go out and sell their land if it suits them to do so.  A lot of people in Dáil Eireann imagine that the only person who ever sells land is a landed proprietor. Anyone who lives amongst the people and knows them realises how grotesquely untrue that is.  After 1881, the average small farmer invested his money in two ways.  He either gave it to the joint stock banks to hold it on deposit for him&mdash;a thoroughly uneconomic procedure, and if the banks do not like that they can lump it&mdash;or he invested it in improvements in the land. The farmers believed, and they rightly believed, that if they bought a holding for £200 and put their savings into it by way of improving fences, out-offices, and manure, and if later the family arrangements required them to sell, they would be able to get for the improved holding the price which they originally paid and the amount spent on improvements out of their savings. They were perfectly right.</P>
      <P>Now what have you?  A man has a holding of land and puts his savings into it, improves it, makes it outstanding amongst those of his neighbours, whereupon the grabbers form a Fianna Fáil club and the land is inspected. That man wants to sell that piece of land.  Perhaps he has no son, and his daughter is going to marry into another place, and it suits him to sell the land and give her a dowry, and go into town to live himself.  The minute that man's land is announced for auction, the grabbers' club notify the Land Commission and there is an inspector down to inspect it.  Quite apart from the prospect of whether the Land Commission are going to take the land or not, in fact, when the inspector comes, that land becomes unsaleable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone who is bidding for it retires from the contest, and the grabbers' <Col N="633" /> club manage to create an impression that it is contrary to Government policy to buy that farm.  Ultimately that man is confronted with a situation that his savings are locked up in the piece of land, that he cannot sell it, and that the only way he can dispose of it is to dispose of it to the Land Commission, who will fix the price for the land with due regard to the value of the land, and the capacity of the land to pay the annuity; with the result that that farm of land for which £900 could be got in the open market will be acquired by the Land Commission for maybe £200 or less.  The life savings of that old man are gone, as well as a substantial part of the money that he originally put into the holding.  That is not free sale.  If you are going to destroy free sale, as certain as we are in this House not one penny is going into the improvements of the land of Ireland, and if it does not go into the improvement of the land of Ireland, not only will the people who live upon the land suffer, but the whole nation will suffer. Deputies are blinding themselves to facts if they do not face them.  There are people in this country and in high places who can make themselves believe what they want to believe.</P>

      <P>I do not want to have any argument or wrangle with Deputy Corry on the subject of fixity of tenure, free sale, or free rent.  I believe it is in the interests of the country to enable every small farmer to improve his holding.  I believe it will contribute to the national wealth. <Col N="634" /> I believe it will redound to the revenue and to the whole life of the country. I believe precisely what Michael Davitt and the Land Leaguers believed.  I believe that if our people are to be free to maintain their freedom you have to give them security in their means of livelihood&mdash;fixity of tenure and free sale on the land.  I am prepared to believe that Fianna Fáil robbed them of these things without realising what they were doing. If that be correct, then there is a chance of remedying the wrong.  I have no doubt that with good will we could arrive at an agreed basis between all Parties in this House upon which fixity of tenure and free sale were to be restored.  In that event I believe that a constitutional amendment would be carried practically without a single vote against it</P>
      <P>I seriously say to the Minister that it is of vital importance, not only to the economic future of the country, but to the peace and good government of the country, that that should be done.  He himself I know has had some anxious moments in regard to civil disturbances that have arisen here and there as a result of an attempt to grab a neighbour's holding. The Minister himself knows that at least on one occasion I did what I could to make an end to such activities, and with the collaboration of the Minister for Justice, freely and courteously given, it was possible to bring to an end an agitation which was giving rise to wholly undesirable violence and which was due to that section of the Land Act in relation to which the Potterton case was argued and decided.  The Minister himself knows that there were analogous cases in other parts of the country.  If that goes on great evil will accrue and I want to stop it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am prepared to admit now that in the situation in which we find ourselves we cannot get back to the pre-1923 decision and there is no use in battering one's head against a stone wall and lamenting that which is irretrievably gone.  It has gone and there is no use crying about it.  We have to get the next best thing and that is, having got sunk in a bog, to find dry land on which we can stand.  With good will, <Col N="635" /> that dry land can now be got.  If we do not get it, I am telling the Minister that he is going to sink deeper and deeper into a mess out of which nobody will be able to get him.</P>
    <P>I cannot emphasise too strongly and urgently the vital necessity of facing this issue and dealing with it.  There are other matters arising on this Bill, but they can be more appropriately dealt with in Committee.  The other matters I referred to now, because I think so deeply on the three F's.  I am profoundly convinced that they affect not only the interests of individual parties or individuals but the whole future of Ireland.  I do not propose to go beyond making a strong appeal to the Government to realise whither their policy of the promiscuous resumption of holdings will bring them, and to assure them that if they face this reasonably and responsibly, they need apprehend from this side of the House no embarrassing criticism, no unreasonable remonstrances, but cordial co-operation in finding some method on which we can all stand together to reassure the vast majority of the farmers living on the land that, from this day forward, no power on earth will have the right to take from them the homesteads from which they get their living.  We can still do much, and it will make an immense and a profound difference to the state of public peace, and to the mind of the agricultural community in general.  I am sincerely frightened by the prospect of what may develop if the present system continues.  I said that in regard to the economic situation, and I feel that I am justified, in saying now deliberately, that the powers of resumption at present vested in the Land Commission constitute a real menace to the public peace, in addition to the economic position, and I beg the Minister, in the face of that situation, to take counsel in his own Party and, if necessary, with us, to determine on an agreed basis upon which we can re-establish now and for all time free sale and fixity of tenure for small farmers.</P>

      <P>I am not going to put up with that from anybody.  Statements have been made here that Fianna Fáil and this Government have abolished security of tenure.  When and how?  I should like some Deputy to show under what Land Act security of tenure was abolished.  We were told that land is not a security for loans.  It is not. Why?  It is not because of anything the Land Commission has done. Deputies and the people of the country generally know that if banks try to sell farms on which there are mortgages there will not be one buyer.  That is well known.  It is common property to everyone that that is why land is not security with the banks.  There is no getting over that position.  That has been the case for a number of years. I remember having had to stand up in this House several years ago to protest against the Land Commission buying a holding from which a bank had got a tenant evicted.  That kind of security is not there now, and that is why banks will not advance money on holdings.  These are facts that no one can deny.  We heard talk about grabbers and emergency men in Fianna Fáil clubs.  I remember ex-Deputy Hassett's allusions to the manner in which he and other Deputies in the Party to which they belonged succeeded in getting land divided in County Tipperary, and I remember hearing of cross road meetings and as to whom was to get the land.  That is on the records of this House for any Deputy who wishes to read it.  I remember the scandal that was created <Col N="637" /> in County Tipperary when 360 acres of land were given to a district justice. That is the way Cumann na nGaedheal divided the land.</P>
      <P>We are facing a problem that does not affect the small holdings about which Deputy Dillon pretends to have such sympathy.  In my constituency there are four parishes that were grabbed and from which the original tenants were evicted.  These people are now on the hillsides with farms varying from 20 to 30 acres, and they are paying not only their own annuities and rates, but the annuities and the rates of the grabbers as well.  I challenge contradiction of that statement. It is to end that state of affairs that this Bill is before the House.  On the Foley Turpin and the Smyth estates arrears are due for eight or nine years, amounting to £1,700.  That money is being paid by the unfortunate people who were evicted and who are now living on farms of 20 or 30 acres. The people who owe these arrears have taken advantage of every flaw and every legal quibble that could be found in the Land Acts.  When the Land Commission proceeded to take over the Foley Turpin estate some years ago there was an objection, and the estate is still there waiting for this Bill before it can be acquired.  Meanwhile the ratepayers are paying the rates owing on it, and all the county council can get after the Land Commission has acquired it will be two years' rates.</P>

      <P>On the Rostellan Estate £1,760 is owing for rates, and is being paid at present by the unfortunate people on the hillsides.  They have to <Col N="638" /> pay in order that Deputy Dillon can throw his arms around Sir James Pope Hennessy and say: &ldquo;Here is an unfortunate hard-working farmer who is going to be evicted so that some land grabber out of a Fianna Fáil Club might get his land.&rdquo;  Did you ever hear of such hypocrisy on the part of any Deputy with any sense of responsibility? The position is nearly the same on the Flower Estate.  I think they paid fairly well.  On the Smyth Estate the arrears of rates amount to £480.  That is the position we are faced with down there.  There are 3,800 acres of land in one parish for which no rates have been paid for a number of years and for which no annuities have been collected for a number of years. They take advantage of all the legal quibbles that can be picked out by Deputies opposite.  Those are the people we are told about, the hard-working, honest farmers who are to be kept in their holdings with Deputy Dillon's mantle thrown over their shoulders.  If anyone looks crooked at them he is a grabber or an emergency man.  I, for one, will do all I can to put people in there and I defy anybody to call me a grabber or an emergency man.  If he does he will get his answer damn quickly.</P>
      <P>I intend to see these holdings divided as long as God gives me strength and a good right arm.  I will see that the men from the hills are brought back and put into the holdings their ancestors were driven out of, and I will make no apology to anyone for doing it.  This piece of legislation will finish the job, and it has been long enough in the finishing. I do not think any Deputy with a sense of responsibility could say that the unfortunate men with 20 or 30 acres, rearing their families and slaving from morning till night, should pay, in addition to their own rates and annuities, the rates and annuities on those holdings from which their fathers before them were evicted.</P>

      <P>You will get over it.  We are going to see that the land is taken over and that the objections they succeeded in raising, objections that prevented the land being taken over, will now be removed.  This thing has gone too far, and it is unjust and unfair to the working farmer.  Deputy Dillon has been throwing his mantle over those people.  I saw them marching four deep in processions; they were known as the New Land League and the Tates, the Smyths, and the Flowers were there.  I do not think there was ever a Land League brought into being to keep these people in possession of 600, 800 or 1,000 acres.  I do not think any responsible Deputy would stand for their continued possession of so much land.  Year after year these estates have been dragged into court, and there was no chance of getting over the technicalities.  This Bill will settle all that, and I hope it will baffle the lawyers.</P>
      <P>We hear talk about land grabbing. Deputy Lynch made a point in connection with the sale of a holding to another man.  There are lots of what are known as fake sales.  I have a very definite instance which occurred in a portion of my constituency recently.  A gentleman there found himself served with a notice by the Land Commission that they wanted to acquire portion of his holding.  He sold it to another man. There is no need in this country for taking over any land that is being worked properly.  There is no occasion to go to the man with 100 acres or 50 acres, provided he is working it.  If Deputy Broderick would only speak, he could tell us that there are between 3,000 and 4,000 acres lying between my house and his house, and it could be taken over without anybody crying salt tears.  It would undoubtedly relieve congestion there if that land were taken over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The land is there waiting to be taken over, but what can you do with these people?  I saw one old damsel, who has 700 acres and owes us between £700 and £800 in rates, coming before a board of inquiry and kicking up the dickens of a row because an unfortunate labourer was going to get one acre of it on which to erect a house.  She <Col N="640" /> opposed it tooth and nail.  &ldquo;Why should an acre of her land be taken?&rdquo; She knew that the £30 or £35 she would be paid for the acre would be collared by us for the rates.  Deputies over there have taken the line, first, that we abolished fixity of tenure&mdash;we did not&mdash;and, secondly, that on account of fixity of tenure being abolished, the banks will not give any more loans.  I have given the reason why the banks will not give loans.</P>

That is why the banks will not advance money on land, because the banks know very well that no matter what they do they cannot realise.  There is a lot of talk about security of tenure.  I should like some Deputies opposite to point out when did Fianna Fáil abolish security of tenure, and in what way.</P>

      <P>The position is that there is no prevention whatsoever of free sale.  Neither is there any attempt by the Land Commission to acquire land that is being worked in a fair way.  I have not seen it in my constituency. If there are Cork Deputies who know to the contrary, let them say so.  I doubt very much if Deputy Dillon will get one follower in his attitude towards these people.  I do not see why certain people should be <Col N="641" /> protected on their 500, 600 and 700-acre farms, from which the people have been cleared out and who now have to live on the hillsides and have to pay, not only their land annuities, but their rates also.  I do not think there is very much further to say in this connection, but I should certainly like to hear some Deputy over there tell us when the 60 years' tenure should stop.  In my own constituency I saw, as I am sure other Deputies there also saw, men being evicted, between the years 1923 and 1932, if they could not pay their annuities.  If a man did not pay his annuity the Land Commission came down and just put him out.  That was all there was to it&mdash;out he went.  Of course, the Land Commission must get their annuities for their holdings.</P>

      <P>I can name several people who were evicted between 1922 and 1932 for the non-payment of their annuities. I can name quite a number of them, and there was no economic war going on at that time.  However, that is the position as I view it, Sir, and I can see no justification whatever for the arguments that have been put up here with regard to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few points that I should like to make, Sir, in connection with this Bill. Firstly, I would appeal to the Minister to have regard to the point raised by Deputy Lynch as to applying Part III of the Land Act to certain cases all over the country where an existing land annuity on a fee farm grant obtains, seeing that they do get the benefit of Part III of the Land Act of 1933.  I am aware of a fairly large number of cases, and although the Land Commission has authority to fix a fair rent, keeping in mind the valuation or the capacity of the land to carry a new annuity, at the same time the new annuity, if Part III of the Land Act does not apply to it, will be more than the tenants on these particular holdings will be able to carry. Now, the difficulty here is that if we <Col N="642" /> do not raise the matter at this particular time, we cannot move an amendment to the Bill because it would be considered to be a charge upon the Exchequer and, therefore, would be out of order.  For that reason, I appeal to the Minister to consider these cases. There are not very many and it would not be a very heavy charge on the Exchequer, whereas it would be a great benefit and would be of the utmost importance so far as concerns these unfortunate creatures who have existed on these farms, at a bare subsistence level, for a great number of years.</P>
      <P>Now, the question of the necessity of this Bill has been very clearly put, and it seems to me that nearly every Deputy who spoke has congratulated the Land Commission and the Minister upon this explanatory memorandum that has been circulated.  I must say that that memorandum is very well done.  I think that it is a very good idea and that it should be continued, and I think it should lessen considerably the discussion upon the Second Reading of this Bill.  There is, however, a question to be considered. I must confess that I do not know how you are going to get over it.  Deputy Corry has spoken about the 300-acre, 700-acre and 800-acre farms.  Now, nobody on these benches, or anywhere else, is going to defend farms of that kind which are not being utilised in the proper way.  If a farm of 100, 200, 400 or 600 acres is being left practically derelict and not being used properly, nobody in this House would dream of defending its retention by the present owner when one knows that ten, 20 or 30 families could be reared on a farm of that type and get a tip-top livelihood out of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here, however, is a question which does require attention.  In certain districts in the country a farm of even 40 acres is regarded as a big farm, and is even considered as a ranch, and if a man decides to put up one of these farms for sale in such a district, where there is a certain amount of congestion, an agitation immediately springs up for the acquisition of that land, and the result is that that farmer cannot sell it. I have known of cases in the County Longford of farms of land that were <Col N="643" /> purchased for £2,000 or £3,000 originally that have been sold recently for as little as £700.  In one particular case which has come to my definite knowledge, and in connection with which I am aware of the full facts&mdash; similar things happened in other cases, but I cannot vouch for them&mdash;a farm of land was put up for sale.  Now, I do not say that this was confined to the Fianna Fáil club, because there is no doubt that there were Fine Gael people concerned also.  Members of both Parties were mixed up in this, but that does not make the thing right.  At any rate, an agitation was started for the acquisition of a certain 60-acre farm, and when it was put up, nobody would bid for it, and the secretary of the Fianna Fáil club bought it the following week at a knock-down price.  I know that such things happened in other cases, but I cannot prove these cases.  This, however, is a case in connection with which I can give proof.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to what Deputy Dillon has said, I should like to give my interpretation of his remarks.  Of course, I may misinterpret him, and I think, Sir, that you have ruled that I cannot even interpret him in certain circumstances.  I think, however, that what Deputy Dillon is concerned with is the farmer who has put his money into a moderately-sized farm of, let us say, 100 acres, 150 acres, or even 200 acres.  My interest, however, is with the 30-acre, 40-acre or 50-acre farm, and I think that there should be no doubt as to the right of free sale for that farm.  In certain districts, however, as I say, a 40-acre farm is regarded as a ranch.  It is quite natural that, where the average size of the farms is six acres, eight acres or ten acres, a 40-acre farm would be regarded as a ranch and there would be an immediate demand for it.  I know that the Land Commission does not take it, but the price of the farm has been whacked down or broken down, so to speak.  I do not know how you can get over the problem.  It is a problem for which I cannot offer a solution, but there is some force in the point that the Government should get into a position in which they would see that a certain acreage or a certain valuation of a <Col N="644" /> farm was positively and definitely exempted.  If that could be done, I think we would get somewhere; or, at least, have some security of tenure; because, notwithstanding anything to the contrary that may be said, this Bill gives power, for the relief of congestion, to take small farmers out of a district and put them into another district no matter what may be the size of the holdings.  Even though the people might get better holdings elsewhere, they would rather stay in the districts where they have been long-rooted.  In these circumstances, I think it might be all to the good if they were changed, but, at the same time, it is an authority that the Land Commission would have to use with discretion.</P>
    <P>I do not like the idea of naming individual estates in this House where people are publicly charged&mdash;as they have been here this evening&mdash;with owing land annuities and rates.  They have no opportunity of defending themselves here and the privileged position that members of the Government and members of all Parties occupy in this House should not be availed of to make charges.  I think that it should not be developed at any rate.</P>
    <P>There is a crying need, in my opinion, for the further acquisition of certain farms and I know that the Land Commission cannot proceed without some such authority as this, but it is a very difficult matter to know where to draw the line.  Therefore, the House and the country have to depend upon the integrity, ability and impartiality of the Land Commission in dealing with these cases. Rightly or wrongly, there is the feeling throughout the country&mdash;I admit unjustly&mdash;that the Land Commission are influenced to a very great extent by Government activity and that, in particular, if an agitation is started in a district by a semi-I.R.A.-cum-Fianna Fáil Club and they insist that some farm of land should be taken, no matter what the merits are, there is a feeling that the Government is behind that, that the land cannot be bid for by anybody and that it must go by default.  As I pointed out in connection with some other matters, that, in my opinion, is immoral in the sense <Col N="645" /> that it is taking the value of the land from those who are lawfully and justly entitled to have it and taking the farmer's life savings and perhaps the savings of his people for generations and giving very small compensation.</P>
    <P>We know perfectly well that in this country to-day there are three valuations for land: there is the land valuation for estate duty purposes which is considerable; there is the open market valuation; and then there is the Land Commission valuation.  There are three distinct valuations.  When a farmer dies, if he has willed his farm to a nephew or anybody, there is immediately estate and succession duty payable on it and on that the Revenue Commissioners immediately value the land.  It is providential that they are not the purchasers for the Land Commission or they would soon stop land purchase.  Then, as I say, there is the market valuation and then the Land Commission valuation.</P>
    <P>I think there should be some means of getting a fair valuation of land for Land Commission purposes because when people are acquiring land they are getting something that is of value and they should pay a reasonable price for it.  While I am anxious that they should not be overloaded, a reasonable price should be paid to the vendor for the land and, if necessary, the State should bear a substantial loss upon the resale.  I notice that there is authority taken for that in the Bill but to establish or maintain the value of land or the security that land may be for credit there should be some definite system of valuation by which it could be shown what land would be worth in certain circumstances if and when acquired by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Again, I wish to compliment the Minister and those responsible for this memorandum.  I think if Deputies keep it in mind and go through it carefully it may considerably shorten the whole debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Land Act of 1933 was going through this House, on the First Reading, I referred to what has been repeatedly referred to in this particular debate&mdash;the three F's.  At that particular period I ventured to prophesy that the Government would <Col N="646" /> destroy what were commonly called the three F's in vesting themselves with the powers which could be named in another set of F's&mdash;fleece, filch and forfeit.  I believe that subsequent events substantiate the fears I expressed in my opening remarks on that particular Bill.  During the passage of that Bill several points were raised. We are asked now that we should raise several points on the Committee Stage of this Bill as we did then.  Many of the doubts we expressed of various sections and many of the amendments which we moved and which were not accepted were met always by the Minister who was in charge of the Bill at that particular time with the retort that none of the provisions were meant to apply in the way we indicated.  It has happened that almost every one of them has applied in the manner we feared.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry and other Deputies said that things had not happened, that farmers' land had not been endangered.  Every Deputy in this House knows that it has.  I do not care from what part of the House he comes, every Deputy knows that that is a fact.  The Deputy who smiles at me knows just as well as I do.  Deputy Meaney knows it full well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>And the members of the Labour Party know that it has happened that farms of even 100 acres have been endangered under the operations of the Act.  Deputy Corry tried to defend it.  He said the Government did not institute the resumption of farmers' holdings.  Perhaps they did not. Perhaps the 1933 Act did not give the Government all the powers we said it gave.  Perhaps there were some of those powers in existence before.  But, there was a limit to the powers contained in the previous Acts.  If there is any proof that it was the 1933 Act which gave these powers it is that until the 1933 Act came into operation there was no general fear in the minds of tenant holders that there was going to be any interference with their title or with their sales.  It was only subsequent to the 1933 Act that these fears <Col N="647" /> entered into the minds of even the average sized tenant farmer in this country, and his fears were justified.</P>
      <P>One has begun to be timorous of any Land Act that has been brought into this House in the last few years.  I certainly am.  We have here a Bill of 58 sections.  It would be impossible to go through all these sections.  As many Deputies have said, I do not think it would be advisable to do so at this stage.  Anyhow, they will be gone into fully, I hope, on the Committee Stage. The introduction of this Bill is proof that the 1933 Act and subsequent Acts did not even achieve all that was desired by the Government in regard to the acquisition of land.</P>
      <P>Many of the sections in this Bill are admittedly meant to make the acquisition of land easier.  Any ameliorating circumstances in favour of the tenant owner that were in the 1933 Act, if there were any such, are going to be put in danger by this Bill.  I could name several sections where there is discrimination between the treatment the tenant is going to get and the treatment the Land Commission is to be entitled to get.  Yet Deputies will get up and say that this is a fair Bill.  I, for one, am against anything that furthers the resumption of tenant-owned land, land that has already been purchased and requisitioned.  One would say that the owners would at least have a reasonable security of living on their land, of working it and passing it on to those who came after them.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry referred to some large estates: that is only drawing a load of red herrings across the track.  No one can have any sympathy when land has been farmed so badly that the farmer is not in a position to pay rates and owes £500 or £600 in rates, which he is making no attempt to pay.  No Deputy would have sympathy with a farmer of that kind; such a man has no right to own land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>But, generally speaking, the ordinary farmer makes an <Col N="648" /> attempt to work his land in the way in which he thinks is right.  He purchased his land, under one Act or another, on terms which he thought reasonable, and he has a right to enjoy the land, and should not be hampered by any legislation in a free country like this. There is a limit to which we can go in the acquisition of land.</P>
      <P>One thought that when the landlords had been bought out and when certain other sections who did not farm their land properly had been interfered with, there would be a lessening in the tendency to encroach on legitimately owned farmer's land. It must end sometime.  There must be some finality in legislation, or are we to expect a new Bill in two or three years' time, with another 58 or 60 sections?  Is that the condition in which farmers will live, that what is not drastic enough will be made more drastic in a few years?  Is there going to be successful farming under those conditions?  Of course there is not!</P>
      <P>Somebody said that the banks had other reasons for refusing credit.  If they had, I do not know of them.  Some of us got big loans from the banks in years previous to eight or ten years ago.  Every farmer who wanted money could get it.  He could not get it now. On 100 acres of land he would not get a solitary copper that he could jingle on a tombstone.  There is not a Deputy on this side of the House or on the other side of the House, or on the Independent or Labour Benches who does not know that.  Land is no security, but if credit has been killed the desire of holders of middle-sized farms to improve them has not been killed.  The fear of resumption is hanging over the head of every decent farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would have thought that, if there was any sincere desire to amend legislation in the direction of improving the lot of the ordinary farmer, it would have been to amend the 1933 Act and the 1936 Act on the lines of allaying the fears that the farmers had. However, no attempt has been made by the Minister in this Bill, or in any other Bill, to preserve the right of ownership of land.  There is no chance of free sale and of a fair price for his <Col N="649" /> land if it is resumed.  And, mark you, if the latter was given, much of the objection to the previous Bill would have gone by.  Even if there was no resumption, even if free sale remained, if there was a free, fair market value such as we were guaranteed by word of mouth by the Minister who passed the 1933 Act through this House, then practically all the fears that are in the farmers' hearts would be abolished. But no attempt has been made to do that, and every Deputy knows that the Land Commission never gives the market value.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin said that there were three values on land.  There is the Revenue Commissioners' value, the market value and the Land Commission's valuation, which is the lowest of all.  I would suggest to the Land Commission that if they cannot agree with an owner in assessing a fair valuation, they should borrow the valuation methods of the Revenue Commissioners and follow them, and there would be very few objections amongst the farmers to that valuation.  But the Government will not do that.  It has been candidly admitted by backers of the Government Party that if they are going to give land at a fair rate to people to whom they propose to allot it, it will be impossible to give a fair price to the present holder.  That has been admitted.  Is not that a dangerous admission&mdash;an admission of injustice&mdash;for any person to have to make in this State where the main industry is farming, that it is impossible to give a fair value for land if a fair rent is to be put on the subsequent allottees?  I have said before that land division might come to be one of the best social services if it is properly administered; and I say that that cannot be accomplished without spending money.  There is money being spent now on social services and similarly you cannot put people on the land without spending money.  It is worth it and the money ought to be spent, but it must not be spent on the principle that it is going to be spent on new congested areas because they are congested, as most of the small plots that are being allotted at present are not sufficient to make a farmer.</P>
    <P>One must pay the piper: one must <Col N="650" /> pay the owner an honest, decent market price, and, if you do that, much of the objections&mdash;all of the objections that I have&mdash;to land division will disappear. However, there is no attempt made to meet any of the objections, and we are asked to smilingly pass this Bill of 58 sections, most of which is directed to giving the Land Commission or the Minister, and everybody else concerned, greater powers to interfere with the present proprietors of land in this country.  I, for one, shall not give my vote in favour of this Bill without very serious consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am rather surprised at the Bill, first of all, at the land policy, and at the course this debate has taken.  There was a time when I felt very strongly that to make any progress when we became a nation, we should take full responsibilities of nationhood.  When I saw certain things happening I cooled off in that opinion. I never felt that opinion more strongly than I felt it this evening.  I think it has been disastrous to this country that when we set up a Parliament here we did not set up an Irish banking system.  If we had, all the cod that has been talked this evening could not have been attempted.  I wonder has anybody ever thought of what is to back the pound note that we have in our pockets?  Is it the division of land, is it the taking of land off one section and giving it to another at a big expense to the State?</P>
      <P>It has been stated here this evening that certain large farmers are not able to make a success of large farms, and that they have been allowed to run into arrears for rates and annuities.  Why is that?  What has the Land Commission been doing?  Why did it not sell them out?  What has the county council been doing that it did not sell them out for the rates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Deputy sell them out in County Dublin?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have decrees against them, and we have registered mortgages against them, and when that land is cashed, these are first claims against it.  When the land referred to <Col N="651" /> here is cashed, only two years' rates can be recovered.  There is nothing in this Bill to enable more to be recovered.  What has the Government Party done?  By its policy in the last seven or eight years it has robbed agriculture, and now it wants to come in to carry out the further looting of the farmers.  The acid test is when you go into the open market to get money.  That was done a few weeks ago with the backing of the Government, and the money was not got.  Will Deputies think for a moment of the serious position confronting this country?</P>
      <P>It has been stated here, and nobody has contradicted it&mdash;and nobody can contradict it&mdash;that on agriculture alone there is not a joint stock bank in the country that will lend £100.  I challenge contradiction of that.  Not a member of the House will contradict it.  How can it be otherwise?  There is not a farmer holding land in this country who has a cast-iron title to it. The Land Commission can take land from any man, and take it according to law.  That policy has been extended by the present Government, but my recollection of the 1923 Land Act is that the principle of acquiring land already the subject of loans by the Land Commission was never violated until the 1923 Land Act came along, and was, in fact, violated by that Act.  I think that is true, but no matter by whom it was violated, in order to have stability in this country, or in any country, you must have security of tenure.  We have not got it, and we have no financial stability in this country.  A loan with the backing of the Government here a few days ago was not half subscribed.  Will the Government sit up and take notice of that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been stated from different benches here that certain objections would be withdrawn if a limit were set.  I do not agree with that.  I do not agree with setting a limit.  The ordinary revenue is putting a sufficient brake on land holdings in this country. There is a point beyond which it would not pay any man to own further land.  It is put on by income-tax and <Col N="652" /> surtax.  A point is reached when it will not pay a land owner to own any more land, even if he got it for nothing. When a man is paying 10/- or 12/- to the Revenue every year, when he has to look at his labours and say to himself, &ldquo;I have to work seven or eight months for the Government,&rdquo; he is going to slow down.  If he does not, there is something wrong with his upper storey.  There is no need to put on a brake, and with regard to how the land should be worked, that is the responsibility, and it should be the mark of the efficiency of the Government in devising an agricultural policy that will make it profitable for a man to work his farm in the way which is most valuable to the community, and to do, by inducement, what the community requires and what, in the opinion of the Government, is best for the community.  There is no need for compulsion.</P>
    <P>Is it not extraordinary that land is acquired and given to people who know nothing about the working of it? Take an industrial worker in the city of Dublin who wants a house.  Is there anybody who will provide him with a house?  He will get a house, and he will get a loan to purchase that house provided he has a percentage of the money himself.  The acid test in regard to settling people on the land and to settling the right type of people on the land is: acquire your land, and where the allotment costs £400, let the man who will put down 20 per cent. of that sum get his allotment.  Then you can put the people on the land without any cost to the country.  Why is that not done? Are there not many workers, many men, labouring men whom I know myself, to-day in possession of farms which by their own savings and industry they bought in the open market?  There is no danger of those men being broken, but I should like the Minister to take a census of the land distributed at a big loss to the State in the last six or seven years. How much of it is at present let on the 11 months' system?  Is that farming? Is that what you want?  The greatest danger to this country is its present credit position.  There is not <Col N="653" /> an economic activity which is not at gasping point at the moment.  The building trade is idle.  Deputy Allen laughs at that, as if it were a joke.</P>

I can tell Deputy Allen and the Government that they now have had a six months' holiday which they never had before, but they are not paid for that holiday.  Let Deputy Allen laugh at that, and I will send to the Deputy the next Wexford man who comes to me looking for a job.  He will not laugh at that, I bet you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been mentioned here that economic holdings should be defined. How can one define an economic holding?  How would one define an economic holding during the economic war?  The whole country was uneconomic then.  An economic holding has been aptly described by a very able man writing on this question of land settlement and land purchase as depending entirely on land situated on the track of trade.  One could imagine 100 acres of land that would not be an economic holding, and one could imagine a comparatively small farm that would be an economic holding.  An economic holding largely depends upon the efficiency of the Government in <Col N="654" /> office, and upon the manner in which that Government handles the economic situation.</P>
    <P>A tribute has been paid here to the work of the Congested Districts Board. That board set about adding to the size of holdings so as to make them economic.  I know several holdings of five, six, and eight acres of land made by the present Government.  I would like to put it to the Minister is he not creating during his term of office a congests' problem for his successor? If there is going to be a division of land let it be a division of land to give a man a fair chance of a living on the land, not something in which he will have a leg on the farm and a leg on something else.  I cannot see how anybody can reasonably deny that fixity of tenure has gone by the board. Deputy Dillon referred to the three F's.  The three F's. are a tribute to the old Land League Party for having perceived the essentials on which national stability can alone be raised.</P>
    <P>Land is the most important asset we have.  The agricultural industry is the industry of this country and every industry in order to be able to command respect and to command credit must be stabilised.  Is the agricultural industry, that has lost what the three &ldquo;F's&rdquo; stood for, in a stable condition?  Of course, it is not.  Go to the banks. How much money will they advance on the agricultural industry?  Instability in the agricultural industry caused by the abolition of those three &ldquo;F's&rdquo; has destroyed the credit of the agricultural industry.  This being an agricultural country, that loss of credit is reflected in the loans that we have unsuccessfully tried to float.  The position is very serious and it all comes back to the land.</P>
    <P>Again, I would emphasise that settlers on the land cannot be selected by political clubs of any brand.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health in financing house purchase did not say that the houses would be built at the expense of the Government and handed out promiscuously to the nominees of any political organisation. He laid it down by statute, and he was most conservative in his views, that loans would be granted if <Col N="655" /> the applicants for the loans put down a certain percentage of the purchase price.  There is no other way that will be of permanent use or benefit to anybody except giving the land to applicants who can put down at least 20 per cent. of the value of the holding, the remaining 80 per cent to be paid by way of an annuity.  It is only then that the Government can go on with its land division.  Now, I am discussing distribution.  Distribute the land to those who will put down 20 per cent. of what the land and the buildings will have cost the Land Commission to acquire, improve, and so on.  The man who will put down 20 per cent. of his holding will not do it unless he knows something about agriculture. Such a man is going to set his teeth into his job, take off his coat and work that land.  As against that you get the political adventurer who will get a bit of land and will not work it, but use it on the eleven months' system, as many of them are doing at present.  It is a cod to give land to people who do not work it.  These people are only waiting for an opportunity to cash in on it. That should be stopped.  Another thing also that should be stopped are those fellows who were brought up from the country and given 30/- a week.  These fellows sleep their brains out at the public expenses, until 1 o'clock in the day.  The subsidies to these people should be stopped.</P>
    <P>A Bill to amplify previous Bills was, I suppose, necessary.  But in a Land Bill I suppose it is justifiable to have a discussion on land policy generally, and on the details of the Bill generally. But some of these points have more to do with the Committee Stage than with the Second Reading Stage.  My general remarks are on the general land policy. I am as convinced, as a man can be convinced of anything, that one man who will pay 20 per cent. to acquire a holding is a better acquisition to the State than 100 men who will get holdings for nothing.  I am quite sure the Minister is anxious to do some permanent good when he is acquiring land and parcelling it out.  My advice to him is to seek powers through this House so that the division of land will <Col N="656" /> be carried through by him without loss to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I wonder does the Minister consider how far he can go as to the credit position and as to the backing of our paper money.  Has the Minister thought of the one essential to nationhood that we are afraid to take up in this country&mdash; namely, the control of our credit and banking?  This Government is absolutely afraid of doing that, though they will mouth and shout about republicanism.  This is one of the essentials of republicanism, and yet they funk it.  If they took it up, their economic war would not last a month, and their land policy would not last two months, because they would be up against maintaining the credit of the paper £.  We are up against it now.  It is time for us to sit up and take notice so as to see that the national expenditure will be within the national income.  We are up against the time when the national income, both seen and unseen, will be less than our expenditure, and then the danger signal will be visible to everybody.  I do not think I have any more to say on the measure at this stage, but there will be quite a lot to be said on it in the Committee Stages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, as we gather from the Minister, and from Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, is simply a Bill to amend the existing law.  It has introduced no new principle.  But, listening to the Opposition for the last three hours, and listening to Deputy Belton, one would imagine it was quite a revolutionary Bill altogether, and that none of the principles of the Bill had ever been heard of in this House up to now, whereas we know, as Deputy Belton has admitted, that the same principle has been in operation since the 1923 Land Act was introduced here by the late Minister for Agriculture.  That same principle that Opposition Deputies now object to has been in operation since 1923.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has admitted that there was no principle involved whatever in the Bill that had not been already accepted by this House and by the country in the last two general elections.  That issue was challenged by the Opposition at two general elections&mdash;the issue whether farmers had been deprived of <Col N="657" /> the right of free sale and fixity of tenure&mdash;and the people pronounced judgment upon it.  There is a lot of talk about the farmer's credit.  It is said that his lack of credit is due to the Land Act of 1923, or the Land Act of 1933.  Does any member of the Opposition believe that?  For purely political propagandist purposes they state that day by day, knowing that there is not a word of truth in it.  In the county I come from, every farm divided by the Land Commission during the last five years was offered to the commission and not compulsorily acquired.  These were farmers which the owners wanted to dispose of for one reason or another, and they were not sold by auction, but were offered to the Land Commission because the Land Commission gave better prices than could be got in the open market.  I know that very well, and other Deputies know it also.  There is no proof that the provisions of the Land Act of 1923 or 1933 affect the farmer's credit one iota.</P>

Deputies just make that suggestion for political purposes.  Although they say they are interested in the farmer's credit, they are doing more injury to the farmer's credit by that sort of talk than anything else is doing.  Deputies know quite well that the question of agricultural land as security for loans goes back much farther than the 1923 Act or the 1933 Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It goes back to long before your time or my time.  Everybody knows, whether he cares to admit it or not, that this question of land as security for loans has its roots in the land agitation of about 100 years ago. Fortunately or unfortunately, land has never really been a negotiable security in this country.  Why that is so we cannot tell.  The banks lent money freely at the end of the last war&mdash;to their own grief and the grief of the people who got the money.  Is not that true?  There is no use in going on and talking about the Land Acts affecting the farmer's credit.  That is more calculated to injure the farmer's credit than anything else.  Deputy Belton has admitted that, even if that provision were taken out of the Land Act, the farmers would not get a shilling more from the banks than they have been getting for the last ten years.</P>

Deputies know quite well that the Land Commission are not going to acquire the land of the farmers and that the farmers have security of tenure.  When it suits them, Deputies make these statements for political purposes.  They do not care a straw.  It does not affect them very much.  This Government is here in a sound position and is going to remain here for the full term of office.  In two general elections, you got a full opportunity to persuade the farmers that they had no fixity of tenure and they repudiated you.  At by-elections, the question was also <Col N="659" /> raised.  I remember fighting a by-election at which my friend Deputy Keating tried to persuade the farmers that they had not security of tenure.

      <P>I wish Deputies on the other side would deal seriously with a serious matter.  Many amendments have been made to legislation for the improvement of the land code.  My only objection to this Bill is that the Minister did not see fit to embody all these amendments to legislation since the Act of 1923 in one Bill, so that <Col N="660" /> people would understand clearly what the law was.  The putting of this Bill into operation will cost the country a great deal of money, and will be damaging to the credit of the country because of the costs lawyers will get out of the measure for interpretation. The land law is so mixed that the lawyers will get more out of it than the class to which Deputies have been objecting.

      <P>I wanted to ask the Minister a question regarding tithes. Tithes have been a burning question in one area in my county, and they are also being agitated in many other areas.  I do not see the necessity for the word &ldquo;tithes&rdquo; now at all.  Like other matters in land law, they have their roots in the far-distant past when they were not very popular.  If it is necessary to collect these moneys, why not consolidate them with the annuities and collect them in that way?  It is now proposed to halve the tithes which were not halved before.  I think all tithes should be consolidated with the annuities, and be collectable in that way.  If that were done, we should <Col N="661" /> have finished with the word &ldquo;tithes&rdquo; for ever.  I think that that could be quite easily done.  I do not see any objection to it.</P>

      <P>The Minister will tell you that they have the same right to collect them as they have to collect annuities.  I do not know.  I am not capable of forming a judgment on that matter, but if there is that right, they should collect them as annuities and have them consolidated with the annuities.  I would ask the Minister to consider that one point.  I hope we have finished and done with this question of land as a negotiable security. Land is just as much a negotiable security to-day as it was at any time for the past five, ten, twenty or thirty years.  I live amongst farmers, and mingle as much with them as any Deputy on the opposite side, and I have never yet heard a single farmer complain that he could not get credit from the banks because of the operation of the land law.  I say that honestly, and I am as much in touch with farmers, some of whom support Deputies on the opposite side, as they are.  Not a single farmer has ever complained to me that because of the land law in operation he has been refused credit in the bank.  I have yet to meet a farmer to tell me that his credit has failed in the bank or that he failed to get credit in the bank because of the land laws that are in operation.</P>

I hope this ramp that has been going on will end, and end forever more.  If there is merit in this Bill let it be supported, but if there is opposition to it let that opposition be genuine.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish Deputy Allen knew of some of the cases of which I am personally aware in which land was taken over during the past four or five years.  I might mention one case, the case of a lady whose sister is a nun. She had 200 acres and on that she borrowed £1,000 to pay over to the convent.  The Land Commission eventually took over the farm and when everything was paid, when the £1,000 had been repaid to the bank, the lady had nothing to get for the farm.  I know of another farm of 90 Irish acres and all the owner got was bonds for £90.  If Deputy Allen states that the land was not value for the money which these people paid for it long ago, why is it that the banks advanced so much on the land?  Why did the bank advance £1,000 to the lady whose case I have mentioned?  Why is it that the bonds are paid over to the bank and that the owners get nothing?  Because the banks knew that the land was worth the money when they advanced these loans.  The high-falutin' talk of the Deputy does not mean anything.  I wish Deputy Allen would go down to Wexford and publish in the local papers his statement that the people would sooner sell their lands to the Land Commission than put them up for sale in the open market.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lynch and Deputy MacEoin mentioned the position of people under fee farm grants, and stated that small farmers who would be buying out under the Act would be victimised.  I want to bring before the Minister the case of a few large holders in the country who are placed in similar circumstances.  I know the case of one farm for which £6,000 was given in 1883.  A few years ago the Land Commission started negotiations to take over that farm. It has not been taken over yet, but the price offered is only £3,000.  There is a rent on that farm to the Land Commission, and there is also the fee farm rent, and the niece of the original owner, or the person who owns the farm at present will only get about £50 for this farm, which cost £6,000 in 1883.  The case of Mrs. Connolly which was mentioned was somewhat similar.  There are numerous other farms which the Land Commission proposes to take over, and the owners will get practically nothing after the landlord of the fee farm grant is paid and the Land Commission annuity has been redeemed.  I would ask the Minister to see that such land will be taken over on terms which will ensure that the owner of the land will at least get some fair recompense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think something also should be done to facilitate the free sale of land. At present if a farm of 40 or 50 acres <Col N="664" /> which is non-residential is put up for sale, no one will buy it, because immediately an agitation is started to have it taken over by the Land Commission. The Land Commission does not take it over, with the result that the farm lies unsold on the owner's hands.  Deputy MacEoin mentioned a case where the secretary of a Fianna Fáil club had bought such a farm.  I know of another case where a lady put 50 acres up for sale.  An agitation immediately sprang up, and there was a demand sent into the auction that the land was required for division.  One of the men responsible for the agitation bought it a week afterwards at a knock-down price.  I think there should be some system under which, if an agitation of that kind were started, the Land Commission would announce there and then whether it was their intention to take over the farm, or else they should send down a representative to the auction to bid for the land at the market value.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>They should send down Mr. O'Neil.  He must be out of a job now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not matter who would be sent down.  There may be many people who wish to dispose of their land, who have debts to clear off and who want the money to clear off these debts.  The system which I suggest would be much fairer than the present method under which the Land Commission refuses to say for a considerable time whether they will take over the holding.  Again, I would suggest that when the Land Commission take over land, they should fix a fair price there and then and not compel so many people to come to the court to have a fair price fixed.  Day after day we see instances in which a farm is valued, say, at £1,000, and when the owners come to the court that value is increased to £1,500 or £2,000.  Why does not the valuer who is first sent down put a fair value on the land? If he did so, it would lead to better security for land owners and to better prices.  Generally, there is not much objection to the division of land.  The objection merely is that owners are not getting a fair price.  A number of people whom I know have been badly <Col N="665" /> victimised in this respect, during the last four or five years.  Perhaps they were left farms by their parents on which there had been mortgages.  As a result of the poor price which they were paid, they are now in the poorhouse.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned some time ago that he did not agree with the policy of giving land to small farmers' sons.</P>
      <P>You have, for instance, the case of an estate being divided in a district. In that district you have several small farmers, men with twenty, thirty, or forty acres.  They are not eligible to get any portion of that estate, although they may have a family of three or four sons.  They may have been in the district for generations, and yet the sons of those men cannot get any of that estate.  Indeed, they have to go to England or America.  I do not think that is right.  In such circumstances it is not fair to be bringing strangers into a district and giving them land that should properly be distributed amongst the sons of men who have been there all their lives.  Ultimately their fathers have to try to get a place for them in some other district.  They give the boys £100 or £200.  Surely, they would be the right type of people to give land to when an estate is being divided.  They would have the capital to make a fair start.</P>
      <P>In my county, also, you have in the case of land that has been divided within the last 10 or 12 years, men with small bits of land here and there. They may have got five acres in one part of the district and a similar amount in another part.  What I think the Land Commission should do in these cases is to give those men a compact holding when land in a district is available for division.  Concentrate on them and give them an economic holding instead of bringing strangers into the district.  You have a lot of that kind of thing in my county.  The people who have been there should be provided with suitable holdings and the Land Commission should concentrate their activities in that direction instead of bringing migrants from other counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion I hope the Minister <Col N="666" /> will take into account what I said about the fee farm grants.  I would also appeal to him to see that in future a fair price is paid for any land that is taken over.  I imagine that when this Bill goes through more land will be acquired and divided.  I hope that will not be done on the valuations that were made two or three years ago when, one may put it, &ldquo;land was down to nothing.&rdquo;  There should be a revaluation of land that was valued in 1935 or 1936.  I admit that a good many farms were not in a very prosperous looking conditions at that time.  The people who owned them had no heart to do anything.  They did not appear to be of much value.  In those circumstances I hope the Minister will send down a valuer to put a fair value on land before it comes under the operation of this measure.</P>

      <P>I desire to take the opportunity of congratulating the Minister on introducing this Land Bill which has been eagerly awaited by the people of the country ever since the decision was given in the Potterton case in 1931.  The measure will have the effect of clearing up any injustices that were done.  People who are eligible to get holdings when the distribution of land takes place are eagerly awaiting the passing of this Bill.  It will enable them to get some additional land, and thereby change the character of their present uneconomic holdings.  Others will be enabled to obtain accommodation plots and will thereby be put in a position to earn a decent livelihood for themselves and their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon this evening applied the terms of &ldquo;grabbers&rdquo; and &ldquo;emergency men&rdquo; to those who were eagerly awaiting the passing of this Bill and the division of land.  He said that the Fianna Fáil clubs were backing up those grabbers and those emergency men, and that the members of the Fianna Fáil Party were also assisting. He said, further, that it was his ambition to strangle such grabbers and such emergency men.  Well, if those people are grabbers and emergency men, then I am glad to be able to take my stand to-day in supporting this Bill which will enable them to <Col N="667" /> continue as grabbers.  Deputy Dillon, however, did not tell us who the real grabbers were.  He did not tell us about those who were evicting our people from the land, and who, before Fianna Fáil came into power, were granted large ranches of land by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government so that they might continue the old system of ranching.  Deputy Dillon, in an effort to destroy the effects of this Bill, or in an effort to win over support from the Government, thinks fit to-day to brand those people as grabbers: the people who were evicted from their holdings, who were driven back to the bogs and to the uneconomic patches to eke out a livelihood there, who were driven up the sides of the mountains, and who for years were forced to live in poverty on their uneconomic holdings.  Those people have now the hope that when this Bill is passed and comes to be operated, they will at last be able to secure a decent living for themselves.  When we think of all those people, of what they endured in the past, of the misery and the degradation that they suffered for years, is it any wonder that we should welcome this Bill on their behalf, that we should welcome it in the knowledge that it will bring a great measure of comfort to themselves and to their families?</P>
    <P>In the county that I represent we have numbers of uneconomic holders, landless men, and others who have been eagerly awaiting the introduction of this Bill.  They have reason to, because in 1935, when the Land Commission had acquired certain holdings and were proceeding to resume other holdings, and had arrived at the stage that the sale of the lands was almost complete, they found that the decision in the Potterton case prevented them from going further with their work.  The people who at that time thought they were within a few weeks of securing a holding have since been awaiting the introduction of this Bill to put matters right.  Therefore we have every reason to compliment the Minister on its introduction.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal about the three &ldquo;F.s&rdquo;.  We have been told that <Col N="668" /> this Bill will destroy fixity of tenure, free sale and fair rent.  We are told that it will destroy the security of the farmer.  But that has been the argument which has been used against every Land Act brought in here by Fianna Fáil.  It has been used against the 1933 Act and the 1936 Act.  Speakers from the Fianna Fáil Benches who have gone before me this evening have made it quite clear that, as far as the Land Acts passed by Fianna Fáil are concerned, the security of the farmer has not been destroyed.  We are told that the security of the man with 40 or 50 acres has been destroyed.  We are told that when this Bill becomes an Act the farmers with 40 or 50 acres will have no security in his holding.  It is quite obvious that there is no truth in that suggestion.  The Land Commission have not at any stage entered into proceedings for the resumption of a holding which the farmer was working according to the best methods of husbandry. There is no desire on the part of the Minister or on the part of the Land Commission to enter such Lands. We know it is their desire that such holdings should remain, and that they should be worked as the welfare of the nation demands.  If farms of 100 acres are so worked, and give the necessary employment, we are told by the Minister that they will not be interfered with except in very congested areas, when land of equal value and with the same facilities will be given to the owner.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon suggested that a maximum acreage should be guaranteed to the farmers, and that the Minister, when he is replying to this debate, should state the maximum number of acres he would be satisfied to leave to a farmer.  I feel that the maximum number of acres to be guaranteed would be the maximum number of acres that a farmer could conveniently work for the benefit of the people, for the benefit of the neighbourhood, and for the purpose of getting a decent livelihood for himself and his family.  Deputy Belton does not agree with Deputy Dillon.  He says that there should be no maximum, that there should be no minimum, that there should be no guarantee asked for.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="669" /> It is very hard for a Deputy on this side of the House to know exactly what the Opposition really mean. Judging from the few speeches to which we have listened this evening, there is a difference of viewpoint amongst the Opposition, but it appears that those who have already spoken are quite agreed that this Bill&mdash;although there are 58 sections in it&mdash;does not lend itself to a Second Reading speech; that it is more a Bill for discussion in Committee.  I have listened to debates on very many Bills in this House, and it has always been an indication of opposition to a Bill when the Opposition Party attacked the Bill on Second Reading.  This Bill has received the blessing of the first Leader of the Opposition who has spoken this evening. Other Deputies of minor importance in the Opposition will find it very hard to work up an agitation against it, seeing that the Leader has given it his blessing.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney was the first speaker, and he said that at this stage it was not possible to have an ordinary Second Reading speech on the Bill; that he felt that minor improvements or minor matters of that kind could be dealt with in Committee. That in itself, I think, is a justification for the Minister in the introduction of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In connection with this matter of free sale, we are told that if this Bill is passed the farmer will not be able to sell his land; that he will not be able to go into the market to sell his land; that he will not get a fair prices for it. It has been suggested that the farmers should be allowed to go to the open market, and that the Minister should bid for land in the open market. Deputy Fionan Lynch was of opinion that the Minister or the Land Commission should become an ordinary purchaser in the open market.  He gave us particulars of one case, which he himself knew, where the Land Commission stepped in when the sale had almost been completed.  He suggested that that was not fair, but told us that the matter was rectified afterwards.  Why should the Land Commission complete in the open market?  If that were to be the case, we would have the position that farmers who found it necessary to sell their lands would rush into the market, knowing that the Minister <Col N="670" /> or the agent of the Land Commission would be there to meet them.  All that would be necessary at that stage would be for the owner of the land to have a few men there to give bluff bids in order to run the price up.</P>
    <P>If the agent of the Land Commission purchased the land, it would be at a fabulous price, and the result would be that the annuity which would be placed upon the incoming tenant would be unbearable.  We would have the position that every farm purchased by the Land Commission would be secured at a fabulous figure.  To get over that difficulty we had Deputies of the Opposition this evening&mdash;I presume they could see that difficulty, although they did not disclose it&mdash;telling us that the Government should subsidise the farmer to some extent; that the Government should stand in with some of the purchase money.  If the Minister introduced legislation imposing extra taxation for the purpose of getting that extra money, we would find the very men who spoke in that strain this evening opposing any such legislation.</P>
    <P>It would be foolhardy to suggest that the Land Commission could secure land at reasonable rates in the open market. In cases in which the Land Commission have purchased land, there may be a few people who have suffered where fee farm grants were in existence. Others who have suffered in that way have more security on the holding, left to them.  But, generally speaking, the Land Commission have given a fair price.  Oftentimes the price has been fixed as the result of an appeal.  One thing I do hold is that the Land Commission have given a price that will enable the incoming tenant to have his holding at a reasonable annuity.  In effect, Opposition Deputies plead that there should be higher annuities charged to such people.  In fact, Deputy Belton went so far as to suggest that 20 per cent. of the cost of the holding should be paid by the incoming tenant.  That would have the effect of crippling the incoming tenant.</P>
    <P>It appears to me from the trend of speeches delivered by some of the Opposition Deputies, that that is the object they have in view&mdash;that 20 per cent. of the cost of the holding should <Col N="671" /> be put upon the incoming tenant. Then says Deputy Belton, &ldquo;Let him take off his coat and get to work.&rdquo; I suggest that there would be very little use in his taking off his coat so far as making a livelihood is concerned if he had to pay 20 per cent. of the purchase price of the holding. All his capital would be absorbed.  I know from people who have received holdings from the Land Commission, and if they were compelled to pay 20 per cent. of the purchase price they would have nothing left for stocking the land or securing implements which would enable them to go in for tillage farming or mixed farming, or whatever other system they propose to adopt. The position would be that when they paid the 20 per cent. they would have nothing left to work the farm, and we would find these people handing over their holdings to the Land Commission or, under Section 19 of this Bill, the Land Commission would take over the holdings from them.  That is not a thing which we want to see happening.</P>
    <P>We have been told that certain people who have secured holdings from the Land Commission since Fianna Fáil came into power have not been working these holdings.  We know that the percentage of such people is small, and is becoming smaller day by day.  But there are people who were allotted land before Fianna Fáil came into power who are not working the land either. You will always have a small percentage of people who, for some time at least, would not be able to work the land properly.  But I suggest that if you insist on their paying 20 per cent. of the purchase price, the most deserving cases will be ruled out, and the people who will secure land will not be able to work it.</P>
    <P>It has also been suggested that people who have got land within the last few years are only awaiting an opportunity to cash in upon such land. As far as my experience goes, that is not the case.  I do not know of one man in my constituency who applied for land in the hope that he could cash in upon it by selling it at the earliest possible date.  The Minister, in his <Col N="672" /> wisdom, has ensured that such people will not cash in.  We must remember that holdings will not be vested in the persons securing them for a certain length of time.  That is an assurance that such holdings will be worked in the best interest of the country, because otherwise they will be given to other people who will work them.  If it is pleaded that there is a want of security of tenure in such cases, I would admit it quite freely.  I do not think that anyone on these benches has at any time defended the principle that a man should get land and then allow it to become derelict.  We may differ upon the length of time that may be allowed to an allottee to make good upon his new holding, but we know that certain improvements have to be made, that implements have to be secured, and that certain expenditure, a possibly unforeseen expenditure, has to be undertaken.  We may, as I say, differ upon the length of time that should be allowed to such a person, but there is one thing we do not differ upon and that is, that after a stated period, possibly a considerable period, these people should be expected to work their holdings in the best interests of the country.</P>
    <P>We are told that the security of farmers in the banks had been weakened as a result of the operations of the Land Acts, and especially those passed by the Fianna Fáil Government. The Opposition, when speaking in that strain, should remember that there are what are known as &ldquo;frozen loans,&rdquo; and that for a period of years these loans have been a source of worry to Deputies and, I presume, to the Minister.  The security of the farmers is as good as ever it was, but the position is that the banks will not issue money because of the fact that, day after day, they are making representations to the farmers to reduce amounts due on old loans.  The far mers are unable to do so, and, unfortunately, many of them&mdash;perhaps more than the ordinary people realise&mdash;owe very considerable sums of money to banks.</P>
    <P>From 1919 until 1921 bankers went to farmers and asked them to take out <Col N="673" /> loans to improve their land, and to take advantage of the boom period to make fortunes.  I know farmers who when they went into the banks to get loans of £100 were told that that amount would be very little use, and that they should take £400 or £500 or £1,000.  Many people purchased farms at that time and have been unable to pay for them since.</P>

      <P>I think the Deputy knows as well as any other Deputy that large numbers of farmers owe considerable sums of money at present to the banks, and that these debts were incurred in the years I mentioned. Owing to the deflation of the £ people have been unable to pay interest on the money, much less to reduce the principal, and as a result bankers in many cases are prepared to accept any reasonable offer made to them.  It is because of that condition of affairs, and because bankers know that it will take farmers some time to get on their feet financially, that they will not advance money on loan now.  That has been my experience.  As far as The Land Acts are concerned they have not destroyed the security of farmers. It has been customary in Opposition speeches to suggest that members of Fianna Fáil clubs tell the Land Commission what land should be acquired and what land should not be acquired. The Land Commission do not need to <Col N="674" /> be told what land should or should not be divided.  There is a hard-working inspectorate attached to the Department, the members of which go around the country and make a survey of land available for acquisition and distribution, taking into account the congestion in different areas.</P>
      <P>If members of Fianna Fáil clubs remind the Land Commission that there is congestion in a district, or that certain lands are not being worked, I do not think any national harm is being done by such activities on the part of Fianna Fáil Deputies or clubs.  We have suggested the resumption and acquisition of land where it is not being worked, especially when it is non-residential, and where the tenants or owners live away from the holdings. These lands give no employment and, in some cases, are being allowed to run to waste, the fences not being made up, the drains not cleaned, or the thistles cut for years.  Such lands are suitable for acquisition and distribution and are pointed to by members of the Fianna Fáil clubs, but that does not means that it rests with these clubs to say whether they will be eventually taken over or not.  That rests with the Land Commission and with the appeal tribunal.  Any charges in that respect made against Fianna Fáil clubs are made merely for purposes of political propaganda.</P>

    <P>Deputy Bennett said that where suitable employment was not being given on a holding of 500 or 600 acres the owner had no right to that land, especially if it was not being worked, or if the rates were not being paid on it.  The Deputy suggested that such land should be taken.  There at least, we are on common ground.  When other Deputies on the same benches as Deputy Bennett spoke about the three &ldquo;F's&rdquo;, and about fixity of tenure, possibly that was political propaganda. I do not suggest that Deputy Bennett' had that in mind, but he will find it very hard to reconcile the statements that were made about fixity of tenure and his suggestion that land should be taken where there were 500 or 600 acres which were not worked, and that it <Col N="675" /> should be distributed amongst congests.</P>
    <P>On this side we do not go much further than that, so that we are at one with the Deputy there.  Perhaps we could go a little further in seeing that the acreage of land that is not being worked should be reduced, and that smaller farms that are not being <Col N="676" /> worked, on which the annuities and rates had not been paid and on which no one was living, should be taken over.  As far as fixity of tenure is concerned, it appears that Deputy Bennett is on the same ground as we are in that respect.  I move the adjournment.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned until to-morrow.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, June 7th.</P>

      <P>Statistics for income tax purposes are not compiled in such a form as to enable the information requested by the Deputy to be given.  Certain particulars, however, in relation to surtax assessments can be supplied.  I am having the matter looked into and perhaps in the circumstances the Deputy will be good enough to repeat his question in, say, a week's time.</P>
