      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether his attention has been drawn to the published statement on conscription by the Premier of Northern Ireland; and whether, in view of that statement, he has made, or intends to make, a protest against the possibility of Irish nationalists being conscripted by the Northern Government whose policy is not in keeping with the nationalist outlook.</P>

      <P>The Government have protested to the British Government in the strongest terms against the threatened imposition of conscription in that part of our country to which the Deputy refers.  I would remind the Deputy that the Army is one of the service in the occupied area over which the British Government retain control.  The proposal is, therefore, one for the conscription by the British Government of Irishmen for the British Army.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first part of the question, the reply is in the negative.  The Deputy may, however, be interested to know that it is stated in the report of the medical superintendant officer of health for Cork County Borough for the year 1935 that between the years 1929 to 1935 there was a total of 184 deaths from diphtheria in Cork City and not one of these was a child who had been immunised against the disease.  During that period over 12,000 had been immunised against the disease in Cork City.  As regards the second part of the question, it is not possible to secure in returns of deaths from <Col N="1417" /> diphtheria the inclusion of information as to whether the deceased was immunised unless all medical practitioners giving certificates of cause of death should agree to insert that information in the certificate.  The matter has been under consideration with a view to having the information made available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware <Col N="1418" /> that the application of James Cotter, Cork (serial No. 4699) for unemployment assistance, which was made on February 13th, 1939, was disallowed; that Mr. Cotter is a reservist of the National Army who, after completing his annual training in September, 1938, took employment in England; that immediately after certain bombing incidents in England (with which, admittedly, he had no connection) he was dismissed from his employment, and he returned to Cork; that he is now unable to find work, and is without either unemployment insurance or unemployment assistance; and if he will state the grounds on which his application for unemployment assistance benefit was disallowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Unemployment Assistance Acts enable Unemployment Assistance to be paid only to persons who satisfy, all the statutory conditions and are free from statutory disqualifications for its receipt.  One of these statutory conditions reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In the case of a person resident in an urban area applying for unemployment assistance, that either he has been ordinarily resident in such urban area for at least one year immediately preceding his application for unemployment assistance or has had at least three months employment in such urban area within the year immediately preceding such application.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>When Mr. Cotter applied for unemployment assistance on the 13th February last he stated that he had gone to England in September, 1937, and returned to Cork on the 11th February, 1939.  He had no employment in the county borough in the year immediately preceding his application, nor had he been ordinarily resident there for the year immediately preceding the date of the application.  Consequently his application for unemployment assistance was refused by an unemployment assistance officer.  The decision was upheld on appeal to the Court of Referees before which Mr. Cotter appeared and gave evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No contributions have been paid into the Unemployment Fund on Mr. <Col N="1419" /> Cotter's behalf, since the 1932/33 insurance year, and he is not therefore entitled to unemployment benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this man has never been 12 months out of the country?  He went to England in 1937.  He returned to Ireland in September, 1938, to do a month's training in the Army.  He returned to England in October, 1938, and came back to Cork in 1939, after being dismissed from his employment in England owing to the trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of what constitutes ordinary residence in an area is, of course, one of fact, and in this case the unemployment assistance officer gave his decision against the applicant, and the court of referees upheld the unemployment assistance officer's decision.  There is no appeal to anybody from the court of referees, and consequently, there is no means of having the case reopened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>But this man is a resident of Cork City, and the question of his being outside of Cork City for any period is quite a different thing. I think it is most unfair that this young man, who is a resident of Cork City, has been denied his unemployment assistance because of the circumstances, especially having regard to the fact that he came back and did a month's service in the National Army in 1938, and was dismissed later from his service in England because of the trouble there.  He returned to Cork in 1939.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state whether there is any statutory provision or Departmental regulation prohibiting the trustees of Cork Savings Bank from investing moneys in any securities other <Col N="1420" /> than British trustee securities; whether he is aware that trustees of British and Northern Ireland Savings Banks are empowered to invest in municipal loans; and, if so, whether he is prepared to take such steps as may be necessary to enable the trustees of the Cork Savings Bank to make investments in municipal loans.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge), for the Minister for Finance Patrick J. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge), for the Minister for Finance</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the establishment of the Free State, trustee savings banks were required by law to deposit their funds with the Commissioners for the Reduction of the National Debt and could not invest them in any other way.  The British Statutes affecting the commissioners presented such difficulties that no clear provision was then made for the performance in this country of the general range of functions vested in that body, though the matter has been under consideration. In the meantime, the banks have continued to deposit their funds with the commissioners; but it should be noted that, with the consent of the commissioners, the banks may transact what is called &ldquo;special investments&rdquo; business, that is, they may accept from individual depositors moneys for investment otherwise than with the commissioners, and among the forms such investments may take are loans secured on local rates.  This arrangement would appear to apply to the Cork Savings Bank and the other four Trustee Savings Banks as it does to British and Northern Ireland Trustee Savings Banks, and the need for what the Deputy suggests in the concluding part of his Question does not, therefore, arise.  In this connection I note that the resources of the bank mentioned in the Question are of modest dimensions, so that the release of a proportion of its funds could hardly affect appreciably the financing of municipal loans.  As regards the position of the Trustee Savings Banks generally in this country, I would refer the Deputy to the comments in paragraph 619 of the main Report of the Commission of Inquiry into Banking, Currency and Credit.  The commission's recommendations, which are linked up with recommendations on other matters, such as that of the institution <Col N="1421" /> of a debt and investment council, are receiving attention.  It may also be observed that Trustee Savings Banks are among the matters mentioned in Article 3 (iii) of the Financial Agreement of the 25th April, 1938, as being reserved for further discussion with the British Government.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have received representations from the Cavan Urban District Council and from Deputies Smith and Sheridan, requesting them to take over and preserve as a national monument the structure within the graveyard referred to by the Deputy.  This graveyard is vested in the council, and the Commissioners have no power under the National Monuments Act, 1930, to take over for preservation any monument so vested.  The Cavan Urban District Council was advised to this effect in March, 1936.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if, in view of the fact that the stocks of sheep in the mountainous areas of South Kerry have become depleted in recent years, he will take steps to have a scheme drawn up after consultation with local representatives whereby loans will be made available for sheep farmers in those areas to enable them to restock their lands and develop their business as formerly; further, if he will see that his Department will make arrangements to ensure that the restocking will be carried out with sheep imported from Scotland, or, <Col N="1422" /> in any event, from areas of the country outside South Kerry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The annual returns relative to sheep stocks in County Kerry as a whole reflect the position in the hilly districts, for comparatively few sheep are kept in other parts of the county.  Those returns show that there was a decline in the number of sheep in 1934 and 1935, but that there has since been a considerable increase.  I am aware that, owing to the abnormal and unfavourable conditions which prevailed last season, the mortality in sheep in the more exposed districts of County Kerry was greater than usual, but, taking the area as a whole, and in view of the fact that stocks have tended to increase in the last few years, I am not satisfied that a loan scheme of the nature suggested is necessary.  I may add that it is intended to continue in operation the scheme whereunder stock rams are brought into the county and supplied at nominal prices to sheep breeders in the hilly districts.</P>

The rest of the increase is due to normal increases of salaries, and adjustments.  On the other side there are receipts estimated to amount to £14,500.  This brings the total net sum to be provided to £76,431.</P>
    <P>The Estimate contains three new items for which the Dáil passed Supplementary Estimates during the year, namely, a sum for the repatriation of volunteers from Spain, a sum for the Austro-German refugees&mdash;£200&mdash; and £750 for the promotion of cultural relations with the United States. During the year, the Department continued to expand and develop.  The first Minister for Belgium presented his credentials here and in a few days we are to have renewal of Spanish representation.  I think I should say, in passing, how glad we all are that the civil war has terminated in Spain and how glad we are, also, that the new Minister will represent once more the Spanish nation here.</P>
    <P>The state of tension abroad has naturally increased the responsibilities of our representatives abroad, to whom our nationals naturally appeal for assistance and advice in these times of anxiety.  In the United States of America the services of our consuls were invoked in regard to 600 estates, which resulted in the distribution of some £32,000 to people in Ireland. Visas were issued in the United States at the rate of about 25 a day.  I may, perhaps, say, in passing, that the changes in the passport, which I indicated <Col N="1426" /> we had under contemplation and consideration in February, have now been made.  The new passport is being issued.  I do not think there is anything further I need say on the details of the Vote.</P>

      <P>I would suggest that it is much better not to have any mixing up of these things.  They stand on a different level.  I know that the Opposition has been anxious to have a debate on external affairs, and, I understand, of course, the anxiety that everybody feels at the present time; but I am not quite clear what particular aspects of the situation the Opposition wish to discuss.  Nowadays, with the radio and the Press, and with everybody interested in the international situation, there is very little I can add to the knowledge which I am sure every Deputy already possesses about the situation.  We all know its gravity.  We all know the danger.  We know that Europe is, in fact, as I said in a recent speech, an armed camp.  As far as a small nation can do anything to remedy that situation we have tried to do it, but in times like these, when the Great Powers are arming as fast as they can, when expenditure on armaments is reckoned in hundreds, and even in thousands, of millions of pounds, it is obvious that a small nation's voice cannot be of much avail. However, in so far as we have been able to exert any influence, it has been on the side of peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at it generally, it seems to us that there ought to be on this globe room for all of us and that it ought not to be necessary that there should be disastrous war, of the dimensions of which it is likely to be, in order <Col N="1427" /> to settle some of the differences that may cause it.  In so far as we could do it, we have urged on the greater powers&mdash;because, in the long run, it is they whose interests are likely to provoke this conflict&mdash;that they should get into conference and try, in a peaceful manner, to adjust the differences that exist.  I hope that war is not inevitable.  I do not think it ought to be, but, undoubtedly, a greater disposition must be shown on the part of the Governments of the great Powers towards conciliation and peaceful adjustment of differences if this war is to be averted.</P>
    <P>Should a war occur, the smaller nations, even though they themselves may have no desire whatever to be involved in conflict, are bound to suffer too.  Heavy burdens are placed on the nations that desire to keep out of this war.  Nobody can suggest for a moment, for example, that countries like Switzerland, Holland, Denmark, and the Scandinavian countries, desire war or have any purposes of aggression in mind, but they have to bear very heavy burdens for armaments for one purpose only&mdash;in order to provide that, should this war break out, the desire of their people to keep clear of it might be respected by the combatants on both sides.  They realise, as we must realise here, that the only chance they will have in a conflict of that sort, the only chance there is that their rights will be respected, is that those who would try to interfere with them will not be able to escape without some punishment at any rate.  I saw a statement by a representative of one of the Scandinavian states in which it was stated that, though they had no hostile intention against any other State, they were arming and bearing the burden of armaments in order that, at least, any State that might wish to attack them would not be able to succeed immediately even though, with the weight that might be brought against them, they might ultimately succeed unless some other assistance was given to them.  We here have indicated our desire to avoid being involved in this conflict but, as I said here, it is not <Col N="1428" /> sufficient to wish to keep out of this war.</P>
    <P>I think I have already indicated that, even though we were completely out of it and regarded by the combatants on both sides as having no desire to enter it, any such conflict will have very grave reactions here, even though we are not at all directly involved in it.  But, apart from that, we have the duty to try to see that our wishes in that matter will be respected by the combatants on both sides.  For that reason, we have asked that there should be a certain increase in our expenditure on defence.  It may be urged&mdash;perhaps it could be urged with a certain amount of truth&mdash;that we should have begun earlier to note that and that the expenditure which we propose to make is not nearly what we should prepare for, if we want to be in a position in which real respect will be given to our desire to be neutral. The only excuse I can offer for that is that we are already fairly burdened with taxation; that there is a great deal of pressure of social services and so on, and the Government was very loath indeed to add to those burdens by expenditure on defence, on armaments. However, we have got to do our best, and I am perfectly certain that the people in this country are as willing as the people in any other country to defend their liberties.</P>
    <P>With regard to external relations generally, we have no cause of quarrel, no dispute with any country, save the continuing dispute which we have with Great Britain.  I say &ldquo;continuing&rdquo; because everybody knows that the settlement of last year, though it did remove all the causes of a particular dispute, did not remove one fundamental cause of dispute, namely, the Partition of our country.  Everybody knows here, I think, and will admit that this Government has endeavoured to lay the foundation for really friendly relations between the two countries.  It has endeavoured to do that in the only way in which it can be done, and that is by the removal of the causes of the dispute. Those causes, I need not go back upon them now, were largely, as far as this part of Ireland was concerned, removed.  If this part were the whole.  I <Col N="1429" /> think we could say that most of the troubles, the causes of dispute in the past, would have been removed.  I could almost say practically all have been removed, but this continuing cause of dispute is poisoning the relations, and will continue to poison the relations, between the two countries as long as it is permitted to exist.</P>
    <P>The difficulties of that position have been accentuated by the proposal which is at present, I understand, before the British Parliament, the proposal to conscript Irishmen in the Six Counties into the British Army.  Everybody who was alive 20 years ago knows the resistance which such a proposition met from the Irish people here, and from the Irish people throughout the world.  It was a question on which there was a greater amount of unanimity amongst our people than any other political question.  The whole Irish race, here and abroad, united as one to resist it, and it will be remembered, so great was our hatred of this intolerable&mdash;because it was intolerable&mdash;aggression, that we actually pledged ourselves to resist it by every effective means, a pledge which got the support of Irishmen everywhere.  The present proposal is in no wise different from the proposal at that time.  It is a proposal by a foreign Parliament, a foreign Government, foreign to our country, to conscript Irishmen for the British Army.  No legal points can cover the fundamental fact.  We claim the whole of Ireland as national territory.  That claim will remain, I believe, as long as the Irish nation remains, and will be asserted as long as there is any denial of it, or as long as any portion of our territory is cut off.  To conscript, therefore, Irishmen who are inhabiting that area is an act of aggression.</P>
    <P>There is no use in mincing words in regard to it.  That is our attitude towards it, the attitude of the Government towards it, and it will be the attitude of Irishmen wherever they are.  As I indicated in the question to-day, the Government have, in the strongest terms, protested against it. It is not sufficient, I think&mdash;in fact, I am sure it is not sufficient&mdash;that there should be a suggestion, a measure, in the British Parliament that this will <Col N="1430" /> not come in immediately, but can be held as a threat during a continuing period.  That threat would be intolerable. Anybody who wishes for good relations between the two countries must realise that the continuation of that threat would be intolerable.  I think I will be speaking for the Irish people here and throughout the world if I ask that that clause be eliminated from the Bill.  As I said, no doubt lawyers will put forward a case for it, suggesting to the British Government, as this is part of the territory that they call the United Kingdom, that the British Government have a right to do this.  But that is just the point; the point is that we deny that that portion of Ireland should be separated from our territory here.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to speak any more on this matter.  From one point of view I prefer not to speak about it at all at the moment, but I know that I would not be representing the views of the Irish people if I did not make our position in that matter clear.  Consequently, I have done so.  I hope that this particular difficulty will be removed, but the difficulty arises immediately out of the question of Partition, out of the fact that portion of our country has been cut off from the national territory against the will of the vast majority of the Irish people.  Only a small fraction of the total population of this country, a relatively small fraction of the total population of this country would vote for the cutting off of that area if it were put to a national plebiscite.  We know that it is not Ulster; we know that there are only six of the nine counties in that area.  We know that those six were cut off on no basic principle, corresponding to no historic fact of any kind, geographic fact or even economic fact.  They were cut off for one purpose, to give the Parliament in Belfast or the majority in that area the biggest territory that they could hold with their majority.  We know that of the six counties we could take out four and put them in a bloc&mdash;all the counties of the six except two on the sea border, namely Antrim and Down &mdash;and that if you took a plebiscite in four out of those six counties we would <Col N="1431" /> have a majority in favour of unity with the country; so that, in fact, it is only in the area east of the Bann&mdash;an area altogether less than a tenth of the area of the whole country&mdash;that there is any local majority for Partition.</P>
    <P>I think that, as I said on other occasions, the more we make those facts known the better, because it is on an understanding and a knowledge of those facts that our attitude towards that whole question will be properly understood.  We claim, then, that this island as a whole is an historic national territory.  We claim that the present division is not based on any fundamental fact of history or geography or economics or anything else.  It is purely a gerrymandered area.  We claim it is only in a very small part of the area, less than half of it, that there would be anything like a local majority in favour of separation.  All the interests of the people who are living in this island, as I believe also the interests of the people in the neighbouring island, would be better served if that division were ended.  With regard to our external relations generally, as I have said, we are on friendly terms with every nation.  We want to be on the friendliest possible terms with Britain, but this division of our country is the fundamental matter in dispute between us.  If that were removed, and if the position in the whole island were similar to the position we have here, then I think I would need to make no reservation in regard to our external affairs.</P>
    <P>I should like to be able to say, as I think on a previous occasion I indicated that I hoped somebody would soon be able to say, speaking from this bench, that we were at peace and in friendly relations with every nation in the world because we wish well to all nations.  We believe that small nations benefit from peace more than they could possibly benefit from war.  We believe, as a matter of fact, that nations, great and small, taking the long view, would benefit more by peace than by war, but at the moment I regret that it is not possible for me to make that statement without reservation.  As I said at the start, I am somewhat in <Col N="1432" /> a difficulty, because I do not know exactly what are the points with which the Opposition wish to deal in this debate.  They were evidently very anxious to have it but, perhaps, I shall understand their position better when I have heard some of the speeches.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The particular matter that occupied a considerable portion of the Taoiseach's speech, even what has occurred as regards the question of conscription in the North, and the particular concession that has been given, shows the unnaturalness of Partition. With Europe facing the situation that it is to-day, with Great Britain and France having to face a situation in which their very existence will be at stake, knowing, as the British Government should have known, the importance of avoiding any cause of irritation between the Government of this country and themselves, it seems to me as if&mdash;not for the first time on their part&mdash;they were guilty of an incredible piece of stupidity, to put it no higher.  As I say, when faced, as I am afraid we soon may be faced, with a situation that will test the good sense and the good-will of two Governments, whose fundamental interests should be identical, it is, to my mind, amazing that they should, so to speak, gratuitously, go out of their way to raise a matter of grave misunderstanding between these two States.  I am sure the House shares with the Taoiseach the hope that anxiety in this particular matter will be quickly allayed.  However, judging by the action of the British Government in the past, judging by the attitude of the British Government during the particular European crisis we are discussing, I feel in my bones that there is always the danger that the epitaph may have to be written: &ldquo;Too late&rdquo;.  I hope that, if they do make up their minds to meet this particular matter in the way the Taoiseach suggested, there will be no delay about doing it.  The quicker it is done the better for both Governments and both States in the long run. I should have found it extremely difficult, as I say, at another period of British history to understand action of this kind or remissness of this kind&mdash; it can hardly be that, because I gather <Col N="1433" /> their attention was drawn to it, and drawn very definitely to it&mdash;on the part of that Government, were it not for the fact that I find it extremely difficult to find any rationale especially in their treatment of foreign affairs in Europe in the last three or four years.</P>
      <P>There are a number of matters in this Estimate that we might discuss.  The actual activities of the Department might be discussed, but I am not prepared to go into those things at the moment.  I realise, possibly nobody more fully, the gravity of the situation and how necessary it is to direct the attention of the country and the attention of the Government to the consequences that war may have, not merely for civilisation but for ourselves.  I think that in many respects the situation is much graver now than it was before the outbreak of war in 1914.  I think the consequences of war now would be much more disastrous even than in 1914.  I have a feeling that not merely our interests in the material sense but even our liberties, as we enjoy them here in the Twenty-Six Counties, may be gravely jeopardised or may come to an end as a result of this particular struggle.  It is because I feel that many people in the country, though they are anxious about the international situation and are keenly interested in it, have, to my mind, failed to grasp the gravity of many of the issues involved, that I should like to direct the attention of the House to some of these issues.</P>
      <P>In a way, I regret, and I am sure the Taoiseach regrets, that he had to make the particular statement he has just made on the question of conscription in Northern Ireland.  That, unfortunate in itself, may have an effect on some people on the Continent inclined, and shall I say, anxious to misread the signs, and those people here who are also willing and anxious to misread the signs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can hope with the Taoiseach that war is not inevitable.  No catastrophe of that kind is strictly inevitable.  But for a number of years past, and particularly for the last 12 months.  I certainly can see very little grounds on which to base any optimism whatever. Optimism is an excellent tonic.  I can quite understand, and I have a great <Col N="1434" /> deal of sympathy with, the attitude of the English people in treating Munich as a great victory&mdash;a defeat so great that there was no other method of preserving the morale of the country except to hail it as a victory.  I myself, I may candidly confess, greeted it at least as a postponement of the horrible catastrophe of war, whatever I may have thought of the price paid.  There was at least that gain, but that anybody could seriously pretend that it settled, rather than unsettled, the situation in Europe was difficult to understand.  For some people it was a tonic that they should pretend it was a victory.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why here, situated a bit out of the way perhaps, we should not face the facts a little more realistically and realise what really happened, as possibly most people realise it now, and try to make out what is liable to happen in the immediate future, or if not in the immediate future, then in the course of the next couple of years.  A number of people in this country, who assume that war may break out and are very perturbed at the prospect, who realise the horrible sufferings of war and the losses that may be caused by war&mdash;not merely material losses&mdash;do not realise that a war which breaks out now may well end in the defeat of the Western Powers.  That is a possibility.  Had I been asked 12 months ago whether it was a reasonable possibility, I should have said &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Were I asked to-day I should be very slow to give even a hesitant answer.</P>
    <P>Let us ask ourselves, apart altogether from other issues which may be at stake, and there are other issues at stake, if such a thing happened, what would be the position of the liberties even of the Twenty-Six Counties.  I cannot see our people continuing to enjoy their present liberties.  We may say that the idea is fantastic.  I heard people nine months ago denounce as fantastic many of the things which have become the realities of European politics at the present day.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the question of democracies and autocracies, I think it is quite possible that the Western Powers might be defeated.  In that case, we <Col N="1435" /> could easily become, call it a protectorate if you like, an outpost against the United States.  That is by no means an impossibility.  But it is not a possibility of which the great bulk of our people reckon, any more than the people of Europe realised what was in front of them twelve, nine or six months ago.  I want, therefore, every possible care given to the consideration of what may be the issues at stake for this country, even for those liberties of which the Taoiseach spoke.  I have not the slightest doubt that the people of the country, as the Taoiseach said, like the people of any other country, will be prepared to defend their liberty.  So were nations much more powerful than we are.  Comparatively small nations were quite willing to defend their liberty.</P>
    <P>I have not the smallest doubt that Czecho-Slovakia was quite willing to defend its liberties and fight for them I think nothing more cynical has occurred in recent history than the way in which certain statement gave as an excuse for the particular line which they pursued that they had saved a great deal of slaughter in Czecho-Slovakia.  But the Czechs never asked them to do so.  What happened then?  Wisely these nations, ever so much stronger than we are, made up their minds to surrender.  Do I despise them for that?  I do not do anything of the kind.  There was no alternative open to them.</P>
    <P>For that reason I ask the House to consider what would be the outcome for us if there was a real defeat of the Western Powers.  I say &ldquo;Western Powers&rdquo; because I leave aside now the question of autocracies and democracies. It is not our business to try to impose or wish certain people to have a certain form of government. That is beside the issue.  A great deal of harm has been done, I am convinced, by raising false issues in that respect.  There are other reasons, besides the form of government imposed on certain European States, why I oppose them.  Independent altogether of the form of government they enjoy, I object a great deal to what they stand for in the sphere of civilisation, <Col N="1436" /> religion, and culture.  I think it would be disastrous for Europe, disastrous for our values, for the things we prize most highly, I shan't say that the Western Powers should be defeated, but that National Socialism should have a chance of triumphing. That is the issue in which we are vitally concerned.  I am not interested in what form of government the German people choose to have or do not choose to have, but I am interested that the particular outlook in life which National Socialism represents shall not be forced on other countries.</P>
    <P>There is no good in pretending that this is all moonshine.  There are very few countries in the two hemispheres in which there is not an intense propaganda going on.  In the United States and in many States in South America propaganda has been going on in favour of that particular form of philosophy, outlook on life, secular religion, call it what you like.  Is that for nothing?  Does anybody think that the interest of that particular outlook on life stops at the frontiers of Europe? It does nothing of the kind.  It envisages a great deal more than European domination.</P>
    <P>Again, people will say that that is fantastic.  When I see people making proclamations that mean world domination, and when these people have already proclaimed other things and carried them out, then I think it is time that people paid at least some attention to the words of these people. Therefore, it is well that we should recognise it, and I do not think the country recognises it.  There is a certain amount of propaganda going on in this country&mdash;the extent of it I do not know.  I think that particular form of propaganda is most marked and has caused considerable uneasiness not merely to the Government of South Africa, but especially to many of the Governments in South America.  What is it for?  A very short time after Munich, when all were to be friends, when a new world was to be built up on that extraordinary foundation that was laid there, Dr. Goebbels, charged with the complete propaganda of the Reich, said one thing which has <Col N="1437" /> remained in my mind since: &ldquo;Had we been united in 1914, we should have world domination.&rdquo;  Is that fantasy? I should have laughed at it myself a couple of years ago.  Dare anybody laugh at it at the present day?</P>
    <P>If there is the slightest doubt, not merely about the particular form of secular religion for which Germany stands, but about the wish for world domination&mdash;as a preliminary, of course, domination in Europe&mdash;let anybody who has such doubt read the full translation of the famous book of Herr Hitler, &ldquo;Mein Kampf,&rdquo; which is now available.  I am not anxious to go into the archives to show what he meant there and what he meant here, if certain things were not borne out and brought up to date by the policy of that particular Government.  I have just one quotation here, and perhaps I may be pardoned for reading it.  Let anybody consider, in the light of the activities that we see in Europe and the propagandist activities in the two hemispheres, a statement like that I have quoted from Dr. Goebbels, and remember that the great boast is: &ldquo;We are united now; had we been united in 1914 we would have world domination.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The conclusion is fairly obvious as to what is aimed at.  Here is the master himself, and I see no reason to believe it is not his policy to-day.  Speaking of an extraordinary disease that he is under the impression the Germans are suffering from, and which he calls hyper-individualism, he wrote:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;During times of peace, such a situation may offer some advantages, but taking it all in all, it has prevented us from gaining a mastery in the world.  If in its historical development the German people had possessed the unity of herd instinct by which other people have so much benefited, then the German Reich would probably be mistress of the globe to-day.  World history would have taken another course, and in this case no man can tell if what many blinded pacifists hope to obtain by petitioning, whining and crying, may not have been reached in this way; namely, a peace which would <Col N="1438" /> not be based on the waving of olive branches and tearful misery-mongering of pacifist old women, but a peace that would be guaranteed triumphant by the sword of a people endowed with the power to master the world and administer it in the service of a higher civilisation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is that rubbish?  Is that ridiculous nonsense? Thirteen or 14 years ago when that was written, the world might have laughed at it.  Can the world afford to laugh at it to-day?</P>
    <P>Another contingency I should like to ask the country to consider is this: If this crisis is postponed for a couple of years, and if the tension, as seems likely, continues so that you have continued crises&mdash;I mean if it does not burst forth in its full ripeness for a couple of years&mdash;there is this position that I feel few people envisage, but it is a possibility, and is partly borne out by rather recent pronouncements from the same source.  I have recently contended that this crisis in world peace will be more serious than 1914 in its bearing on the question of individual liberties and States.  A great deal more is involved now.  There are terrific dangers apart from that, the dangers of the triumph of National Socialism on the one hand or perhaps Bolshevism on the other hand.  Probably it is just a choice between them.  I find it very hard to know which is the greater evil. At the moment I should say that National Socialism is the more dangerous. That is all I can say in favour of either.</P>
    <P>There is very little difference between the two outlooks.  Daily they are getting closer together, and were the personal element left out, I am quite sure the alliance that many of the Germans sponsor might become an active alliance of these two supposed enemies, they are so much alike.  In the things I am most interested in, I say there is very little difference between the two, and if the Bolshevists triumph, as may happen, the people who will have to bear a large share of the responsibility, as well as the Bolshevists themselves who were primarily responsible, will be the so-called dictators and the premiers of a few great States in Europe.  The dictators, on the one <Col N="1439" /> hand, and the so-called democratic premiers on the other hand have contributed to bring about the state of affairs we see to-day.</P>
    <P>What chance has Europe of getting out of the present situation?  I am particularly anxious to see how it will affect us.  We see efforts being made now at the eleventh hour to restore confidence amongst the various Powers in Europe.  There is a tremendous struggle, in the light of what has occurred in the last couple of years, to bring back a feeling of confidence to a number of the small and middlesized States in Europe.  They are trembling for their very existence to take the side of any Power at either side.  Either as an instrument to advance their own particular cause to victory, or to stave off defeat, do we think our liberties would be respected for a moment?  I call attention to the fact that in some of his recent speeches &mdash;and it was noteworthy in the last speech as a particular case in point, as was the Reichstag one immediately preceding it&mdash;that there was very little reference to Russia.  All his antagonism was directed against England and the United States of America.  That is a situation I commend to the careful attention of the Government, and also to our people as a whole.  These are factors that dare not be left out of a count.  In our material interests and in our spiritual interests, and in the interests of the liberty of this country, it is not a matter of indifference to us as to who would come out of the maelstrom as victors.  Our own spiritual interests could be very well at stake. Our liberties might be at stake; everything we hold dear might be at stake. Again, it is a great mistake, a mistake that British statesmen after British statesmen have made, not to pay serious attention to what people on the Continent say.  It is assumed, when they make &ldquo;extravagant&rdquo; statements, at least the commonsense Englishman assumes, that they are not meant.  That is the situation that faces not merely Great Britain but that faces as well the United States.</P>
    <P>Supposing the Western Powers collapsed in a quick war, supposing you have that hatred of democracy that is continually preached <Col N="1440" /> and denounced, what would happen? My own view is that no country has the right to impose government on another country, because that is a matter for the people themselves.  But that is not the view of certain people, and even in England there are people who object to Germany and Italy merely on the ground of the form of Government they have.  For that there is no justification.  But you need only read the speech of the German Chancellor to see the hatred of democracy.  The only difference between his attitude now and 12 months ago is that added to the hatred of 12 months ago there is contempt, and that is a much more dangerous situation. He now tilts, even more than at Great Britain, at the United States of America.  We have a supreme interest in that particular matter, and it is because I am anxious that the Government should not leave any of that side of the question out of account that I stress it.  It is highly desirable that there should be good relations between this country and the Government of Great Britain at all times, and particularly now. That is the reason I hope that this difficulty that has arisen about conscription in Northern Ireland will be quickly put aside.  That that should be the cause of unfriendly relations between the two countries seems to me to be unthinkable.  It is not merely a question of the British Empire being at stake; we are not particularly interested in that except in so far as it might concern ourselves; but we are interested in the fate of the Commonwealth of Nations so far as that affects ourselves; and that anything should occur to prevent harmonious relations between the two countries, in view of the present crisis, is almost unthinkable. I think it is a duty, not merely on our own Government, but on the English Government, to prevent any such thing happening.  That seems to me to be quite clear.</P>
    <P>I cannot speak, of course, from a military point of view.  I do not know what advantage our harbourages would be at the present time to any country, or whether their defence is necessary or not.  As I say, I cannot speak on that, but let us suppose that our harbours <Col N="1441" /> should become a nesting-place for, let us say, German submarines, in the event of war, acting against foodships coming in, not alone to England, but into this country, what would be our position?  I do not want to put the Taoiseach into the position of having to answer questions that might possibly damage this country at the moment, but I do want the Government to consider well what our position would be likely to be.</P>
    <P>We speak of an invasion of our neutrality and of our hitting back.  Well, let us look at both points of view.  Again, I put it before the Government and before the House, and I should like the House to put it before the country&mdash; because I think that this is the most serious situation that we have had to face&mdash;suppose Germany violates our neutrality by dropping bombs on Dublin, how can we react to that?  Even if a war were to break out to-morrow, I do not suppose anybody expects us here to send a single soldier out of this country; but in the case that I have given, such as the dropping of bombs by, let us say, Germany, on Dublin, how then could we react against Germany? I do not desire that there should be any misunderstandings between the two Governments that would mean that both would be really fighting against their own interests.  But in times of stress that is precisely, unfortunately, what may occur.</P>
    <P>There is another point that I want to make clear.  What will our problem be in the case of war?  Whether we regard ourselves as a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, or whether we are merely utilising King George VI for the purpose of certain external affairs, or whether we regard ourselves as having a republican Constitution, our position will not be determined by that, and I think that those who assume we would be in a better position if the present situation were changed are mistaken; but the fact is that our position will be determined, not by these considerations, but by our geographical situation and by the necessities and desires of the other countries that are at war.  In a life-and-death <Col N="1442" /> struggle such as this war is going to be if it breaks out, does anybody think that the Germans, or the people of any other country, are going to allow themselves to be wiped out of existence merely for the sake of observing our neutrality?  These are matters that I should like the Government to consider. This is a very difficult period in our history, and we must face it.  It may be only a couple of months before the war may be upon us, and again, the incredible may happen, and the whole situation may quieten down&mdash; though I do not think there is much hope of that.  Again, there may be a continuing crisis going on for a couple of years or longer, with a continuing changing of the European situation, but that is just what concerns us.  I think that the Taoiseach himself pointed out on one occasion the great strategic importance of our country's position in the event of such a war. It is quite true that we in this country are only on the verge of Europe, but it is also true, perhaps unfortunately for ourselves, that to some extent we are in the centre of the world.  We are on the outskirts of Europe, but, to some extent, our island commands the approaches to Europe.  If, then, as I say, you wish to be neutral, and German submarines, or the submarines of other hostile countries, come in and use your harbours, how will you deal with them?  Supposing that we have our full independence here, what about the question of foodstuffs?</P>
    <P>Who can tell what will happen in the event of an outbreak of war?  Suppose that Spain happens to be on the side of the Axis Powers?  There, at all events, there is a potential harborage for submarines&mdash;not merely against Great Britain but against foodstuffs for ourselves.  The very existence, not alone the welfare of the United States of America may depend on the capacity to cope with these.  I do not know whether the United States of America will come in to a war of the type that is possible in Europe at the moment. I could not prophesy as to that.  That they have taken up a strong attitude with regard to the present crisis is quite clear, but what their attitude will be in the case of an actual European war, I could not say; I am not sure. <Col N="1443" /> That they would come in ultimately, if the war lasted long enough, is highly likely; but beyond that nobody can prophesy, and neither can anybody prophesy as to how quickly they would come in even if they did eventually come in.  Let us suppose a modern European war lasting three years.  Does anybody think that there would be any of our civilisation left?  Let us try to remember the Napoleonic wars, which lasted, roughly speaking, about a quarter of a century.  About 100 years afterwards we had the Great War, which lasted four years, and which put a much greater strain on the peoples of Europe than the 25 years of the Napoleonic wars.  Surely it will be admitted that a war at the present time, lasting for a year or a year and a half, would be much more disastrous in its effects than the four years of the last war, and, from what I can make out, some of the European Powers at the moment are preparing for such a war.</P>
    <P>In view of these possibilities, we have to consider what our position would be, and I want the Government to consider this matter very seriously, because, as I say, it is our very existence that may be at stake, and, I fully believe, it will require a great deal of clear grasping of the situation and, possibly, often, a great deal of restraint, even in the coming months, if we are to avoid steps that may ultimately be disastrous.  I am sure that the Government will take every means to avoid that, but I wish to impress upon them the necessity for considering calmly and coldy, with as little emotion as possible, and as objectively as possible, where our interests are likely to be, and where we are likely to be at the end of the war if it breaks out.  It is very easy for some people to say that we are on the outskirts of Europe, and that we are not likely to be affected by such a war.  Many people say: &ldquo;Thank goodness, we are not like Holland, just on the borders of Germany.&rdquo;  Many other people say: &ldquo;Thank goodness, we are not like Switzerland.&rdquo;  Certainly, we have certain advantages if such a war were to be confined to the Continent of Europe, but it is not going to be confined to the Continent of Europe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1444" /> Nobody has put that more strongly than the Taoiseach himself&mdash;the extreme importance of our position&mdash; when he said that some of our ports were equivalent to several Gibraltars. As well as I remember, that was the phrase used.  Possibly, it was a patriotic exaggeration, but at least so far as I can see merely an exaggeration, and not a complete misrepresentation of the situation.  We may think that we can sit quietly here and take a ringside seat and watch what is going on.  Now, if our position is such as the Taoiseach has said, is it likely that we shall be allowed to take a ringside seat?  Can we, any more in this than in other matters, take up the line that so many in this country are inclined to take up: &ldquo;Well, what is it to us what happens to certain people in Germany, whether they are kicked out or not; let us attend to our own affairs.&rdquo;  May I raise a question on this Vote, namely, the way in which the people have not responded&mdash;I am not speaking now of the Government &mdash;to the claims that people of our faith from other countries have on us? They may say &ldquo;we are not our brother's keeper&rdquo;, but if we are not, and if we take up that particular line, we are possibly apt to get into the other half of the famous advertisement of Bovril, &ldquo;Alas, my poor brother.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That may be our position.  But we need not be so much ashamed of ourselves. Greater nations than ours have, unfortunately for themselves, taken up that position.  That policy of splendid isolation that has been preached by certain circles in England has led to peculiar developments, and has led almost to the very undermining of the whole position of the British Commonwealth of Nations and of the Empire itself.  It is rather interesting to see one of the strong advocates of Partition in the North, one of the most patriotic of them all, the man that has played a very peculiar rôle in the international politics of Europe in the last six months: it is a very peculiar thing indeed that when the British Government announce a certain policy there are certain forces that seem to know better than the Government themselves what that <Col N="1445" /> policy is.  We had an interesting example of that last September when apparently the London <i>Times</i> and a man like Lord Londonderry had a better insight into what Government policy was going to be than the official spokesman of that Government. There was a ray of hope for peace the other day when we saw the same <i>Times</i> belittling the pledge given by Mr. Chamberlain to Poland.  It did the same thing last September.  It was repudiated last September, and it was proved right by events.  It belittled the pledge of the other day, and it was repudiated.</P>
    <P>I have not seen some of the maps that have been published in Germany. I am not referring to the one that Deputy Mulcahy adduced the other day, but I have heard a great deal about them.  But taking these, and the pledges and the actions of that Central Power, which cause nothing but the gravest uneasiness for the future of every country, what is the excuse for wiping out of existence Austria and Czechoslovakia?  We are told, of course, that there was no employment of force.  In other words, if you are so strong that your forces cannot be resisted it is a virtue to attack the weak: it proves the very height of your virtue.  One small nation after another has been wiped out, and the rest are in a state of nerves.  Why should not they be?  Can we hope to escape? Possibly that can be discussed more appropriately on the next Vote, but I sometimes ask myself, when I watch the development of modern European politics, whether or not the day of small nations has passed with the claims of the bigger nations, some of them put forward cynically and openly and the others to follow suit when the time comes.</P>
    <P>Speaking about international agreements, I wonder where the greatest contempt has been shown for international agreements?  I saw that a British statesman made the statement the other day that you could not trust the word of the dictators.  He was an optimist in thinking that you could trust the word of any leading European statesman so far as international agreements are concerned.  I mention <Col N="1446" /> that because that is a situation we have to face.  We cannot ignore it. You may tell me quite truly that England and France made Hitler, and that since he came into power they have consolidated his position.  What, if they did?  That does not make his position at the present moment any weaker: it makes it all the stronger, and it makes that Power a menace, not merely to England and France but to every country in Europe.  We have to face that: we cannot ignore it.  It is small comfort to us that great Powers, to their own detriment, let that menace develop.  We certainly cannot ignore the menace, although I say that a number of people in this country are doing it.  I am not referring now to the Government, but I do say that there is a certain underlying campaign almost in favour of that particular Power.</P>
    <P>Can anyone be certain of knowing what that Power stands for?  As I have said already in this House, it seems to me to be almost the very personification of evil.  It is not because it is autocratic that I object to that form of Government&mdash;that is not my business&mdash;but it does personify a great deal more than that, and for that reason I object to it.  What is the position?  At the present moment, if a fortnight passes without a major crisis, is there not a feeling of relief, almost of optimism all over Europe?  The fact that you were deceived last week does not prevent you from being optimistic about next week.  From the fact that last week's crisis is over, following one a fortnight before, and that this does not lead to another crisis, people assume that everything is all right.  I see no justification for optimism of that kind.</P>
    <P>I hope, like the Taoiseach, that war is not inevitable.  I recognise certain changes that have taken place.  If you take the political or rather the strategic position of the world, I should say you would find that as the result of the war of 1914 to 1918, Great Britain, to a large extent, lost the position that she previously had in the world, as arbiter, so to speak, in Europe.  That position has automatically gone to the United States of <Col N="1447" /> America.  Whether that country decides to intervene or not, it will be found that ultimately her interests will be bound up with Europe, as the President of that country has so often demonstrated.  She will be in Europe to the same extent as Great Britain used to be in the great wars up to the end of the nineteenth century, and even after the nineteenth century.  She will inevitably be brought into that position.  That makes her position one of considerable importance.</P>
    <P>I should like the Government to weigh very carefully, having in mind the interests, spiritual and political, the liberty that we ought to enjoy and the material interest of this country, and to shape its policy on them.  I know very well there will be a number of people anxious to drive the Government into other directions.  It will require a certain effort to resist pressure of that kind.  But I feel it will be essential for the future welfare of this country that the Government should not yield to thoughtless clamour of that kind, no matter from where it comes.  The Government will be wise to pursue coldly, calmly and undeviatingly the best interests of the country if they take that line.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Taoiseach in the fullness of the restraint with which he makes his protest with regard to the threat of conscription in Northern Ireland and the passing of conscription.  We hope that his hope in that matter will be realised and that the provisions in that respect, whatever they are, that are in the Bill at present before the British House of Commons will be removed, and that they will be removed at the earliest possible moment.  The interests that concern us here are, naturally, the interests of our own people.  The interests of our own people are not only their material interests at home and their spiritual interests at home, but they include also the ideals our people have with regard to world conditions, and the general world position of civilisation as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the same way we are concerned at the present time with our national strength and our own national <Col N="1448" /> resources.  It seems to me that the Taoiseach in dealing with this matter, however unprepared, and for whatever reason he has, ought to take the House or the country as a whole into his confidence with regard to the present situation. He wound up his statement with the suggestion that he hoped somebody, speaking from the Government Benches, would be able some day to say: &ldquo;We are at peace with every nation on earth.&rdquo;  He regretted it was not now altogether possible to make that statement without reservations. The implication he made before was that the only reservation he found it possible to make with regard to the external affairs problem at the present time is that Partition exists.  I do not think it is treating our people fairly as a whole, in the most important debate that we ever had on external affairs, to discuss external affairs on the assumption that we are at peace with every nation on the earth, and that the only blot on the picture is that we have Partition.  It is particularly unfair to treat our external affairs problem in that way, at a time when the British are continuing their unenlightened, blundering attitude with regard to this country as a whole.</P>
    <P>As far as we are concerned here, either there is going to be peace in the world or there is going to be war.  If there is going to be peace, we could concentrate on the problems we have here.  These are the problem of unemployment, the problem of the reorganisation of our agricultural interests, and problems regarding the bettering of our educational and social position generally. If, on the other hand, the Government is satisfied that there is a danger of war, then, apparently, we cannot go ahead with these things; we cannot use up the money at our disposal for these purposes, and we cannot devote all our energy and attention to these matters.  While the whole action of the Government and their general policy to-day imply that war is a likely thing, our discussion on external affairs implies that we have no troubles to expect from anybody outside. There are very many indications in the situation throughout the country that the people want a more definite lead from Parliament in quite a number <Col N="1449" /> of these matters than it is getting.</P>
    <P>We are going to defend our country, we are told.  The Taoiseach is full of hope that the people of this country are going effectively to defend the liberties of the country against any aggression.  At the present moment, the Minister for Defence is reorganising his Army; carrying out many developments in the Defence forces, and changing his present Volunteer force for another Volunteer force.  But the results that the Minister for Defence is getting do not show in any way that the young men of the country are convinced that a crisis exists, even to the extent that our normal Army strength is to be kept up to its present figure.</P>
    <P>I see in the practical failure of the recruiting campaign that the young men of the country are not convinced that there is a crisis at the present time.  If the thing had not been so absurdly proceeded with, I would see in the dissipation of the Minister's Forces the clearest possible evidence that the young men of this country have not been convinced that a war situation exists at the present moment.</P>
    <P>In the same way we have the action of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the action of the Minister for Agriculture seeming to indicate that they do not realise the position. The way in which the Minister for Industry and Commerce is dealing with the preparations for the supply of raw materials and food stuffs for the country from outside, and the Minister for Agriculture is dealing with the question of the increased tillage that there ought to be in the country, show that neither of them realises the position with which the country is faced. The Minister for Industry and Commerce is responsible in one Department, and the Minister for Agriculture in another Department, but in neither sphere is there any indication that there is any clear appreciation of the seriousness of the situation with which this country would have to grapple in the probable or possible event of war being brought about.  Nor, in the same way, in the approach of the Ministry to foreign affairs matters generally is there any evidence of that.  The Taoiseach on a number of occasions here pointed out how difficult it would <Col N="1450" /> be in the circumstances of a European war to preserve our neutrality here. But the Taoiseach has recently been swinging back more and more on a statement of policy as if it were isolated neutrality.</P>
    <P>There is one thing that the Taoiseach has encouraged in the country, and that is the development of a spirit which is so easily raised in this country, a feeling of irritation, antagonism and hostility to Great Britain.  That is one of the things which very definitely is arising out of the general treatment of foreign policy by the Taoiseach.  His contribution to this debate to-day can do nothing but exaggerate that to some extent, although I appreciate the firmness and the restraint with which he dealt with the question of conscription in the North of Ireland.  If this country is to be prepared for what will result from a European war, then we have to be much more unified in our outlook on things here, and we can only be unified in our outlook on things here when we get an opportunity of facing the facts, and it is of the greatest possible importance that the Government should show the country in some way what the facts are, because if the Government proceed as they are proceeding at present, we are going to find ourselves in a war situation without the type of army we would require to have and without the type of outlook on our neighbours and on the general problems of the country which it would be essential for us to have if we are to deal with matters in a suitable way.</P>
    <P>As a result of the inadequate presentation of the facts by the Government of the people, there is a trend in certain quarters in the country to support the attitude of the German Government, utterly ignoring the aspect of that Government's policy about which Deputy O'Sullivan has just spoken, and there is a tendency to go back to the old cries of antagonism to Great Britain.  Whether such difficulties as we have with Great Britain as a result of Partition can be settled at present&mdash;and if Great Britain were in any way sensible she would endeavour to settle them at present&mdash; and whether they are settled or not, they can have no bearing on the outside <Col N="1451" /> world forces which will impinge upon us if war breaks out.  On the other hand, we are definitely of mind here&mdash;and I am quite sure that Deputies on the Government Benches and the people of the country as a whole are satisfied&mdash;that the interests and ideals of our people are bound up with the maintenance of the strength and security of countries like Great Britain, United States, Canada, Australia, South Africa and France, and that if, as Deputy O'Sullivan stated, these countries were either injured or destroyed, the type of world we think of in our ideals would no longer exist, the economic and social position of our people would be an impossible position and our liberties and economic well-being would be lost, so that it is of the greatest possible importance that, apart altogether from what difficulties we may experience at present, we should raise our heads above these difficulties and look at the general facts of the situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce said the other day that he had examined how arrangements were to be made to safeguard the ocean-borne supplies of food to our people.  We are concerned with making arrangements to safeguard those ocean-borne supplies of food and we are concerned with making arrangements to safeguard the bringing of the raw materials to our people which are necessary for the upkeep of our industrial life here.  The country as a whole ought to have some picture, and it should get it from the Government, as to the extent to which this country is relying on external food and external raw materials for the keeping up of the people's life here, and it ought to know the countries on which we are likely to have to rely in order to bring those supplies here securely. Whether war comes or whether war does not come, my belief is that the more we concentrate on our own economic well-being here, the better we are prepared for war, and we have to eliminate as far as possible all the petty political feelings which are likely to distract our people from following out sane and sensible policies.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan dealt with the <Col N="1452" /> position of the United States and with the position of the United States as placed somewhat in the forefront of German criticism at present.  If it were necessary for the United States Government to enter into a war in Europe, United States forces could not be landed in Europe without the cooperation of the people of this island. That was manifested to a great extent in the Great War, and questions like that which would arise are questions which should be gone into by the Government, who should place the broad, open facts of the situation before the people so that they may not be confused if a war decision requires to be taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Out of great evil, good can sometimes come.  I think the proposal to conscript our people in Northern Ireland for the British Army has shocked all parties in Éire.  It has happily been abandoned, but it has served this purpose, that it has thrown into greater relief than had hitherto been done the absurdity of Partition and the deadly danger of Partition to the survival of the Commonwealth of Nations.  I have argued with friends in England, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and South Africa, as a believer in the Commonwealth of Nations, that Partition was a matter in which they might properly take an interest, if they believed, as I believe, that the interests of the world at large would be served by the survival of the Commonwealth of Nations, because I felt that, sooner or later, Partition might create a situation between this country and Great Britain which would precipitate grave and deplorable events for her and for us, and ultimately for the Commonwealth of Nations itself.  I think the thought of the British Government in 1938 advancing a claim to do that from which she recoiled from attempting in 1918, before the protest of a united people in this country, shows the world and our fellow members of the Commonwealth of Nations the dynamite danger of continuing the Partition arrangement, quite apart from the inherent injustices that it involves for our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to see Partition abolished, as <Col N="1453" /> the Taoiseach does, and as every political party in this country wants to see it abolished, because I believe it to be a loathsome injustice to our people and to our nation.  I want to see it abolished, also, because I believe it is a standing menace to the Commonwealth of Nations which I regard as not only of vital interest to this country but of vital interest to freedom, democracy and decency the world over.  I want to sound this note of warning.  The cause of Irish reunion is not served by pouring oil on the flames of hatred that past injustice has ignited between our people in this portion of the country and our people in the six counties of Northern Ireland.  No intervention by Great Britain can satisfactorily terminate Partition unless Partition is terminated with the goodwill of the people of Northern Ireland.  Rightly or wrongly, our people in Northern Ireland&mdash;unhappily&mdash;look upon England as their protector.  When I say &ldquo;our people&rdquo;, I mean our Orange and Protestant fellow-countrymen, who are our people, who are just as Irish as we are&mdash;every bit.  Unhappily, they look upon England as their protector. It can never serve the interests of Irish unity that we should create in their minds the indelible impression that we purchase their betrayal by the country upon whom they look as their protector. We have got to win not only the barren acres of Ulster but the hearts of the people who live in it.  We are not going towards that goal by disowning them, by repudiating them as Irishmen and by denouncing and outraging them as they not infrequently denounce and outrage us.  Whether we like it or dislike it, the Craigavons, the Brookes and the other Ministers of the Northern Government are as Irish as the de Valeras, the Lemasses, the Cosgraves and the Dillons&mdash;every bit. They were born in this country and they have spent their lives in this country.</P>
    <P>I fully acknowledge the difficulty of winning the consent of those people to reunion but no satisfactory or enduring peace can be built on their coercion.  That is not an easy fact to face but any disinterested person must face it if he loves his country.  I do not despair that that reconciliation can <Col N="1454" /> be effected.  I believe it can be done in our time but it is not an easy job and it is not made easier by stirring up new discords or stimulating old quarrels between us.  Personally, I should sooner see that reunion achieved without British intervention of any kind. We got the English out of this country and my only advice to them would be to stay out.  I should far sooner see reunion effected by Irishmen making peace, one with another, in our own country.  All the goodwill we can get from Great Britain or Canada or any other friendly nation is welcome, but the less intervention we have in the domestic differences that divide us&mdash; whoever was responsible for starting them&mdash;the more satisfactory will the ultimate settlement be.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with that aspect of our external relations, the Taoiseach said to-day that he gathered that we had read the newspapers, listened to the radio and knew as much as he himself did about what was passing in the world; therefore, he did not know what we wanted him to talk about and proposed to wait and listen.  This is not the first time the Taoiseach wanted the last word.  But he did not sound convincing.  Our situation is perhaps a little too grave to permit of manoeuvring of that kind.  I do not think that it serves any useful purpose. I do not think that there is room to go chasing one another up and down the country in an endeavour, by creating political embarrassments for one another, to make it impossible to do the right thing.  Whoever sits in the place of the Taoiseach in circumstances such as we find ourselves in to-day is in a difficult position.  His difficulties are made no less by the public men of the country preserving a deathly silence and inviting the unhealthy rumour and the malicious behind-door conversations.  In a democratic country, where we have a Parliament, the useful thing is to discuss these difficulties with all discretion, but as frankly as the circumstances permit, and with no desire to make cheap political capital out of the vital interests of our common country.</P>
    <P>I think that the people want a lead. In the confusion in which all of us find ourselves the people of the country <Col N="1455" /> want some clear indication of where our duty as a nation lies, so that, having got a clear indication of what the Taoiseach may think or what we may think, they may accept or reject it or fashion a policy of their own.  We achieved sovereignty and independence, and I think that a great many people forget that these things carry with them extremely uncomfortable responsibilities in addition to the luxury of freedom.  One of these uncomfortable responsibilities is to realise that we are standing out on our own in a storm-swept world, and that we have got to ask ourselves if the wind changes direction, how will we fare.  Deputies in this House might ask themselves this question: Supposing that the portions of the world from Southampton to Singapore were under the control of Germany and of the Nazi Government, what effect would that have on the people of this country?  I think a great many Deputies would be tempted to reply: &ldquo;None whatever.&rdquo;  God forbid they would ever get the dark awakening of the experience.  What would happen to a small nation like Ireland, if the particular methods of diplomacy employed by the German Reich during the last two years were the order of the day here?  What would happen if, when a small nation such as we are, made its protest or made representations that its interests were being interfered with, the reply was given that it was very lucky to escape incorporation in the Reich, and if the condition of a continued independent existence was that all our legislation and all our future international relations should be submitted to Berlin before they were acted upon?  What would we feel like if a trade delegation came to negotiate with us and informed us that the alternative to concluding our agreement was to be incorporated in the economic system of the other party to the proposed agreement, and that we could sign on the dotted line or take the consequences?  We have never known what it meant to feel that wind blow about us.  How would we like it if we had the experience?</P>
    <P>We claim the right to move about <Col N="1456" /> the world quite freely.  Have any Deputies ever asked themselves why are the oceans of the world free to the passage of peace-loving men?  Is it not because the British Navy and the United States Navy police them?  Is it not because we have come to know, in recent years, that where the Stars and Stripes and the much-abused Union Jack float there is usually the rule of law and there is also substantial justice for a peaceful man going about his legitimate work?  Anyone who has travelled the five seas of the world knows that; but supposing that for the British flag and the Stars and Stripes, and the French Tricolour, you substitute the Nazi Swastika and the Japanese Sun, and travel the world under that dispensation, and live in the world controlled by that combination, I wonder how much our liberty-loving Irish democrats will like it? Supposing that we make up our minds that we would not like it, that that system of world relations, based on our knowledge of what the United States and Great Britain and France stand for, is more to our liking than what would be substituted by the combination of the so-called Anti-Komintern Pact, can we, as an independent nation, in the event of a conflict between these forces in the world, proclaim that we are disinterested, that we stand aside and do not give a hoot which side wins?  In our own interests, thinking of nothing but Ireland, is it wise to do it?  Remember that we have now got upon us the sometimes appalling duty to determine what is Ireland's interest in the far wider sphere of world politics than we have had to face during the 700 years that we were subject to Great Britain.  During those 700 years we had no problem except the one&mdash;and that was to get the British out of Ireland.  We could ignore world development, and the only hope we had was that some major disaster would overtake Great Britain which would enable us to shake off our yoke.  That was our only interest in international affairs.  Having got Great Britain out of the country, we now stand alone in the storm-swept world when we are taking counsel as to how Ireland's interest might best be served, and it is a responsibility that we have got to <Col N="1457" /> grow up to take now, or we might do a desperate harm to the long life that lies before the Irish nation.  I put it to the House that, in the event of the kind of conflict taking place that threatens now in Europe, we could not be indifferent to the issue, that it is vital to Ireland that one side should win.  If that is true, I wonder has the Government considered certain contingencies that may arise?</P>
    <P>Deputy Professor O'Sullivan pointed out that in any future world conflict, the United States of America, willingly or unwillingly, is almost certain to be drawn in.  Supposing that she were, what would our reaction be to a request from the United States of America for harbour facilities in our ports?  It seems likely that the safe conduct of troops&mdash;never mind food or supplies&mdash; from across the Atlantic would largely depend on the defence accommodation that could be enjoyed in our ports. Would our attitude to the United States of America, smashed by the Nazi-Japanese combine, and menaced as she may be, be that we do not give a hoot, that we were neutral, would take no sides, give her no accommodation, and if her ships sank, would allow just so many of her crew on our shores as could swim ashore, and then intern them here?  Or would we say to her: &ldquo;You are welcome to all the hospitality of every kind that we can offer, and anybody who does not like that, anyone who has any complaint about our bidding your men welcome and giving you all the comfort and help that we can, can lump it&rdquo;?  Has the Government considered that?  If they have not, I think they ought to.</P>
    <P>I do not demand that the Government should come out and lay down a cast-iron policy on Monday or on Tuesday, because we all know that in the dynamic state of world affairs what may be the appropriate policy on Monday may be quite out-moded on Tuesday. But what I do ask is, that the Government will consider the contingencies that may arise in the light of Ireland's interests, and that the Government, having determined how best Ireland's interests might be served, will have the courage to give the country the lead on the right road.  I <Col N="1458" /> think it right to say now that no Government in this country could contemplate sending an expeditionary force to Europe, no matter on what side we are involved, no matter how deeply interested we were in one side or the other prevailing, because we have neither got the equipment nor the resources to equip an effective expeditionary force in any European enterprise.  Any force we might despatch, mixed in the mighty armies with all their equipment, in a European conflict, would serve no useful purpose and could give no really useful aid.</P>
    <P>I think it is expedient to state that now.  I feel that it may be expedient to state other things now, but we who are in this position of opposition, must recognise that the Government may have information which has not been communicated to us, which stays their hand, imposes upon them a greater measure of reticence than such information as we have would suggest was necessary.  Whatever measure of reticence they may determine to impose upon themselves, no consideration should exonerate them from the responsibility of examining these questions in their own council and in reaching very definite conclusions upon them.  These conclusions once reached, they should take effective measures to prepare our people for the things that it is necessary in defence of the interests of Ireland to do: to prepare our people to be equal to the task, the immense responsibility (1) of recognising what is the true interest of Ireland, and (2) of showing the courage, moral as well as physical, of doing that, recognising that the interest of Ireland to-day may demand action which it requires very real moral courage on the part of some people to advocate.</P>
    <P>God forbid that at this first really great crisis of our independence, the first time that we faced the world in turmoil as an independent nation, any past history, any reluctance to face facts, any poverty of moral courage, should paralyse our efforts, should prevent us from doing the things we ought to do if we are to play our part in preserving, not only for ourselves but for <Col N="1459" /> the whole world, liberty, decency, democracy and, above all, the right to render unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's, and to God the things that are God's.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is no Deputy here who does not appreciate the gravity of the situation and the responsibility which rests upon the Government in the present international crisis.  My object in rising is simply to offer one suggestion, a very small suggestion, perhaps.  Why is it not possible for the members of the Government and the leaders of the Opposition Party to meet in consultation, as they do in other countries where the Party system prevails? Ministers may say, perhaps, that the Opposition Party here have nothing to offer to them by way of advice or information or help.  I think, however, there are few who will not appreciate that the leaders of the Opposition Party are men who have for a number of years carried on their shoulders the responsibility of Government and I am sure they feel to the fullest extent the gravity of the present situation.  I am sure they are sufficiently patriotic to give all that is best in them to help the Government to arrive at the wisest and most prudent decisions on questions affecting the interests, if not the very existence of this country. For that reason I think that while it is right and proper that this Parliament as the representative national assembly should discuss matters of external interest frankly and openly, there are many aspects of international affairs which can only be effectively dealt with in conference between the leaders of both big Parties in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of this question. At the present time there is great need for calmness and confidence amongst our citizens.  We know that the Opposition Party command the confidence of a fairly considerable section of the citizens and the fact that they are in consultation with the Government on matters relating to external affairs would be reassuring, at least to their supporters, and would <Col N="1460" /> for that reason strengthen the national position.  We know that in times such as we are living through any decisions taken may have the most far-reaching effects.  Any mistake made by the Government may result in complete disaster, not only for the material interests of the country, but even for the very independence of the nation, because that, too, may be at stake. Therefore, I think there should be no hesitation whatever on the part of the leaders of both Parties, whatever differences may exist between them or whatever differences may have existed in the past, in consulting with the fullest possible confidence and frankness.</P>
    <P>Some of the statements made by Deputy O'Sullivan are such that I think this House could not entirely accept them.  I do not think the people of Ireland would be prepared to go as far as Deputy O'Sullivan has gone in supporting one side against the other in the present international crisis.  I think the people of Ireland realise that no matter how much sympathy they may feel with the United States, perhaps, or with Great Britain, in the present position in which they find themselves, they must recognise that this nation cannot offer a sufficient military contribution to justify them in taking sides.  We also must realise that in the last Great War this country made the greatest of all blunders, and that was the blunder of taking sides with two of the great opposing Powers. In the early stages of the war we had this country definitely on the side of Great Britain and her Allies, and when the war had gone on for two years we were definitely as a nation on the opposite side.  That was a position which should never have been allowed to develop. That is a position which must not be allowed to develop in the future; yet it is a position which could develop unless our leaders are extremely careful, and for that reason I think the whole situation should be carefully considered, and considered in consultation between the Leaders of both big Parties in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Dillon made some complaint that I had not spoken perhaps as fully on the <Col N="1461" /> international situation and our relation to it as I might.  I think that there is hardly any question on which our people are so well instructed as this, strange as it may appear to Deputy Dillon and to some others who have spoken.  The difficulty in this country has been one fact, that is, that the people see now, as they have seen in the past, a certain aggression, and that they naturally ask themselves, if this is going to continue, does it matter very much for us who it is that is engaged in European wars?  Now, I know that that attitude is not the attitude of some of the members on the Opposition Benches, but the last speaker has indicated how, at the beginning of the war, in 1914, the majority probably of the people in this country was on one side and how, before the war was ended, the majority was on the other side.  The reason for that is clear&mdash; and anybody who has lived through it knows why&mdash;because that war, on one side, was said to be a war for the freedom of small nations and, if it were really to be a war for the freedom of small nations, our people could not help saying to themselves: &ldquo;If that be so, why is this small nation, which is older than any of them, and which has been working for its independence and struggling for it for centuries, deprived of its independence when the freeing of it required no war to be fought?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We may have strong views about certain things, and the members on the opposite benches are at far greater liberty to talk about them than I am, but the fundamental thing which is going to affect Irish public opinion is whether we have, as a nation, that independence which is our right.  It is useless to say that these things can be put aside.  They are fundamental in the thought of our people here and, before there can be any question of our entering into any type of crusade, that question has got to be settled for our people.  I know Deputy Dillon would say that the other evil is greater.  You will have difficulty in convincing people that an evil which is a threatened evil is going to be greater than the evil that exists.  It is because I want our own people here, who are interested in <Col N="1462" /> the big issues at stake, to realise what is fundamental in the thought of those who do not take their view at the moment that I say these things aloud. I think them.  I might, perhaps, have kept them to myself were it not for the fact that I am asked by the Opposition to talk frankly on these matters.</P>
    <P>Now, with due deliberation, the Government has set the aim of its policy, in the present circumstances, to preserving a position of neutrality.  We believe that no other position would be accepted by the majority of our people as long as the present position exists and, in taking up that position, we are fully alive to all its difficulties and all its responsibilities.  I tried on a previous occasion when we were speaking here on this subject to indicate what these difficulties were likely to be.  I did not go into it in detail but, under present conditions, very little ought to be sufficient for thinking people to understand the situation for themselves.  Perhaps I am wrong, but I give credit to our people for having as sound general political sense as any people in the world.  They have shown that, I think, throughout their history.  Therefore, I think it is not necessary to go into the detail which members of the Opposition seem to think necessary in order that our people should be fully alive to the dangers and responsibilities of the present situation.  However, as I have been asked to do so, perhaps I should go into some of these details a little bit more than I have done.</P>
    <P>The position is very different now from what it was in 1914-18, as far as we, in this part of the country, are concerned.  The difference is this&mdash;a fundamental difference&mdash;that in 1914 our wishes had nothing to say to the matter.  We had no Government here that was responsible for safeguarding the interests of our own people.  The British Government were here at the time.  On them fell the responsibility of making arrangements for supplies of whatever kind were necessary, as well as for the &ldquo;general protection,&rdquo; as they put it.  They were responsible for seeing that, as far as it could be possible in war-time, the trade which was <Col N="1463" /> fundamental for the life of our country should be continued, and so on.  The British Government have no responsibility now for matters of that sort.  We have the responsibility, and a very heavy responsibility it is.  We know perfectly well that the supply of the materials which we will need if there is a prolonged war will largely have to come in here on British ships.  No other ships will be available anyhow, as long as Britain has command of the sea.  We have not the ships ourselves to bring them in.  It is necessary for us, for our economic life, to continue our trade and to send out the agricultural produce, with which we have to purchase these other materials which we require.  Therefore, it is necessary for the Government to make arrangements with the British Government so that these essential services should continue. I want also to get people to remember that, during a time of war, life here cannot go on exactly as it goes on in these times.  The moment a great war begins essential supplies will be very difficult to get.  Some of our industries will have to close down after a relatively short period, for want of the raw materials for their products. Take, for example, the motor assembling industry.  The building industry, for want of timber, may have to slacken down, and close down after a particular period.  Therefore we shall have here in this country a very serious problem with regard to employment. We may expect, also, to have a large number of our people who are temporarily resident in Britain coming over. Our transport is bound to be seriously affected by the difficulty there is likely to be in getting sufficient petrol.</P>
    <P>I have a long list here of other directions in which the normal life of this country will be affected.  I do not want to give them all in detail, but I have said enough to indicate that those who think they will not be affected by a war, even if we are neutral&mdash;as I hope we will be able to remain&mdash;and that our life here will go on as if there was not a great war at all, are making a very big mistake. The experience of the last war will have taught outside Governments also &mdash;will have taught the British Government, <Col N="1464" /> for example&mdash;that it is necessary to control prices, and the help which on the last occasion the increase in agricultural prices was to this country may not be there any longer. No one, then, could really exaggerate the seriousness of the difficulties which will confront this country if war should break out.  We want, therefore, from everybody in the country the co-operation which alone will enable us to surmount those difficulties. I was glad to see by the speeches which were made from the Opposition Benches to-day&mdash;I am not to be taken as agreeing with many of the things that were said, and perhaps it is just as well for us on each side of the House to avoid going too much into this fray, even in words&mdash; that members on the Opposition Benches realised the gravity of the situation, and the difficulties that would present themselves to this country if a war should break out.  If that spirit prevails throughout the country in regard to those who support the Parties that are represented here, I have no doubt whatever that, despite the gravity of the difficulties, we can surmount them.  We will have difficulties at the start.  There is no doubt whatever about it.  We must be prepared to be patient with those, because it is quite impossible for a small country like ours to make such provision in advance as would enable us to be fully prepared to meet all those difficulties.  The cost would be tremendous, and at the present time even if we were prepared to take the risks involved we could hardly purchase some of those supplies.  In any case, the cost, regarded from an insurance point of view, would be so terrific that we could not adequately provide for all the difficulties that will face us, any more than we could for instance adequately provide armaments which would ensure us against attack from any quarter.  It is well, then, that the seriousness of the situation should be understood by our people, and, if the debate has the effect of bringing that seriousness home to everybody, and making everybody realise the importance of unity in effort, it will certainly have served a good purpose.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1465" /> My dislike to having the debate at this time was due to the fact that I was anxious that the matters on which we differ&mdash;and we do differ, I think the Deputies on the opposite benches will be the first to admit, on a number of fundamental things&mdash;would not be the cause at this particular time of weakening any spirit of co-operation that there is in the country.  It is true, as Deputy Dillon said, that we are facing a situation which this nation had not to face for centuries, if it ever had to face a similar situation before.  We have not had the experience of looking ahead and making all the provision which other nations who have had to face great wars before have had.  We can look and learn from their experience, as far as possible, but the situation is going to be a completely new one for our people.  I hope that those who were alive in 1914, and were able to understand political situations at that time, will not make the mistake of thinking that the situation to-day, as far as this nation is concerned, is exactly the same as it was in 1914&mdash; for it is not.  If this fundamental difficulty that we have in getting agreement on political matters were not there&mdash;I refer again to the existence of Partition&mdash;it would be a relatively easy task to get the unity which is essential for our people in a crisis of this sort.  That is why I have been so anxious to try to get rid of it at all times.  I appreciate the element of truth that there is in the remark which Deputy Dillon made in regard to the Northern situation.  I have said, too, that we want not the territory alone, but the hearts of the people there as well.  I have said that recently a number of times, and Deputy Dillon was but using practically the same words as I have used in that connection. We do not want to coerce anybody, but we do say&mdash;and we must continue to say it, as it is a basic truth &mdash;that a section of our countrymen up there are being coerced.  There is a section of our people who are at this moment undergoing coercion&mdash;the people in South Down, South Armagh, Tyrone, Fermanagh, Derry City.  The people in all that area&mdash;as I have said already this evening, in practically all <Col N="1466" /> the area except that east of the Bann&mdash; are being held in that situation against their will.  It is not we, then, who are proposing coercion at all.</P>
    <P>Coercion is in existence against portion of our people, and there is no use in saying that that at a time of crisis should not do damage.  It is there, and it is doing damage, and that is going to be fundamental in the views of our people in this crisis.  I am sure everybody on the opposite benches realises its fundamental importance as much as I realise it, and that they will admit that the things we have been trying to do&mdash;they may not agree that they are essential, or that they are vital&mdash;and whatever element of success has attended our efforts, have removed certain causes of misunderstanding between Great Britain and ourselves.  I think they will also admit that if this final difficulty were removed the vast majority of the people of the country would desire to be on friendly relations with those in the neighbouring island.  The whole aim of Government policy is to get that situation right.  So far as the war situation is concerned, we believe it is in the interests of our people&mdash;as we have here a small nation which has suffered severely for centuries&mdash;to try to avoid being involved in that struggle.  That the issues are great, and that we cannot afford to be indifferent to them, I shall admit; but at the same time our people here will consider that their first and primary object must be to try to get here that freedom for the whole country which our people have been, on every occasion on which there was a crisis for 700 years, trying to secure. I do not think that I need say anything more.</P>

    <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £8,506 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith inïoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1940, chun Sïntiús mar chabhair do Chostaisí Chumann na <Col N="1467" /> Náisiún, agus chun Costaisí eile mar gheall air sin.</P>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £8,506 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1940, for a Contribution towards the Expenses of the League of Nations, and for other Expenses in connection therewith.</P>
    <P>Deputies will see that the total amount of the Vote is £12,806, of which £11,641 is for charges in respect of the contribution to the League of Nations.  Deputies will also remember, from previous discussions on this Vote, that our contribution is ten units out of 917.  The extra sum over and above the contribution, £975, is intended to meet the expenses of the usual delegation to the League.  There is also a sum of £250 which is required to make up the difference between the par value of the Swiss franc and the current rate.  There is likely to be a conference this year on matters relating to rural life to which we propose to send a delegation.  That is as far as the items of the Vote itself are concerned.</P>
    <P>With regard to the present position of the League of Nations, Deputies are aware that the League has not been able to exert anything like a decisive influence or, in fact, any real, appreciable influence on world affairs during the past year.  That work has been mainly done by diplomatic action outside the League.  It may appear to some that the present position of the League is such that no good purpose could be served by our continuing to belong to it.  I do not agree with that view.  I think that there is in the League a certain element of support, though I will admit that in the past it has not proved itself decisively effective, for small nations and for things for which small nations stand. Besides the political activities of the League, which at the moment are largely in abeyance, as I said, there are the technical and the social sides. When I say the social side, I am referring to its relations with the International Labour Office and its activities <Col N="1468" /> in regard to social services in the various countries.  Work at the League in that direction is proceeding, as far as 40 or 50 States are concerned, in an undiminished degree, and I hope that we, at any rate, will not set the example at the present time of leaving the League.  I do not know if a conference between the great Powers, which I have suggested, might take place in the hope of trying to get some peaceful adjustment of their difficulties. If that does not take place, and if there is unfortunately another terrible war, it will end, as all wars in the past have ended.  When it is ended there will have to be a conference, and there is bound to be again some effort at trying to get a rational way in which disputes between nations can be settled or adjusted.</P>
    <P>The old League of Nations had one fundamental fault, in my opinion, and that was, that it was linked up with the treaties that followed the war. These treaties, in their nature, were treaties that were imposed by those who had been the victors on those who had been the vanquished.  It was a fatal mistake to link them up in any way with the Covenant.  The Articles of the Covenant which provided for adjustments were never really availed of.  I am certain that if there is another great war and there is an ending to it, those left in the nations afterwards will not be satisfied unless some effort is again made to have some rational basis of security.  The experience that has been gained over the last 20 years or so, in regard to the League of Nations, will be of value and the mistakes that have been made, the things that should have been done and were not done, will be of value for the future.  I know that there is a very large number of people who are quite cynical about any such idea.  Their idea is that the world has been unified, in so far as it has been unified in the past, not by the willing coming together of nations but by their being forced into units in which the stronger absorb the weaker.  They will say that that is the lesson of history.  There have been some cases in which that has not been quite true, but the hope of mankind now does lie in the possibility <Col N="1469" /> that nations will, for the greater advantage which peace and security will give them, make adjustments or submit to a rule of law which will make it possible to avoid the method of resolving their differences by force.  It would be to despair of mankind to think otherwise.  It is because I have that hope that I think this nation ought not to do what may be suggested by a number of people&mdash;leave the League at the present time.</P>
    <P>We have made it clear with other nations that we do not regard Article 16, in the sense in which some people interpret it, as at all in force under present conditions.  We have made it quite clear that sanctions, military or economic, are out of the question as politics to-day; and to prevent the League in any way being used as an alliance by one set of Powers against another we have refused even to accept any definition of &ldquo;aggressor&rdquo; by the organs of the League as binding upon us.  That is a matter which we assert and have made clear that we intend to keep as a matter which we ourselves must determine as we see it. We have made that position quite clear in the League Assembly, and I do not think there is any misunderstanding of our position anywhere.</P>
    <P>On the whole, then, I think that we should continue our membership, and that we should avail, as we are availing, of the technical services which the League is rendering; that we should do everything in our power to improve these non-political activities of the League, and that, if it is at all possible to use the League as a rallying point for all those who believe in peaceful methods of settling disputes, we should continue to do so.  For that reason, I am asking the House to pass this Vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>With what the Taoiseach has said, I am substantially in agreement.  I admit that at present the League is little more than a flyblow, but I am very much of the opinion voiced by the Taoiseach that we should not contribute in the slightest to its further collapse.  It would be a very easy thing for a person to point out that the proper thing <Col N="1470" /> would be to desert the League.  What good is it?  What good was it ever? That is easy to say at the present time. Yet I feel that it would be unjust so far as the activities of the League in the past are concerned, and that it would be unwise to identify ourselves with a policy of that kind.  True, the League has to bow its head at the present moment.  Its voice is certainly not heard in the major international affairs that interest the world.  That is clear to everybody.  But I should be long sorry to think that we would ally ourselves with those who have left the League for different motives, and I feel that, especially now, to take the step of leaving the League would only be read in one way&mdash;here is another nation throwing in its lot definitely on one side.  Staying in the League does not commit us to any such thing. Leaving the League would.</P>
      <P>As regards those cynical people who, as I have said more than once in this House, have by their wise cynicism been throwing cold water on any effort to save mankind from the catastrophe which now faces it, they might ask themselves if what has followed the League has succeeded much better. The Taoiseach pointed out that at present you have international conferences. They have taken the place of the League.  Is anybody in this House, or even the most cynical person in the country, satisfied with that particular method of settling international disputes?</P>
      <P>It is not, therefore, on a question of the advantages, which are no doubt considerable, that we might get out of the technical operations of the League that I am glad the Government is not deserting the League at present.  It is because at times in the past the League did step in and possibly save Europe from facing a situation such as it is facing to-day. It is easy to forget that the years after 1918 and 1920 were not such easy years to get over.  There was many a dispute which might have led to a major quarrel in Europe that was overcome by the efforts of the League.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing that always impressed me &mdash;possibly to some minds it was a weakness of the League&mdash;was the <Col N="1471" /> influence wielded there by the small nations.  Perhaps there was an element of unreality about that which might not appeal to the modern-wise, realist statesmen, but it was a reality during a number of years.  I have seen representatives of the greatest Powers not merely using their strength to get support from the smaller Powers, but being genuinely anxious to convince the representatives of the small Powers that their point of view was right.  The League did represent in its best years a kind of solid European public opinion that the different Powers of Europe were quite anxious to court and that they did obviously court.  When I see the position of the small nations to-day, every one of them, as I said on the last debate, trembling, anxious to save their skins, and not sure whether they will have any skins to save in a year or two, when I see the situation everywhere in Europe at present; and when I compare that situation with the situation that I knew 13 or 14 years ago when the League was a reality, I should be the last, with any sense of European responsibility, to cast any stone at the League.  It had its weaknesses undoubtedly.  One of them was mentioned by the Taoiseach.  I do not know how such a thing will be avoidable in the future.  Supposing you have conferences with the big Powers to-day and they settle on the basis of the present territorial distribution in Europe, can anybody regard that as satisfactory?  Even if there were not further conquests by the big central Power of which I spoke on the last Vote, can anybody regard even the Munich settlement as a satisfactory one on which to base any future settlement of the world?  It is a pity that these definite treaties settling boundaries were made a portion of a covenant like the League of Nations Covenant.  It is very hard to know whether it is avoidable or not.</P>
    <P>But there was another fault, and I think it did help to some extent to explain the gradual eclipse of the League&mdash;I think it was inclined to go too fast.  I am sure the same charge has been made against governments in <Col N="1472" /> various countries, that they would run ahead of the views of their constituents. I think the body of men who met at Geneva, and perhaps especially the civil servants at Geneva, were inclined to run ahead of European public opinion, and to attempt more than the public of Europe was educated up to.  I do not say that they attempted to do what was unjust.  I say that it was unwise to go so quickly, because Europe was not sufficiently prepared, and that no State, great or small, was prepared to make the necessary sacrifices.  There were some States that I might preeminently call good League States, generally the Northern States that had no reason to do otherwise, that might be relied on always to take a definite and an impartial League view.  At one time or another there was the danger &mdash;and I do not see how it will be overcome as long as human nature is what it is&mdash;of different States trying to use the League for their own purposes.  At one time it was France, and at another time England.  At one time England had no use for the League, if I might use that expression.  Then she determined to use it.  At one time Russia scoffed at the League and everything connected with it as being the embodiment of the bourgeoisie, and standing for everything that was discreditable and hypocritical, but that view changed in a couple of years.  That, I am afraid, is an evil that cannot be got rid of.  What is being done at the moment?  What is the hope of Europe, or, at least, what was the hope?  Is &ldquo;hope&rdquo; too strong a word?  When President Roosevelt sent out his message the basis of it was the setting up of a new League.  That proposition, remember, came from a statesman removed to some extent from European affairs.  It came from the head of a nation that itself had stood apart from the original League, and had stood apart, possibly, for good reasons of its own.  By standing apart from the original League it, to some extent, undermined its authority, yet that nation now comes forward with a suggestion for a new League, or something like it.  If you want to get any reasonable settlement or, apart from <Col N="1473" /> an institution like the League, to get any method of preventing things coming to the edge of war, because once they come to the edge of war I am afraid the League will be no use, it is hard to know how to do it.  What is the position with the breakdown of the League?</P>
    <P>At present there are diplomatic negotiations amongst the Powers. What is the result?  The situation we were discussing this afternoon.  Is that a condemnation of the League?  The worldly-wise people have now triumphed.  They have won victory over the idealists, and won a victory from the League.  See the magnificent mess they have made of the world. What is the system that prevails at present?  What are the western Powers trying to do?  According to themselves they are now forming a League of Peace.  If you take their professions at their face value, that is what is happening.  Is it possible for these Powers to restore confidence in Northern and Eastern Europe?  Look at the efforts of the past 12 months. What prospect is there of a restoration of confidence?  What Power in east Europe, that is not an immense Power like Russia, can have any confidence in anything that is done in the way of international negotiation of any kind? I think it was in the month of October that a meeting of the French Radical Party was held.  I am not sure of the designation of the different French political parties, but there was a meeting in Marseilles, just when the fire occurred there, and one speaker after another, including M. Heriot and M. Bonnet, got up and said that collective security was at an end; that the fate of Czecho-Slovakia destroyed collective security.  It destroyed something which was more fundamental than collective security.  It destroyed not collective security, because it did not come into play, but the ordinary method of trying to bring about international understanding between one State and another.  That is what was killed.  It was buried last March. That was already done by the very people and by various countries that are now trying to resuscitate either <Col N="1474" /> peace through the sword, or else a new League of Peace without aggression.</P>
    <P>I should be very sorry if this country, particularly at the present moment, whatever may happen in the future, would take the step of resigning from the League.  It would be symbolic.  It would be another useful weapon of propaganda for those who have always thrown scorn, not merely on collective security, but also on peace as something that was good in itself.  I spoke of small nations and mentioned their position to-day, and I meant to go on to point out what was the position before.  Everyone of them had a feeling of absolute security 12 years ago.  There was no fear of aggression from a neighbour, and no fear of being overrun by a big Power.</P>
    <P>We were one of the smallest nations and, as the Taoiseach knows, we were not afraid to get up to give our view, no matter how opposed it was to that of Great Britain, France or Germany, and sometimes we were listened to effectively.  Is that the position at the present day?  The result of the ordinary return to common sense? That is what we have at the present day.  We are now facing up to a new League and to a return to common sense.  Small nations were particularly powerful there in the old League days. I admit that they were powerful beyond their real strength.  That was the great thing to be said in favour of the League.  That sense of security for them was there for a number of years notwithstanding the intrigues of this or that Power.  There was a feeling of European solidarity.  For reasons that we need not go into that has been undermined.  Everyone knows that if we are not to have a continuance of the present crisis after crisis, and if it does not end in a great war, that even after a great war some machinery must be set up.  Of course, there were difficulties.  Every Power was anxious for the application of justice to every other Power but they made mental reservations where their own interests, great or small, were concerned.  Every nation was anxious that every other Power should observe not only international but also the moral law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1475" /> There was not enough, perhaps, of flexibility in the arrangements.  When I look back to September last year I wonder whether people think of some of the things involved in the defence made for the Munich Agreement.  I have heard defenders of the Munich Agreement say: &ldquo;After all, is it not only quite fair that the Germans got what they were entitled to?&rdquo;  If that were so, and if they only got what they were entitled to, why was there a danger of a war?  Who was responsible for bringing Europe to the pitch of a war of such a nature if one State only got what it was entitled to?  The people who were making that defence on these grounds apparently forgot that they implied that the Western Powers were not quick enough to see the justice of their neighbours' cause. Apart from that, however, if you call that an example&mdash;and I should be sorry indeed to hint that that defence was seriously meant&mdash;there was a slowness, and there was no proper machinery for bringing about a peaceful change.  If there is any machinery in the future to be set up, somehow or other, that will have to be provided for.  It is a pity that all nations, great and small, never give way except to the threat of force, and never give way to the decent demands of justice, but always to the threat of force.</P>
    <P>That is what has happened with regard to certain Powers in Europe&mdash;that when there were decent demands for ordinary justice, the great Powers ignored them.  The great Powers adopted the bad political method of teaching, of giving way only to threats. Undoubtedly, the League of Nations did good work, and that it failed to do its full work is largely due to the selfishness of these Powers, none of which was concerned about the demands of justice or its neighbours, and also to the cheap cynicism that a lot of people poured on the League itself&mdash;merely because it was symbolical of collective security.  But we can still cherish a belief in its return.  For that reason I am glad that the Government is not leaving the League at the present time.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister concludes, I should like to ask him if he can give us any information about the migrants from the Gaeltacht to the good lands, in view of statements that have been made in various places?  I should like to know if the Minister would make an authoritative statement on the position with regard to these migrants.  From any private contacts that I have been able to make, or from any private sources of information, it seems to me that all the evidence points out that these migrants have been an unqualified success; their present position is far better than it was at any time in the past in the places from which they came, and I think that the time has come when the Minister ought to be able to give us detailed information as to the present economic position of these people and their prospects for the future.  I am sure that the Land Commission has been able to supply the Minister with detailed information on this matter, and perhaps he could tell us what their prospects are for the future, and how they have done for the short time they have been there.  I think that a statement of that kind is due from the Minister, and I would ask him to make it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. G. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I dare say, Sir, that it would be just as well to deal with Deputy Bartley's question first.  I had intended to deal with that matter anyhow, because it was raised by several Deputies.  I think Deputy McMenamin raised it, but at any rate the matter was raised by a number of people, and I am in the position of being able to inform the House that we have gone into the question of some of these holdings in detail, especially with regard to the Gibbstown colony.  We have heard a lot of talk about what is an economic holding, and I am prepared to admit that it would have been better if we could have given more land to these people, but as it is, in these cases, 22 acres is the minimum.  There is no such thing as 20 acres; 22 acres is the minimum and, in future, there will <Col N="1477" /> probably be a little more.  Although we cannot claim that a family are going to have, let us say, a very prosperous time on these small holdings, still, compared with what they have left, their position is very satisfactory indeed, I think.  I have here four cases from that colony which, I am given to understand by the people who made the investigation, are typical cases.  They may be the best cases, but I have been assured that they are based on typical cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>They are average farms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, 22-acre holdings. What was done here was that the holdings these people left in their own areas have been compared with those to which they have gone, and the position in each case is set out here, and I think that, when I have read this out, it will at least satisfy the House and the country that the position of these people has been very much improved, indeed.  One of the usual criticisms has been that a lot of the people from these holdings have been migrated.  It seems to be expected by some people that the farms we are giving to these migrants ought to be able to maintain more than one family. Apparently, Deputy McMenamin knows the difference, but judging by some of the criticisms we have heard from some quarters it seems to have been expected that these small holdings should have been able to maintain a grown-up adult family in addition to the parents.  In fact, one paper, published at the present time, gave articles week after week, pointing out the emigration from these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, everybody knows that, no matter how big a farm is, only a certain number of people will remain on it. Other members of the family will go into the cities and towns.  If the farm is a big farm, certain members will go into various professions or into businesses in the cities and towns, and, in the case of small farms, certain members of the family will look for work elsewhere than on the farm.  Everybody knows that that is so; and that is what is happening with regard to these <Col N="1478" /> small holdings.  I thought that Deputy Norton was referring, when he spoke the other day, to the heads of houses looking for work on the roads.  I am quite certain that that has not happened. We have only transferred 90 families so far.  I am hoping that, with the remaining land we have available&mdash; which, it will be understood, is a dwindling amount&mdash;it will be mainly devoted to the relief of congestion which still, unfortunately, exists on the Western seaboard.  That is the Government's intention.  The cost is pretty high, but we hope that it will not be as high in future as it has been with regard to these first cases.  At any rate, we shall try to look for people who may be able to give some assistance themselves. The total cost of these holdings is about £960; that is, about £320 in excess of what it would take to put a landless man on to the same-sized holding. It must be taken into consideration that, in the case of a congest, he has surrendered his original holding, which goes to relieve, to a fair extent anyhow, the acute congestion in his immediate neighbourhood, and that has been forgotten generally by people who make these criticisms and expect that the same treatment should be given to people who have nothing at all to give in exchange.  It should not be forgotten that these migrants have given up, or surrendered, something to their own immediate neighbours, and also that they have left their own districts.</P>
    <P>What has to be borne in mind is that the extra cost is about £320 per head. That is the maximum.  I hope that in the future we will be able to get a type of migrant who will not require more than about £120 over and above what it would take to provide a landless man with a holding.  As far as the landless men are concerned, I think there will not be very much land left for very many more of them.  We are going to concentrate on the migrants. I propose to give some details with regard to these migrants, because I am not going to allow myself to be accused of slurring over these things.  I have some figures here which I propose to give to the House so that the public may be able to get accurate information about them.  I propose to deal <Col N="1479" /> with four cases, two taken from Donegal, one from Kerry and one from Mayo.  The holdings are on the Major Gerrard estate at Gibbstown, County Kildare.  Here are the particulars of the first case, that of a migrant from Donegal.  His annuity and rates on his new holding amount to £19 2s. 4d.; what he paid by way of annuity and rates on his old holding was £3 15s. 10d.  As Deputies will observe, there is a big difference between the two figures.  The sales of stock and produce at Gibbstown for the year 1938 amounted in this man's case to £187 6s. 0d.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what was realised for what was sold off the farm, exclusive of what he retained for the maintenance of himself and his wife. Later, I propose to give to the House full details of a case as regards what was consumed on the farm and what was actually sold off it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not able to tell the Deputy at the moment, but I may be able to get the information for him later.  He got stock, but I am not sure if he got implements as well.  I will be able to tell the Deputy about that later.  The value of the stock and produce on his hands, having disposed during the year of what I have already mentioned, was £269.  That is how he stood after selling all that produce off the farm.</P>

      <P>A 22-acre farm.  The value of the stock and produce on his old holding in the Gaeltacht in March, 1937, was £79 5s. 0d.  The next case is also of a Donegal migrant.  The annuity and rates on his new holding amount to £15 7s. 0d.  On the old <Col N="1480" /> holding they only amounted to 12/-. His sales of produce and stock off his new holding at Gibbstown amounted to £154 8s. 0d., and off his old holding in the Gaeltacht to £23 18s. 0d.  I would draw the attention of the House to the big difference in that man's position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I will do that before I conclude.  The value of the stock supplied to that man by the Land Commission was £152 10s. 0d.  The value of the stock and produce on his hands in March, 1938, was £194.  The value of the stock and produce on his hands on his old holding in the Gaeltacht in March, 1937, was £25 2s. 6d.</P>
      <P>Take the case of the Kerry migrant. His annuity and rates on his new holding at Gibbstown amount to £17 6s 6d. On the old holding in Kerry they amounted to £8.  He was paying more in the case of his old holding than the two migrants from Donegal.  The sale of stock and produce off his new holding in 1938, amounted to £179 13s. 2d., while what he sold off his old holding in March, 1937 amounted to £67 14s. 0d. The value of stock supplied to this migrant by the Land Commission was £62 10s. 0d.  He got less than the others.  The value of stock and produce in the hands of this migrant in March, 1939, was £334 10s. 0d., while the value of the stock and produce on his old holding in the Gaeltacht in March, 1937 was £151.  We got all this from the migrants themselves&mdash;that is to what they had at that period.  We have to take what they say for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next case is that of the migrant from Mayo.  The annuity and the rates on his new holding amount to £16 17s. 6d.  On the old holding they were £4 6s. 0d.  The sale of stock and produce off the new holding in 1938 amounted to £144 4s. 2d. while off the old holding they amounted to £30&mdash; that is in March, 1937.  The value of the stock supplied to this migrant by the Land Commission was £145 10s. 0d. The value of stock and produce in his hands in March, 1939, was £267.  The <Col N="1481" /> value of the stock and produce off his old holding in the Gaeltacht in March, 1937, was £68.  These figures are very illuminating.  I cannot say whether every migrant on these new holdings is in the position of these men.  I have been assured, however, by a very reliable official, a man who has had great experience in charge of these migration schemes, that these figures are typical of the migrants generally. There may be some who have not done quite as well, but, taking the migrants generally, they are doing very well and have justified themselves.</P>

The total value of the stock supplied to this migrant on the Gibbstown colony was £155 10s. 0d.  I have said that the horse was worth £35; four cows, £55, and five two-year old cattle, £62 10s. 0d.  He sold five two-year olds and three one and a half year olds.  He has the others on hands.  He has three six-months old calves valued at £18; one sow in pig, £8; one two-year old heifer, £12; poultry valued at £6 10s.; hay, £6; potatoes on hands, £36; seed oats, £3.  He will probably sell the potatoes now at a big price.  The total value amounts to £269.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Deputy to be clear on this point.  It is not my intention or purpose to deceive anybody. I only read out what the Land Commission gave these people.  They did not come in there empty-handed. Deputy Cosgrave was not present when I started to read out the figures. I did not say it was a balance sheet. What I am trying to do is this: to show what the income of these people <Col N="1483" /> is now as compared with their old position.  During the debate the point was raised that it was ridiculous to bring these people up to these allotments; that they were practically all failures.  Possibly they are not in as affluent a state as a person with 60 acres of land would be; still, compared with what they were doing in their old holdings, they are doing very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; no matter from what source he came, that is a thrifty holding now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with that case pretty fully, because Deputy Bartley asked me what I had to say about it. It is our intention as far as possible to see that the remaining land that comes into our hands is used for the relief of the acute congestion in the western seaboard and in Leitrim, and that the chances of landless men in the future, whatever Deputies Giles, Kelly and O'Reilly may say, will not be anything like as rosy as in the past. Deputy Norton, when speaking about these holdings, complained about the people who got them, that they were not working the holdings, that they were looking for work on the roads and on relief schemes, and not making a success of their farms.</P>
      <P>In some cases I would say that that is a correct description of the position, but it is not general.  In no case of these migrants to whom I am now referring has there been a failure of that kind.  If anything that we have done has been justified it is this migration attempt of ours even though I have to admit that the cost has been high. For the information of Deputy Cosgrave I may mention that the cost compared with the setting up of landless men in holdings was £320 as against £960.  That is the difference between this and the setting up of landless men in holdings.  We have also to bear in mind that the migrant in these cases surrendered his old holding and benefited six, and sometimes as many as ten, of his neighbours, whereas the landless men gave up nothing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the same position in my constituency.  The Land Commission do not propose to continue the practice of giving people new holdings or plots of land at a distance from their dwelling.  I find in my own constituency in Roscommon&mdash;and I know it is the same in Meath and other places&mdash;that there is great reluctance on the part of these people living in congested districts to leave and take up a better farm elsewhere. What the Land Commission is trying to do, and insisting on doing in order to relieve local congests, is to get people from these congested areas to move into new farms elsewhere so that the land that they vacate can be divided amongst their neighbours. Everybody knows that it is most unsatisfactory to have people in a holding with a field here and another field there a mile or a mile and a half away. The Government have laid down that policy and I, as the Minister for Lands, have directed the Land Commission that holdings are not to be given to people at a greater distance from their dwellings than a mile or a mile and a half at the outside.  The Government considers it a sound policy to get local congests to accept a holding elsewhere so as to allow their existing holdings to be divided amongst their neighbours. That is about the best way of dealing with congestion sometimes.</P>

      <P>There is nothing new in it, but, as Deputy Nally knows, there are cases in which additions were given quite a considerable distance away&mdash;up to two miles&mdash;and they have been most unsatisfactory.  I say that not alone have the local congests been considered, but, if anything, too much consideration <Col N="1485" /> has been given to other types of local people, and where the failures have been is where a lot of people, landless men, who were supposed to be good allottees&mdash;they may have deceived some inspector&mdash;got land and did not avail themselves of the opportunity given to them.  Some have not gone to live in their houses&mdash; I will not say a great number&mdash;but the Land Commission is determined that if they do not live in these houses and work these holdings, the holdings will be taken from them again.  Whatever opposition there may be to that, we will insist that they either work the holdings, and work them properly, or make way for somebody else who will.  They have been given this opportunity, and if they are not going to avail of it, we will get plenty of people who will.</P>

That is reasonable, and, very often, the house has not been built for three years after the land has been divided.  The Land Commission are very reasonable in that matter, but if they are satisfied that they have put the wrong man in the place, they are not going to leave him there, and everybody in the House should agree that they ought not to leave him there.</P>

Surely we are not to spend money for people to take the most out of the land and throw it aside then? Deputy McMenamin, in starting off his remarks, had a great deal to say about <i>nulla bona</i> returns, and he mentioned that there were 3,400 on hands. That is a big number, I admit, but it is not a very great percentage of the total holdings.  There are about 480,000 holdings, and the percentage is about 6 of the total.  I think that is not a very big percentage.</P>

It includes persons who never had stock at all&mdash;the type of person who sets his meadow.  I should like to see the percentage much less, but I do not think it is anything to be much alarmed about.  Some Deputy said that these people were the types of people who were in fear and trembling lest the land would be taken from them.  That is not the type of land we go for at all.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister look at this point?  I do not want to put a political question, but it is a matter of examination.  Is there one section of persons engaged in farming <Col N="1487" /> more hit by reason of the events of the last few years than another?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I know, but what I am at is whether there is a particular section more hit than another section. They can be divided into about ten classes&mdash;£10, £20, £30, £40 and £50 valuation and so on&mdash;and as you go up, there is greater employment on the farms.  If we are to make agriculture a success, we ought to see that the maximum number of persons is engaged in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but I cannot go into that detail now and I do not think the Deputy would expect me to go into such detail.  I am simply saying that so far as <i>nulla bona</i> returns are concerned, they are high, and I wish they were not so high, but I do not think that anybody could say that they are alarmingly high, as a percentage of the total.

      <P>Reference was made to the drastic powers to be taken in the new Bill.  There will be no drastic powers in the new Bill.  It will contain what we actually thought we passed previously.  A judge held that what we thought we had provided in the previous Act had not been provided. We are dealing with that in the new Bill and, in addition, with some things which were found to be necessary. A number of little things have been holding up the Land Commission in one way or another and we are trying to deal with these.  Consequently, there has been delay.  The main point to be dealt with is that raised in the decision given in the Maher case.  The point was raised in that case that the reference to the commissioners who are to make the decision was not to a specified number of commissioners but to &ldquo;the commissioners&rdquo;.  It was held that that meant all the commissioners. That made it impossible for us to proceed because two of these commissioners cannot possibly act in cases in which they may have to hear appeals. That is the main point we dealt with. Another section was held to be <i>ultra vires</i> under the old Constitution but that disappeared when the new Constitution was enacted.  The obstacle I referred to remained, however, and we have not been able to take any land compulsorily since then.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cogan made a great complaint about the collection of land annuities.  He started off by challenging our right to collect them and he was ruled out on that.  As he went so far, perhaps I may say that if the Deputy would use his influence with the people he represents to get them to make their cases to the Collection Branch, as Deputy Fagan has done, he would find that the Collection Branch would be very reasonable.  If he takes up an attitude of defiance, then the people concerned will have to take what they are getting.  People in his constituency made fools of themselves and allowed their cattle to go for practically nothing rather than make an arrangement, which they could easily have done, and which would have been fairly satisfactory to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know a case in which one man has <Col N="1491" /> ruined himself through his cussedness and pigheadedness.  There is no use in beating one's head against a stone wall.  We are going to collect these annuities, and if these methods are the only methods available, then we shall have to continue to employ them. As to the attitude taken up by Deputy Cogan and his organisation, we are certainly not going to give way.  If they have a proposition to make, they will find that the Collection Branch are not going to drive people out of production altogether.  They have never done that.  Every Deputy who has ever had occasion to make a case to the Collection Branch admits that they are reasonable.</P>

      <P>The Deputy could get very few people to say that.  As regards the members of the squad, the Minister for Justice is responsible for them, though it is at the instance of the Minister for Lands that they are working.  Deputy Gorey raised a question about costs.  He said the costs in some cases were given against the tenant.  I understand that the <Col N="1492" /> reason for that was that he objected to the standard land purchase annuity. It was the tenant who started the proceedings and, that being the case, he had to pay the costs.  If he had accepted what was fixed, and had not brought proceedings, there would have been no question of costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I mentioned the circumstances quite clearly.  The tenant objected to the standard purchase annuity.  The Land Commission sent down a valuer to fix what would be the proper purchase annuity in the opinion of the Land Commission.  He fixed it and the tenant had nothing further to say to it.  That was appealed and costs were given against the tenant because of the act of the Commissioners.  That is unjust.</P>

      <P>The inspector places his value on the holding.  The Commissioners consider that and it is for them to decide.  Whoever initiates proceedings has to pay costs if the court so decides.  That is the practice and I cannot alter it.  I have no control over it.  The question of the size of the holdings was again raised.  As I have said, I had a different view from my predecessor and, since I came into office, I got the Land Commission to increase the size of the holding to landless people.  We cannot be expected to put them on a level with men with 50 or 60 acres.  They are being reasonably dealt with.  Deputy Brasier made a complaint about the type of people who have been given land in his part of the country.  Taking everything into consideration, I think the people who got land have been reasonably successful. I do not know the whole particulars. I had not time to go into the question of the rents.</P>

I would imagine that, as ex-President, he ought to know that that would be more a question for the Taoiseach than for the Minister for Lands.  He made a suggestion that, on account of Section 6 of the Act of 1933, there should be less work for the Minister than there was in his time. I have made inquiries in the Department as to that.  I asked was it the practice of the Minister for Lands before our time to interfere actively in the question of acquisition, fixation of price, and so on, and I was assured that it was not the practice, and I quite believe it.  As a matter of fact, the position was rather indefinite, but in practice it was practically the same as it is now.</P>

      <P>Deputies who have attended meetings in Roscommon know that they have more to say in Roscommon about the division of land than I have; but I am given to understand that, when the Deputy's Party was in power, the same things were said about them.  As someone here has remarked, in a case like that it should be assumed that things are going as fairly as possible.  So far as the work is concerned, I expect the people who advise me to tell me the truth.  Perhaps it was rather an embarrassing question to ask them&mdash;as to whether <Col N="1494" /> there was work for two Ministers or not: it was hard for them to answer and to say whether there was work to be found or not.</P>

      <P>Well, not altogether; sometimes more, sometimes less.  I wonder does the Deputy do an eighthour day?  As a matter of fact, sometimes I do a 16-hour day.  I did not answer that question of Deputy Cosgrave's because I did not think he was serious.  I think he would know that it was for the Taoiseach to decide whether there should be one Minister or two Ministers.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with the various Deputies' questions as I go along.  Regarding the introduction of people from the Gaeltacht, there was an extra cost in bringing them previously, but we hope we will be able to get the type of migrant who will not cost more than £120 extra.  It might not be the best of economics, but socially it is a very desirable thing to do.  Some of the Deputies seem to think that, because we have brought up small migrants, we have abandoned the policy of bringing large migrants. If we can get large people to surrender their holdings and give a lot of relief in the congested areas, we would be only too glad to do it if we get the chance.  Then there was a comparison made here between the town and the country and the amount that was done in Deputy Cosgrave's time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I must try to take a reasonable attitude.  As I say, if the Land Commission were to adopt an attitude like that adopted by some of the rack-renting landlords in the past, and insist on getting their pound of flesh, no matter what it might mean, then there was something to be said for the criticism.  But a man who wishes to pay his way and is not able to will only have to go to the Collection Department and make the best offer he can, put his case before them, say that he has so many cattle and that if he sells now he will not get as good a price as if he sold later and would be ruined, that he would be prepared <Col N="1496" /> when market conditions are right to sell, say, one cow, and pay something, he will always get time to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a case that Deputy Cosgrave made about a lady in Meath.  That case was dealt with under Section 44 of the 1931 Act.  I must correct what I said previously, because I took it then that she had applied herself and I find now that the Land Commission made application first.  That even makes the case worse than Deputy Cosgrave is making it.  It was dealt with under that section, and once proceedings were started, unless the land was worked according to proper methods of husbandry the Land Commission had no option but to take the land over.  We are proposing to amend that section to prevent a recurrence of cases of that kind.  So far as the retrospective part is concerned, I was inquiring as to the possibility and I am afraid that is a difficulty.  I put the matter up to the Land Commission when Deputy Giles and Deputy Fagan came to see me.  I asked the Land Commission to try to give the compensation they suggested in the case of her nephew, as I thought that might go some way to meet the case.  I admit it is a bad case, but, in this section that I have referred to, we hope to prevent a recurrence of it.  Deputy Fagan says that a number of cases are being held up on account of it.  That is so.  We think, however, when this amendment comes in it will make that impossible in the future.  I regret very much that that happened.</P>

      <P>Well, it was a judge who said that.  In this case it was a judge who made the allocation, and I cannot interfere with it.  When the 1933 Act was being passed, all sorts of dire prophecies were made about what the Minister would do.  We were told that he would have his yes-men, and that he would be interfering all the way.  I have not interfered.  I have been asked by members of the Opposition to take a personal interest in this case.  I do not know whether it was a special compliment to myself, but they persisted that I should.</P>

      <P>With regard to the costs of collection, that is very largely a matter for the person in arrears.  I give those people as much notice publicly as I can, and I think they ought to try to make arrangements.

It would be better for those people to make some arrangement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy, or any person in arrears, makes any reasonable offer it can be accepted and the matter will be taken out of the hands of the flying squad, but if he persists in saying that we are not entitled to collect the money, we will try, anyway. Deputy Victory wants us to operate so that people will not be kept waiting for five years, or some other period like that.  I cannot give any guarantee in that matter.  Deputy Norton was on the same point and it is very troublesome to be dealing with these cases.  I do not think it is desirable, when a Deputy asks to have a report made about some estate, that in all cases we should rush an inspector to the land to make a report.  I think great discretion has to be used before an inspector is sent to examine land. I do not believe there is any grievance in that connection.  There may be an odd mistake made.  For instance, an inspector may go to an estate that was never acquired at all and the farmer may be frightened and little misunderstandings may arise.  I am not prepared to agree that we should automatically send an inspector to make a report about any land that may be mentioned to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton dealt with the size of the holding.  I think we have already covered that point.  There are no 20-acre holdings.  The 22-acre holding was the minimum, and for the present it will be a holding of 25 acres of arable land.  That is the maximum this Government is likely to give, except in the case of a migrant, where we have <Col N="1499" /> to give an exchange.  Of course, that is a different case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is as economic as we can make it.  Of course, Deputy Gorey may have a different standard.  It is about the most we can do, anyway.  I have covered the ground pretty well in the statement I have read out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy was not here when I was dealing with the Gaeltacht cases.  When he reads the discussion, I think he will find a lot of information on that point.  Deputy Norton said that it takes an interminable period to induce the Land Commission to inspect lands.  I dealt with that point, and I think there is a reason for the delay, which should be apparent to everybody.  Deputy Ryan mentioned cases in Tipperary, and he knows very well that in respect of these cases we cannot make more progress until we get the new legislation. Deputy Kissane referred to embankments. We have spent a lot of money on embankments.</P>

      <P>We may.  I do not want to attack the farmers, but I know that in some cases&mdash;and I think Deputy Curran knows it, too&mdash;very often the embankments are neglected by the people who should maintain them.  In some cases they were deliberately broken in order to let stock have access to the fresh grass across the margins, and then those people will not carry out the repairs.  They will not make any attempt in some cases to help themselves.  They expect the Land Commission to do everything.  It is a pity that these people will not repair the breaches they make in those embankments. In some of the cases Deputy <Col N="1500" /> Curran is interested in, he knows that kind of thing happens.</P>

      <P>As regards Deputy Dillon he is many years in the House, and surely it is time he stopped shouting about corruption, telling us we are all corrupt.  I think he said that I was only 30 per cent., and that is a little better than some of my colleagues. That sort of utterance does not do him or his Party any good.  He did not actually say that I was wangling.  I think he might cease making remarks of that kind.  It is not a good thing to do that and, at any rate, there is no foundation for it, and he ought to cut it out.</P>
      <P>He made a suggestion here about the desirability of having an experiment in regard to the division of land; instead of dividing up the land into small holdings, to give 250 or 260 acres and have it worked by a number of people in common.  I was thinking of that idea myself but the thing I see against it is that, unfortunately, we are individualists in this country and the whole thing would depend on the people you would bring together.  I would like to see a thing like that happening myself but it is an experiment that would be very risky.  If you got the right type of people it would be all right but that is the trouble.  I am afraid our experience has been very bad in the past and until we learn to co-operate, I am afraid the idea would not be practicable.</P>
