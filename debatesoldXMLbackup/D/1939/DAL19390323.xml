      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he can now state what the future of the Dublin dockyard is to be; if he has under consideration proposals to open it as an official yard for ship repairs and building; if not, if he is prepared to grant facilities that will be sufficient to induce investors outside this country to do so.</P>

      <P>I have been in close touch with the Dublin Port and Docks Board for a considerable time in the matter of the possible re-opening of the Dublin Dockyard.  The Port and Docks Board has had several schemes under consideration but a satisfactory scheme has not yet been evolved.  The Deputy may rest assured that everything possible is being done both by the Dublin Port and Docks Board and by this Department to have some arrangement concluded by which work would be resumed in the dockyard.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that the import duty of 33? per cent.  <i>ad valorem</i> imposed on harp strings is a great hardship on the few institutions in this country where the harp is being taught; and if he will in the interest of such institutions, and generally to encourage the teaching of the harp, remove altogether this duty on the <Col N="2344" /> strings, which are very expensive and not manufactured in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>Why?  What is the difficulty in distinguishing between a string for a harp and a string for a guitar?  The Customs authorities could not possibly mistake one for the other. There is a great deal of difference between them.  Does the Minister know that this matter affects places like blind asylums and charitable institutions? Will he promise to have the matter looked into with a view to facilitating the free entry of these strings?  It is a very important matter and should not be laughed at.  The harp is the national emblem of our Government and of our State and it should be encouraged.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that statements issued by hide and skin merchants reveal the fact that in January, 1939, the percentage of hides handled, which showed warble defects, was 32 per cent., and that the percentage for February, 1939, was 64 per cent.; and if, in view of these figures, he has satisfied himself that it is worth while to continue the scheme of eradicating the warble fly pest by local inspectors.</P>

      <P>I have seen in the Press the statements to which the Deputy refers, but I cannot admit that they represent the general position throughout the country in regard to the prevalence of warbles in our cattle.  The reports relative to cattle passing through the ports furnished for the years 1936, 1937 and 1938 by the Department's veterinary staff show that there has been a steady <Col N="2345" /> decrease in the proportion of warbled cattle and particularly in regard to heavily infested animals.  I am, therefore, satisfied that the scheme should be continued.</P>

      <P>Last night when we were discussing this motion No. 17 the Minister, with a copy of the Dáil Debates in his hand, gave the impression that he was quoting a statement of mine from a previous debate and he used these words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On the last occasion the Deputy referred to what he claimed to be a fact, that a medical doctor can look forward to only £500 a year as a maximum.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He made that statement with a copy of the Dáil Debates in his hand and he left the impression on my mind, and I am sure on the mind of everybody listening to him, that he was quoting from the volume which he had in his hand.  He then added the statement:&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  That was my recollection when the Minister was speaking last night.  When I referred to the rate in the document circulated by the Minister in my remarks, in a rough way, not being able to work out on my feet the annual rate from the daily rate, I said &ldquo;something in the neighbourhood of&rdquo; and the Minister, presuming to quote me on a matter of immense importance, at least to members of my profession, and on a matter vitally affecting my character as a person who has some respect for principle, leaves out the important words &ldquo;somewhere in the neighbourhood of&rdquo; and substitutes the words &ldquo;to look forward to only £500 per annum as a maximum.&rdquo; I want to protest in the presence of all, and in the most emphatic manner, against anyone, Minister or Deputy, pretending to quote a person, and quoting in an absolutely untruthful way.  There is a vast difference between referring to a specific sum in specific terms and referring to a specific document and saying &ldquo;in the neighbourhood of.&rdquo; That is not the only point I was contradicted on last night.  I also happened to refer, from recollection, to an advertisement which appeared in the Irish daily papers, both in regard to vacancies in the British Air Force and vacancies in the Irish Air Force, and I pointed out that the British Air Force was advertising for boys of 17½ years of age, the only qualifications required being a standard school certificate, age 17½, and rate of pay 12/6 per day.  I said that along side that, in the Irish daily papers, appeared an advertisement looking for officers in the Irish Air Force, and that the terms laid down for applicants were that they had to hold a certificate as being qualified as engineers through a diploma from a university.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have the two advertisements before me.  The British advertisement offers 12/6 per day to untrained boys of 17½ years of age, and the Irish one offers vacancies to qualified engineers, and merely says that they will be granted commissions.  I take it that they enter like every other officer as second lieutenants.  We applied to the Department of Defence arising out of D.F.R. 69 for the pay warrant which lays down the rate of pay for every rank and every unit in the Army.  We got back a reply stating that that particular publication was out of print, but in order to facilitate us in our inquiries a typewritten statement of the rates of pay was issued. The rate of pay laid down for second lieutenant in that particular document is 8/- a day, after two years 9/- a day, and after five years 10/- a day.  In the face of the advertisement anyone reading it is entitled to assume that they were advertising for men to be admitted as second lieutenants, and the rate of pay for second lieutenants applied by the Department of Defence is 8/- a day.  I make the Minister a present of the other 2/-.  I said 10/- a day.  That was contradicted too.  If the Minister is offering more, certainly the advertisement does not indicate it, and nobody could read from the advertisement or read into it that any higher rate was being offered than the normal regimental rate.  In addition, I must offer my feeble protest against the manner in which this whole subject has been handled by the Minister, not only last night but on the previous occasion when we discussed the rate of pay.  I could quite understand any man, Minister or anyone else, having a view of his own and standing over it, and I can quite understand anyone having views as to whether pay be increased or diminished, and standing over them, and if the support of others is required subsequently for the action taken, then the figures would be given in a straightforward way and action taken in the light of these figures.  When we discussed this particular matter before, we had a very slick and tricky style from the Minister, in which he introduced <Col N="2349" /> allowances every time in referring to the pay of doctors, but when he referred to the pay of any other type of officer the allowances were not mentioned; they were subtracted.  In other words, presuming or pretending to give a comparison, which was comparing the pay of one lot of officers with the pay and allowances of medical officers, although the allowances are common to all.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;It is within the recollection of everyone that it was done repeatedly during his time.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>
      </P>
      <P>&ldquo;The revised rates, as far as medical officers are concerned, apply only to new entrants and new promotions.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That in itself is encouraging.  The revised rates apply to existing officers if they are promoted to higher rank, <Col N="2350" /> and if they take the new rate of that rank.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The figures given do not represent the total emoluments paid to officers.  Take, for instance, a new entrant to the medical service.  On entry, he will be commissioned as a second lieutenant and will be entitled to £296 a year in addition to the following allowances in cash or in kind: lodging, fuel and light allowance, £64; uniform allowance, £20; and ration allowance, £32, making a total of £116.  His total emoluments, therefore, during the first year of service will be £412.  It is intended that all new entrants will be promoted first lieutenant on the completion of one year's satisfactory service so that in his second year he will receive £429.  If he marries after three years' satisfactory service, he will be entitled to £340 a year plus the following allowances: lodging, fuel and light allowance, £127; uniform allowance, £20 and ration allowance, £32.  Hence, after three years' satisfactory service, a medical officer, even under the revised rates, will be entitled to emoluments, in cash or in kind, to the extent of approximately £519 a year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We get the rates of pay for engineers; we get the rates of pay for regimental officers, and we get the rates of pay for British medical officers, but we are only given the rate of pay and allowances for Irish medical officers.  If the case was a good case, being fairly presented, would we not have got the rates of pay and allowances for all?  It is merely evidence that a bad case has to be bolstered up by doubtful debating tactics.  The tactics adopted by the Minister from the first day on which this matter was debated here up to 10 o'clock last night are being very mildly described when I describe them as doubtful.</P>
    <P>There was another matter, and again it shows the manner in which we are being treated.  When this matter was under discussion last night and when my case was mainly based on the figures before me and on the knowledge inside my head, that the highest rank <Col N="2351" /> in the Army Medical Service is, and was for ten years back, that of major, and when, in making my case, I pointed out that the highest pay a medical officer could aspire to was that of major, the Minister, in order to answer that, last night tells us that the medical officer can be colonel and implies that it is his intention that the highest rank of medical officer will be colonel.  Any Deputy, and certainly any Deputy sitting on this side, has no way of touting intelligent information from the Minister or his Department and it is a very undesirable way of getting information at any time.  The only information a Deputy can get is information officially published, and we have in the Book of Estimates, for the year 1939-40, on page 325, the establishment of the Army Medical Service for the year ending 31st March, 1940.  Will the Minister refer me to the colonel's rank and pay on that page?  Is it there?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not there, but, when the Minister is in a tight corner in an argument, it is there.  There is no provision made for a colonel in the official publications.  In the course of a lengthy debate a month ago there was no indication of the colonel's rank, but in order to make it appear that the highest rate as given by me was untruly given, a new rate is introduced. I ask if I am describing it any way harshly when I say that such tactics are doubtful?  The Minister, dealing with the pay of medical officers and attempting to justify his rates and make a fair case for the altered rates of pay, made this statement, at column 1913 of the Official Debates of 9th March:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I arrived at this basis of differentiation, that for the first year we will give to every professional officer who comes into the Army, and has the qualifications that we require, £25 per year for each year he attended the university.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Does the Minister consider that a fair basis?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to argue or to catch the Minister out, and I do not expect him to know things that are entirely outside his sphere; but if the Minister considers that £25 a year added pay for each year in the university, doing strictly medical work was a fair addition to the pay and if&mdash; I will put it this way&mdash;the university medical curriculum has been since extended by two years, there is a fair case for an extension to £50 on the rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That can be considered. If the curriculum has been extended, that is all right, but we got from the universities four years as being the average for the engineer and six years for the medical man.</P>

      <P>The Minister has the correct figure for engineers and he has the correct figure for medical officers up to those who commenced medicine last October.  By the Irish Medical Council, the course was extended by two years for everybody commencing from last October.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>No, seven years. The minimum will be seven years and the average eight years.  I take it then that these rates will be revised.  I continued my remarks to-day for the primary purpose of standing over statements <Col N="2353" /> which I had previously made, protesting against being loosely or inaccurately quoted.  I know from a previous debate that there is certainly no use in my putting in any plea for fair terms for officers of the Army Medical Service.  It certainly does not improve the condition of any officer in the Army to reduce the rates of other officers, when the situation is such that, instead of reducing the rates of medical officers, others who should properly be regarded now as professional officers are entitled to have their rates of pay raised.</P>
      <P>There is only one other point I have to make on this subhead.  I would like to be informed exactly how officers are recruited when vacancies arise in the Army Medical Service.  I addressed a question to the Minister on that point some time ago, I asked how they were recruited, and what steps were taken to advertise the vacancies so as to give all young doctors an equal chance of applying.  The answer I got was to the effect that the previous procedure was still being followed.  Of course, that was not an answer to the question I asked.  I now repeat that question, and I give the Minister an opportunity of answering.  When a vacancy arises in the Army Medical Service, what steps are taken to fill that vacancy; what steps are taken to ensure that all doctors desirous of an Army medical career get an equal opportunity of applying?  Are the vacancies advertised? Is there any form of selection board?  Is the advisory board drawn from the colleges and hospitals which used to recommend doctors for vacancies, still being utilised?  Exactly how is the thing done?</P>

      <P>It is almost impossible to argue with Deputy O'Higgins because, so far as I can see, he will make statements that are very far from the facts and repeat them, notwithstanding that the facts have been clearly presented to him and to the House.  I want to deal with a couple of his statements here last night and to-day.  Last night the Deputy said that we were inviting young engineers to join the Air Force and that the rate was 10/- per day.  To-day he went a bit further and he said the rate was 8/- per day <Col N="2354" /> by reference to the regimental rates of pay and he compared the 10/- per day with 12/6 which, he alleges, the British offered to untrained boys of 17½ years of age.</P>

      <P>The Deputy said that 12/6 a day was offered to untrained boys of 17½ years in the British Air Force.  I have the advertisement here.  I have not the date of its insertion, but anyway it is the same advertisement.  On the completion of training, air observers will be given the rank of sergeant and, after a probationary period, normally six months, pay at 12/6 a day, food and accommodation provided free.  First of all, I take it from that advertisement that they will go into a period of training and, after the period of training a man would be promoted to the rank of sergeant and after six months he will be entitled to 12/6 a day.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only examining this from the point of view of the correctness of the Deputy's statement.  I do not make any claim that we can pay here the same rates of pay and allowances, the same salaries and remuneration as they can pay in England.  I do not believe this country could stand it.  Having regard to the resources of this country, I believe we are offering fair rates of pay to all ranks and all services.  In regard to these young men who want to go forward as aeronautical engineers, instead of getting 8/- or 10/- a day, as the Deputy alleges, and never having much of a chance of going further, they will be entitled to £362 a year the first year, which is exactly twice 10/- per day.  The first year it is £1 a day instead of 10/-, which is a little bit of a difference.</P>

      <P>The fact of the matter is, anyway, that, instead of these boys getting 12/6 walking in to the British Air Force, as the Deputy says, they get it after preliminary training of some length, plus another six months in the rank of sergeant and, instead of our trained engineers coming into the Army getting 8/- or 10/- per day they get, as a matter of fact, 13/- for the first year, plus a couple of pounds a week as allowances.  Again, if we compare the <Col N="2359" /> allowances that an officer gets and, say, the ration allowance that an N.C.O. air observer would get, it would be, I suppose, in England about 12/6.</P>

He went on down in the same paragraph for a long sentence, concluding by saying:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;While the highest rate which the man who comes in trained and qualified at his own expense, or at the expense of his parents, the man who obviously comes in more advanced in years, because he has gone through a lengthy university course, and the man who obviously must look forward to a much shorter service life, can reach is half the rate that can be reached by the untrained man.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Minister might quote a little bit further.  In my speech I said, &ldquo;in the neighbourhood of £500 a year&rdquo; and in my remarks I referred to the document circulated by the Minister.  In other words, my remarks were related to the circulated document which every Deputy had before him.  Later on, when I was giving my own figures I twice stated the rate of 34/6 per day.</P>

      <P>May I interrupt the Minister?  We were discussing at that time D.F.R. 69.  As regards the present rate for major, there is an asterisk, but when you refer down to it in the Estimate you find that the rate is personal to the present holder of the office.  D.F.R. 69 gives a new rate of pay for medical officers, but there is nothing to indicate an added £100 for the Director of Medical Services. If there is, I would like to have it verified, because that is what we were discussing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The thing is that you have a Director of Engineering and a Director of Medical Services and they always have had allowances for their Departments.  That has always <Col N="2362" /> obtained.  What I am concerned with is not so much in proving that the Deputy is wrong as in bringing before the young medical men of the country what they can look forward to if they join the Army Medical Service.  I want to bring out to them that they are entitled to go to, not the £500 a year which the Deputy speaks of, but on the present basis and on present ranks, to a salary of over £920 a year. I want to point out to young medical men that they can aim at being in the enjoyment of such a salary in the Army Medical Service.</P>

      <P>A specific motion was decided recently dealing with this matter of medical pay.  The practice has been that the subject matter of a specific motion so decided may not be reopened on the Estimate. Deputy O'Higgins, indeed, in speaking on the Estimate, made only a brief reference to the pay of medical officers in the Army.  The Minister, however, in concluding, dealt at length with the speech made by Deputy O'Higgins on the specific motion.  Hence this debate. But there should be some reasonable bounds to it.</P>

During the last six years, and for a number of years before, medical officers were appointed to the medical corps on the nomination of the Minister.  There were no examinations and no boards of any description.  On the nomination of the Minister they were commissioned by the Government and appointed to the Medical Service.  It has been agreed to between my Department and the Department for Finance that for the future the ordinary Civil Service Appointments Commission will operate, or a board of that nature.  Vacancies will be advertised and applicants will be invited to apply.  The board will go into the merits of the applicants and recommend names for the filling of the vacancies.  That is how it will be for the future.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach, speaking in the Dáil on the 16th February last&mdash;column 716, vol. 74, No. 6, said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Nearly £1,000,000 is to be spent in regard to aircraft defence by means of aeroplanes, and so on, and there is about another £1,000,000 on anti-aircraft guns and ammunition, etc.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Would the Minister say if the only money provided in this Estimate from which aeroplanes can be bought is the £219,585 which we find under sub-head O&mdash;General Stores&mdash;and appearing as No. 5&mdash;Aviation Section?  I am speaking now of the year ending March, 1940.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.  The way that I would put it is this, that out of the £1,300,000 extra on warlike material, there will be an expenditure of £219,585 for aeroplanes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to spend more, as a matter of fact, out of the £5,500,000, if we can get them this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to deal with the figures before us, and to get some understanding of the implication of these figures.  In the first place, referring to the Taoiseach's statement, that nearly £1,000,000 was to be spent on aircraft, I should like to ask when we are going to be equipped with £1,000,000 worth of aircraft.  In connection with that also, I think that the House ought to have some information as to our aircraft strength at present, and what we anticipate it will be at the end of the current financial year.  In spite of the conflict of pictures set out by the Minister, on the one hand, and the Taoiseach on the other, with regard to what is likely to hit us first, if we are going to be hit by anything in the line of a military attack, and in spite of what he says elsewhere, even the Minister has indicated, so far as the preparations that he wants for the benefit of the civil population are concerned, that he is rather concerned about attack by air.</P>
      <P>What I want to get is some picture of our present air strength as far as aircraft is concerned, and how the picture here reconciles with the statement made by the Taoiseach in column 716.  Later on, in column 716, the Taoiseach said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We are spending roughly one-half of it on aeroplanes and one-half <Col N="2366" /> of it on anti-aircraft guns and ammunition.  I will admit that personally I would be inclined to go more for aeroplanes except for the cost.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When the House is threatened with the expenditure of £2,000,000, I think the House is entitled to some kind of idea as to the reasons for deciding to spend half the money only on aeroplanes and half on anti-aircraft guns, because nobody in the House wants to pose as the expert that the Minister rather suggested in the previous debate.  But I think that if we transfer our minds from discussions in this House to the other discussions spoken of so approvingly from the Fianna Fáil Benches yesterday in comparison with the type of discussions that go on here, discussions which have taken place at crossroads and houses of refreshment throughout the country on this subject of defence, we will not find a single one of the disputants on these matters at the crossroads or any place else but will have some kind of grip of the simple primary idea that the only thing that can really destroy hostile aeroplanes are fighting aeroplanes on the defensive side.</P>
    <P>If there is a case for all this expenditure on defence, and for approaching the Dublin Corporation to spend nearly 50 per cent. of the amount of money on aerial defence of one kind or another that the Minister is asking us to spend on aeroplanes, the whole reason for that application for expenditure on defence is that we are threatened with air attacks.  If Dublin is attacked by air, the only defence that Dublin can really have is a fighting force of aeroplanes attacking the aeroplanes that come here. That can be said of any city in the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we will have some kind of a different system for sizing up the things that are going to make us shiver and planning the things that are going to put the shivers away from us.  If the Minister cannot in a reasonable way give an explanation to the House as to why this expenditure on aeroplanes is so small in the current Estimates and cannot tell us something as to how he is going to balance the aircraft forces with the anti-aircraft guns; if he is not going to tell us what the fighting strength in aircraft for the defence of the City of Dublin is, then he is certainly adopting a curious attitude to the House.  I would ask the Minister not to take exception to any question that we put here.  Some of us, as ratepayers of Dublin, are asked to co-operate, both with our money and our personal services, in elaborate A.R.P. schemes for the City of Dublin; we are asked, as taxpayers, to provide this money; and we are asked, as representatives of the people, to come in here to discuss both the amount of money that is required, what is going to be done with it, and what the results are likely to be.  What I am personally anxious to discuss is, what exactly the Minister has in mind when he distributes approximately £1,000,000 in the present Estimate here in the proportion of less than £250,000 for planes and more than £750,000 for guns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2368" /> In that connection I tell him that the ordinary people outside, who take an interest in these things and who try to visualise a hostile air force coming here and the likely plans for the defence of this city, expect the Minister's plan will be to put planes into the sky as the principal means of protecting the city.  If he is not able to put planes into the sky over Dublin, then, certainly, for a very large percentage of the number of days they are here, he might as well be without anti-aircraft guns down below.  If there is any massed attack by bombers on Dublin, that massed attack is going to be launched two or three miles before the hostile aeroplane fleet comes near the city.  When it does come near the city, on the greater number of days of the year it is going to be completely protected from any gunner's eyes by the cloud formation over the city.  That is the ordinary, much-appraised, street corner opinion on the matter.  We are entitled to ask the Minister what his plans are and how he thinks anti-aircraft guns are going to serve as defensive measures against aeroplanes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

I have been trying, on the Supplementary Estimate and to-day, to give the country a fair picture of what the Government propose to spend on armed equipment.  Instead of giving the thing piecemeal to the House on Supplementary Estimates or Annual Estimates, such as this, I projected into the future and said that the Army would cost for the future in maintenance, servicing, repairs, etc., about £2,250,000 and that, in addition to that £2,250,000, we were going to spend <Col N="2369" /> £5,500,000 on capital equipment.  I have tried to give some idea of how we intend to spend that money on the various corps and services.  I indicated that we would spend half of that £5,500,000 on defence against air attack &mdash;both ground defence and air defence. I want to say what I said before, that we cannot guarantee the citizens of Dublin or of any other town subject to attack that no bombs will be dropped on them as a result of the expenditure of this £5,500,000.  Nor could we do that if we were to spend £15,500,000.</P>

      <P>I am showing what we propose to have and, if the Deputy wants to get himself fogged up in these things, he can go and do so.  We are going to spend half of that £5,500,000 on protection against air attack.  And half of that half will be spent on ground guns and the balance on machines.  It is well known that, even if we had 1,000 or 10,000 fighting planes we could not guarantee to stop attacking raiders.  The Deputy has, I am sure, seen for himself the reports on exercises on the continent where the protecting fighting screen of planes knew the direction from which the bombers were to come and knew the hour at which they were to come. Still, the bombers got through and got away without any casualties so far as the fighting machines were concerned. The only casualties marked down against them were those from the anti-aircraft guns.  If the Deputy knows all about these things, he should go over to England and tell them that they are fools to be spending so much money on anti-aircraft guns, and he should go to Germany and tell them the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not trying to deceive the citizens of Dublin by saying we can prevent bombs being dropped on the city.  If we spent the whole £5,500,000 on aeroplanes or on anti-aircraft guns we could not guarantee that.  The City of Dublin and towns subject to attack <Col N="2371" /> will have to do a little to help themselves, just as people in other cities and towns throughout the world have to do at the present time.  I wish the Deputy would devote some of his energy to impressing that on the Dublin Corporation, who are holding up matters.  The Deputy said that I was trying to scare people about the possibility of air attack.  The most violent person in regard to air attack was the Deputy's colleague on his left. He came into the Dáil with a long rigmarole about the wailing women who gathered around Parkgate Street last September.  The nearest the wailing women got was Cavan.  Instead of thousands gathering around Parkgate Street during the September crisis, we got one letter asking what was the best thing to do in connection with a shelter.</P>

      <P>I move motion No. 72:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Estimate be reduced by £15 in respect of sub-head Y (2),</P>
      <P>As far as the statement of numbers issued to us goes, the Army Reserve forms a substantial part of our Army strength.  The whole history of the Army Reserve, formed in this particular way, has been such that it certainly does not commend it to some of us here as a satisfactory way of strengthening the Army.  The figures given us by the Minister the other day show that, I think, 53 per cent. of the total strength of the Reserve on which he depended so much&mdash;he praised very highly its effects on the men in regard to discipline and everything else like that&mdash;did not attend for their annual training.  When we look at the numbers in regard to officers, non-commissioned officers and privates in the tentative figures available to the Minister at the present time, and which he intends to circulate later, we find that 56.5 of the privates did not attend for their annual training last year.  In the Seventh field battery of the artillery in the Monaghan area only 13 privates out of a total of 39 attended their annual training.  In the Eighth field battery, Drogheda, only ten privates attended out of a total of 59.  In the Tenth field battery, Tralee, only nine privates attended out of 65. In the Fourth field battery, Castlebar, only nine privates out of a total of 45 attended their annual training last year.  Those figures are in regard to some of the worst artillery sections.  In the cyclists' sections we have cases like that of the Fifth cyclist squadron, Tramore, where only six privates attended out of a total of 29.  In the Seventh cyclist squadron, Bandon, only four privates attended out of a total of 29.  In the Eighth cyclist squadron, Bantry, seven attended out of a total of 25.  In the Twelfth cyclist squadron, Westport, five privates out of a total of 60 attended for their training.  In the Seventeenth cyclist squadron, Dungloe, County Donegal, nobody at all attended for training out of a total of 40.  In the Corps of Engineers in the Western Command a total of 19 of all ranks attended out of 83.  In the whole Corps of Engineers formed in the Reserve only 72 attended out of a total of 240.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister maintains that for a Volunteer reserve of this particular kind the figures which he quoted for the general attendance for training last year were satisfactory when compared with formations in other countries, about which, as far as I am concerned, I have no information.  In regard to a Reserve formed in the way in which this Reserve was formed&mdash;with halls studded <Col N="2375" /> here and there, and supposed to be used for weekly training of one kind or another, and in some places not used&mdash; when we see the results in the way they attended for annual training we are driven to the conclusion that the conviction we had at the start is correct, that this Reserve was formed on a very wrong basis and in a very wrong spirit, and that, unless something drastic is done to change the whole attitude towards the Army reserve, that reserve will be a source of weakness rather than of strength to the Army.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>In dealing with the Supplementary Estimate, I indicated that we were changing the basis of recruitment for the Volunteers, in that, instead of a Volunteer being allowed to resign on seven days' notice, for the future a Volunteer would join for a specific period of five years, and that during that five years he would only be allowed to resign in the same way as a regular soldier is allowed to resign. I said also that we were reducing the annual training period from 21 days to nine days.  This is being done because, from our experience over a number of years, men in regular employment find it difficult to get away for 21 days.  I believe that, for the future, it will be possible for every Volunteer to get away for nine days' annual training. We will get the Volunteers up to a comparatively high initial standard of training by making them serve three months or its equivalent in initial training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy has quoted certain percentages from the worst of the figures I gave him to-day.  Taking them all round, Volunteers last year turned up for annual training to the extent of 47 per cent.  I am not satisfied with that percentage.  Naturally, I should like to see this figure at 100 per cent., and so would the officers dealing with the annual training.  We want to get it as near 100 per cent. as is possible. Now, it has been found in other countries, just as we have found it here, that you cannot expect territorial forces to turn up to the extent <Col N="2376" /> of 100 per cent.  In my recollection, if you take the American territorial force and the territorial forces of other countries, it would be about 55 per cent.  The ordinary regular Army reservists turn up to about 60 per cent. or 70 per cent., as I said yesterday. We hope that, with the change in the Volunteer system of initial and annual training, we will get a larger turn-up than 47 per cent.  I hope that it will be almost as good as that of the Reserve, which is somewhere about 70 per cent.</P>
    <P>I do not at all agree with the Deputy that this is the wrong way to build an Army reserve.  I think it is an excellent way, and from our experience of the young men who came forward during the last five years to join the Volunteer force, I am convinced that by means of the Volunteer force we will get the finest type of reserve that this country can expect to get and at the cheapest possible rate.  If we are to rely altogether on monetary inducements to build up an Army reserve we will have to spend a very large amount of money on pay allowances.  We are attempting, by means of the Volunteer force, to stimulate the patriotism of the young men of this country and point out to them that it is their duty as citizens and as young men to train themselves for the defence of Ireland. We are endeavouring to carry into the present situation something of the same spirit as imbued the young men who joined the Volunteers in the period from 1919 to 1921, who volunteered and went out and fought without any remuneration whatsoever.  We are pointing out to these young men that they should do their utmost to be worthy of the men who fought for the establishment of the independence of this country, that they should volunteer their services, and that we will give them certain allowances to cover their out-of-pocket expenses.</P>
    <P>I believe that the young men of the country will respond.  They have responded.  We have not gone out with any great intensive recruiting campaign for the Volunteers, but within the last five years about 12,000 of them came forward.  Deputy Dillon asked for the figures yesterday, and I have them here to-day.  In 1934, 7,484 Volunteers <Col N="2377" /> reported for annual training.  That was the initial year, and the only year, I may say, that any advertisement or campaign was made for the Volunteer forces.  In 1935, 2,749 came forward; in 1936, 688 came forward; in 1937, 824 came forward; in 1938, 737 came forward, and in 1939, up to the date at which this was prepared&mdash;I think it was towards the end of January or the middle of February&mdash; 66 had come forward.  That is a total, over those years, of 12,588.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the figures the Minister is giving relate to men coming forward to join and do their preliminary training?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The number who reported for initial training.  Over a period of four years and a month, therefore&mdash;or let us say five years in order to make certain&mdash;12,588 young men came forward.  During that period we did not go out on an active campaign to the same extent, let us say, as they do in other countries for their territorial forces, and some of these years, as the Deputy will know, were particularly difficult years from the point of view of recruitment to the Volunteers.  I think that if we had the same sympathy for the Volunteer movement from all sections of our people as they have in other countries, such as England or America or elsewhere, and if the Government went out on a recruitment campaign for the Volunteers, we would have every decent young fellow in the country coming forward to join.  We do not want all the young men of the country to come forward.  If we had all the men of military age in this country in the Army, it would mean that we would have 1,000,000 men or thereabouts, but we only want about 30,000 of them.  With a little bit of goodwill from all sections of the people I believe that we would have 30,000 of the pick of the youth of the country coming forward to serve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had experience of this Volunteer force in its organisation and training.  We were careful not to go out to get in very large numbers until we were in a fit state to organise, train and equip them.  Steadily, over that number of years, the military have <Col N="2378" /> been gaining experience of the handling of such a force, and the result of our experience is being incorporated in the new regulations, which will be issued and which I outlined on the Supplementary Estimate.  From our experience, over these five years, of the type of young fellow who came forward, I have every confidence in the future.  As I said last night, the young men who came forward in these last five years are as fine a body of young Irishmen as ever offered their services to the country.  I speak with experience of the Black and Tan war, and I say that these young fellows are as fine and decent, honest and sober a lot of young men as the country ever had. They had their difficulties in coming forward, of course.  They had their difficulties, and objections of various kinds were offered from various sections of the people, but they came forward in spite of these objections and difficulties.  They have their own personal difficulties in leaving their farms or leaving their businesses to come forward for training, but they overcame those difficulties and came forward.  From our experience, treating them as a military force, we find that they are very efficient.  Our people in this country have a natural aptitude for military training.  Of course, you cannot expect a volunteer or territorial force to march as smartly as a regular unit that is in training every day in the year over a number of years, but in the handling of their weapons, in shooting, in artillery shooting, these young men have held their own even with some of our regular troops.  My information is that in regard to artillery some of the Volunteer units were the best on annual training.</P>
    <P>I am certain that, given a fair amount of goodwill, we can get all the Volunteers we want.  I am certain also that, on the basis of the new regulations, we can turn them into efficient soldiers&mdash;not up to our regular Army standard, but to as high a standard as obtains in territorial forces in Europe, America or elsewhere.  I am satisfied also that it is the cheapest way this country can build up a reserve force in addition to the regular Army. I pointed out last night that a <Col N="2379" /> volunteer costs somewhere round about £12 a year.  A regular soldier costs £112 a year.  We can have ten volunteers for the cost of one regular soldier.  Naturally, anybody in charge of an army would like to have the whole personnel up to the regular soldier standard, but to do that would cost us millions year after year, a sum which I do not think the country could afford and which I do not think the young men of this country should ask the people to spend.  I believe that the young men of this country have a duty to offer their services to the country.  We are asking them to join the first line of volunteers for five years &mdash;under the new regulations it is for a period of five years&mdash;and to subject themselves to call if the country should require them.  I have every confidence, as I say, that we shall get the number we require.</P>

      <P>That the Estimate be reduced by £15 in respect of sub-head Y (4).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister can be quite assured that in pursuing plans to develop an Army reserve for the country he is not going to get anything but help from every section in the country.  In criticising certain aspects of Reserve forces, we here are criticising things that exist, that exist perhaps for definite reasons, and we hope that his new plans will enable him to eliminate these things.  Sub-head Y (4) provides for payments to secretaries of sluaighte and capitation grants also for secretaries. This implies that civilian committees are going to continue throughout the country in connection with new Volunteer schemes.  I do not think that is going to be any help to the Minister.  I do not see why such Reserve as there is throughout the country should not be administered by Volunteer machinery and handled entirely by men who have military responsibility.  I move this motion because I think that whatever civilian super-structure there is in connection with Volunteer forces in different parts of the country should be <Col N="2380" /> eliminated, that the Reserve should be a clearly defined military force and should be linked with the Army only through its military officers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the Deputy's criticism of this subhead. When we started the Volunteers we adopted the same system as they have in other countries where they associate civilian committees with the local territorial units.  Initially, I invited a number of people in the various districts to come together and help to organise the young men in their districts as Volunteers. I did my utmost to get all sections of the people represented. That was five years ago.  At that time, too, we decided that the secretary of each sluagh should be paid an allowance of £5 for doing the secretarial work and, to remunerate him for the extra expense in regard to new recruits coming along, we gave an extra 2- per head for each recuit.  At that time we were starting on a clear field. There were no Volunteers, there were no Volunteer officers and no Volunteer N.C.O.'s.  Under the new scheme, we shall have Volunteer officers and Volunteer N.C.O.'s attached to the various sluaighte.  Their allowances will be increased and I think we can, without any hardship or without any injustice to them, ask the Volunteer officers and N.C.O.'s to carry out whatever secretarial or other work arises in connection with the sluaighte.  While we started five years ago with civilians on the sluagh committees, there are very few of the civilians left and the sluagh committees in 99 per cent. of the cases, are composed of Volunteer officers and men.  For the future, it may be taken that the sluagh committees will be all Volunteers, that the secretarial work will be divided amongst the officers, the N.C.O.'s and the men of each sluagh, and that if we are paying a grant in regard to recruits we shall pay it into the sluagh funds rather than to any individual.  That is what we have in mind.  The regulations will be published in the next couple of weeks, I hope.</P>

    <P>It will thus be seen that of the total £596,010, the sum of £115,793 is a non-recurring liability.</P>
    <P>From this sum of £596,010 there have to be made deduction in respect of deaths, and abatements under Section 8 of the 1924 Act and Section 20 of the 1934 Act in respect of pensioners being in receipt of remuneration, other pensions or allowances payable out of public moneys.  On foot of such abatements, a sum of £28,000 is estimated to be saved, and another sum of £5,240 is expected not to fall for payment owing to casualties during the year. Hence from the £596,010 we deduct £33,240 and get as the net cost of awards the sum of £562,770, of which the sum of £446,977 may be regarded as a recurring item of annual expenditure.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister say how many applicants with only 1916 service are still without having their pension cases decided, and when he hopes to be in a position to have this matter cleared up?  I should also like to ask who is the referee appearing for the first time in sub-head E?</P>

      <P>In regard to the referee, up to recently we had a judge, and then another gentleman with long legal standing, a barrister for 20 or 30 years, was appointed as referee.  In regard to the 1916 pensions, my recollection of the last time I was speaking to some of the referee staff is that there are very few clear 1916 cases outstanding. There is a number in whose cases there is a dispute as to service, but practically speaking, I think 99.9 of the 1916 cases have been cleared up.  Some <Col N="2385" /> cases are still outstanding owing to a dispute over service.</P>

      <P>I want to take this opportunity of complaining about the length of time that the claims of some people have been held up.  These are claims that ought to have been considered long before now.  I have in mind one particular case, that of a man living in Wexford.  I will not mention the name, but he has been living in Wexford for the past four or five years, and before he came there he fought in Northern Ireland under the present Minister.  In consequence of having been born in Northern Ireland, this man is not eligible to draw unemployment assistance, and is not eligible for any work under the rotational scheme of employment.  The result is that he has had very bad health.  He has been in a mental hospital because he could see nothing but starvation facing himself, his wife and his family of six children.  I drew the Minister's attention to his case as far back as 1935, and nothing has yet been done.  I also brought his case to the notice of the Minister for Industry and Commerce with a view to seeing if anything could be done to enable him to draw unemployment assistance, but, under the Act, nothing can be done.  This man with a wife and six children is at present in receipt of 10/- or 12/- a week home help, and I think that is a disgraceful way to have a man who gave the best years of his life fighting for his country.  I brought the man's name before the Minister and he promised to give the matter his attention, but, although that is three years ago now, nothing has been done.</P>

      <P>There seems to be a widespread complaint with regard to the treatment of some of the 1916 men. The Minister will tell us that all these cases are taken in rotation, but I think it would be the wish of everybody in the House that the cases of men connected with the 1916 movement should be taken out and attended to as quickly as possible.  Will the Minister give us an assurance that that will be done? The case raised by Deputy Corish is only one of many, and I believe that, <Col N="2386" /> in the City of Dublin, there are some men who were in the 1916 movement in very penurious circumstances.  These cases ought to be taken out at once. It is a great reflection on a national Government that these men should be allowed to suffer the hardships they are suffering.  Many other cases in which there was no real urgency have been decided, and I think it is a national stain upon us that these men should have to continue living as they are living at present.</P>

      <P>I also wish to protest against the delay in dealing with claims.  So far as my county is concerned, I do not think there are six or eight men who have got pensions under the present Government.  While dozens of men have been brought up in the last two or three years, not one case has been passed.  They are brought before the board and they hear nothing further for two or three years.  I ask the Minister to deal with these cases as soon as possible because many of these men are in want and misery.  Some of them have got newly-divided farms, and, if they got the arrears of pension due to them, it would be a great help to them.</P>
      <P>I think this whole matter of Army pensions should be dealt with more speedily.  We know that there are at present 50,000 applications for pensions and the Minister and those of us who took part in the fight know that we had not got 10,000 men in the fight, so that at least 40,000 of these applications are bogus and should have been thrown out long ago.  I did not expect them to be dealt with up to the last general election, but the Government have now four years in which to carry on and to get these 40,000 bogus claims out of the way so that the remaining claims, which should be considered, could be dealt with more speedily.  These bogus claims are holding up consideration of the genuine claims, and I think the Minister should throw them out of the way, because it is not good enough to have Old Republican Army men in hunger to-day because of these bogus claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my county, we have a strong complaint <Col N="2387" /> in this respect.  There is no reason why the county should not be dealt with speedily because we have the whole Republican movement united there, with both sides working to get the genuine claims through and to see that no bogus claims get through. There is no reason why they should not have dealt with every man there already, because we have a perfect committee working in the county.  The Minister should have more confidence in the officers who are dealing with the cases in the different counties.  If the Minister would get the board to accept the advice of these men who are in charge of the different counties and who are to-day volunteering to see justice done to all men, we would not have these old I.R.A. men hungry to-day.  Last year, I raised the case of a genuine applicant.  He was a man with very good service and I mentioned that he was in hunger and misery.  I am sorry to say that, not two weeks afterwards, that man died in absolute want.  He dropped in the field from neglect and hunger.  He was entitled to a pension, and if he had got it a few weeks earlier, he would be alive to-day.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have to take more responsibility for seeing that the board does its work more speedily.  There are plenty of men on the board to deal with these cases more quickly, because, if we are going to carry on as we are, our generation and the next generation will be gone before the board will have done its work.  I think it is really a disgrace, because there are only 10,000 or perhaps 8,000 applicants genuinely entitled to pensions, and four years should be sufficient to deal with them.  The Minister should get his coat off and see that these men get the pensions to which they are entitled before they come to old age or before they are dead.  A good many of them will be gone before their cases are considered at all under present conditions. It is a disgrace that the one little band of men who succeeded in wresting our country from the foreign invader should be left as they are.  I feel that it is a matter for shame for all of us. We should have got these cases dealt with satisfactorily long ago, and one <Col N="2388" /> would think that the genuine cases, the very small body of men who fought in that movement, would get more consideration from an Irish Parliament and an Irish Government.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, although it is fairly late, to get those genuine cases dealt with by taking the bogus claims out of the way.  He is making no effort to get these bogus claims out of the way, and the genuine cases are being kept waiting and waiting in the expectation that something is going to come.  If I were Minister I would tell these bogus applicants that they are not going to get pensions as they are not entitled to them.  If that were done we could easily deal with the men who are entitled to pensions.  The Government have now three or four years of power to look forward to, and they need not be afraid of a general election.  Let them get these bogus cases out of the way, and, if these men have sore heads, they will forget their sore heads inside four years.</P>

      <P>After three years, it is impossible for me to recollect individual cases because I get such numbers of them every day.  Generally speaking, however, the referee and his board are doing their utmost to deal with all the clear cases.  They have already dealt with 6,100 such cases and we hope, in the coming year, to deal with another, 1,100 or 1,200 cases.  If those were dealt with, I think that all the clear cases would be finished Deputy Giles says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Why not throw out all the baseless claims;&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>but the position is that the referee cannot refuse to hear a man who makes a <i>prima facie</i> case.  It is a most difficult job.  I believe the referee and the board have done a very difficult job over the last three or four years in dealing with all these cases.  At the beginning they <Col N="2389" /> had great difficulty in getting local committees going in certain areas, to give them the evidence upon which they could rely.  Many of those difficulties have been got over and a greater speed is being maintained at the moment.  I am satisfied that, in another year, practically all the clear cases for pension will have been cleared up.  It may take some time afterwards to adjudicate on the border line cases. Deputy Corish's applicant may be a border line case and one in which the referee is not satisfied that he is entitled to a pension.  If that is the position, it does not matter what his merits as an individual may be or what his individual financial circumstances may be, the referee cannot give him a pension.</P>
    <P>Now, in regard to the 1916 men being in a penniless condition, all that I can do as Minister for Defence, or all that the referee can do as referee, is to administer the Acts that have been passed by the Oireachtas.  Under those Acts, the 1916 men are getting what they are entitled to.  You cannot guarantee that, by means of the allowances under those Acts alone, certain men who gave excellent service to the country will be above the poverty line in all circumstances.  I think that the action of the State, in providing allowances for those who had active service, will have to be supplemented and supported by local benevolent committees in the various battalion or company areas, committees who will chip in and help old comrades who happen to be in distress.  If the State were to do that, it would cost an enormous sum of money, because what the State gives to one individual it must give to every individual in the country who has a like claim.</P>
    <P>It would be difficult in our particular circumstances, because we have to advert to our peculiar history over the last 20 years, and it would be impossible to have a national benevolent organisation on a national scale.  If the Government gave a grant to a national benevolent organisation, it could not hope to meet all the claims that would be made upon it and I am afraid it would cause ructions by reason <Col N="2390" /> of the claims that would be turned down.  The only people who can really help the old Volunteers along the lines of a benevolent organisation are the people who compose smaller units.  I think the old I.R.A. men throughout the country should have their own battalion benevolent fund into which the various pensioners, or the various old I.R.A. men, or citizens who wanted to show their regard for old I.R.A. men, would pay a certain sum of money, small or large, each year, and that would go to help the worst cases.  It is the only way I can see in which especially hard cases of old I.R.A. men can be dealt with.</P>

      <P>I would like to suggest to the Minister that he should make some alteration in regard to the teaching of Irish in the national schools, because it is simply scandalous the way the poor children in the country are being taught at the moment.  I know many poor children around my constituency; they leave school when they are 13 or 14 years and they do not know how to write their names in English or to read a paper.  I met the father of one boy lately and he told me his son is not able to read a sentence in English.  I think the education of the poor children is being destroyed.  The children of the poor are the chief sufferers, because the parents have no chance of giving the youngsters education after they reach 14 years.  They leave school and they <Col N="2391" /> do not know how to add two and two together in English.</P>
      <P>I have two boys going to a national school, the youngest of them being ten years of age, and he cannot read a word in English; he has nothing but Irish the whole day long.  I have heard it remarked that if the teachers try to teach a little English and they have an English book on the desk, if the inspector comes in they have to hide it immediately.  As a parent of children going to school, and as one who observes the children of poor people who have no chance of educating them afterwards, I appeal to the Minister to curtail the system of teaching through Irish.  The children can add two and two in Irish all right, but if you ask them to do it in English they scarcely understand you, and when they go out in the world later they will be at a great disadvantage. When they have no chance of being educated in English after 14 years of age, where will they be when they have to seek a livelihood?</P>
      <P>This thing of teaching through Irish is going too far.  Drumming it into the children's heads is nothing but utter nonsense.  I do not mind a little Irish being taught, but teaching them nothing but Irish is nothing short of a scandal.  There should be a vote taken throughout the country and let the people decide whether they want this compulsory Irish.  It looks at the moment as if the next generation will be a lot of dunces.  I refer now to the children of the poor, because the other people are able to pay for the better education of their children.  I am speaking my mind on this question, and what I say represents the views of many people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to submit some scheme which will give the children of the poor some chance of being able to get on in the world.  Many of the youngsters will in later years be labouring men, and because of the lack of proper education now they will hardly be able to count sheep in the field, or do anything.  It is simply a disgrace and we will be nothing but a nation of dunces instead of, as we were known long ago, a nation of scholars. <Col N="2392" /> If I was not in a position to send my children to school after they reach 14 years, they would know very little and they would be a disgrace to any nation.</P>

      <P>For some years past the practice has been that all the education Votes are discussed in the one debate.  That was not expressly stated when this Estimate was introduced, but the debate has ranged over the whole course, from the Minister's office to Summerhill, so far, and I presume that will be followed now, though Deputy Mulcahy has moved to refer back the Vote for secondary education, in which he is technically within his rights.  The whole course might, I think, be covered, with possible minor exceptions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to try to secure that the vocational education section will make more scholarships available for students in the technical schools.  I think it would be a great attraction if there were more scholarships available for the pupils in vocational education schools.  I would like to refer especially to domestic economy instructresses. Anybody attached to a vocational education committee in the country knows how hard it is to secure the services of a domestic economy instructress.  That is a very important subject that is being taught in vocational education schools.  We find it very difficult on some occasions to secure teachers.  I would ask the Minister to permit of scholarships being applied in connection with that particular branch of education so as to give pupils in the small towns and the rural areas an opportunity of becoming proficient in the teaching of domestic economy.  There are other scholarships given from time to time, but I have never yet known of a scholarship being given for domestic science.  Perhaps the Minister will do something in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other forms of education for which I think scholarships should also be available.  I refer particularly <Col N="2393" /> to engineering, motor car engineering and kindred subjects.  From time to time it has been impossible to secure the services of a teacher in the engineering section, especially the motor car engineering section.  I understand there are scholarships available for that section this year, but it has been very spasmodic; I do not think there was any scholarship last year.  I ask the Minister to try to keep that subject in mind when he is awarding scholarships.</P>
    <P>With regard to secondary schools, I understand that matter has been referred to by Deputy Mulcahy and by Deputy Hurley.  I think the Minister knows that, so far as secondary teachers are concerned, they are in an inferior position to people occupying similar posts in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.  Their salaries are much below those paid in those places I have mentioned.  But I want specially to refer to their pension scheme.  They have continuously asked for something to be done in that connection.  Something has been done for the national teachers in recent years, not all that we would expect should be done for them, but something has been done for them, at any rate.  If a national teacher dies, I understand that his dependents are given the equivalent of a year's salary by way of grant.  That does not prevail in so far as a secondary teacher is concerned, and I would ask the Minister to give attention to the matter and to treat them in the same manner as the national teachers are treated.  These teachers are doing very valuable work, and I think they are entitled to the same treatment.  The Minister during the year, of course, has restored the 5 per cent. cut to the national teachers. That is very good, as far as it goes, but the national teachers are still expecting that the full cut will be restored.  The Minister knows that since the cut was imposed the cost of foodstuffs has increased enormously and the cost of living has increased enormously, and the national teachers expect that in the very near future the whole cut will be restored.</P>
    <P>There is one matter to which I wish <Col N="2394" /> to refer, which perhaps would be thought to be a very unpopular one, that is, the rule that has come into operation recently in connection with the retirement of lady teachers on marriage.  There is a great deal of dissatisfaction all over the country in connection with this matter.  To a great extent it is a good idea, but I am of the opinion that it should not have been brought into operation until those who were in colleges during the period were dealt with.  It takes, I understand, about eight years to turn out a proficient teacher and a great many teachers who are on service now will lose their positions if they get married.  I suggest to the Minister that it would have been far better for him to have waited to put that into operation until the people who were in colleges at the time had been established in their positions and that it should not apply to those particular people.  I have information which leads me to believe that a great many lady teachers are not getting married at the present time because of that rule being in operation.  The marriage rate is low enough at present, if we are to believe, and we have no reason to doubt, what the religious authorities say, and I think there should be some adjustment to get over a certain period in order to deal with certain teachers who were in course of training when the rule was introduced and that it should only come into operation for those who had not entered college at the particular time the Minister brought it into operation.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister to pay attention to those matters, especially to the question of scholarships for domestic economy teachers because, as I said before, it is very difficult to get teachers of that kind when vocational education committees want them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I simply rise to call attention to one matter&mdash;a really urgent matter&mdash;and to ask the Minister to give it not merely his sympathetic consideration, but also that he would bring sufficient pressure on what, in most other matters, is a very yielding Department, namely, the Department of Finance, but one that <Col N="2397" /> seems to develop extraordinary granite qualities whenever the expenditure on Education is in question.  I refer particularly to some aspects of the teachers' pension fund.  This is the first year, as I gather, that any payment has been made in by the Department to this particular fund.  Perhaps the Minister may be able to tell us what is the actuarial state of the fund at the present moment.  I know that actuaries are slow-moving bodies, extremely slow-moving.  Still, I think the Minister will remember that when this question was raised over the last couple of years the general reply, as far as I can recall, was that the matter was in the hands of the actuaries and that their report was not yet ready.  I doubt if a fund that has been only established for a couple of years should present all that particular difficulty, at least, in reaching a conclusion.  As to whether the actuary will ever be able, with the material now at his disposal, to give a verdict on the state of that fund, candidly, I am not quite sure how he can, seeing that the Government contribution is a purely haphazard contribution, limited, and, too, no amount being compulsory.  Naturally, if the fund is expected to carry on from the contributions of the schools and the teachers alone, it is quite obvious that it could not be self-supporting, and that very early it is bound to get into difficulties.  Another reason&mdash;and I think the Minister will bear me out&mdash; is that the fund had this particular drawback, so far as the younger teachers are concerned&mdash;that is, young when the scheme started some years ago&mdash;that they were practically paying in their contributions to provide pensions for a number of older teachers who deserved them, but who themselves, owing to the non-existence of the fund, had been able to make practically no contribution.  It was inevitable, therefore, that there should be difficulties in the start of this fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But the most serious matter, from the point of view of the teachers, is this, and I would ask the Minister to consider it, as I say, very sympathetically. I know no more distressing event, and I suppose the older we grow the more the matter is brought physically so to speak to our notice, <Col N="2398" /> than attending the funeral of an official, be he a member of the Civil Service or of the secondary teaching profession.  The case of the teacher is worse, considerably worse than that of the civil servant because, no provision whatever is made for the widow and family of a teacher.  There is some provision made for the widow and family of the civil servant, but none for the teacher.  I know a great outcry is sometimes raised on this question of pensions and by people who, when they die, leave a going concern as a business behind them to their family, but the unfortunate secondary teacher is not in that position.  He dies.  He has never had a salary at all equal to what the education that he has got should entitle him to.  I know that it may be urged that the finances of the State do not allow us to do as much as we should like to do in this matter, but that is the teacher's position, whatever the excuse or the explanation may be.  It is absurd, on the salary that he has, to expect him to marry, or, if he does, to educate his children in the way that he would like, at least to give them as good an education as he has got himself and to put by anything even in the way of insurance to provide against anything happening to him.</P>
    <P>Take the case of the man advancing somewhat in years, from 40 upwards, faced with that situation.  I cannot believe that it conduces to good work. I don't see how it possibly can.  I think it will interfere with his work, and if for no other reason I think that ought to appeal to the Minister for very earnest consideration.  If anything should happen to him his family, up to then living in tightened but perhaps by no means impossible circumstances is practically thrown on the world in the morning without a halfpenny. It is quite true that if he lives to enjoy it he gets a certain pension, but if he dies his wife gets nothing. In that way he is worse off than the civil servant.  Provide him with the lump-sum payment and the widow's gratuity which the civil servant gets. His commencing salary is not at all equal to what his fellows enjoy, men of the same education in, say, <Col N="2399" /> Northern Ireland to say nothing of Great Britain.  Furthermore, it is only fair to bear this in mind because it is a thing that we have to accept as a fact: that there is not open to him, as there is open, for instance, to secondary teachers in other countries, married secondary teachers in, say, Northern Ireland or in England, the prospect of ever becoming the head, and enjoying the emoluments as head, of a secondary school.</P>
    <P>That in practice, is closed to him in this country.  He cannot even reach the position that can be reached, for instance, by a successful teacher in a national school who can become a principal.  His salary, I admit, is better than it was, say, 20 years ago. There has been an improvement there; but, even so, the salary is very tenuous, not at all, I am sure, as much as the Minister would like it to be.  I put it to the Minister to consider one of two things&mdash;I do not know which will present the least administrative difficulty. From my own point of view, I may say that provision for the family makes a stronger emotional appeal to me.  But I should like the Minister to consider, if he thinks there are some difficulties that I do not see quite clearly in that respect, remedying this in the other way, in connection with a somewhat higher basic salary and a somewhat different increment; but at least to put him in the position of the civil servant and his northern fellow as regards the lump sum, and so that, when a secondary teacher dies, his widow and family will not have to face the workhouse, because I think that is the situation before a number of men at present.  You can imagine the anxiety of a man, with a wife and three, four or five children, who on reaching a certain age is no longer as vigorous as he was, or who sees his health breaking down, with the certain prospect that if he dies, every source of revenue for that family dies.  In the Civil Service, where they also get the same yearly fraction, and in Northern Ireland and in England, there is a provision that there would at least be a lump sum paid to the widow, after the person had a certain number of years' service, varying <Col N="2400" /> from one year to one year and a half's salary.</P>
    <P>I put it as strongly as I can to the Minister that it is not too much to expect that, if a man has devoted all his life to this work, and has been unable, owing to the circumstances in which he lives, to put aside anything, at least that much might be provided for his widow and children; that, according to the number of years of service, anything ranging from one year to one year and a half's salary should be paid to them.  I understand that there is a provision similar to that in the Civil Service and in the pension scheme for secondary teachers in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I press on the Minister as strongly as I can that he should not merely give this consideration, but that he should use all his energies to push this through.  As I say, I cannot attend the funeral of a civil servant, though I know there is a certain provision there, without remembering that when a man like that, with a salary which allows his family to live in a certain way, dies in harness, the whole method of life of his family must be changed. But what is the position of the secondary teacher, where there is no gratuity and nothing left?  There are other anomalies in the scheme to which I need not refer at present.  I came in here specially for the purpose of making this particular appeal to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter I want to bring before the House at the risk of being misunderstood and, perhaps, of being misrepresented, is this question of the teaching, not of Irish, but through the medium of Irish.  I am not going to take the line taken by one of my colleagues who spoke to-day.  I do not want to be taken as being in any way opposed to the teaching of Irish, but I think that, as representatives of the people, we have a certain duty. Whether well-founded or not, there is a very big volume of opinion in this country that tends to believe that definite injury is being done to the education of the children.  I am not in a position to say whether that is so or not.  But the way I look at it is this. If the position with regard to teaching <Col N="2401" /> in the schools through the medium of Irish is such as we are told, what I want to know is where are we heading, what is behind the scheme, what is the object of it?</P>
      <P>We have to remember that the vast bulk of the pupils in the primary schools get no education beyond the age of 14.  We have in this country to-day greater competition than perhaps ever before amongst people to secure the right to live, in other words, to secure work.  This Government, as well as the previous Government, started to industrialise the country, and one of the principal drawbacks, if I might put it so, in the development of industry was the fact that we had not skilled or trained labour available. I have given whatever thought it is possible for the ordinary man in the street to give to this matter, and the reason I ask the Minister what is behind this policy of teaching all pupils in primary schools through the medium of Irish is that I want to know how does that policy during the first 14 years of their lives fit in with the policy of preparing them to take their places either in the industrial or agricultural life of the country.  Take a working man's son who goes to a primary school until he is 14.  If he is lucky, at the age of 16 or 17 he secures employment, say, in one of the new industries.  In that industry Irish is of no use to him.  I am not talking about the fact that he has learned Irish purely as a language or that he is able to speak it.  If he goes into a factory or any other employment, behind the counter or outside the counter, he is not going to be asked to make up a sum in Irish, to make out a bill in Irish, or to write out a receipt in Irish.  He is going to be asked to do that, and will have to do that, in English and, if he is not able to do it in English, he will not keep his job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the aspect of it which I should like the House and the Minister to look at.  I can see everything that is to be said for teaching our native language to every child.  But I want to be convinced, and the people want to be convinced, that we are benefiting children by insisting on teaching them other subjects through the medium of Irish.  I am not going to go as far as a great of the people, <Col N="2402" /> perhaps the majority of the people of the country, go when they say that you are definitely injuring the children.  But I want to see what good it is doing the children and whether we are fitting them to take their place either in the agricultural or industrial life of the country, leaving out altogether the fact that, unfortunately, a large number of those who have left school have failed to find employment at home and have had to go elsewhere. I am not urging that point at all.  We are trying to educate our farmers, our farmers' sons and farm labourers to take the fullest advantage of the agricultural research work being done and paid for in this country.  Take the son of a farmer or a farm labourer who has left school at 14 or 15 years of age. Does he know enough English to read and understand the Departmental pamphlets dealing with scientific agriculture or the improvement of agriculture?  Is he capable of understanding the advice given regarding seeds and soil?  Has he learned in school sufficient English even to read and understand the information turned out by the Department of Agriculture as a result of the research work which is being done? These are a few points with which I should like the Minister to deal.  There are certain people who will not allow you to say &ldquo;boo&rdquo; once the Irish language is mentioned.  If you do so, you are anything but a patriot; you are a base materialist.  We have got to get down to the fundamental that if there is any reason at all for educating children in this or any other country it is that they may be better, more useful and more intelligent citizens and be able to take their places in agriculture, industry and commerce, better fitted, if possible, than were their predecessors.</P>
    <P>The Minister and some Deputies may try to brush these few points aside but these are the very points that are causing very deep and grave concern to the parents of this country.  Perhaps, because of lack of moral courage&mdash;they know they will be misrepresented or misunderstood&mdash;the parents are not as vocal as those who are, what I might call, whole-hoggers and who want to go the whole way with Irish, whether it <Col N="2403" /> will be good or bad for the nation. The plain fact is that it is only in Government service or in Government circles that Irish counts, so far as securing employment is concerned. We know that quite well.  Is there any employer in the City of Dublin or Cork or in any town or village in Ireland engaged in ordinary commercial work who will insist upon an applicant for employment being able to transact his business through the medium of Irish? Do we not all know that there is not?</P>
    <P>How many businessmen, if any, do their business and keep their accounts in Irish?  How many of them, even in the Gaeltacht, do that?  I do not object to the spending of money on the teaching of Irish, but I do think we are entitled to know what is in the mind of the Minister and what is behind the scheme for teaching every subject through the medium of Irish.  What does he hope to achieve by that, either for the pupils or for the nation?  Does the Government think that the present system of education is likely to fit our young men and young women to take their places in industry, agriculture and commerce?  I have tried to raise these few points in a non-controversial way, and to present them in the most impartial way I can.  I put the facts before the Minister as I see them and as they have been put to me by people in my own county and by people I met in other counties and in the City of Dublin.  If the Minister were able to clarify the whole position, he might be able to relieve the minds of a lot of people, particularly the parents of the children concerned.  This is a source of worry to them, and not alone to them but to a large number of teachers.  For obvious reasons the teachers cannot be vocal in the matter, but a great number of them are doubtful about the benefits to be derived from the present system.  I hope the Minister, when replying, will let us have his point of view and the point of view of his Department, and that he will tell us towards what end the present policy is being pursued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BridgetMRedmond" hpid="Mrs. Redmond Mrs. Redmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I thoroughly agree with every word Deputy Morrissey has said on the subject of Irish.  As he <Col N="2404" /> said, it is, unfortunately, the case in this country that when one speaks the truth it is often misinterpreted, and one is ballyragged around the country as being opposed to everything national.  For a long number of years this country has heard a great deal about national culture in connection with this Irish teaching in the schools. I have no objection whatever to the teaching of Irish as a subject, but I am absolutely opposed to the teaching of every other subject in Irish.  If the matter were really carefully considered and examined, it would, I think, be found that very few of the teachers were really capable of teaching every subject perfectly through the medium of Irish.  I say this on the authority of people who are running schools&mdash;nuns, lay teachers and the clergy&mdash;that, as far as I can see, if people had the courage to say so, nobody wants this whole-hog system of Irish which we have at the present time.  As I said before, you are misinterpreted, or likely to be misinterpreted, if you say so.  I make my position absolutely clear.  I am deadly opposed to the teaching of every subject through the medium of Irish.  I do not object to the language, but I think that a large amount of money is squandered every year for which we receive absolutely no return.</P>
      <P>We must realise that the children now being educated are those who will be running this country some day.  I want to ask anyone interested in the subject are we absolutely certain that the children will be better fitted to do that through the medium of Irish than they were in the days that are past? We sometimes hear and read about self-made men.  These were educated when Irish was not compulsory and the education they received in the national schools enabled them to work themselves up.  That was at a time when education was not supposed to be at the high pitch it is at to-day.  If Irish were being taught in the schools when these people received their education, and if it were compulsory there at that time, I doubt very much whether these men could have made the success of their lives that they did make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to look at this matter apart altogether from politics and regardless <Col N="2405" /> of which side of the House Deputies sit.  I know that the parents of the children all over the country are deadly opposed to this compulsory Irish.  I believe if, to-morrow, a ballot were taken in every school in every parish in the country it would be found that a majority of the people were opposed to it.  The teachers find that they are being given an impossible task.  In the first place they are not succeeding with the children who have little liking for the language and, in the second place, there is a complete jumble in the minds of the children who do not understand what they are supposed to be learning.  They do not understand what the thing is in English and they cannot understand it in Irish.</P>
    <P>The main idea of education is to prepare the child for the future life. Certainly, as we have it at the present time, the children are not being prepared for the future life.  If a boy at the age of 15 years is seeking employment and knows nothing but Irish, it is quite certain his services will not be required in many places, of which I have some knowledge.  There is no objection to his knowing the language. But so far as taking his directions in Irish the boy will soon find that he will get no directions in that language; he will find that there will be no use for Irish where he is employed and, therefore, he will find that there was no necessity to know it.</P>
    <P>In many cases in the schools it is a fact that English grammar and arithmetic are not really taught at all. I understand that in the future, arithmetic will not be compulsory in girls' schools.  Surely that will not make for a proper education.  I appeal to the Minister on that point. Arithmetic is as necessary for girls as for boys.  I ask the Minister to have that proposed departure carefully examined.  I ask him to have it examined not by people who are just simply prejudiced and are afraid to go back on what they have already said.  Believe me, the people of the country are not behind the Minister in this matter.  They believe they are not getting good value for the money that is being spent on education.  It is the taxpayers' money and the <Col N="2406" /> children to-day are not being educated as children were in the past.</P>
    <P>We are supposed to be advancing but everyone knows that the ordinary children in the schools at present are not getting the education in English, arithmetic, grammar and other subjects that was being given 25 or 30 years ago.  Surely the idea of trying to learn algebra and Euclid through the medium of Irish is ridiculous.  It is hard enough on the child to learn these through the language that he knows&mdash;English.  How much harder it must be in Irish, which the child does not know?  It has been said by previous speakers that the education, so far as boys are concerned, should be related to the particular phase of life or the particular calling which the boy is to follow in order to get his livelihood. With that I am in agreement. The boy should be prepared for his life as a farmer if he is expected to follow that calling, or for business if he is expected to make his living in that way.  How much better that would be for the boys than being forced to devote their time in school to subjects which can be of very little use to them.</P>
    <P>Money should be alloted for additional technical schools, for such things as cookery, sewing and other domestic subjects.  This would be far more beneficial for the children and the parents would welcome the change. I ask the Minister to take this thing very seriously and not to listen to people who tell him that everything in the schools is going on all right.  It is now found that it is impossible to get the children to take an efficient interest in the Irish language because of its being forced on them.  Nobody wants this compulsory Irish.  One does not feel that one is less Irish because one does not know the Irish language. I know there are a few people who think it sounds well to talk about national culture but, in fact, all that sort of talk does not mean anything. Indeed I would not like to say about this forcing of Irish the things I hear people outside saying about it.</P>
    <P>We are not spending the money voted for education in the best way. It is a miserable interpretation of the <Col N="2407" /> word &ldquo;education&rdquo; to teach children as they are being taught throughout the country at present.  The people want this whole business revised.  I hope the Minister will take steps to do that.  I hope he will accept the sincere criticism of people whose only object is the welfare of the youth of the country and to tell him the truth about what is happening in the schools. I am speaking simply for the good of the children as a whole.  I recently heard the head of a certain school in Ireland saying that in order to get the children to take Irish seriously there, there had to be established what is known as a particular feast-day.  This was held once a week in order to encourage the children to take an interest in the Irish.  The children, in order to induce them to take an interest, were to have something extra at this tea.  It is not that the children were not properly fed on other days. It was considered a high-class school. The children flocked down to this tea. But it was not for love of the Irish language.  That is a fact, and I mention it as evidence of what is the feeling in other similar schools and what is happening in the ordinary national schools.  I trust, when the Minister comes to reply, that he will give us some hope that in the future working of his Department the points I have put before him will be considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a few words on this subject.  I am aware that it is the general concensus of opinion that the standard of education is lower to-day than ever it was in this country.  There can be little doubt about that, because both teachers and parents agree that the standard has been considerably lowered.  Whether that is due to Irish or to some other cause I am not able to say.  The general opinion is that it is due to the method of teaching Irish and to the fact that the Irish language is obtruded on the teachers and too much of the school time is monopolised by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The education standard at present is very low.  There are very many useful subjects that pupils leaving the primary schools at the age of 14 years <Col N="2408" /> should know but they have never been taught these things at all.  Many of these subjects relate to the ordinary business of life and the children are never taught them.  The children know nothing about book-keeping, they know nothing about agriculture, they know very little about arithmetic, very little about grammar and nothing at all about geography.  These are subjects in which a great many years ago the children were well instructed in the national schools.  Many of these subjects have now been dropped and Irish substituted for them.  If it were the case that the children leaving the schools had been made into Irish speaking children, then we would have been given something in exchange but we have neither the one nor the other. There are some people who are cynical enough to believe that the object of this Irish teaching is not to educate the children but to make them ignorant.  Irish is being thrust down the throats of the children and the result is they know neither Irish nor English.</P>
    <P>The strange thing is that anything that is Irish that the children do understand is not tolerated by the present Government.  It seems there must be a difference of opinion in the Executive Council.  For we find that the Minister for Justice is opposed to Irish and the Minister for Education is all for Irish.  A question was put down last week to the Minister for Justice on the matter of Irish time and his reply was that he would not have Irish time in Ireland.  Neither are we allowed to use Irish measure in Ireland.  I live near the Border of Northern Ireland, and it is a simple fact that when you cross the Border into Northern Ireland, which is supposed to be English, you get Irish mileage.  Go into the Free State and you have English mileage.  They do not understand English measure or English time; they do understand Irish measure and Irish time, but they will not be allowed to have them. They do not understand the Irish language, but it is being forced down their throats, while they are being deprived of learning a great many useful subjects.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2409" /> The main body of the pupils, who are not able to go further than the national schools, are being deprived of those advantages.  Those who can afford to go further can get more generous education, and can recover lost time, but the unfortunate poor of the country have no opportunity of recovering it, and are at a serious disadvantage. Mind you, more than one of those people have to seek their living in other countries.  Of what use to them is this half learned language, which they never spoke or never used or never could use?  They are being deprived of knowing the very useful subjects that they ought to know, and that are necessary in any country in order to enable them to earn their living. I think the Minister should look into this matter, and that he should have some sort of inquiry in order to learn the opinions of people down the country who are entitled to give an opinion with regard to the whole matter of the teaching in national schools, how far Irish should be pursued, and what methods should be adopted in order to make Irish a success. If they want ever to make it a language that will be generally spoken there is need to improve the methods of teaching it, because so far those methods have been a failure.  None of the children leaving the national schools speaks Irish.  That proves how much of a failure those methods have been.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I want to refer is the fact that there is no agricultural trend in the teaching in rural districts.  The children are taught to disregard the occupation of their parents, the occupation which they ought to be taught something about. Forty or 50 years ago, and up to a later date, the children were taught something about the business of the rural districts, that is agriculture.  Now there is not a word about it in the schools, and I think that that is a terrible neglect and a terrible fault in the system at the present time.  I believe that, if a commission were set up to deal with this matter, nine out of every ten who would give evidence would recommend a change in this direction. We see a good deal in the papers from people who are qualified to give an <Col N="2410" /> opinion&mdash;clergy and others who have given the subject a good deal of thought, and have the interests of the country at heart&mdash;and they all deplore the lack of an agricultural trend in the education.  The children are being taught to prize the city life instead of being taught to have some regard for the occupation to which most of the people in the rural districts have been brought up, and which they should be encouraged to pursue.  That is a very serious mistake.  The people are flying from the rural districts because there is nothing to encourage them to stay there.  They are not even taught the elements of the business in which they are engaged, and therefore they have no interest in nor taste for it.  Their minds are directed towards other occupations.  I think the whole question of education in the national schools needs to be examined, and a different curriculum introduced.  When speaking to the teachers privately, there is not one of them who does not admit being of the same mind.  They all say there is something wrong in the system of education; that they cannot do the work which is imposed upon them; that they are dissatisfied because of the fact that they are turning out the children from the national schools who are not in a position to make their way in life.</P>

      <P>A great deal has been said here, and there has been a great deal of criticism, with reference to the system of teaching through Irish. We have been told that the standard of education is lower as a result.  We have heard that the parents are against it, and that the children are getting muddled.  I can quite understand that it is the aim of people on that side of the House to criticise every Estimate that comes in here, but from inquiries which I have made I find that those people who spoke about the parents and about the children have no reason for expressing those opinions.  I think only two teachers spoke in this House, and neither of them had anything to say against the system.  Deputy Hurley spoke here, and gave his own experience as a teacher and as a father of a family, but he did not offer the same criticism as <Col N="2411" /> we have heard from the opposite benches.  Personally, my experience is quite different from what I have heard from that side of the House.  Last Sunday there was a children's football match in Balbriggan, between the Swords children and the Balbriggan children.  Having a fairly big car, I promised the children that I would bring them to the football match.  While going down to the match they seemed to take great delight in chatting in Irish.  Even out on the field, playing football, they spoke to each other in Irish.  From my own experience of listening to little children, I can say that they take great delight in repeating their nursery rhymes in Irish&mdash;&ldquo;Eeny, meeny, miny, mo&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hididdle-diddle,&rdquo; and all those other nursery rhymes.  Also at their various games, such as hop-scotch, and so on, they have got into the habit of using the Irish language.</P>

      <P>A tip for him came in in a bottle down in Stradbally, and I am going to back him to-morrow.  I do not agree with the people who criticise the system of teaching through Irish. The statement by the Minister was very welcome.  Any increases that there were in the Estimate were, I think, very welcome.  There was an increase in the amount for heating and cleaning of schools.  In the rural areas, where charwomen and labourers are employed, that is very welcome.  The State will bear half the cost, and there has been an increase in the Estimate to meet that charge for the coming year. There has also been an increase for the provision of new schools.  As far as my own constituency of County Dublin is concerned, I must say that good progress has been made both in the provision <Col N="2412" /> of new schools and in the improvement of other schools.  It is true that there are odd schools here and there which are a disgrace.  St. Margaret's is one of which I would like the Minister to take particular note.</P>
      <P>All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy, and apart from the standard of education, the system, and everything else, I should like to remind the Minister that there are other aspects to be looked at, such as cleanliness of the children&mdash;seeing that the children should be given every chance in the matter of cleanliness&mdash;and sanitation in schools.  I quote from an extract from a report from the county medical officer of health of the 31st January, 1939, stating that of the 109 schools in the county health district 61 had no proper water supply; that in 29 other schools a water supply was available within a reasonable distance, and that in nine of them it was necessary for the children to cross the main road.</P>

      <P>In page 5, before Section 11, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  When a planning authority has passed a resolution for the making of a planning scheme and has, before such planning scheme comes into operation, made a special prohibition in relation to any work, such planning authority, in addition to the powers conferred on them by sub-section (1) of Section 58 of the Principal Act, may, if they are of opinion either&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  that the remedying after the coming into operation of such planning <Col N="2413" /> scheme of the prejudicial effect of proceeding with or doing the work to which such special prohibition relates would be unduly costly or would involve undue delay in the enforcement of such planning scheme, or</P>
    <P>(b)  that such effect would seriously injure the amenities of the neighbourhood during the period before the coming into operation of such planning scheme,</P>
    <P>declare, at any time before such planning scheme comes into operation, that any contravention of such special prohibition before such coming into operation shall be unlawful.</P>
    <P>(2)  a declaration under this section shall, for the purposes of the Principal Act and, in particular, for the purposes of sub-section (2) of Section 58 of the Principal Act, be deemed to be a declaration under the said Section 58.</P>
    <P>On the Committee Stage several amendments were down in the name of Deputy Benson, who took a great interest in the discussion on this Bill. Amongst other points raised by him there were three in connection with which I promised that I would try to look into the matter again and see how far I could go to meet the points of view he had been putting up.  In this amendment, which is now on the Order Paper in my name, I think I am going a considerable way to meet Deputy Benson's point of view with regard to one of these matters.  I have had long discussions with those responsible for the drafting of the Bill&mdash;the experts in my Department&mdash;and they were rather timorous about going so far.  A lot of this legislation in town planning is experimental. It is new; there has not been anything like it before, and we have not had any experience of its working.  Therefore, we hesitate to tie it up too tightly in rules and regulations, especially in regard to any to which penalties might be attachable for the infringements thereof.  However, we have decided to go as far as is suggested in this amendment, and I think it meets the Deputy's point of view to a considerable extent.</P>

      <P>The only thing I have to say about this amendment can be very briefly summed up, and that is by saying &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo;; because I think the Minister has met everything I suggested on this point.  It is very satisfactory, and I am sure it will be a big help to the town planning authorities in carrying on developments, because it will enable them to control certain things which, previously, they could control nominally, but which, in actual fact, they could not control until the plan became operative.  I think this is perfectly satisfactory.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 12, Section 28, line 49, to delete the words &ldquo;the owner of the land to which such road plan relates&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;an owner of land.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is one that, I think, could properly be described as a drafting amendment.  It is merely to change the words &ldquo;the owner&rdquo; to &ldquo;an owner.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am not clear as to the purpose of this amendment, but it seems to me that possibly it is rather too wide.  The section, as now proposed to be amended, would read that a local authority charged with the construction and maintenance of roads may, in pursuance of a road plan and at the cost of an owner of the land to which such road plan relates, construct any new road, and so on.  Surely if that is taken in its broadest sense, it would mean that if the local authority is going to do something on, say, the North side of Dublin, they can make an owner of land on the South side pay for it.  The words proposed definitely suggest the owner of the land to which certain road planning relates, and I think this is very much broader. I suggest that it is too wide altogether, and does not confine the matter to the actual land which is being developed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it is to be read in connection with the other sections of the Bill.  When taking this section and the others that go before it, it means in reality the developing owner. There might be a case where there <Col N="2415" /> would be two owners, the developing owner and another owner, but the person we would be interested in for these purposes would be the developing owner finally.  We have thought of the point of view put by Deputy Benson, and we think that this will be more accurate, will give us wider scope, and will not lead to any injustice or to anybody who is not the right owner being brought in.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>On that question, Sir, there was one other point of some importance that I raised with the Minister on the Committee Stage, and that was on the question of advertisements affixed to structures.  The matter was also raised by Deputy Walsh, of Drogheda, and the Minister said that he would look into it.  I rather gathered from what the Minister said, in reply, I think, to Deputy Brennan, that there was a suggestion that there might be further legislation on that subject.  I should like to know what has been the result of the Minister's consideration, if he is in a position to inform us yet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said earlier, I promised that I would give further examination to three of the points raised by Deputy Benson.  We have examined this one regarding the control of advertisements, and we are satisfied that we have gone as far as we can to meet the suggestions that have been put up in the course of the discussion on this Bill, and, before these discussions arose here, to meet the point of view that there should be in the hands of local authorities power to control these advertisements.  There are advertisements in existence in, say, the City of Dublin that are objectionable, but a number of these, perhaps, <Col N="2416" /> cannot be interfered with, or you cannot oblige the owner to take them down until the planning scheme comes into operation.  I think the Deputy was chiefly interested in advertisements that were indestructible, or rather advertisements that are an obstacle to the improvement of the city of a permanent nature.  We will have all the power that is necessary, of course, when the planning scheme is adopted, but it is difficult in the interim to give power now to any local authority to go around looking at these things that are objectionable from the aesthetic point of view or the building point of view, and giving too widespread powers to them to wipe out these objectionable things.  Some of these things have been there for many long years and, even though they are objectionable, it is difficult to deal with the matter, and the giving of such powers might lead to destructive work of a wholesale kind and God only knows where it would end.</P>
      <P>If we give too much encouragement, now that we are getting town-planning conscious, so to speak, elements who are enthusiasts on the subject and some who might even be fanatics on the subject, would perhaps go too far. Those who have any association with town planning in my Department and I myself would like to see the ideas that the Deputy has in mind put into operation but we have to go slowly. A beginning is being made.  The idea of town planning is new and <i>festina lente</i> is a wise motto in regard to putting into operation certain aspects of town planning.  There are any amount of these bill-posting signs on buildings and on railway bridges, and even the railway bridges themselves, that I should like to see removed from a purely aesthetic point of view.  They do not add anything to the beauty of the City of Dublin, at any rate, but there are great difficulties in the way and I think we shall have to hasten slowly.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>As I was saying, all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.  I should like to direct the attention of the Minister to a few other items arising out of this Vote, apart from the system of education, the standard of education and other matters which have been threshed out here.  The first matter with which I should like to deal is the question of cleanliness and sanitation in the schools.  The children should be given an opportunity of practising cleanliness in the schools.  From the report of the Dublin Board of Health for the 31st January, 1939, it appears the county medical officer reported that of 109 schools in the county health district, 61 have no proper water supply, and nine are a considerable distance away from a water supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 39 cases only was there a proper water supply.  In the remaining cases the children had to cross a main street, a very dangerous practice, to get water.  The Minister will probably say, in reply, that this is a matter for the managers of the schools.  The various boards of health, I am sure, have frequently endeavoured to see that schools are provided with proper water supplies and that sanitary and sewerage arrangements are attached to these schools.  I would suggest to the Minister that he should bring pressure to bear on the managers of the schools, if it is their function to provide these facilities.  If not, the Department should consider the question of providing a water supply and proper sewerage and sanitation in each school.  I refer in particular to schools in the Dublin County Health District.  I am sure that a similar situation exists in other counties.  There are various schools in County Dublin which have not even a playground.  The children have nowhere to play unless they run out on the roads.  That is true even of schools some distance outside the <Col N="2418" /> towns.  The children should have some place where they could have a healthy game of football or where they could eat their lunches in peace and security without running out on the roads.  The question of providing playgrounds for national schools is one to which the Minister should give every consideration and I should be glad if he would look into it.  Surely there is sufficient land available.  If land owners in the vicinity of those schools were approached by the Department of Education, I am sure they would be agreeable to give over some little piece of ground which could be utilised as a playground.</P>
    <P>One other matter to which I should like to draw attention is the question of providing free school books.  I heard at least one Deputy on the other side advocating that these books should be supplied to all children in the schools.  This is an experiment which has been tried by the Minister and I hope it will be very successful and that when the Estimates come along next year the amount provided for free school books will be greatly increased.  I also hope that the Minister's regulations regarding these free school books will provide that they are not to be issued to all children and that only the children of necessitous parents get them, the children of poor people and of working class people. Otherwise the privilege will be abused, and the people whom this grant is intended to benefit will not receive the full advantage of it.</P>
    <P>When about two years ago I first came into this House, I was amused at the various speeches which Deputy Dillon used to make here.  He used to speak about meat, flour, cotton balls, and everything that could possibly be debated in this House.  I was told then that no one ever took him seriously, and that the Government certainly did not take him seriously.  Listening to what he said on this Estimate, I can understand why nobody does take him seriously.  He advocated the closing of rural schools in certain areas, and suggested that buses be provided to bring the children into school in the towns; that buses should go round and collect them.  Just think of what might happen <Col N="2419" /> in that case.  Mickey would be late in the morning, perhaps, and the bus would have to wait for him.  Then he would be kept in in the evening as punishment, after the other children had left, just as many of us were kept in in our school days, and the bus would have to wait 15 minutes or so for him. Or perhaps Mickey would have to do messages before he could leave for school.  The bus would arrive at the school about one o'clock in the day. Then it might be six o'clock in the evening, owing to various delays, before the bus could get home.  Very often the children would have their parents along with them.  It would become a regular shopping bus.  I never heard such a ridiculous suggestion before in all my life.</P>
    <P>The Minister may not be aware of the schemes under which scholarships are provided for children attending national schools.  Local authorities are enabled to strike a rate of 2d. in the £ to provide such scholarships.  I find, from a long experience of local administration, extending over a period of 15 years, that a rate of 2d. in the £ is inadequate.  It is generally sufficient to provide only about 20 or 24 scholarships. Occasionally, under a county scheme, you may have 35 or 40 children who will pass the examination, but only about 25 can receive scholarships. An injury is inflicted in such cases on the sons and daughters of working-class people who are unable to send their children to Christian Brothers' schools or to other secondary schools.</P>
    <P>The result is that children in national schools, some of whom, unfortunately, when they go home in the evenings may have to work by the light of a candle and on their knees beside a chair, have to compete with children who are educated under better circumstances. To the credit of these children it must be said that they pass the examinations, but as only a rate of 2d. in the £ can be levied, they are deprived of scholarships. I suggest that the Minister should look into the matter with a view to giving local authorities power to increase the rate so that scholarships <Col N="2420" /> might be provided for children attending national schools.  I have very little more to say about this Estimate beyond directing the Minister's notice to the points to which I have referred. I must congratulate the Department on the work being done.  I think that great credit is due to the teachers for the efforts they are making in the teaching of Irish.  They are doing admirable work.  I hope that when the Minister introduces his Estimate next year the same progress that has taken place during the last twelve months will be continued, and that he will be as generous, if not more generous, than he has been in this Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>Judging by the remarks of some of the speakers, towards the conclusion of the debate, one would imagine that they were entirely unfamiliar with the fact that there has been a national policy in progress the object of which is to make Irish the spoken language of the people, and that, as a concomitant of that policy, there has been for many years past a programme in operation in the national schools, and in the other schools, which aims at making our young people Irish speakers.  This programme has not been devised by me.  It is the outcome of a conference representing, as far as primary education is concerned, the managers and teachers as well as the Government of the day.  The conference sat in 1925, and the programme which it then brought in is still in operation.  I have already referred to this programme, but it seems necessary again to quote from it.  Page 27 of the Report and Programme presented by the National Programme Conference to the Minister for Education says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where a teacher is competent to teach through Irish, and where the children can assimilate the instruction so given, the teacher should endeavour to extend the use of Irish as a medium of instruction as far as possible.</P>
      <P>When these conditions do not exist, such teaching through Irish is not obligatory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Teachers who hold bilingual or higher certificates will, unless there be evidence to the contrary, be regarded <Col N="2421" /> as competent; but the possession of these certificates is not an essential condition for such teaching.</P>
    <P>When the full use of Irish as a medium of instruction is not possible any or all of the following transitional courses are suggested:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  The use of both languages in teaching certain subjects;</P>
    <P>(2)  A gradual extension through the standards, beginning at the lowest, of instruction through Irish;</P>
    <P>(3)  The gradual extension through the subjects of the use of Irish as a medium of instruction.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On page 10 of the Report of the Conference it is stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;One of the leading characteristics of that programme is its insistence on the principle of teaching the infant classes through the medium of Irish.  The members of our Conference agreed on the supreme importance of giving effect as far as possible to this principle; and in confirmation of their belief they received authoritative evidence. It was argued with much weight that a `direct' method of teaching Irish, continued during the length of an ordinary school day for a few years between the ages of four and eight, would be quite sufficient&mdash;given trained and fluent teachers&mdash;to impart to children a vernacular power over the language; while, in the case of older children, it was shown that such a result would be more difficult of attainment.  The members of the Conference were, therefore, at one in holding that the true and only method of establishing Irish as a vernacular is the effective teaching of it to the infants.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Irish, therefore, is not, as Deputy Dillon would have us believe, a language of instruction in infant classes, as there is no instruction in infant classes in any modern educational system.  There is only language teaching on the direct method, which excludes the use of any language but the language taught, which was Irish in this case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2422" /> In spite of the attacks which have been made on the direct method in infant schools and classes I believe that it has justified itself where the teaching is done by skilful teachers.  I ought to know what is going on in the schools better than the critics, as I am in constant touch with the inspectors. Quite recently I discussed this whole question with them, and I am satisfied that the conditions laid down in the 1931 Circular, from which I quoted on a former occasion in this House in reply to Deputy Dillon, are being carried out.  I find the attitude of the chief Opposition Party in this matter difficult to understand.  Are we to take it that the ex-Ministers, who are far more responsible than I am for the policy of teaching through Irish in the primary schools, in the secondary schools, and in University College, Galway, are no longer in favour of it? If they are, how can Deputy Mulcahy who, I think, is largely responsible for the experiment of compelling an institution of university status to give instruction through Irish remain silent, while Deputy Dillon attacks the policy which he himself sponsored?</P>
    <P>If the Government of which Deputy Mulcahy was a member instituted a scheme for higher education through Irish in University College, Galway, did they really believe in it at the time, or, if they did believe in it, have they now changed their minds?  In that particular case the Government deliberately interfered in university education to encourage and subsidise instruction through Irish.  If this policy was feasible and sound so far as university education is concerned, it surely should be, at least, equally feasible and sound where secondary or even primary education is concerned. I do not claim credit or responsibility for the introduction of teaching through Irish in either national schools or secondary schools; it had been introduced and firmly established by the previous Government, and since I became Minister, it has been carried on according to the principles laid down by my predecessor.  These principles have been stated here so frequently by him and by me, that it is not necessary to repeat them.  As evidence that my predecessor, and the <Col N="2423" /> Government at that time, considered that teaching through Irish in secondary schools was educationally sound, and should be encouraged, I might refer to the action taken in 1931 to establish an Irish-speaking secondary school for boys in Dublin.  It was considered that sufficient progress was not being made in providing teaching through Irish in the existing boys' schools, and instead of putting pressure on these schools to increase the amount of such teaching, as one would expect to be done, if one paid any heed to the allegations of Deputy Dillon, the Christian Brothers were approached and asked to open a boys' school in which all subjects, except English, would be taught through the medium of Irish.  This was an interesting experiment.</P>
    <P>The City of Dublin was well supplied with boys' secondary schools, and the opening of a new school, in which Irish was the ordinary medium of instruction, would afford a fair test as to what demand existed for a school of that type, or whether parents were so much opposed to instruction through Irish as is sometimes alleged.  The new Irish-speaking school opened with 26 boys in 'October, 1931; the following year the numbers increased to 73, and the year after to 137.  Since then, there has been a steady annual increase, and the present attendance is 176. As I have already mentioned, this new school had to compete with existing old-established secondary schools, and its success is evidence that there is a genuine demand among parents for a thorough Irish education for their children.  I might add that the number of boys' secondary schools in Dublin in which Irish is the ordinary medium of instruction has now increased to four.  There are still six Catholic boys' schools in the city in which no instruction is given through Irish, so that if parents object to their children being taught through Irish, they have a remedy at hand.  The fact that the number of Irish-speaking schools and the attendance at these schools goes on increasing, year after year, should provide a convincing answer for any honest inquirer to the unfounded allegations <Col N="2424" /> put forward by people like Deputy Dillon regarding the objections by schools and teachers and parents to teaching through Irish.</P>
    <P>The instruction through Irish in the secondary schools has been proceeding over a long period of years.  It started in 1925 with two schools in the Class A category, which were doing all their work through Irish.  In 1925-6, the number of secondary schools in Class A increased to five, and, in the following years, it increased to 11, 13, 18, 21, 24, 34, 47, 61, 67, 77, 87, 97 and, during the present year, the estimated figure is 106.  Concurrently, in the other two classes, B 1 and B 2, in which portion, though not all, of the instruction is being given through Irish, there has been a similar increase.  In B 1, the number of schools in the year 1925-6 was 17 and, in the present year, it is estimated to be 50.  In B 2, the number of schools in 1925-6 was 19 and, in the present year, it is estimated to be 57. There were 41 schools in which Irish was the medium of instruction, either wholly or partly, in 1925-6 and, in the present year, the estimated number is 213.</P>
    <P>If further evidence on this matter were necessary, I might point to the fact that many of the secondary schools are boarding schools.  There are boarding schools for boys and for girls in which Irish is the ordinary language of instruction, and schools in which no instruction is given through Irish, so that parents are free to select Irish-speaking or English-speaking schools for their children.  Moreover, an arrangement was made a few years ago under which a large secondary school is empowered, if it wishes to do so, to establish a separate Irish-speaking section or school in which all the teaching would be given through Irish to those pupils who are fit to profit fully by such instruction.  This arrangement has been availed of by a number of schools, about ten, which desired to provide instruction through Irish to some of their pupils but had other pupils in attendance who had not a sufficient knowledge of Irish to follow instruction through that language.  I think this explanation should prove conclusively how groundless are the <Col N="2425" /> allegations made by people like Deputy Dillon about our policy of teaching through Irish in the secondary schools.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the actual experience of Deputies Morrissey and some of the other Deputies who have spoken with regard to the work that is being done through Irish in the national schools may be, but the figures which I have do not confirm the view that Deputy Morrissey and those who accept his point of view need have the slightest anxiety about this policy of driving Irish down the throats of the children.  The total number of schools classed as national schools with which I have to deal is in the neighbourhood of 5,400.  There are 171 schools in the Fior-Ghaeltacht in which all subjects are taught through the medium of Irish; there are 72 such schools in the Gaeltacht; there are 114 such schools in the Breac-Ghaelteacht; and there are 284 schools in the Galltacht: making a total of 641 schools. If we omit the Fior-Ghaeltacht schools and take the remaining 470 schools as a proportion of the total number of schools outside the Fior-Ghaeltacht area, we find that about 9 per cent. of the schools are schools in which the medium of instruction is Irish.</P>
    <P>The programme in operation in the schools, whether secondary or primary, is not, I repeat, the fruit of any ukase from my Department, but the fruit of the labours of conferences on secondary and primary education set up by a native Government as one of its earliest tasks.  That policy has been successful, both in the secondary and primary schools, in spite of the enormous difficulties involved.</P>
    <P>My Department is not, as Deputy Dillon suggests, so blind or so prejudiced as to ignore these difficulties. On the contrary, it is because we are fully alive to them that the whole question of the progress of Irish and of instruction through Irish in the schools, as a matter of fact, is constantly under review.  Our officers realise, as nobody else can, how much teachers need all the assistance they can get in the heavy task that has been laid upon them.  As I have often said, in no other country in the world has such a task been laid upon the schools.  Our teachers have not alone <Col N="2426" /> to teach the children to speak their national language, a huge task in itself, but, in the course of their work, they have to contend with the indifference of the general public in the matter, as well as with the open and veiled hostility of certain sections.  I assure the House that there are plenty of difficulties in the way of teaching successfully through Irish and no one is more aware of it than I am.  Anybody entrusted as I am with the responsibility of making this policy effective and who does his duty conscientiously, will have due regard to these difficulties, whether they be within or without the schools. I have always been cognisant of the difficulties.  I have had them under constant consideration and observation and it is this close and detailed knowledge which makes me regret all the more deeply the criticisms of people whose knowledge of the actual work done is either nil or derived from baseless hearsay.</P>
    <P>It would be taking up the time of the House to deal in detail with all the humbug for which Deputy Dillon has been responsible.  One of his pontifical statements was that children could not add or write as they did 15 years ago.  In columns 2142 and 2143, he says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Look at the children coming out of the primary schools to-day.  They cannot read; they cannot spell; they cannot add; and they cannot write.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Nobody here will argue that the children coming out of the primary schools to-day can add or write as they did 15 years ago.  It is common knowledge that the average child coming out of school to-day cannot read, or write a legible hand.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>One wonders exactly what knowledge Deputy Dillon has of the situation in our schools 15 years ago.  He must have a good idea surely of the amount of knowledge which the children of that day had.  In case anybody in the Dáil or in the country may be deceived by this kind of nonsense, I would simply call his attention to the figures showing the enrolments in the higher standards since the School Attendance Act came into force.  What was the position before the School Attendance <Col N="2427" /> Act of 1926?  The majority of pupils of the national schools attended school in a casual and intermittent manner and they often left school at the end of the third or fourth standard.</P>
    <P>Giving evidence before the Technical Education Commission in 1930, Mr. W.P. Ward, Ballinasloe, a well-known teacher, referred to this.  He pointed out that up to a year or two before that, the average age at which children left the primary schools in the country was between 11½ and 12 years.  Many of the children only attended anyway regularly during the slack periods in agriculture.  The result was that it was extremely hard to do anything with them.  What is the position now?  For many years the higher standards have been steadily filling up.  There are no figures, unfortunately, available for the years prior to 1926, but in 1926 there were 45,499 pupils in the fifth standard. In 1937-38 there were 52,872, an increase of, roughly, 16 per cent.  In 1926 there were 24,502 pupils in the sixth standard, and in 1937-38 there were 38,751, an increase of approximately 58 per cent.  In the seventh standard in 1926 there were 10,237 children, and in the same standard in 1937-38 there were 17,773, an increase of 73 per cent.  In the eighth standard in 1926 there were 3,415, and in the same standard in 1937-38 there were 6,342, an increase of 86 per cent.</P>
    <P>The total increase in enrolment in the higher standards between 1927-28 and 1937-38 was from 89,455 to 115,738, or an increase of 29 per cent.  The percentage of the total numbers of children on the rolls in the higher standards in 1937-38 was 24.4 per cent. as against 17.5 per cent. in 1927-28. Whereas we formerly had the position that many of the children, after very irregular attendance during their school lives, left school at the age of 12 or before it, every child now has to attend at least until he or she is 14, and a fair proportion of children continue to attend until they are 15 or more.  The figures of enrolment of pupils between 14 and 16 at secondary and vocational schools are in the neighbourhood of 14,500 and 17,500, respectively, while there are some 13,000 pupils attending primary <Col N="2428" /> schools.  Yet, year after year we are told that the standard of education is going down when, in fact, it is steadily improving.  There is a wide extension of post-primary activities and the extraordinarily keen competition for appointments in the Civil Service, coupled with the increase in entrants to the universities, shows we are on the upgrade educationally all the time.</P>
    <P>It would be too much to ask Deputy Dillon to give some proof or evidence that there is any substance in his statements.  Time after time his charges have been shown to be completely baseless, but still he persists in repeating them.  There is one statement of his, however, which I cannot let pass without a strong protest, namely, that papers worked through Irish for the intermediate examinations receive different treatment from others.  I find he raised this question two years ago at the Committee of Public Accounts, and he received information then which showed that these allegations were completely without foundation.  As, however, he seems to have forgotten this, I shall take the liberty of quoting the answers given to him on that occasion.  Here are some extracts from page 54 of the Minutes of Evidence taken before the Committee of Public Accounts on the 12th May, 1937.  I may mention that the chairman on the occasion was Deputy Dillon:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Chairman: I take it that there is continual surveillance to see that in Class A schools the education imparted is satisfactory?&mdash;Yes.  The students sit for the same examination, and the same standard of instruction is required in the subjects taught, whether they are taught through Irish or English.</P>
    <P>Is the same standard required in the examination?&mdash;Yes.  The same paper is set.</P>
    <P>I know that the same paper is set, but is the same standard required, or how is it arrived at?&mdash; The examiners who mark the papers would be the same for marking, whether through Irish or English. The only advantage in the case of <Col N="2429" /> Irish is that a small increased percentage may be awarded.  It is comparatively small&mdash;not more than 10 per cent. of the marks actually deserved on the merits of the answering. Not more than 10 per cent. may be awarded in the case of subjects taught through the medium of Irish, such as history and geography, and not more than 5 per cent. in the case of mathematics.</P>
    <P>When the examiners are arriving at the standard which shall be fixed as the pass standard in a given examination, am I correct in saying that the objective is to fix such standard as will permit 70 per cent. of the candidates to pass and 30 per cent. to fail?&mdash;No.  I do not think that could be done.  At any rate, it is not attempted.  When the examination has been set, before the papers are corrected, the examiner who sets the paper meets his correcting or marking examiners and instructs them as to what marks should be awarded for a certain kind of answer, and what marks should be deducted for a certain kind of error.  That was further expanded by the standardising committee.  At present, I think, science is being taken in that connection.  The teachers appoint representatives who meet the examiner and discuss the paper, and they decide that a certain marking should be awarded for answering a certain question, and so on.  Once that is done, there could be no possible adjustment to ensure that 60 per cent. or 70 per cent. should pass.</P>
    <P>The same papers are set in the case of students using Irish?&mdash;Yes.</P>
    <P>They are translated and given to them?&mdash;Yes.</P>
    <P>Is there a separate standardising committee to deal with papers given through the medium of Irish?&mdash;No.</P>
    <P>In the event of an undue proportion of pupils&mdash;let us say, 30 per cent. &mdash;failing, can there be any revision of the standard?&mdash;Well, it occurred only once in my experience, about ten or 12 years ago, when a certain standard was introduced, there seemed to be dissatisfaction about <Col N="2430" /> the standard of mathematics.  It was felt that the standard was rather strange and difficult, and it was considered whether it would be possible then to go over all the marked answer books with a view to adjusting the marking, but there were so many thousands of these that it was found not to be possible.  As things stand now, however, if it is found that more than 30 per cent. fail in a certain subject, the marks must stand.</P>
    <P>With regard to the general question of Irish in the schools, I think it will be appreciated that it would be very difficult, indeed, to insist upon exact standards which could be everywhere enforced.  We have to depend on our teachers and inspectors to use their commonsense, intelligence and initiative in dealing with the problems which arise.  We are in a transition period with regard to Irish.  Some schools are far in advance of others; some teachers are more highly qualified or more skilful than others.  Even if we were not in the painful position that, generally speaking, the schools receive very little support from the people outside, either individually or collectively, in their uphill task of making the children Irish speakers, we would have to recognise that in any national system of education there must be differences of standards of attainment, of qualifications, of skill, of opportunities, which render comparisons between one school and another, one area and another area, one period and another, fallacious, apart from success in written examinations, which not everyone will agree is an entirely sound and universal test of educational efficiency.</P>
    <P>There is no easy rule or formula which enables us to say with regard to Irish or any other subject, that progress is everywhere satisfactory or unsatisfactory. There are the extremes of highly meritorious work and inefficient work, and in between these we have a great range of effort. Teachers must satisfy the inspectors in the individual subjects and on the general results of their work.  I am satisfied that the great majority of the teachers are doing their work honestly <Col N="2431" /> and conscientiously, and that the inspectors, with whom I am in constant touch, are closely acquainted with the work of the schools, and that both are using their best endeavours to improve the standard of education where improvement is necessary.  I am hopeful that in the future we shall have closer co-operation between the teaching body and the Department of Education, and that through the medium of discussion and consultation teachers and inspectors will work in harmony, each seeing the other's point of view and trying to meet it as far as possible, and neither having any interest other than to improve the efficiency of the schools, and to do their utmost to advance the children's education. It would be extraordinary if, in this country, under a native Government both these important sections in the educational administration, the teachers and the inspectors, could not be got to co-operate to the fullest possible extent in the common interest.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure Deputy Hurley, and the other representatives of the teachers whom I meet from time to time, that I am anxious that the Department of Education should work in close co-operation with the teachers, and that the most friendly relations should exist between our officers and the teaching profession.  In fact, I would like the teachers to take the inspectors into their confidence more than they do: to acquaint them of their troubles and to ask their advice.  I have tried to foster a friendly spirit on the departmental side, and I would be greatly surprised if the inspectors do not manifest a helpful and a friendly interest in the difficulties of the teachers whom they visit.</P>
    <P>Emphasis has been laid, and quite rightly, on the development of the qualities of helpfulness, direction and guidance on the inspectors' side.  Just as the success of the work in the schools depends very largely upon the personal influence of the teachers, so the fostering of harmonious relations, and a mutual spirit of trust as between teachers and inspectors, depends very largely on the personality of the individual. I agree that full co-operation between the teachers and the Department <Col N="2432" /> is essential to the welfare of education in this country.  The routine of inspection has its place and I am not going to underrate its importance, but the general aim and purpose of the system, which should be reflected in the spirit which animates it, are in my opinion the elements which count most. Most of the inspectors were teachers themselves, and nobody can understand better than they do the difficulties with which teachers have to contend.  As far as I am concerned I have always counselled the inspectors to take due cognisance of these difficulties and to make allowance for them.  That has always been the policy which the Department has laid down.  If the teachers would only look on the inspectors as friendly guides, who are anxious to assist them, rather than as officials who merely find fault, I believe we would achieve far greater progress in securing that the friendly relations which we all desire would obtain in all cases.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the success of the Cork experiment for the raising of the school-leaving age there.  I am glad that there has been such general satisfaction with the result of the experiment. One of the most gratifying features of the scheme is the support it received from the Cork City employees.  Each young employee, I am informed, is provided with a school attendance card which his employer requires him to produce weekly as a certificate of his attendance at the school.  The new courses are also being utilised as recruiting centres for employment, employers seeking the advice of the teachers in the choice of suitable applicants.  Moreover, the chance of finding good employment obviously constitutes a strong incentive to a young person to work steadily at his course.  Finally, the local vocational committee who deserve the greatest credit for the success of the experiment which they have initiated are taking steps to ensure, even after it is no longer compulsory for a student to attend the course&mdash;that is when he has reached the age of 16&mdash;that contact with them will, nevertheless, be maintained, and efforts will be made to see that they still participate in the activities of the technical school in Cork.</P>
    <P>With regard to a general extension <Col N="2433" /> of continuation education, I am, of course, interested in the matter, and recently I have been examining a proposal which has been made from various quarters, and that is the feasibility of providing, within the ambit of the national school system, a training for the senior pupils in practical subjects: for example, a training in woodwork and allied subjects for boys, and in domestic economy for girls, as such training would be of great value to the senior pupils attending rural national schools in areas in which it has not been found possible to organise schemes of vocational education.  For such practical training it would be necessary to have two extra rooms, suitably equipped.  added to selected national schools, one for instruction and practical training in domestic economy, and the other for instruction and practical training in woodwork and allied subjects.  A preliminary survey of the school population in typical counties has shown that there are serious problems to be solved, leaving out of consideration the overriding problem of the attitude of parents to the extension of the compulsory school age and also the problems of management and control which arise in any such experiment.  There are other extremely difficult administrative problems which may be classified as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) The very large number of small national schools, consisting of 1, 2, or 3 rooms, scattered throughout the country, at considerable distances apart.  There are 4,600 schools of this kind out of a total of 5,200 national schools in the whole country.</P>
    <P>(b) The impracticability of adding rooms to a good many of these schools on account of the restricted nature of the present sites and the age of the existing school buildings.</P>
    <P>(c) The fall in the school population in rural areas, which makes it difficult to select a centre which would give hope that there would be a steady attendance of a reasonable size supplied from among the senior pupils in the selected school, and of the senior pupils from schools within <Col N="2434" /> accessible distance of the selected school.</P>
    <P>(d) The difficulty of combining in one national school general education with education that is partly general and partly vocational.</P>
    <P>(e) The necessity for devising a scheme, or schemes, to ensure that the benefit to the pupils would be commensurate with the cost involved.</P>
    <P>With regard to the cost, if we take a typical rural area which has been surveyed in connection with the examination of this proposal and one which has very few facilities for post-primary education, where there are 81 primary schools and roughly 6,000 pupils in attendance, three secondary schools, one technical school and two technical day centres, we find that the estimated number of young persons in the county is, roughly, 1,600, and the estimated number without post-primary instruction 900 or probably more.  To provide accommodation for instruction in woodwork, rural science and domestic economy at the 81 primary schools in that particular county would cost approximately £100,000. Some schools might manage with a room that could be used for the purpose of all their subjects at a cost of say £1,000, but others would require two separate rooms.  The attendance of special subject teachers at 81 centres would be difficult to arrange and the cost of travelling would be high.  The arrangement of the work in a school would be presumably in charge of the headmaster.  Many of the existing headmasters are unaccustomed to post-primary work and would not be able to control it effectively.  I am not very hopeful, therefore, that it will be possible to put such a scheme into general operation in the country. Apart from the tremendous financial cost, the details which I have read out will show the House that there are very serious difficulties besides.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of book equipment for necessitous children, I should perhaps state that under the proposed scheme for the administration of this a grant will be made to the manager for the purpose.  The normal grant will be at the rate of 1/- <Col N="2435" /> per pupil per annum on all pupils enrolled in second and higher standards. This grant may, of course, be refused or reduced where we are satisfied that such official action is justified.  The grant may, on the other hand, be increased where schools are situated in very poor localities in the Gaeltacht or the poorer parts of boroughs or towns. The maximum grant may not exceed 2/- per pupil per annum on the number of pupils in the standards to which I have alluded.  For the second and subsequent years the grant will be at the rate of two-thirds of the grant for the first year, subject to official sanction. The regulations and directions with regard to the official manner in which application may be made for the grant, and the returns which it will be necessary to furnish to the Department or keep for reference will be issued when the details of the scheme have been completed after consultation with the managers.  This is a matter in which there should be community of interest. I shall urge, therefore, upon managers that a local contribution should be made towards the cost of supplying the books for the children concerned.  I consider it to be of great importance also that self-effort on the part of the parents should be maintained and encouraged, and for that reason the parents of the children affected will be expected to contribute something, however small, towards the cost of their children's books.  I am convinced that, with the local interest and effort which should be forthcoming to secure the best results from the present scheme, and with the effective working of the arrangement officially communicated to the managers and teachers in September, 1937, under which readers and text books in national schools are only to be changed when it is necessary, the aid which the State is now providing should be quite sufficient to enable reasonable book equipment to be provided for necessitous children.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has raised a question as to the proper carrying out of the panel scheme.  This is a scheme of the greatest importance since it has revolutionised the conditions of service of <Col N="2436" /> national teachers by giving them security of tenure for the first time. Since its inception it has saved over 200 teachers from either completely losing their posts, or being reduced in rank or pay as a result of falling averages.  It is, therefore, essential that it should be retained and operated properly.  It has, however, cost the taxpayer a considerable amount, and the Government accepted the heavy additional cost which it involves on the understanding that all the managers would co-operate to the fullest extent to keep down the expenditure by appointing only teachers who were on the panel to fill vacancies in their schools.  It was the managers themselves who, in conference with the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, initiated the scheme, and I am glad to say that the majority of them are loyally carrying out their part of the contract.  There is, however, a minority which has quite definitely tried to evade it and to snatch at any excuse to appoint teachers who are not on the panel.  This is not fair to the taxpayer, to the majority of the managers who are carrying out their share of the contract, or to the teachers.  If my Department allowed such managers to evade their obligation under the panel scheme, the scheme would be killed and with it all the invaluable guarantees of security and contentment which it gives to the teachers.  A scheme of that sort has to be carried out with loyal exactness on both sides if it is to be a success, and I should like to take this opportunity of saying that we shall expect managers to keep to the terms of their bonds as faithfully as we are keeping ours.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the question of giving an agricultural bias to primary education.  It should be noted that no educationists of any modern country accept the thesis that agriculture should be taught as a subject in primary schools.  The most that should be done in this direction is to base the teaching of the subjects as far as possible on examples and illustrations from rural life.  This is done by the supply of rural readers, rural arithmetics, and similar methods of making contacts between the school and the life of the country.  This aspect of education <Col N="2437" /> has been emphasised in the national programme which was drawn up by the conference in 1925 and the methods which it suggested should be adopted in order to secure a rural bias are being followed and are being carried out as far as possible.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to waste the time of the Dáil in replying to Deputy Dillon's statements on the subject of the place of detention for boys at Summerhill, Dublin; but I find it necessary to challenge in a definite and categorical manner one of his references, and to make the strongest possible protest against the suggestion which it conveys. In his speech on the Vote for Prisons, the Deputy is reported (column 2112) as saying:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;... it is in every sense a thoroughly undesirable Oliver Twist kind of establishment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does the Deputy wish to suggest that boys are not properly fed or are otherwise ill-treated in this institution?  If so, I wish to say in the most definite terms that the suggestion is a scandalous falsehood, and I think it comes very badly from a person in the responsible position of a Deputy of the Dáil to avail of his position here to make such a slanderous statement regarding the superintendent and staff of that institution.  I am aware that the Deputy did not say definitely that the superintendent and his staff ill-treated the boys committed to their care: he did a much meaner and more cowardly thing.  He carefully and elaborately insinuated it, by describing the institution as &ldquo;a thoroughly undesirable Oliver Twist kind of establishment.&rdquo; It is nothing of the kind, and the Deputy knows quite well that the statement is a most unfair slander on the officials in charge of it.</P>
    <P>This institution is not intended as a place for the reform of boys charged with offences: it is a place where a few boys are housed and cared for for short periods, usually less than a week, when they have no homes in which they can be safely left.  Boys are not sent there because they are children of the poor, but because their removal from the home conditions is considered necessary. As showing the detentions there <Col N="2438" /> during the past year, I should perhaps read a note on the institution, with your permission, Sir.  The ages of the boys, with a few exceptions, vary from 12 to 16 years, the period of detention being about seven days.  The majority are charged with offences such as house-breaking and larceny, and are remanded to facilitate inquiries by the Gárdaí and probation officers, or when parents decline to hold themselves responsible for the good conduct of their boys, pending the disposal of the charges.  During the period of 12 months ended 28th February, 1939, the largest number under detention on any one day was five.  The following shows how the numbers were distributed in the period:&mdash;</P>

    <P>So that for a considerable portion of the year, namely, 212 days, you had either one boy or no boy at all in that institution.  There are a certain number of industrial schools throughout the country which have agreed to accept children on remand.  Owing to circumstances over which they or the Government of the day had no control, it was found necessary to set up this public institution for the purpose of accommodating young persons on remand.</P>
    <P>Young children are, of course, not remanded.  Unfortunately, I have not the report of Deputy Dillon's speech on prisons here.  He devoted a considerable portion of his time to recommending to the House that clinics should be set up to deal with these young boys who are confined in this institution.  The period of time&mdash;less than a week&mdash;in which boys are in this institution and the fact that the average number of boys for the past 12 months&mdash;that is to say, the daily number in detention during the whole of 1938&mdash;was 1.4 shows that it would be quite impossible to set up such a clinic as Deputy Dillon has in mind.  It would <Col N="2439" /> not have sufficient time to train or improve the children and, in any case, other people seem to be more in need of being locked up in clinics than some of these people.  I should like to know if it will be satisfactory for me now to deal with the point which Deputy Mulcahy raised in connection with mathematics.</P>

      <P>I suggest that it would be satisfactory if we could hear the Minister's statement on that subject now.  Then, I should be able to deal with it on the motion to refer back the Vote for Secondary Education.  The discussion would be more satisfactory and complete in these circumstances.</P>

      <P>I do not care what the Minister says.  In a reasonable way, I drew attention to a rather important subject which is, I think, worthy of discussion in this House and I hope the Minister will find it possible to discuss it.  The Minister can satisfy his own conscience if the statement which he proposes to make now is sufficiently complete.  If he makes his statement now, the House will be in possession of all the facts which the Minister proposes to place at its disposal and any discussion that takes place on the motion to refer back will be informed, so far as the Minister can inform it, and may, therefore, be shorter than it otherwise would be.  If we do not hear the Minister now, then, on the motion to refer back the Vote for Secondary Education, I shall have to reiterate a certain amount of stuff and then follow the Minister.  I think it would be more satisfactory to hear the Minister now.</P>

      <P>Regarding Deputy Mulcahy's references to the present standard of mathematical teaching in the schools, I think he was rather unfair to the secondary schools, not so much in the actual statements made by him but rather in the order in which he made them.  After a comment on the absence of references in the Department's annual report to the teaching of mathematics in secondary schools, he quoted adverse comments from the report on the teaching of that subject <Col N="2440" /> in primary schools, and then referred to the proposal to drop mathematics as a compulsory subject in secondary schools.  Lest there be any misunderstanding on the subject, I wish to state distinctly and emphatically that there has been a very decided raising of the standard of mathematical teaching in the secondary schools in the past 14 or 15 years, i.e., since the introduction of the present programme. In order to show that it is only necessary to compare the present courses and examination papers in mathematics with those of the years before 1920.  When the present courses in mathematics were introduced in 1924, there were many complaints that they were too advanced, and the percentage of failures at the examinations was rather high.  A gradual improvement in the teaching of the subject has been effected, but it is generally felt that the present courses make too heavy a demand on many pupils.  The present intermediate certificate course is more difficult and advanced than the old middle grade course of the Intermediate Board, and the leaving certificate course is much more advanced than the old senior grade course.  As regards the reductions to which Deputy Mulcahy referred, these do not involve anything more than transferring from the intermediate course to the leaving course a few of the more advanced sections, such as logarithms in arithmetic, and trigonometry.  After these reductions are made, the intermediate course will be as extensive and of as high a standard as the middle grade formerly was.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the proposals for the revision of the programme for secondary schools are still under consideration, I had not intended to go into this matter in detail. The House will recognise that a discussion here on details of the proposed changes would scarcely serve any useful purpose, at any rate at this stage.  The Department's proposals are the fruit of long and careful consideration. We have discussed the programme very thoroughly with the representatives of the schools and the teachers.  While I am not going to say that no change will now be made in these proposals, I am hopeful that they will be accepted generally by the <Col N="2441" /> schools, and that no substantial amendment to them will be found necessary.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Department is, and has been, to give the schools as much freedom as possible, particularly in the subjects which candidates may take for examinations.  Where the schools desire more freedom and where they show that they have a good case to support their claim, I am anxious to meet them as far as over I can.  The proposals regarding mathematics, like the proposals generally, are not based upon theories but upon intimate knowledge of the work in the schools and due consideration as to what is best in the interest of education.  I explained the general aim of the reforms in my opening statement and I need not elaborate them further.</P>
    <P>There is, and always has been, a problem so far as mathematics in girls' schools is concerned.  Since I became Minister, I always felt that girls' schools should not, in fairness, be compelled to do the same mathematical programme as boys' schools.  There may be individual girls who are as good at mathematics as the best boys and, so far as they are concerned, they can follow the full course.  In the revision of the programme, we must keep our minds on the average student, frame a programme that will be within his capacity and enable him or her to pass the examination if they have covered the appropriate course satisfactorily.  Few who are acquainted with mathematical work in girls' schools will disagree with my view, I think, that girls in general have not the same aptitude for mathematics as boys.  And, furthermore, that allowance must be made for them accordingly. We have to consider whether it is in the best interest of girls' education and their preparation for life that they should be compelled to do mathematics through the intermediate course.  In the view of my Department, experience has shown that compulsory mathematics for girls has not achieved the results expected.  The schools share these views.  Before I became a Minister, a girl could take arithmetic instead of mathematics for her intermediate certificate course and examination. In order to induce girls' schools to take up the study of the <Col N="2442" /> other branches of mathematics in addition to arithmetic, it was decided to institute a shorter course of mathematics for girls and a new subject, elementary mathematics for beginners, was introduced.  This alternative course does not seem to have provided a solution of the problem. Having fully considered the question, we propose, therefore, to leave the subject optional for girls in the intermediate course and examination.  A girl must pass an entrance examination in arithmetic, sixth standard, before she is accepted as a secondary pupil. To say that a girl may go through her whole school career and &ldquo;not be able to add&rdquo; is clearly absurd.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will not be denied that there are boys who, although they may not be in as great a proportion as the girls of the same class, have no aptitude for mathematics. There are boys who may be very talented in other subjects but who have no taste for this subject.  A boy may, for instance, secure honours in two or three important subjects, thus showing that he is above average ability in these subjects, and at the same time he may fail in mathematics.  It is scarcely fair to describe a boy as failing at his examination when he does well in the subjects which he likes, simply because he happens to have no taste for mathematics and his aptitude does not lie that way.  We must remember that if, as I hope, this relief in respect of the examination will be granted to such boys, all boys will still have to take the approved course in mathematics and the schools will, of course, be subject to inspection by the Department's inspectors. Mathematics was never compulsory either for the course or for the examination in the leaving certificate. It was a result of the recommendations made by the Commission on Secondary Education and not to any action on the Department's part that mathematics was not made compulsory in the leaving certificate examination. I do not think this decision has been to the disadvantage of mathematical teaching in the schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The changes which are now proposed in the programme both as regards <Col N="2443" /> mathematics and generally, are in accordance with the principle that the schools should be given as much freedom as possible to shape courses of study suitable to the capacities and requirements of their pupils.  I am satisfied that our secondary schools recognise fully their responsibilities and that they will use wisely, and in the best interests of their pupils any further freedom given to them.</P>
    <P>As an illustration of how this freedom has been used in the past, and to show that Deputy Mulcahy's apprehensions regarding mathematics are groundless, I might refer to the position of this subject in the leaving certificate course during the past ten years. As I have already stated, mathematics has not been compulsory, either as a subject of study, or for examination in the leaving certificate course.  Nevertheless, it has been taken as a subject at the leaving certificate examination by practically all the boys and the great majority of the girls.</P>
    <P>The percentage of the boys taking mathematics in the year 1928 was 92.8; there has been a steady annual increase and the percentage for 1938 was 96.9. Similarly the percentage of girls who took mathematics at this examination increased from 75.8 in 1928 to 82.7 in 1938.  When it is recollected that there was no obligation on any pupil to take this subject, the figures I have quoted should satisfy any reasonable person that the schools recognise the educational importance of mathematics, and that there is no real ground for apprehension regarding its position in our secondary schools.</P>
    <P>Individual educationists may have decided views as to the value of mathematics in secondary schools but I am quite sure there is a large number of modern educationists who would not accept the view that an examination in mathematics is educational in the case of pupils who have no mathematical aptitude.  They would hold a different view, and they would hold it more strongly in the case of girls.  The strengthening of mathematics in this country could not possibly depend on forcing pupils who have no aptitude for <Col N="2444" /> mathematics to take it at an examination. Such forcing can only result, I am convinced, in waste of time and energy.  In the old days, when mathematics was taught to a high standard in more of our national schools, the teacher did not teach all pupils mathematics. He taught selected good boys who he knew had an aptitude for mathematics and brought them to a high standard.  I venture to say that this was what always happened in the case of teachers who established a reputation for themselves as mathematical teachers.</P>
    <P>There are just one or two points of importance with which I want to deal now.  There is the question raised by Deputy O'Sullivan about the Secondary Teachers' Superannuation Scheme.  Deputy O'Sullivan and other Deputies are asking us to introduce amendments to the scheme and to grant additional benefits.  The House will see from sub-head G in the Vote for secondary education that during the present year a sum of £4,900 has to be provided to enable the fund to defray the cost of pensions and gratuities during the year 1939-1940.  Unless substantially increased contributions are obtained from the secondary teachers themselves, the Government will be called upon to continue to pay the deficiency in the fund which after a few years it is estimated will exceed £20,000 per annum.  Since the fund is quite unable to meet the present cost of the scheme it is not possible to increase the benefits given to the pensioned teachers.  Furthermore, it may be necessary to require increased contributions from the teachers so as to make up the deficiency in the fund.</P>
    <P>I think Opposition Deputies should be a little more cautious in raising this question of the Secondary Teachers' Superannuation Scheme, because our memories are not so short that we do not remember when the Secondary Education Board was abolished by our predecessors.  When that board was abolished the Government took over its endowment of £750,000 and used the money to meet ordinary Government expenditure.  That sum of £750,000 would have financed the superannuation scheme for secondary <Col N="2445" /> teachers.  When the scheme was instituted under my predecessor no aid was given to finance it.  Deputy O'Sullivan had an opportunity then of introducing an amendment which he now seeks to introduce and which I think circumstances will not permit us to introduce.</P>

      <P>I beg to move the motion standing in my name: &ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo; The Minister suggested that I was unfair to the secondary schools as to the standard attained in mathematics in these schools. I do not think anyone could read the slightest suggestion of that into what I stated here on the other day when the discussion was on.  I suggested that perhaps what was bringing about the reduction of the ministerial standard of mathematics in the secondary schools was the inferior position which mathematics had in the higher classes of the primary schools.  I can only take it from the statement of the Minister and from the document which has been circulated to the managers and to the representatives of the school teachers that this is a proposal which is being urged on the schools by the Department.  The changes in the secondary school programme were first referred to in the Department's report for the year 1934-35, which states at page 56:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Department has had under consideration for some time the question of the revision of the secondary schools programme with a view to giving schools greater freedom in their choice of subjects, and for the purpose of simplifying the rules generally.  In this connection, certain proposals for the amendment of the programme were submitted by the Department in December, 1935, to the various associations of managers and teachers, and they were invited to give their views thereon.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the report for the following year, 1935-36, reference was made to the fact that this communication had been made in December, 1935, to the Association of Managers and Teachers, and that certain proposals had been made, and it indicated what the proposals were.  Part of the proposal was that in regard to mathematics it was to be a compulsory subject for the approved <Col N="2447" /> course for recognised junior pupils as far as boys were concerned, and that no subject should be compulsory for the intermediate certificate examination except Irish, that is, that mathematics would not continue to be compulsory: that mathematics would not be a compulsory subject for examination in secondary schools at all, particularly that the compulsory position which it held in the intermediate certificate would be dropped.  Now we find that a proposal is made that for the year 1939-40 the matters which are indicated as having been under discussion at that particular time are going to be put into force.  The 1935-36 report says at page 63:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All the associations submitted replies, and the Department is grateful to them for the care which they gave to the examination of the proposals, and for their criticisms and suggestions.  There was considerable divergence of opinion regarding the proposals.  Almost all of them were approved, sometimes with qualifications, by one or more of the associations, but none of them received the unqualified approval of all the bodies. The nearest approach to general agreement was in regard to the proposal to shorten the intermediate certificate course in history.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At any rate, according to the report for the year 1935-36, there was divergence of opinion, and now in the spring of 1939 we get circulated to the managers and to the teachers a draft statement, showing that it is proposed to make drastic revisions of the secondary school programme as from the beginning of the school year 1939-40.  We find ourselves faced with this position, that no longer in the secondary schools need mathematics be a compulsory subject of examination.  The Minister will remember that one of the proposals which were put before the managers and the teachers in 1935 was the proposal that there should be an additional public examination for students at the end of the second year of the intermediate course.  Now, the Minister is surely aware of the reasons which prompted the Department to make that suggestion to the schools.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2448" /> At any rate, it is common knowledge to anybody who has anything to do with secondary school students, or in fact with secondary school teachers, that the year immediately after the intermediate year&mdash;when the students are not faced with any public examination at the end of the session&mdash;is almost a blank year.  There is no concentration on any kind of work, and there is definite relaxation of the discipline of study.  It would be interesting to have, on the one hand, the reasons why that proposal was made by the Department of Education, and it would be interesting to have on the other hand what objection was put up to it either by the lay teachers or the Head Masters' Association.  The whole history of the position of mathematics in the country must drive it home to the Minister that, with the position in which mathematics is in the primary schools, and the removal of the compulsory examination in the intermediate certificate, you are going to have a weakening of mathematics as you go higher up.  I am quite prepared to accept the reports of the Department on the position with regard to mathematics in the secondary schools.  In the report for 1934-35 it is stated that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Good mathematical work is done in the boys' school, and there is an increase in the number of pupils from these schools taking the honours course in the Leaving Certificate. There is little change in the girls' schools as to the manner of teaching or the amount of work done.  In many of them they follow the full course in class and take the elementary course in the examination.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is practically the last detailed report on the position of mathematics in the secondary schools in any of the Departmental reports.  The detailed report is blank as regards 1935-36, and it is practically blank as regards 1936-37. The only thing the report says there with regard to mathematics in the secondary schools is that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;there is little if anything now to be said about teaching in history, geography, mathematics, and in Irish and commerce.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2449" /> But what strikes me about the proposal, and what strikes me about the Minister's reply to it, is the thing which struck me first.</P>
    <P>Who are the people who are reviewing serious changes in the secondary education programme?  In dealing with the question of Irish the Minister to-day stated that be expressed his gratitude to the various people who had sat on the primary and whatever secondary programme conference there was dealing with the changes in the primary and the secondary school programmes in the early days of the State. We all know what a large body was set up to review the primary programme and to bring about changes in it.  We are conscious of the fact that you cannot divorce the primary system or the secondary system of education&mdash; and the objectives before either one or the other&mdash;from one another in considering what we are spending money on education in the State for at all. They dovetail into one another.  The success or otherwise of secondary education is going to depend on the success or otherwise of primary education, and something that comes afterwards, whether it is university education, professional education, industry or commerce, or some other thing, is going to depend on the excellence or otherwise of our secondary education.</P>
    <P>Why have we not had, when serious changes are being brought about in the secondary education programme, a general education conference set up to deal with it?  Who are the masters, and who are the heads of the Teachers' Association that are dealing with the Minister in this matter?  Are we, in fact being governed, and is our educational policy being directed, say, from some unnumbered room in the Department of Education?  In a country like this, which boasts that it is democratic, and boasts that it has a tradition in education&mdash;a country where we are entirely looking after our own affairs, where the legislature is looking after the laws, and where we are spending a considerable amount of money on education, where there is a big fabric of educational machinery in the country&mdash;we ought to know who our educational leaders are and who are <Col N="2450" /> our guides and our experts as regards the laying down of our educational policy and as regards the carrying out of that policy.  There is not a single person in the House here in a position to say who our educational leaders are.  There is one person who stands out, to my mind&mdash;partly because of the position he holds, and partly because I had experience of him in dealing with his outlook on education at the Primary Education Conference some years ago. I refer to the Professor of the Theory and Practice of Education in University College, Dublin.  I recalled to the House, when dealing with his outlook on education generally, and particularly education as applied to the primary schools, that the Rev. Dr. Corcoran said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I would almost say that next to Irish one should rely upon mathematical quality and endeavour to promote it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And he indicated why, briefly.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We cannot give the true technical system, using modern methods of production, without a considerable addition to mathematical power. The countries that have lowered mathematics&mdash;and I may tell you that they are below ours, the American schools distinctly below ours, and English and French schools extremely low&mdash;are the countries left behind in the technical production race.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So he emphasised, bearing on the future work of the nation, the necessity of a considerable addition to our mathematical power, and he went back to show that it was essentially a tradition of our people, saying:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The intellectual quality of the average farm labourer and the small farmer from 1775 to 1850 was ahead of the world, and in consequence they were able to take concerted action of a public character that no other people in the world at the time were even able to think of.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, I ask, was the professor of education in University College, Dublin, consulted in any way with regard to the proposals for changing the secondary <Col N="2451" /> course?  Has the professor of education in University College expressed in any way his opinion for or against the dropping of the compulsory examination for boys in the intermediate certificate, or the leaving of girls entirely free from sitting down in any mathematical class once they enter a secondary school?  I do not think that in any democratic country the people would be satisfied to accept, as the educational lights, members of the Department of Education alone.  The real people who have experience of education, as the Minister would rather seem to have implied, are the people who are stuck out in the thick of the actual practical work.  The Minister has not gone very far to convince the House with regard to the proposal to do away with mathematics as a compulsory subject for boys in the inter-termediate certificate examination, nor has he gone any distance to persuade us that that reform is a reform that is urged or approved by either the lay teachers or the head masters in the country.  I think that a proposal that goes so flagrantly against what does appear to be our national tradition, which goes so flagrantly against what does appear to be a very deep-rooted conviction on the part of the professor of education in University College, Dublin, is not one that ought to be merely decided either by departmental officials or by heads of schools.</P>
    <P>There have been occasions in the past upon which outsiders associated with officials and teachers and head masters were brought together to consider a programme, and I would urge very strongly that before mathematics is touched in this radical way, a conference should be set up that would consist of more than officials and more than teachers.  The Minister must be aware that it is a very serious step to take, and he cannot be without some suspicion that whatever people are urging this&mdash;and urging it behind closed doors, because there has not been the slightest scrap of public discussion on the matter&mdash;are being impelled by the mathematical quality of the children who are reaching them from the primary schools.  Now, there is no suggestion <Col N="2452" /> that any children are not capable of doing the mathematics that are required in the primary school programme up to, say, the sixth standard, but it is obvious, from the reports that are being made annually to the Minister, that there is something definitely wrong in the higher classes of the primary schools, and that before any radical change is brought about in the position of mathematics in the secondary school programme, even with regard to girls, there should be a more critical and systematic examination of what is happening in the primary schools than, apparently, has taken place.  I gave an extract, I think, from the 1936-37 Report of the Department on the position of mathematics in the primary schools.  Here is an extract from the 1935-36 Report:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Many of the inspectors are complaining about the teaching of arithmetic. The notes to teachers are not studied in the lower classes, large numbers being handled before small can be handled with clearness and intelligence.  The children do not understand the rules, and they are unable to apply them.  Sufficient attention is not paid to oral work, to the explaining of principles, and to the sequence of the work.  Algebra and Euclid are only taught in the big boys' schools.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Before the Minister lies down, even under pressure coming from the secondary schools&mdash;and I do not believe pressure is coming from that direction &mdash;he should more systematically examine what is the position in the primary schools and see what remedies can, and ought to be, applied there.  We have noticed appearing in some of the papers recently a statement to the effect that the Government is going to establish, in Dublin, as institute &ldquo;for the encouragement of mathematical research. The proposed institute will not compete with either of the universities. It will cater only for the most advanced students, providing them with opportunities of research under the best guidance.&rdquo; Planning to set up a mathematical institute in this country at a time when our secondary education course is going to be that a girl need never sit down in a mathematics <Col N="2453" /> class or need never pass a mathematics examination, and that a boy need never pass an examination in any mathematical subject in a secondary course&mdash;to start planning a mathematical institute when we are doing that in our secondary education course seems to me like trying to stick some artificial flower on the top of an old stalk that has grown and grown, and lost every scrap of foliage that was ever on it.  The idea of feeling that the mathematical knowledge of our people means nothing to our technical and industrial progress in future, and that at the same time we should lie down under the position in connection with our higher schools and primary schools, in which mathematics as a compulsory subject for any thorough secondary course are wiped out, and then start titivating our prestige and pride by establishing an institute for mathematical research under the most brilliant guidance, seems to me a piece of proud nonsense that I could not associate with a self-governing Ireland. What is going to happen under this precious scheme is that our universities, as far as mathematics are concerned, are going to become our secondary schools.  We are going to have a complete frittering away of teaching power in our secondary schools, a secondary school standard of mathematics in our universities, and then a great institute.</P>
    <P>I referred previously to Father Corcoran's historical reference to the point that the standard of mathematics was reduced from 1900 in the national school, that from 1900 to 1920 the lowering of the standard of the course lowered the teaching capacity of the teachers.  He was urging at that particular time that the teaching capacity for mathematics in the country should be restored.  He was urging that, in order to do that, the summer courses that used to be planned for Irish, had reached the limit at which they might be expected to do useful work at that time for Irish, that they should be turned over to mathematics and that a special summer course should be established to restore to our teachers the teaching power in regard to mathematics that teachers in this country <Col N="2454" /> formerly possessed.  We have heard nothing from the Minister but a kind of vague statement that this programme is going ahead.  If this programme goes ahead, I think the Minister for one is failing in his public duty and that headmasters and teachers are running away from the serious responsibility that is theirs, a responsibility to the country as a whole.  There are reactions that will inevitably follow as a result of this but they are small when compared with the reactions that the proposal as a whole is going to have in the general mentality and character of the product of our secondary schools in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not deny that the opinion of educational experts with regard to the quality of mathematical teaching is of the greatest importance but I think that Deputy Mulcahy rather confuses quality and quantity. I am in a position to be in intimate touch with the schools, not alone through the inspectors but through the representatives of the schools whom I meet and whom I have met in connection with this whole question of the school programme.  I know what their views are.  Generally, I think they share the feeling which has been expressed that our standard has been high, rather too high for the average student, and, moreover, that our courses have been too extensive.  The question is whether allowing a subject to be optional for those who have no taste for it, so far as the examinations are concerned, is going to affect the quality of the teaching.  If the position is tackled from the point of view of giving those who have an aptitude for mathematics a sound grounding in the subject and getting them to cover the course in the schools, then the schools and ourselves agree that that will afford the average student a much better opportunity.  In no subject is quality less dependent on mere quantity than in mathematics.  The quantity of Latin, Irish or French in the curriculum may be of considerable importance but in mathematics you may have much less quality by having too much quantity or by forcing pupils who are not capable of benefiting by <Col N="2455" /> a course in mathematics, to take that subject in an examination.</P>

      <P>I move motion No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Estimate be reduced by £10 in respect of sub-head A (3).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am doing this for the purpose of asking the Minister to discuss some things that I believe are important from the point of view of the &ldquo;A&rdquo; schools.  Quite a number of parents have experience of &ldquo;A&rdquo; schools, and these schools could not be doing their work without the assistance of these parents.  The Minister rather suggested that generally he was not getting the assistance of parents, towards fostering the Irish work of the schools, which he should have got, and would be entitled to get.  Quite a large number of parents are more than anxious to co-operate with the Minister and with the school authorities in seeing that where Irish is used as the teaching language it is not being used merely as an instruction medium, but that Irish, when used as the language of instruction in the schools, is used as the natural language of those attending the schools.  Personally, I feel that in certain schools in the city greater progress would have been made if, in the past, a suggestion from teachers had been accepted, and that was, that in certain of the schools children should only be admitted where there was a definite assurance that Irish was being made the language of the home.  That would have kept parents up to their responsibilities in the matter and would, I believe, have helped Irish-speaking districts, because people would be anxious to get Irish-speaking girls to add to the linguistic strength of the home.  That was not done.  In no range of schools at present operating in the City of Dublin is there any consideration at all as to the linguistic position of the homes from which the children come.  However, the twig has been set for quite a number of years in that direction and has grown fairly steadily, and we cannot interfere with <Col N="2456" /> it; but I think parents who are anxious to make the homes Irish-speaking are entitled to ask the assistance of the Minister in doing so.</P>
    <P>Speaking with a certain amount of experience, gathered not only personally but from a very large number of acquaintances, I ask the Minister to help by getting some inquiry made as to why, in some of the &ldquo;A&rdquo; schools in the city, Irish, which is the language of instruction, is not the language of recreation.  We are asking there for help that the Minister only can give us.  Just as there are difficulties in the use of Irish as the medium of instruction in schools, and known more, perhaps, to parents than to the Minister, we are quite prepared to recognise that there are difficulties in the playground, but we tell the Minister that there is serious weakness in the playground, and that a little encouragement, a little supervision, a little advice and watchfulness from him and from the inspectors&mdash;not in a bludgeoning but in a suggestive way&mdash; would help very considerably there.</P>
    <P>If the Minister does succeed in bringing about the use of Irish in the recreation grounds, to the same extent as it has been brought about in the schools, he would be helping very considerably to protect the homes against some of the influences that react on the homes.  We never know what the reason is, but it is the smallest little thing will break down a position where Irish has been the natural language of schools, and make English the language of the home, with the general atmosphere of English that is around the place.  I ask the Minister's help there.</P>
    <P>I return again to another matter and, in the same spirit, ask the Minister's help.  I urge that he should get a conference of inspectors or teachers, or both, with experience of Class &ldquo;A&rdquo; schools in the City of Dublin, and those who in University College are dealing with the Irish side of things there, to exchange views and get some kind of general understanding, as to what stage has been arrived at in secondary schools, in equipping students who leave these schools with such a quantity and such a standard of spoken Irish, as would enable them to continue <Col N="2457" /> their after life in Irish around here if they had the opportunity, or, at any rate, enable them to continue their university studies in Irish, if there were university facilities for the continuation for such studies.  The Minister must admit that, just as there are parents outside anxious to do the work that only parents can do for the restoration of the language, there are also people who are working on Irish in the university, who are equally filled with the same desire.  They are in a position of exceptional privilege to know and to estimate what is going on. While the Minister will get nothing but the greatest possible help from them, he appears to be reluctant, even in an informal way, to bring together people of the type I suggest, and to get them to talk to one another about what they see and know and what they can do.  I do not know why the Minister should have any such reluctance.  It is essential that he should do it, because if the Minister has any reluctance to do a thing like that, people who are standing in the gap&mdash;and there are quite a number of people standing in the gap for the salvation of the Irish language &mdash;may lose some of the hope they have, because they may be looking around and putting implications on the Minister's unwillingness that might or might not be right.  As the Minister is in a privileged position, I do not know that any of the various classes interested in the Irish language would suggest that this should be turned down lightly, particularly if it is in his power to grant it without prejudicing or complicating himself in any way.  I am moving the motion in order to ask the Minister if he understands that he could usefully act in each of these directions and to know whether he is prepared to take action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">

      <P>I do not think it is suggested that it is negligence on the part of the managers of schools, or weakness on the part of the pupils, that is responsible for English in the playgrounds of &ldquo;A&rdquo; schools.  If what the Deputy alleges is correct, and that one hears complaints of that kind from time to time, I am sure the inspectors have heard them.  The boys' &ldquo;A&rdquo; schools in Dublin are, I think, of fairly recent <Col N="2458" /> establishment, and I do not think there can be any special weaknesses attaching to them.  Some of them, I know, are highly successful, and I do not think there can be any weaknesses attaching to them which do not attach to the ordinary day schools in other places, so that I think it might be rather invidious to say that there was something wrong with the &ldquo;A&rdquo; schools in Dublin, unless we were quite certain that these things are true.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister know that I personally am interested in this?  Does he understand that I have personal experience of this? Does he understand that I am connected with a large number of people who have first-hand experience of this, and will he take it from me that, on the recreational side of &ldquo;A&rdquo; schools in the City of Dublin there is a weakness which is reacting on the position of Irish in the homes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter certainly deserves examination.  If the children from Irish-speaking homes play with children who are not from Irish-speaking homes, outside the schools altogether, it is quite possible that some part of the blame may attach there.  The Deputy is insistent that it is the school grounds of the &ldquo;A&rdquo; schools in Dublin, which are very limited in number, so far as boys are concerned, and I think they are limited so far as girls are concerned also.  We will certainly inquire into the matter. Any time a Deputy brings a complaint to my notice or feels that there is some matter which ought to be inquired into, and which would seem to fall within the normal purview of the Department or the inspectors, I think it is my duty, as Minister, to see that inquiry is made accordingly.</P>
      <P>The Deputy, with reference to the second matter, has been pressing for a rather more formal type of inquiry.  I think the officials of the Department are in touch with those responsible for Irish in the University.  The University, of course, is an autonomous body, and I do not know how they might feel if the Department of Education proposed to hold an inquiry into the state of Irish in the University.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy is not asking that, and if it is to be a purely informal matter, I see no reason why the consultations, which have gone on from time to time, cannot be continued. I am sure the Secretary of the Department meets the university people occasionally. Perhaps he does not meet them as often as we would wish, but I know that he has met them with regard to Irish, and that they have been of considerable assistance to him, and if those responsible for Irish in the university feel that they can help us, we shall be very glad to have their assistance.  Their suggestions, for example, with regard to the programme, examination papers, and so on, will be very welcome.  I want to make it quite clear that in any consultations which may take place, I am not accepting the view that has been put forward by some of the critics with regard to instruction through Irish or anything else.  Certainly, if they are in favour of an extension of Irish in the schools, we shall be very glad to have their advice, and, although I disagree with some of their views, I do not, by any means, question their sincerity.  I know that many of them have given us valuable assistance in the past.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2460" /> That the Estimate be reduced by £10 in respect of sub-head C.</P>
    <P>I do so for the purpose of asking the Minister what is the position with regard to the proposition that was under discussion about the holding of an additional public examination to be taken by pupils at the end of the second year of the intermediate certificate course. Has it been entirely dropped?</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter was put before me by certain of the schools.  I do not think that all the schools shared the view that there should be an additional examination.  We considered the question, and we have not considered it necessary to institute an additional examination.  The course for the intermediate certificate is supposed to be a four-years' course, and pupils are supposed to enter upon that course at 12 years and pursue it until they are 16 years, but that very rarely happens.  I should say that the average course taken by the boy or girl in the secondary school, before the intermediate examination, would be three years. Boys&mdash;I am not so sure about girls&mdash; have been known to come into the secondary schools so late as 14 years, and they are presented for the intermediate examination at 16 years.  So long as it is the case that the average course is only three years, and that there is a proportion which spend less than three years before examination, I am not quite sure that the case for an additional examination is as strong as if every student was doing the full four years' course.  I think it would interfere with the existing course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a certain body of feeling that there should be an examination at the end of each year.  A good many people, whose view I should be inclined to share, would say: &ldquo;Have you no mercy for the children?  Must they be always working for examinations?  Could the schools not be in a position to have school examinations at the end of the year?  If they want to have an additional examination at the end of the second year, where the pupils are spending four years before the intermediate certificate examination, can they not have one within the school?&rdquo; We are not convinced that, having regard <Col N="2461" /> to the varying length of the course, as taken, and the fact that we have two courses&mdash;the intermediate course and the leaving certificate course&mdash;with examinations at the end of them which have been found generally satisfactory, there is a majority opinion in favour of the additional examination. Quite possibly, the subject may come up again for discussion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, I take it, does appreciate the importance of the fact that, when children of 15 or 16 reach the examination stage, it is infinitely better to give them three years' examinations running than to give them simply their first examination, and then wait for a period of two years before giving them another?</P>

      <P>I would like to put a question to the Minister with regard to industrial school teachers.  In the statement introducing the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Education he said it is the intention of the Government to bring these teachers within the Primary Education Vote.  Is he in a position to tell us how soon we may expect these teachers to be brought in, or what steps are necessary to bring them in?  Does it require legislation, or is it that certain inquiries are to be made to meet with the requirements of the Department, inquiries with regard to qualifications, and they will then be in a position to bring in those teachers without legislation?</P>

This represents a decrease of £108,209 on the surplus for the previous year, 1936-37.  This decrease was due to the fact that although revenue in 1937-38 was greater by £50,938 than in 1936-37, expenditure increased by no less than £159,147. The increased expenditure was attributable mainly to higher cost of living bonus (£75,000); additional cost of telephone maintenance (£14,000); extra cost of wireless facilities provided for civil aviation and meteorological services (£14,000); extra staff to cope with additional work, etc.</P>

    <P>The policy of improvement of postal services where reasonably practicable has been continued.  The review of delivery services in rural districts which has been in progress for the past two years has been completed, a total of 1,067 posts having been improved as a result.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for the suspension of postal delivery on Christmas Day <Col N="2466" /> and on the 26th December, introduced in 1937, were repeated last year, and were again satisfactory.  This was largely attributable to the splendid response by the public to the requests for early posting, for which I am grateful.  With the exception of the limited number of officers required for telegraph, telephone and other essential services, post office officials were wholly relieved from duty on Christmas Day and the day following.</P>
    <P>The number of letters and postcards despatched for conveyance by air services continues to increase.  The scheme introduced in June, 1937, under which items for Commonwealth countries are conveyed by air as the normal means of transmission, without special air fee, and which at first served South and East Africa only, was extended during the year, and now includes Australia, India, New Zealand, Egypt, Kenya, Palestine, Rhodesia, etc.,</P>
    <P>The telephone service continues to develop.  The revenue for the year 1938-39 will, it is anticipated, be approximately £22,000 in excess of that for 1937-38 but, as expenditure is growing correspondingly, the financial position of the service will remain practically unchanged.</P>
    <P>There are now 798 exchanges and 1,472 public call offices (including 141 street kiosks) in existence.  The number of subscribers' circuits is 26,124, an increase of 1,355 on last year's figures, and the number of telephones in use is 42,521 (of which 22,000 approximately are automatic) an increase of 2,139.  The number of local calls during 1938 was nearly 31,000,000, an increase of 1,250,000, and of trunk calls 3,500,000, an increase of 335,000.</P>
    <P>To cope with the growing traffic a second new Cross-Channel cable was laid in August last, and there are now 16 Cross-Channel circuits in operation. For internal traffic 73 additional trunk circuits were provided during the year. The quality of speech transmission on the Cross-Channel circuits and on the &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; circuits employed on the main internal routes is of a high order, and the general standard of service afforded, both trunk and local, is satisfactory. There is still some delay on <Col N="2467" /> cross-channel calls after 7 p.m. by reason of the heavy traffic induced by the cheaper &ldquo;night&rdquo; rates, but the provision of additional circuits which is in contemplation will in due course remedy this.</P>
    <P>Additional funds amounting to £1,000,000 for telephone development purposes were provided by the Telephone Capital Act, 1938.  The capital outlay on development works during the current financial year will be approximately £275,000 and the expenditure under this head for 1939-40 is estimated at £170,000.  The programme for 1939-40 involves a further augmentation of trunk circuits; additional circuits in the cross-channel cables; the completion of the new automatic exchange for Dun Laoghaire, Blackrock and contiguous areas; extension of local underground system to meet growth of subscribers mainly in the Dublin area; provision of a three-channel &ldquo;carrier&rdquo; on the Sligo-Lifford trunk route with the object of improving the service in County Donegal; various improvements and rearrangements of minor circuits etc.</P>
    <P>The capacity of the existing central trunk exchange in Dublin is nearing exhaustion and it has been necessary to secure accommodation for a new exchange. Suitable premises for the purpose have, with the approval of the Dáil, recently been acquired in Exchequer Street.  The engineering designs for the equipment, which will be of the most modern type, are in course of preparation and it is hoped that the new exchange can be completed in about two years.  The intention is to divide the trunk equipment between the Exchequer Street premises and premises to be erected in St. Andrew Street in conjunction with the new post office which is to be provided there.  When trunk working has been transferred from Crown Alley, that exchange will be employed solely for the service of automatic subscribers.</P>
    <P>Last year I mentioned that it was hoped to instal experimentally a rural automatic telephone system in the exchange areas of Malahide, Donabate, Rush and Lusk.  I am happy to say <Col N="2468" /> that the scheme, which was introduced about six months ago, is working satisfactorily and that it gives prospect of affording a solution of the difficulties associated with the provision of continuous service at small exchanges. It is proposed to extend the experiment during the coming year.</P>
    <P>As mentioned earlier in this statement the loss on the Telegraph Service for the financial year 1937-38 was £121,820.  This was an increase of £17,557 on the deficit for 1936-37.  It is estimated that revenue for 1938-39 will show a decrease of about £11,700 on the figures for 1937-38 and, as expenditure will be greater by about £10,000, the loss on the telegraphs will be approximately £143,500 at the end of this month.  In these circumstances it will be appreciated that any concessions in the matter of telegram charges are not possible.  In relation to this I may say that the reduction of the rate for inland messages from 1/6 for 12 words to 1/- for nine words in June, 1937, secured an increase in traffic of only 4 per cent., and the result was a loss in revenue of approximately £10,000 a year.  Any further reduction in charges would only have the effect of adding to the already heavy deficit.</P>
    <P>A new telephone cable was laid last summer to the Aran Islands to replace the old cable, which had been damaged and out of use for a considerable time. The new cable gives full telegraph and telephone facilities.  A new telephone cable has also been laid between Arranmore Island and the mainland at Burtonport (Co. Donegal) in substitution of the wireless telegraph service previously operative which was in need of renewal.  A public call office on the island will be opened shortly.  It is hoped that it will be possible before next winter to provide communication by means of wireless telephony with some of the other islands off the western and south western coasts.</P>
    <P>During the past year the value of contracts placed by the Stores Branch amounted to a total of £489,400, of which £330,800 was in respect of articles manufactured or assembled in Eire. These amounts represent increases of £100,000 and £130,000 respectively on the figures for the preceding year.  The operations of the Post Office factory <Col N="2469" /> are confined mainly to repair work, including the repair of telephone apparatus and repair and maintenance of official mechanical transport.  It is not the Department's policy to undertake the manufacture of articles that can be produced by home manufacturers at reasonable cost, and the manufacturing operations of the factory are consequently limited to the production of special articles for the Post Office and other Government Departments.</P>
    <P>Civil aviation and meteorological services are controlled by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but the associated wireless services are provided and operated by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>The amount required for 1939-40 is £36,085, as compared with £27,526 for the current year&mdash;an increase of £8,559. The increase is due to the provision made for additional operating staff for the Shannon Airport and for additional staff and equipment for the Dublin Airport (Collinstown).  The radio facilities at Collinstown will include medium and short wave transmitting stations, a direction-finding station, and a radio-beacon to enable aircraft to land in conditions of low visibility. The radio installations at the Shannon Airport, for the transatlantic air services have been completed except for a radio-beacon at Rynanna, which will be installed later.</P>
    <P>Savings Bank transactions increased during 1938 by 71,000, and the total amount of the deposits by £314,500. The deposits during the year exceeded the withdrawals by £846,296.  The number of accounts remaining open at the end of the year was 350,869, being approximately 25,000 more than at the close of the preceding year.  The total amount standing to the credit of depositors is now £9,500,000, over £1,000,000 in excess of the previous year.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Commercial Account figures given in the first part of my statement, which are for the financial year 1937-38, and which show a profit on the services as a whole of £93,583, I wish to say that, so far as can be estimated at present, the profit for the current year is not likely, on account of expenditure on additional <Col N="2470" /> facilities and increased staff costs, to exceed £54,000, and the tendency will be to drop still lower.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister spoke about the post office in St. Andrew Street.  I see here an item for the purchase of sites, etc.&mdash;postal and telegraph services only&mdash;£3,450.  Would the Minister say how much of that relates to Exchequer Street and how much to St. Andrew Street.  Last year I made some remarks about the post office in St. Andrew Street.  The Minister was uncertain as to whether he owned the site, and had a contract for putting up a post office there, or whether it was the Department of Agriculture or the Agricultural Credit Corporation, or some other Department that was going to put up a building which the post office was to occupy.  There has not been a brick laid on that site for a year, as far as I know.  Is the Minister able to tell us to-day whether it is his Department that is doing that job or some of the other Departments that I have referred to.  I understood the Minister to say that he proposes to have an exchange in St. Andrew Street.  I rather thought that he was also having one in Exchequer Street. While, of course, it is necessary to have a post office in a fairly central position, St. Andrew Street is a very narrow traffic artery.  Last-year I stressed the point that I hoped the Minister would see that there was not a line of post office vans outside the thoroughfare in St. Andrew Street.  Exchequer Street is rather different, because there is a side street, and there is very little traffic in it.  I think the name of the side street is Dame Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know really what the Minister's policy is with regard to the matter of having exchanges in the principal thoroughfares.  There is no reason, of course, why the Post Office should not put up fine buildings and occupy sites in the centre of the city. At the same time, in a city like Dublin, where you have a few central thoroughfares with a very large undeveloped hinterland lying behind them, I think that if the Minister could see his way to do it, he would be adding to the town planning of the city, and probably <Col N="2471" /> adding to the prestige of the Post Office, by putting the buildings over which he has control, and which are not required to be in the main thoroughfares, not necessarily into the back streets, but into the less important thoroughfares.</P>
    <P>However, that is a matter that has to be tried out as between Crown Alley, Exchequer Street and St. Andrew Street.  I suppose the Minister is in the position that he cannot acquire property just where he would like to.  At the same time, I would urge on him to keep off a traffic artery like St. Andrew Street as much as possible.</P>
    <P>There is another matter that I want to refer to, and that is the carrying of the mails from Dun Laoghaire.  I do not see any item in connection with the carrying of mails by sea, and I rather think that is because the British Government hold the contract for carrying the mails to Dun Laoghaire and that the Post Office merely pay a contribution. That may be a very excellent way of working the matter out, and I am not finding fault with the Minister if he finds that that is the most desirable way of dealing with the matter. At the same time, Dun Laoghaire is the most important main tourist artery, and while I would not like to say the facilities there were out of date, still considerable improvements could be effected.  Last year I urged that there should be a conference between the Post Office, the Board of Works, the Dun Laoghaire Borough Corporation, and whoever is responsible for placing the mail contract.</P>
    <P>I saw in the papers some time ago that considerable improvements were being considered in connection with the pier at Dun Laoghaire, and, in fact, that if you went down there you would see people with tapes measuring up the place and considering what ought to be done.  I do not know whether that is a fact or not.  But these improvements take a long time to carry out, and if we are going to have a considerable increase in air passengers from America, it is quite possible that that route via Dun Laoghaire might become a very important tourist traffic artery. <Col N="2472" /> While, of course, it is possible for people to go the longer journey to England, I think that a very considerable and increasing volume of travellers and tourists will use that route.  It is most important, therefore, that we should have it absolutely up-to-date.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister will agree that the pier and the approaches to it are obsolescent, if not obsolete, and require really radical transformation. There are about four parties to be consulted and I should like to hear from the Minister that there is some prospect of calling a conference at an early date to consider the positions of the interested parties.  There is no doubt that a very considerable sum would require to be spent there.  At the same time, it would be a very desirable improvement and one that would probably pay dividends on the outlay.  Of course, the question of the boats would have to be considered in connection with the mail contract, but that is all the more reason why the question should be tackled and a decision arrived at in order that an improvement scheme might be gone on with as soon as the best possible way of working out and reconciling the interests of all parties is found.  I urge these two matters on the Minister and I ask him when replying to give as full details as he can.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to hear from the Minister's statement that the experimental automatic rural installation in the Rush and Lusk area has proved a success.  I take it that possibly he requires a further period of experiment before he will be satisfied that it is thoroughly successful. When he is so satisfied, I trust no time will be lost in establishing similar automatic exchanges throughout the country.  I should like to ask the Minister, if and when that happy state arrives, would it not be possible for all practical purposes to discontinue the telegraphic service completely throughout the country and make use of the telephone only.  There is a loss every year on the telegraph service and the Minister's forecast seems to suggest that that loss is going to increase.  The telephone, on the other hand, shows a <Col N="2473" /> profit and could be used for the purpose of transmitting messages which could then be sent out on the usual forms.  It would just mean the transmission of the messages by telephone rather than by telegraph.  If that could be done, and there is no reason why it should not, it would be an economy for the people of the country at large.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few matters which I should like to raise on the Vote.  The first is the question of the Pearse Street post office premises.  The Minister, and I think his predecessors, used to tell us annually how speedily they hoped to have the premises there adequately equipped for the proper transaction of a Post Office delivery and sorting service.  Whether the premises have now become a ghost to the present Minister or not I do not know, but it is rather strange that this year he omitted all reference to what the Post Office proposed to do in order to replace the present ramshackle structure by a sorting and postman's office worthy of the capital city of Eire.  By now the Minister must be familiar with the condition of the building there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His predecessor stated in this House five years ago that he hoped to start the work of reconstruction in a few months; but the work of reconstruction has not yet been started.  In an effort, however, to get the present Minister to give us some indication as to when the work would be taken in hands, I addressed a question to him some 18 or 20 months ago.  He then stated that the task was a very considerable one and that a good deal of work remained to be done, but that it was hoped to have the premises ready for occupation in 1941.  I do not see that any great improvement has been done on the premises for the past two years except to erect a wooden annex there.  I should like if the Minister would now say whether his promise that the premises would be ready in 1941 has any prospect of realisation, or whether he believes that it is possible to have the place ready for occupation by that time.  It is nearly two years since the Minister made the promise.  He had then four years in which to fulfil it.  I should like to know whether he is now as optimistic as he <Col N="2474" /> was then that the new premises would be available in 1941.</P>
    <P>Last year the Minister, on the Estimate, when the question of the inadequate accommodation at the Waterford Post Office was raised, undertook to look into the matter with a view to ascertaining what improvements could be effected and what steps could be taken to remedy the present unsatisfactory position there.  I should like to know whether any steps have since been taken to remedy the unsatisfactory accommodation at the Waterford Post Office and when it is likely that that office will be put in a condition adequate for the transaction of Post Office business and the proper accommodation of the staff.  In the course of his speech this evening, the Minister told us of a certain development in respect of civil aviation and meteorological services, and made reference to the development at Foynes and elsewhere.  The Foynes station and the station at Ballyporeen are staffed by temporary wireless operators. They have been employed in that capacity by the Post Office for a considerable time.  I should like to know whether it is contemplated that the Post Office will continue to service Foynes and Ballyporeen, whether it is contemplated that the Post Office will continue to be administratively responsible for the aviation and meteorological services at both these stations, and, if so, whether the Minister contemplates establishing the temporary wireless staff employed there.</P>
    <P>Many of the people who joined this service held pretty good positions on seagoing, British-registered vessels. They left their positions to take employment there, believing that this service was a regular service, one on which they would have permanent employment, and be assured of pensions after having rendered reasonable service to the State.  They are now employed in a temporary capacity, and have been so employed for a prolonged period.  Would the Minister indicate what the policy of the Department is in respect of them?  Is it intended to establish these officers as permanent wireless operators, and will steps be taken to grade them and pay them <Col N="2475" /> accordingly?  At present the officers do not appear to know what exactly their future grading is to be, or what way they are to be classified on establishment. As a matter of fact, until recently the Post Office did not appear to know whether it would be responsible for the permanent administration of these air and meteorological services, or whether the Department of Industry and Commerce would either take over that responsibility or share it, to some degree, with the Post Office.</P>
    <P>During the past year I had occasion to address questions to the Minister on some matters which have been the subject of representation to his Department over a long period.  One of the matters on which I addressed a question to the Minister had relation to the holding of an examination to fill Post Office clerkships at Dublin.  It is some years since the last examination was held.  There are vacancies in the Post Office clerk class in Dublin.  The Minister's Department promised about two years ago that an examination would be held to fill these vacancies but, in the meantime, there has been an inexplicable and disquieting silence on the subject on the part of the Minister's Department. The Minister told us, in reply to a parliamentary question about three months ago, that he had his eye on the matter.  The editor of the <i>Skibbereen Eagle</i> had his eye on the Czar in the same way.  Whether the Minister hopes that the results in this case will be more progressive or not, I do not know.  At all events, the Minister has now had the matter under optical examination for, at least, three months, and I should like to know if the decision is going to be announced on a matter which was represented to his Department two years ago.  Even in the case of the Post Office, it is not rushing matters unduly to expect a reply to representations after two years.  As the Minister has taken the matter in hand, we ought to have something definite from him on this question.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech this evening the Minister told us that the net surplus on the telephone side for the <Col N="2476" /> year 1937-38 was £61,000.  There is an aspect of that surplus to which I should like to call the Minister's attention. I think he will find, on examination of the staffing records, that in Dublin there are almost as many temporary telephonists as there are established telephonists.  That is a situation which did not arise in Dublin previously within living memory.  Even in the provincial post offices a large number of temporary telephonists are employed.  It has always been the policy of the Post Office to staff telephone exchanges with established officers.  &ldquo;Temporaries&rdquo; were only employed in very exceptional circumstances. Certainly, they were never allowed to reach the proportions in number which they have reached to-day. I should like to know what the Minister's Department contemplates in respect of these temporary telephonists. Is it intended to hold an examination for them?  When is it intended to hold the examination? What steps are to be taken to bring the authorised establishment in Dublin up to its proper level?  According to the Estimate, there is an authorised establishment on the telephone side.  Everybody who has any experience of the position knows perfectly well that the number of established telephonists in the exchanges is very much less than the number provided for in the Estimate.  I should like to hear what the Minister's Department proposes to do in respect of the holding of an examination to provide the temporary telephonists concerned with an opportunity of qualifying for established appointments.</P>
    <P>On the engineering side, I observe that skilled workmen, class II, and acting unestablished skilled workmen are expected to number 558 during the coming year.  I suspect that an examination of that figure will show that a considerable number of these men are graded as acting unestablished skilled workmen.  Here, again, it has always been the policy of the Post Office to provide these officers with an opportunity of securing established positions by means of limited competitive examinations.  I should like if the Minister would say whether it is intended that an examination for <Col N="2477" /> these officers will be held in the near future, how many vacancies will be offered at the examination and whether the officers concerned who have a substantial period of unestablished service can look forward to qualifying for appointment to the established class.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to make reference while on this question of engineering establishment. That is the question of the wages of the engineering grades. A claim on behalf of these grades has been submitted to the Minister by the union which represents the officers concerned. The Post Office has told the union that the matter is under consideration. That type of reply has been sent to the union on a number of occasions. After all, even for the Post Office, there must be some limit to the amount of consideration which can be given to a case.  Recent replies indicated that the matter was now in an advanced stage, and that there was reason to look forward to an early decision.  I do not know whether or not the matter is with the Minister, or whether he is in any way responsible for delaying the decision.  If the matter is awaiting his decision, I should like if he would say this evening what steps he proposes to take to announce the decision.  It is long past the time when a decision on the subject should be promulgated.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I would like to make reference, and that is the provision of outlets from the Post Office grades to the clerical grade. Looking through this Estimate, and observing the numbers of the Post Office grade employed in the metropolitan and provincial offices, one cannot fail to observe the very large number of persons employed at wage rates which are very low, and the limited opportunities, apparently, available to enable them to reach higher grades. There is at present an opportunity for Post Office clerks and postmen to qualify through examination for employment in the clerical grade in the Post Office and the higher offices.  But that means that only a very limited outlet is available to thousands throughout the country who are eligible to compete in these examinations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2478" /> In the past two years only one such examination has been held, and though the potential number of candidates was considerable, yet the total number of vacancies was only ten for men and two for women.  That is indeed a very inadequate outlet, having regard to the large number seeking an opening.  Only 60 per cent. of the available vacancies are offered to these grades.</P>
    <P>I would like if the Minister would give sympathetic consideration to the question of reserving all the vacancies in the clerical grade at the head offices for competition amongst the Post Office grades who are at present eligible only for a proportion of these vacancies.  I think if the Minister examines this matter personally in his own Department he will find that some of his best and most competent officials have come from that grade.  In asking that a further opportunity should be provided to qualify for appointment to the clerical grade one is only asking the Minister to avail of a very valuable supply of potential executive and administrative officers, the class of men and women who in the past have contributed substantially to the efficiency and development of the Post Office service.</P>
    <P>These are some of the remarks that I wanted to make on this Estimate.  I hope the Minister will endeavour in the course of his reply to indicate how the various matters to which I have referred stand and how long it will take before a definite decision will be arrived at between himself and his Department.  I hope such a decision will be reached without a very prolonged period of waiting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect to the point raised by Deputy Dockrell with regard to the item for £3,450, that does not refer to St. Andrew Street at all.  It has in fact no relation to St. Andrew Street.  It refers to a sum required for the provision of a garage for engineering purposes.  In respect to the site in St. Andrew Street the position is something like this:&mdash;The Agricultural Credit Corporation is not now involved in the question of occupying any portion of that site when it is built.  The position is that originally when these people went out of the scheme we were <Col N="2479" /> endeavouring to bring in the broadcasting Department.  Since we secured the Exchequer Street premises, we have, we believe, very much better accommodation for the broadcasting Department.  We are bringing this to Exchequer Street together with a portion of the trunk telephone section. The other portion of the trunks will be established at the St. Andrew Street site together with the post office which will replace that now at College Green. I do not think there will be any question of traffic congestion likely to arise in Exchequer Street.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if accommodation can be made whereby they will be taken off the main streets.  I do not think there would be any possibility of very much congestion there.  In respect of Dun Laoghaire Pier, I do not think we enter into that very much at all. The present contract lasts until the end of 1940.  Beyond the fact that we will be one of the parties to a renewal contract, I do not think we will have very much voice in respect of the improvements which the Deputy thinks should be made at the Pier, or whatever other additions would be regarded as making it attractive for tourists to this particular port.  However, if we have any influence in the matter, we will naturally use it to the best possible advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know that it would be possible to carry out the suggestion that Deputy Benson has made of discontinuing the telegraph service.  It certainly looks as if things were tending that way, and that the telegraph service has almost become obsolete.  The possibility <Col N="2480" /> suggested by Deputy Benson of telephoning the message and having the telephone message delivered, from its destination to the receiver, might be a way out.  But I do not think that for some years to come, even in face of the loss, that we could just do away with the telegraph service as at present established.  We may, with the growth of telephones, and especially with the growth of local automatic exchanges, find that the telephone will naturally replace the telegraph, and that the telegraph will die a natural death.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton spoke about Pearse Street.  Pearse Street, of course, is a very large problem.  There is a very fine wooden structure there.  I do not know if Deputy Norton has been through the place yet.  I have been through Pearse Street and I regard this as a very fine timber structure. It almost suggested itself to me as a structure of a permanent character. The place is well heated, well lighted and well ventilated and generally I would say the conditions are good.  Any advance in the way of erecting a permanent structure could not have been made until the temporary structure had been erected.  Now that that particular structure has been erected, one of the big difficulties that were in our way has been removed, but I am afraid it may not be possible to have the structure completed by the year 1941.  However, the Deputy can rest assured that we are doing our utmost to get on with the work.  Naturally, we are as anxious as anybody else to see the final permanent structure in being.</P>
    <P>The matter of the Waterford Post Office does unfortunately still present a certain amount of difficulty, but there again we are doing whatever is possible.  There are several outside influences there which are more or less holding us up.  Again, I will have to say that we are doing our utmost to clear those difficulties out of the way. Until we do clear them out of the way we ourselves cannot get on with the job.  Those other influences will have to be satisfied.  They are circumstances which are unfortunately outside our own jurisdiction, but we are pressing to have the matter settled as quickly as possible.  Final arrangements <Col N="2481" /> have not yet been determined in respect of civil aviation.  The Post Office will probably still continue to operate the wireless service, and the question of the permanent status of the wireless operators will be considered when the ultimate staffing position can be more closely visualised.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the question of reserving for limited competition amongst Post Office Departmental classes all clerical officer posts in the Post Office headquarters' offices.  This is a claim which, on representations from the union, has already been considered by the Department on several occasions.  It is a claim that could not possibly be accepted.  It is essential for the efficient conduct of the service that the personnel of the headquarters' clerical grades shall consist of at least a reasonable proportion of officers of the educational standard produced by open competitions.  The Post Office grades in which the Deputy is interested are particularly fortunate in having, as they have at present, half the headquarters' clerical vacancies reserved for limited examination.  In this they have, I may say, an avenue to the clerical grade open to no Departmental class in any other Department, and I think Post Office officers might reasonably realise their exceptionally favourable position in the matter.  At any rate I am not prepared to support the union claim.</P>
    <P>In regard to the holding of a limited competition confined to postmen for posts as Post Office clerk, Grade &ldquo;B,&rdquo; in the Dublin Postal District, this question has involved a comprehensive review of the whole system of open and limited recruitment in the Post Office. The examination of the matter has now been completed, and I hope very shortly to be in a position to take the necessary steps towards the holding of a further competition.  In regard to the provision of outlets to the Learner Class for boy messengers at provincial offices, this matter too involved a review of the system of open and limited recruitment.  As I informed the Deputy about a month ago in reply to a question in the Dáil, consideration of the matter had then reached an advanced stage, and I am now able to say that the Departmental examination <Col N="2482" /> has been completed, and I expect that it will be possible in the near future to arrange for the holding of a competition for learnerships limited to boy messengers at provincial offices.</P>
    <P>As regards the wages claim in respect of engineering classes, the position is that the heavy expenditure which acceptance of the claim made by the union would involve could not be justified. Before rejecting the claim <i>in toto</i>, however, I requested the Department to reconsider the matter with the object of determining to what extent some less costly scheme of improvement in scales would be practicable, and the question is at present under further examination.</P>

      <P>They have been fairly successful so far.  As regards the question of an examination for acting unestablished skilled workmen for promotion to the skilled workmen class, this matter has been delayed by considerations arising out of, firstly, the fixing of the permanent establishment of skilled workers, and secondly, the difficulties of ensuring a competition that would satisfy the requirements of the Civil Service Commissioners by reason of the fact that the number of officers eligible to compete is practically equal to the number of vacancies available.  I am, however, considering whether at this stage it would be possible to hold a competition for, say, half the vacancies, leaving the others to remain over to a future date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the question of a limited competition for appointment as telephonist confined to temporary telephonists, arrangements are now in hand for the holding of a competition, subject, of course, to the concurrence of the Civil Service Commissioners, for 35 situations as established telephonist &mdash;14 in Dublin and 21 in the provinces. The delay which has arisen in dealing <Col N="2483" /> with this matter has been caused by considerations relative to the extent of the service to be required of candidates, but it has been decided on this occasion to make no change in the conditions hitherto applicable.  Whether any change may be necessary in relation to such future similar competitions as may be held, I am not at present able to say.  I think that answers the various queries which were raised by the few Deputies who spoke, and I do not think there is anything else I need add.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister sits down, would he kindly let us know what progress has been made in regard to communication by telephone with the islands off West Cork, such as the island of Cape Clear?

I cannot say at the moment how many islands we can deal with in, say, the next 12 months, but there is no question about the fact that we are going ahead as quickly as possible with a plan to secure some kind of communication. There will probably be wireless communication in respect of the islands to which the Deputy is referring. I think it will be quite satisfactory.</P>

      <P>In regard to the Foynes and Ballyporeen stations, might I ask the Minister whether he can give us any idea as to when some of the officers there will be established?  Presumably the extent to which large sums of money are being spent on those stations is a guarantee that they will remain. Is it not possible for the Minister to take on hands at once the question of establishing at least some of those officers?  One cannot visualise the stations being serviced unless the officers are there, and if they are there, surely they should be appointed in an established capacity.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £46,203 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1940, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisí eile a bhaineann le Fóirleatha Nea-shrangach (Uimh. 45 de 1926).</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £46,203 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1940, for Salaries and other Expenses in connection with Wireless Broadcasting (No. 45 of 1926).</P>
      <P>The amount of the Estimate for the broadcasting service for the financial year 1939-40 is £69,303, a reduction of £5,256 on the provision for the current year.  The amount required for broadcasting plant under sub-head F is less by £8,985, due to the inclusion in the 1938-39 year's estimates of an exceptional amount for the installation of an experimental short-wave station at Athlone.  There was also capital expenditure in 1938-39 for improved engineering apparatus in the studios.  The reduction of £8,985 is offset by increases under other sub-heads, mainly under sub-heads A and B in respect of additional staff and increased performing right fees respectively. The revenue of the service for the current year will amount to approximately £110,000.  The revenue for the coming year is estimated at £113,500, made up of £78,500 from licence fees and £35,000 from advertisements and miscellaneous receipts, showing an increase of £3,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total expenditure on broadcasting out of all Votes in the current financial year will amount to approximately £93,000.  The revenue for the year thus shows a surplus over expenditure of approximately £17,000. Commercial accounts for broadcasting are not, however, prepared, as in the <Col N="2485" /> case of the Post Office, so that in estimating the true financial position of the service, it is necessary to allow, in addition to the Vote expenditure, for the annual charges&mdash;interest, depreciation, etc., on the capital expended on the provision of stations and studios. If full allowance were made for these items, the service would show a deficit instead of a surplus.  The number of wireless licences has been increasing steadily and satisfactorily during the recent years.  The increase during the past 12 months was about 10,000.  Special action is still being taken for the detection of licence defaulters.</P>
    <P>A development of particular interest during the past year was the installation of the experimental short-wave station at Athlone.  Test programmes are at present being transmitted and arrangements have been made to obtain reception reports, but it is not yet possible to say when the station will be in regular operation.</P>
    <P>The recent acquisition, with the approval of the Dáil, of a site at Exchequer Street, Dublin, for the purposes of a broadcasting building marks a further important step forward. Plans for the new structure are under consideration.  Meanwhile, owing to the expansion of the service, additional studios and offices are being made available in the General Post Office.</P>
    <P>The improvement, and the need for further improvement, of the programmes have made it necessary to increase the establishment by a talks officer, a full-time news officer, and a third announcer.  A whole-time engineer of senior rank has also been allocated to the service.</P>
    <P>Three public symphony concerts were arranged for this season in the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin.  Two of these have already been held but, I regret to say, the attendance at them did not come up to expectations.  The position in regard to public concerts during the preceding season was similar.  If greater public interest in the performance is not manifested it will be a matter for consideration whether it is worth while continuing them.</P>
    <P>A public concert devoted entirely to Irish music was given recently&mdash;on St. Patrick's Night.  There were new compositions <Col N="2486" /> and arrangements by Irish composers, large choirs, a céilidhe band playing properly orchestrated Irish dance music, an augmented orchestra.  The public attendance was lamentably low, and offered a very poor encouragement to those who initiated this development.</P>
    <P>The use of Irish in the programmes has been extended, and an Irish news bulletin is now a regular feature.</P>
    <P>The programmes for schools have again been improved, and the greater interest taken in them is reflected in the increased number of schools, which now include them in the curriculum. It is estimated that about 700 primary schools now take the programmes as compared with 400 last year.</P>
    <P>There was considerable interference on the Athlone wavelength from other stations during the year, and while, as a result of representations made in the matter, the nuisance abated somewhat, it has not yet been entirely eliminated. An international conference for the redistribution of wavelengths to European broadcasting stations is, however, at present being held in Switzerland, at which this Administration is represented, and it is hoped that the national station will be freed from interference as a result.</P>
    <P>From the outline which I have given of the last year's activities, it will be apparent that appreciable progress has again been made in the development of Irish broadcasting.  The service, by its nature, is particularly open to criticism, and comparison of our programmes with those of foreign stations is inevitable.  While, however, we cannot hope to compete along certain lines with the larger broadcasting organisations which have vastly greater resources of all kinds, I think it may fairly be claimed that, on the whole, the programmes sustain a high level of interest and attraction and that they are framed with due regard to national, educational and artistic requirements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister will find many people either in the House or in the country to agree with the statement he has just made, that there was an appreciable improvement in the programme of the Irish <Col N="2487" /> broadcasting station during the year.  I think there are very few people in this country who are anything like at all satisfied with the programmes we are getting.  This is a Vote upon which I have spoken during a number of years. I am one of those who spend a certain amount of time listening-in at night time, particularly during the winter, and, if I can, I prefer to listen-in to our own broadcasting station, but I find it very difficult and there is a very strong temptation to turn the knob and switch on to somewhere else.  I want to say quite frankly, giving my own opinion and the opinion of most people who speak to me about it, that their service is a very disappointing one.</P>
      <P>I do not expect that we should come up to the standard of some of the other stations in outside countries where they have an immense income.  I realise that the amount of talent that is at the disposal of the Irish Broadcasting Station is, perhaps, limited.  But I do not think anybody will agree that we are making anything at all like the best use of the talent that we have in the country, and it is that terrible sameness about the programmes, and their monotony, day after day and week after week, during which there seems to be no variation or change whatsoever, that is found so disappointing; so much so that, as I say, I think the Minister will find, if he makes inquiries even amongst his own friends and colleagues, that there are very few people satisfied with the programmes.  Apart from that, small and all as the amount of money that is available may be, we are not even spending the amount that we are receiving by way of wireless licences, and from advertisements, and so on, and there is a sum of somewhere around £17,000 or £20,000 of a surplus that is being pocketed by someone&mdash; by the Minister for Finance, I suppose, for some other service.  Why is that? Is it that the Minister is satisfied that the amount set aside here&mdash;£69,303, or the gross of £90,000&mdash;is all that he can use or that he is spending, or can he not try to improve the programme by the addition of the other £17,000 or £20,000?  There is certainly room for improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is one distinctive feature <Col N="2488" /> about this particular broadcasting station over the last few years, and particularly over the last 12 months, it is the tendency to use it as a Government propaganda machine.  I do not know who is responsible for that, but there is a very definite Government Party bias. On numerous occasions I have listened in to the news broadcast by our broadcasting service, and, as I say, there was a very definite propaganda touch about it.  I could mention several occasions on which that happened, but let me just refer to one recent occasion which will be fresh in the minds of most people.  We had a very important Bill introduced in this House recently, a Bill in which there was a great deal of interest taken throughout the country, a Bill with which nearly every homestead in the country was concerned&mdash;the Valuation Bill.  That Bill was introduced by the Minister, and a considerable number of speakers took part in the debate on that stage.  After the Minister had introduced the Bill, there was not a single speech in favour of it.  Notwithstanding that, the only speech mentioned in the news that night was the speech of the Minister. Now, if that is not Government propaganda, I do not know what it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the Deputy had not spoken on that Bill.  It was on the following day that Deputy Kelly spoke.  The Deputy considered the Minister's speech so good that he wanted to inflict it second-hand on the Dublin Corporation.</P>

The Deputy, I think, notwithstanding his admiration for the Minister's performance upon that Bill, will agree with me that, if we are to have a news service and not a propaganda service, there should be fair play, and that the news given should be balanced news.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister would agree to that, I would give the Government about 24 hours to remain in office. I have quoted that as one instance, but there are several others.  I know quite well that no matter how excellent a programme you may put up, you are not going to please everybody.  That cannot be done.  I do not think that there is a broadcasting station in the world that is not open to criticism, but I doubt if there is any other broadcasting station that so richly deserves criticism as this one.  It is an important service.  It is a service of growing importance. There are roughly 140,000 people in this country paying a licence of 10/- each.  Not only are they paying that, but every person who purchases a receiving set is paying pretty steeply by way of taxation on that set.  These people are entitled, at least, to a service that is fair and impartial, so far as news is concerned.  They are also entitled to expect that at least the amount of money that they contribute will be expended on that service.  I think it is unfair that the Minister for Finance, or whoever is responsible, should, to put it very plainly, collar a sum of money that belongs to that service and put it into some other service. I do not want to take up the time of the House any further, as it is getting late, and I do not know that I could usefully add anything to what I have already said.  What I have said, I have said very plainly and bluntly.  The Minister, of course, will not agree with all I have said, but if he ever listens in to the Dublin station, I think he will be inclined to agree at least with some of what I have said.</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Morrissery in his remarks about the monotony and the weariness of the programmes from Athlone, in which there is no variation, good, bad, or indifferent, from one day to another. Considerable interference exists in Wexford and district for the last five or six years with reception from Athlone.  When I complained about the matter last year, I was told that the power of the station was being increased, and that that would prevent interference in future.  The Minister stated that the power had been increased, but, as far as Wexford is concerned, there has not been any improvement.  From 7 o'clock in the evening until 11 p.m. it is absolutely impossible to hear the Athlone Station. I ask the Minister now, as on a previous occasion, to have an inspector sent to Wexford district, to find out if there is anything seriously wrong, as everyone is complaining about the very bad reception.</P>

      <P>I should like to refute, in some directions, what has been said by members of the Opposition with regard to the character of the programmes. As one who listens to the whole range of radio stations throughout Europe and America, I say that the programmes have considerably improved, particularly in the past 18 months.  No doubt they are still capable of further improvement, but to give an example of the sort of items in the programme which might be thought to be rather dull, but which from actual experience proved rather popular, I cite the case of a recent lecture on the development of seed potato-growing in Athlone.  I was in Athlone on the occasion of the broadcast, and I walked quite accidentally into a house in which there were farmers who grow seed potatoes, and found that they were listening in the ordinary way, and were thoroughly <Col N="2494" /> enjoying the programme.  It was a surprise for me, because one often imagines that lectures of that kind are considered rather dull, and that people do not bother listening to them.  That was an unrehearsed example of people listening to a lecture concerning an experiment of a technical kind, the development of the seed potato industry.  I also found, in curious contrast to the apathy of many people in this country about the Irish programme, that it was regularly listened to throughout the whole of Northern England, and particularly the Manchester district, by people who are not Irish but who are delighted with the Irish programme.  I believe that a good deal of the criticism of our programme arises from the old inferiority complex coming out again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I believe could be developed in this country is a greater conscientiousness of radio as such, by making the people think more about the programme, conscientiously thinking about it as a whole and, as far as the constituent parts are concerned.  I suggest to the Minister that he should consider proposals that have been made to produce a radio magazine in order that people could see beforehand the sort of things that are to take place in the programme.  I am quite sure that the publication of a magazine would make people realise that there are interesting talks on world events being discussed, and Irish events discussed in a way that they had not realised, merely from seeing what was on the radio programmes.  With regard to the development of Irish music, I feel that the Minister should consider Irish radio in relation to radio itself, and also make the people think, not merely of Irish music in the sense that they feel it has something to do with Irish culture, Irish folklore or part of the Irish revival, and not merely something to do with ceilidh music as such.  One of the most essential things is the development of orchestration of Irish music for ordinary purposes, the development of Irish songs and Irish melodies played by orchestras, and to be used as compositions for ordinary music by people listening for the sake of entertainment, <Col N="2495" /> and not because it was Irish or culturally Irish.  That is the most vital thing we need to-day as far as national culture is concerned.  From the Athlone broadcasting station Irish music is continually played, and although a good deal has been done for Irish melodies a vast amount more could be done if the Government would give a grant to people to orchestrate music.  I had the privilege of listening recently to a famous musician who has a private organ and he took out a file of Hardebeck's melodies from Petrie's collection.  In order that they might be developed so that the public would know about them I suggest, that in spite of what could be done by Radio Eireann, a vast amount of Irish melodies and Irish music could be explored to be used for common entertainment by the people so as to get them out of the habit of mind which was amongst them of thinking that Irish music has something to do only with patriotic music, and to make it part of the normal life of the country. I feel that Radio Eireann could contribute to that to a greater degree.  I have one more suggestion to make, and that is that the short wave programme should be developed.  Above all, the Minister should consider bringing out in that programme the part played by Irish people throughout the whole world, by giving news about Irish people in every continent, in order to link up the Irish race in a way that has never been done.  That I think could be done only if the programmes could be heard all over the world. That would help to enable us to achieve the position we desire in the world, and indirectly help us to develop the sort of thing we want to develop, in order to bring about the final stage of our national development, the unity of this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>(Junior): I ask the Minister to speed up the setting up of a short wave station.  It is very necessary for a country such as ours, whose people are scattered all over the world, that we should have some means of communicating with them.  A short wave station is the ideal way of enabling this country to communicate with Irish people who are outside it.  I know <Col N="2496" /> several people who have had communications from friends in America, Australia and other distant parts, inquiring about this matter.  The Minister referred to an experimental short wave station that was set up recently.  In my ignorance of wireless matters I do not know whether that means that the station is for experimental purposes.  I suggest that it is essential that a short wave station should be set up here to send out programmes which would be heard in all parts of the world.  The Government intends to introduce a Tourist Traffic Bill and to spend large sums of money to encourage tourists. Wireless has proved itself to be the biggest advertising medium and the most valuable way to encourage such traffic, and as much use as possible should be made of it in that respect.</P>

      <P>I would not go so far as Deputy Morrissey and say that there has been no improvement whatever in the Irish programme.  I think that there has been a decided improvement since the present Director took charge. I would at all events say that the programme is not as bad as it was some time ago, but there is still a want of variation.  We could do with a little more of the lighter type of entertainment, not only as regards music but dialogues, and a better sense of humour in the programmes, such as &ldquo;Sunny Talks to Farmers,&rdquo; by Deputy Childers. There should be a little more brightness, as the whole programme is inclined to be too heavy, and overloaded with what I think Deputy Childers found fault&mdash;that is, trying to be realistically patriotic all the time, ultra-Irish in everything and in every piece of music and song.  That is not the proper conception of wireless.  After all, wireless is intended to transmit music, not to develop or orchestrate it. That is for our musicians and our schools of music.  There is, of course, an orchestra in the studio.  We have a very excellent orchestra.  I am, however, sorry to learn that the attempts of the orchestra to give symphony concerts here in Dublin have not met with the success these attempts deserved.  It is a very small orchestra, but if augmented could be made into a very fine one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2497" /> Something has been done for the development of Irish musical talent.  Fritz Brasé has done a great in the Army in the way of the development of Irish music.  We have in the Army in Cork at present Lieutenant Boles, an Irishman, and an Irish-speaking bandmaster.  And he is doing excellent work.  That phase of musical development is not for broadcasting. Broadcasting is transmitting to the people what they want, and the people's taste should be respected. Deputy Morrissey has complained of the political tinge or bias that has been given to communications over the wireless. What else could he expect?  Is it not a Government service?  Is it not run as a branch of the Government executive?  That is one of the things I stood up here to object to.  It is a Government service and when our Taoiseach speaks over the wireless he talks of when &ldquo;we&rdquo; did this, when &ldquo;we&rdquo; did that and when &ldquo;we&rdquo; did the other thing.  I thought at first when I heard him using the word &ldquo;we&rdquo; that he meant this country and the people of this country.  Not at all. What he meant was the Fianna Fáil Party.  It was of the Fianna Fáil Party he was speaking.  That is a wrong conception of the use to which wireless should be put.  It is the sort of use to which wireless should not be put.  But while wireless continues to be a Government service you cannot expect to find things otherwise.  Whatever the Fianna Fáil Party does is, of course, right and whatever our side of the House does is, in the opinion of some people, all wrong.</P>

      <P>I would like to suggest that steps might be taken at this stage of the development of wireless broadcasting in Ireland to remove the whole wireless activity from Government control, as has been done and done successfully in other countries.  The direction of wireless activities should be in the hands of some body or corporation outside Government interference and control.  At least wireless broadcasting should be outside direct Government control.  While broadcasting <Col N="2498" /> is subject to Government control there will be a certain amount of Party bias.</P>

      <P>Party bias is given to it.  If Deputy Kelly and I wanted to say the same thing we would give it a slightly different colour and that colour would be according to our political affiliations.  That would happen no matter how unbiased we wanted to be.  I suggest that the time has come when this question should be reconsidered.  This service is now making a profit of £20,000 a year, That £20,000 might be turned into good use on the lines suggested by Deputy Childers for the development of Irish music.  In that way somebody in this country might be got to do for Irish music what Brahms did for Hungarian music.  Then people would be got to listen to it as music, <i>qua</i> music, not as Irish music.  Irish musical talent could in this way be developed.  That could be done if the control of broadcasting were taken over by an independent body or corporation and developed along right lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a wireless transmitting station attached to the military barracks in Cork.  This transmitting station is ruining the afternoon programme of listeners in Cork. Representations have been made to me by people who would like to listen to the afternoon programmes and who have to work at nights.  Owing to the particular wave-length of this transmission station at the military barracks in Cork, it is ruining the afternoon programmes.  There is, it appears, only one programme to which people in Cork can listen at that time and that is the Welsh Regional programme, but that is crushed out by the Morse transmission in the Cork Barracks.  I do not know whether the interference is confined to Cork or whether it is common to all the other military barracks in the country, but certainly it is not fair that this interference should be allowed to continue. It is not fair to Cork listeners that their reception should be ruined by <Col N="2499" /> that transmission system.  I suggest to the Minister that he should take some steps to have that very serious interference stopped.  It ought to be stopped.</P>
    <P>When we get on to this new building in Exchequer Street there will be an opportunity of setting up wireless broadcasting on a new basis in this country.  That will be good for wireless and, from the Irish point of view, it will be no harm.  I should like to say to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs that his hands are quite full enough as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  He has a very large and heavy responsibility in that direction and so, he should not be saddled with the additional responsibility for a highly specialised matter like wireless broadcasting, for which he has not the musical or technical training.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have to say to the House has nothing to do with Party politics.  It is only concerned with wireless listeners.  I see by this Estimate that we made a profit of something like £20,000 last year.  I do not know what the profit was the year before.  The people who are supporting the wireless programme in this country are the people who pay their 10/- licence every year.  Very many of these people find great difficulty in paying that sum.  There are poor people in the country who pay this 10/- yearly and they deserve a return for the money.  But from 9.30 to 10.30 every night we hear the words &ldquo;Sponsored programme.&rdquo; We have to listen to that sponsored programme which brings in a revenue which appears in the heading under &ldquo;Advertising,&rdquo; £35,000.  I <Col N="2500" /> think that should be given back in value to the people who pay the 10/- licences for their wireless sets.  It could be given back in different ways. Those ways could be worked out by the people concerned.  We have this £35,000 there in hands.  Now, this wireless service should not be made a revenue-making concern.  The service should be given back to the people in some form and of some value.  I made this point last year and I am making it now and shall continue to make it again, if necessary.</P>
      <P>The other point I wish to make is this: Deputy O'Neill referred to Party propaganda.  Now I would like to say this&mdash;we have got a very powerful medium in this country&mdash;the wireless &mdash;and we should let the world know through the medium of the wireless what our position is in international affairs.  I am in the position of being able to listen to the wireless every night from foreign stations because I understand what is said in French and German.  I hear propaganda going on all over the world and I often wish our broadcasting authority would let the world know what our position is. We should use our wireless to show to the world, and make other countries realise, what is going on at the present time in this country.  We want to have the Border abolished.  We should let other countries know everything about the partition of this country and that we want the Border abolished.  What we have to say on that matter should be translated into every language in Europe and half-an-hour should be spent, from time to time, speaking to the peoples of Europe&mdash;in French one time, in Spanish another time, in German another time, and so on&mdash;telling the people of the world what we want done about the Border&mdash;telling them the grievance we have on this question of Partition and the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what our wireless service should be devoted to.  That £35,000 profit should be put into every language under the sun so that we could tell the world where we stand, and when the British Foreign Office goes to make a treaty here and there, <Col N="2501" /> and when thy put their propaganda forward in this way and that, why should we not allow our wireless to say what we want and translate the language in which it goes across the air into every language, just as every nation in the world is doing at the present time?  I listen-in on my wireless at night and I hear nothing except British propaganda, French propaganda, German propaganda, and every other kind of propaganda, but where is our Irish propaganda?  It is not there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I naturally welcome any criticism that may be directed at the Department of Broadcasting.  First of all, it is by criticism that we can improve our services, and it is by criticism, I think, that we can claim we have improved our services.  Deputy Morrissey complained of the sameness of the programmes, but I think that if you were to bring the population of Dublin into one theatre, the population of the city would be divided in their opinions as to whether the entertainment provided was the type they desired or the type that they regarded as entertainment.  What is required, as far as wireless is concerned, is intelligent selection of the type of programme you desire.  I have no doubt that there are many portions of the wireless programme we diffuse that are not acceptable to a great many people, but there are other items which are very acceptable and regarded as very entertaining by the same type of people.  It would be quite impossible to satisfy all tastes in respect to entertainment.  I think everybody will agree on that.  We are doing our utmost, as far as lies within our power, to provide entertainment suitable to the greatest possible number of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expressions of criticism that were given here in the House are typical of the difference of opinion that exists outside.  Deputy Morrissey does not seem quite satisfied with the programme as a whole, but Deputy O'Neill is satisfied that, as a programme, it is good.  Deputy Childers believes that there are certain types <Col N="2502" /> of talks still necessary, but he is satisfied that the type of talks and entertainment we are giving is fairly satisfactory.  It can, therefore, be seen that it would be impossible to please everybody.  I think that Deputy Morrissey is as sensible a Deputy as there is in the Hosue, and I am sure he will agree with that statement.  I do not admit for a second that broadcasting is being used for political propaganda by one Party.  The director is a free agent.  He is under my jurisdiction, but in no circumstances do I ever interfere with the director's direction of his job.  I do not think it is fair to charge that particular department with misuse of their powers, because I do not think there has been any misuse.  There may be, as Deputy O'Neill suggested, a little deeper colouring in what Deputy Morrissey may see in a talk, but Deputy O'Neill does not seem to have seen the same deep colouring as Deputy Morrissey seems to have seen; so there it is.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism in respect to certain posts that have been advertised recently.  Deputy Mongan raised the question of advertisements for a news talks officer, and said that no special mention was made in regard to Irish being required.  We have a talks officer who deals mainly with Gaelic talks, Gaelic discussions, Gaelic drama, and so on, and we are satisfied that that Gaelic talks officer is doing the work that is required in respect of Gaelic.  We do not bar any talks officer who may be a competent Gaelic speaker from applying for this job.  In fact, we will welcome an officer if he has Irish, to a greater degree than if he has not Irish.  As far as programmes in Irish, are concerned, I believe that even in this House there would be a difference of opinion.  Some people believe we are giving too much to the Gaelic side of the programme and others contend that we are not giving sufficient.  I feel that we are doing the sensible thing.  The Director himself is a competent Gaelic scholar and a man who is very sympathetically disposed towards the Gaelic language and I think he is using wisdom and <Col N="2503" /> discretion in the manner in which he is dealing with the use of Gaelic on the air.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish spoke about interference. Unfortunately, interference has not been completely cleared away. Klaipeda seems to be still the culprit. I do not know what the position will be now that they have been taken over by Germany, but we have a couple of people at present at a conference in Switzerland who are forcing the pace in respect to the position of Klaipeda and ourselves.  I do not know whether the position will be cleared or not as a result of the recent political happenings over there, but I think I can safely say that, as a result of the conference, the interference will be removed.  At any rate, I sincerely hope so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers mentioned the question of a radio magazine.  I think that matter was raised before, but I am afraid it would not be a matter for the Government.  I suggest the Deputy should offer his suggestions to the people who are already publishing a radio magazine.  Reference was made to the short-wave station.  The position now is that we are awaiting reports as to the quality of the reception abroad.  So far, we have not secured any reports as to the effect of the <Col N="2504" /> broadcasts in Canada, America or Australia, but we are expecting these in the very near future.  I may mention also that, in regard to the surplus of which Deputies Esmonde and Morrissey spoke, there is a very large deficit still&mdash;there is a deficit of something like £100,000 on broadcasting&mdash; and until that is completely wiped out most of this surplus will have to go towards reducing that deficit.</P>
