      <P>I should like to ask the Minister if he has reconsidered this matter, and whether he really thinks that, having added 1/- to the income-tax this year, the addition of another 1/- to the income-tax next year is going to do anything like what he told the House he estimated it would do.  We warned him when the 1/- was going on the income-tax at the beginning of this year that he was not going to get the revenue which he informed the House he expected to get from it. Already about one-third of the income-tax for the year has been collected, and what is the position?  After the addition of the 1/- at the beginning of the year the Minister expected that he would get an additional £377,000 from income-tax over what he got last year. One-third of the total amount of income-tax has been collected this year, but, although the rate has been increased by 1/-, instead of being up, the amount collected up to 26th November is £343,000 down.  I should like to ask the Minister whether the significance in the trend shown there would make him hesitate to put his proposal before the House to increase <Col N="748" /> the income-tax by another 1/- for the coming year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly did not propose, without due consideration, that an additional 1/- be imposed from April next.  From anybody's point of view, it was not a pleasant thing to have to do.  We believed it was necessary, and I am afraid there is no way out of it; it will have to continue.  With regard to the figures he has just quoted, I think the Deputy does not realise that the 5/6 rate is not appreciably reflected in the income-tax figures which have been received so far.  It will not be reflected until after 1st January next.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

      <P>It does fluctuate. The income-tax comes in mainly in the last quarter.  We will have to wait; we cannot draw any really sound deductions from the figure of income-tax revenue at any other time of the year except towards the end of the last quarter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>On Section 2, I emphasised, on the Second Stage, that the action of the Government in <Col N="749" /> imposing a duty on sugar, tobacco, beer and spirits was giving a tremendous impetus to the rise in the cost of the ordinary commodities of life and that the Minister was doing that in order to raise £603,000 between this and the end of the year.  I pointed out that, in the face of the various matters that were impinging on the situation here from outside, tending to disturb the price level here on the one hand, and the amount of money that he was borrowing on the other, it was a disastrous thing for the Government to impose additional taxation for the purpose of getting in that additional amount in such a unique and very disturbing situation, and that it was having a very bad effect.  Has the Minister reconsidered the matter, and what are the reasons why he should continue to press for the raising of the price of sugar in this particular way?</P>
      <P>I am quite sure that the Australian Government is as much exercised and as much affected by the influences of the war as we are here and that, in so far as additional expense is caused to them by the conditions brought about by the war, the burden falling on them is as great, for the moment, as the burden falling on us here. Recent newspaper notices have shown that they have decided not to increase taxation during the current financial year, but to wait and see what the general situation is likely to be at the end of the financial year and then, in the face of the fuller and clearer knowledge that they will have, and the clearer understanding of the way in which outside events are going to impinge on their financial situation, they will make decisions.  I should like to know if the Minister has given any consideration since to that particular aspect of things, and does he still persist in imposing this duty on sugar?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this proposal to increase the duty on sugar, taken in conjunction with the imposition of an extra 3/4d. on the price of sugar, deserves to be considered in the light of what the Prime Minister said when speaking on the Second Stage of this Bill and comparing the outlook of the <Col N="750" /> Government with the outlook of this Party.  The Prime Minister spoke of the outlook of this Party as representing the rule of jungle law in which the defenceless and the poor were to be delivered over to the tender mercies of the exploiter under the policy of the Manchester School of Free Trade, whereas the Fianna Fáil Party stood for a paternal solicitude for the poor, observing constant vigilance to protect them from any attempt at exploitation. He went on to explain that the policy of this Party must result in intense suffering for the most defenceless sections of the community, whereas their Party were prepared to make very great sacrifices in order to ensure that the poor would pass unscathed upon their way.</P>
      <P>While I listened to that, I could not help thinking of this Budget; I could not help thinking that the Prime Minister was actually talking on the Second Stages of a Finance Bill which imposed heavy taxation on one of the modest luxuries of the poor in the form of tobacco and, not content with that, went further to levy heavy taxation, not only on their luxuries, but on the very essential foodstuffs without which it would be impossible for the poor to maintain the minimum standard of health.  Not only that, but that the commodity at which he proposes to strike was that commodity which the children of the poor, particularly, stood in need if their health was to be maintained. I do not propose to go into a long discourse on dietetics here this morning, but there are few Deputies who know more of that aspect of the life of the poor than the present Minister for Finance.  He has been for years intimately associated with the daily life of the poor; for the last five or six years he was Minister for Local Government and Public Health and such questions were continually canvassed in his own office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The poor find the greatest difficulty in providing for their children the minimum necessary diet to protect them from sickness.  One of the most valuable foods they have for that purpose is sugar.  The point to be remembered <Col N="751" /> there is that no matter what tax you may put upon it, no matter how you raise the price, everyone goes on trying to get some sugar.  We are accused by the Prime Minister of being entirely indifferent to the interests of the poor, and we are accused of that because he says we stand for the free trade policy.  I put, in direct contrast to his policy, the policy for which we stand, and which I think I am entitled to say is the policy to which Cordell Hull, Secretary of State in the United States, has been converted, the policy to which Lord Halifax of Great Britain has been converted, the policy to which Monsieur Daladier, the Prime Minister of France, has been converted, the policy to which every enlightened statesman in the world has been converted, the policy which, in the world to-day, has only two convinced enemies, one, the barbarian Government which has just invaded Finland and, two, the barbarian Government of Berlin, which remains one of the two surviving apostles of the doctrine of self-sufficiency in Europe, or, for that matter, in the world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Italy is very rapidly coming round to the view that economic co-operation with France, Great Britain and all the other liberty-loving countries of Europe, is good politics, and I thank God that the difference between Italy and Germany is becoming wider and wider with the passage of every day.</P>

      <P>The Deputy and the Minister must confine their remarks to a tax on sugar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite so, but surely you will allow me to answer his interruption? The Minister sought to identify Italy with the international outlook of Russia and Germany.  Such an identification cannot be made.  I will depart from that, and I should like to say that our policy, described by the Prime Minister as the law of the jungle, is the policy adopted by every enlightened statesman in the world to-day as an essential pre-requisite of effectively protecting the poor and defenceless against exploitation, not only by foreigners, but by those who would exploit them at home.  The policy of the Government, I submit, is to permit every vested interest&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must deal with the sugar tax.  This is not the occasion for replying to speeches made on the Second Stage by the Taoiseach or any other Minister. The Deputy must apply himself to sugar, which is the subject-matter of Section 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that the policy of the Government is to permit the exploitation of the poor by any vested interest that is powerful enough to bring pressure to bear upon them.  Not content with bowing before the vested <Col N="753" /> interests which they themselves created in the industrial sphere, they are now concerned to create vested interests among the agricultural population. They want to create vested interests among the beet growers, among the wheat growers, among the peat collectors and among the industrial alcohol suppliers.  This proposal to increase the tax on sugar by 3/4d. and at the same time to impose an additional 3/4d. upon it is a proposal which, in my submission, sacrifices the poor of this country, first of all, to a vested interest which the Government are deliberately creating in the cultivation of the beet crop.  They are, in the second place, sacrificing the poor in order to extract from them money, in the shape of this tax, in order to subsidise the industrial alcohol factories and other hopelessly uneconomic and rotten schemes, the continuation of which could only be justified by the necessity to appease the voracity of vested interests, for the creation of many of which the Minister and his colleagues are responsible.  I challenge the Minister to answer this question now&mdash;he has avoided the question time and again&mdash;if you have charged upon your Budget several uneconomic and undesirable experimental schemes, such as the industrial alcohol experiments?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the taxation on sugar a proper subject for discussion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy discussed that on the Second Stage, which was quite proper.  He should now confine the discussion to the point as to whether the tax on sugar is fair or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want the Minister to take the tax off sugar, and only off sugar.  He is using the money that he is receiving under this section of the Finance Bill&mdash;this money and only this money&mdash;for the purpose of financing rotten schemes.  I suggest you should delete the section and delete the <Col N="754" /> scheme.  There is no use in my saying to the Minister.  &ldquo;Abandon this taxation&rdquo; if I do not make a proposal to him that will fill the gap that my request to abandon the taxation will create.  I am attacking this particular tax, this particular item of revenue.  I say that you should abandon this item and give back to the poor the 3/4d. you are taking from them.  You can arrange for that surrender of the money to the poor by abandoning the schemes which you propose to finance out of that money.  I am asking the Minister for Finance is he prepared to get up here to-day and say, &ldquo;I am going to take 6d. per quarter-stone of sugar from the poor of this country in order to keep the industrial alcohol scheme in existence&rdquo;.  I am saying to the Minister: &ldquo;If you will get up and say that you are going to ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce to close down that scheme and that, at the same time, you are going to give back to the poor the money that was sought to provide for that scheme&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, Sir, I am entitled to argue that he should not put this 3/4d. on sugar.  Of course, the Minister will get up here and say: &ldquo;Deputy Dillon asks me to abandon the 3/4d. on sugar, but where am I to find the money?&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite appreciate the Chair's position, but I want to point out that this jibe has been thrown at us a thousand times: that we divide and divide and argue on the Finance Bills but never tell the Minister where he is to get the money, and that all we want to do is to take his revenue from him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, Sir.  I make the case and I urgently second the suggestion made by Deputy Mulcahy, that this tax should be abandoned.  I am convinced that there is no more uncomfortable man in this House than the Minister for Finance in respect of this.  I think he knows how wrong, how rotten, and how indefensible it is. I often wonder will the day ever dawn in which the Minister and his colleagues will have the courage to do the right thing, and that is to get up quite frankly and say: &ldquo;Look here.  We admit that we have made very grave mistakes and stumbled into very deep water and into very great difficulties, out of which we are unable to get.  We want everybody's help, by way of counsel and advice, as to how to get out of these difficulties, and we are prepared to accept that help.&rdquo;  If he is prepared to say that, I believe that wholly unjust and wicked impositions of this kind will disappear and that the difficulties confronting us will be surmounted without resort to expedients of this kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy asked me why we insist on this extra taxation on sugar and why we would not put back all this taxation to the end of the year.  Well, my idea of financial&mdash;may I use the word?&mdash;rectitude is that when a time like the present, a time of emergency, arises, when we find our revenue falling fast, and when we know, after investigating the matter to the fullest, that we are not going to receive a considerable amount of the revenue budgeted for to the end of the financial year, we ought to take whatever measures are necessary and whatever measures it is possible to take in order to try to meet that situation.  I said on the last occasion, and I repeat it, that the financial credit of this country is good. <Col N="756" /> It was kept high by the last Government. I said that several times here during these discussions on this financial measure, and I repeat it, and I, as Minister having responsibility in this matter and having the backing of the Government for my view in the matter, would like to keep that credit as high as it has been maintained, and in that interest I think it would be entirely wrong to carry on to the end of the financial year knowing that we were going to be faced with such&mdash;to us, as we are in our condition and with our small finances&mdash;an alarmingly large deficit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the tax on sugar, it is unquestionably hard on the poor.  We have heard a good deal of that all through these debates&mdash;the poor, the poor, the poor.  I do not believe that there is anyone on the Opposition side who thinks more often of the poor than we do; I am not saying that one of them thinks less. Probably what the Opposition Party and this Party say and think on that matter applies also to every other Party.  There is no difference between us as to that.  Everybody here would like to avoid that tax on the poor.  I know Deputy Dillon long enough and I know Deputy Cosgrave long enough; they are both Dublin men like myself. They know Dublin City and they know the hardships of the poor and the makeshifts that the poor have to contrive to live; and that tax on sugar is admittedly severe.  But the money had to be found and the poor had to be taxed as well as everybody else.  The Government were not seeking popularity when they taxed the poor.  We are told to do the courageous thing. I would say that any political Party or any Government that stands over <Col N="757" /> measures of that kind which they think necessary are taking their political courage and their political fate in their hands.  I do not think anyone can deny that.  It is a courageous thing to do.  Other Governments have done it.  The last Government did it; they taxed sugar more heavily than we are taxing it now.</P>

      <P>We should discuss the taxation.  The tax on sugar imposed by the last Government was higher during those years.  I certainly agree that it was to get over a time of emergency.  Is not that admitted? That money was necessary; I am not denying that at all.  The fact is that part of that tax was taken over from the British, just as part of the tax we are imposing was taken over. There is no denying that fact.  As I say it was 1/4d. per lb. higher during those three years.</P>

      <P>What was done with that money is a matter that can be discussed another time; the Chair would not allow us to develop it now. What that revenue from sugar was used for is a different matter altogether. The Deputy challenged us to take our courage in our hands and drop certain other schemes.  There is no want of courage on this side.  I do not think there is any want of courage on the other side either.  If we had to change our policy, I certainly would come to the Dáil and go to my constituency and to the country and would not hesitate to tell the country and the Dáil what I felt if I were convinced that the policy was not the best one for the country.  I think the Deputy will admit that my career in politics for many years, such as it was, was a bitter uphill fight against terrific odds.  We were in a very small minority, of which Deputy Cosgrave was one, for many years.  We were battered and beaten and kicked and bruised, spiritually as well as physically, when we were fighting our uphill battle.  When we differed with those <Col N="759" /> who are now in the Opposition, we were again in a very small minority for a time and got hammered and beaten and kicked again.  We did not lack the moral courage anyhow to stand up for what we believed to be true, and what was true of that time is equally true now.  There will be no want of courage.  I have not seen any argument produced by those on the Opposition side against the main policy, in which sugar is involved to some extent, to induce us to change that.</P>

On the Second Reading Stage of the Budget he told us that there were so many things involved, in putting an additional tax of 6d., 1/- or 1/6d. on income tax, that it would not be worth doing so.  He seemed to suggest to the House and to the country&mdash; and the people in the country are just as intelligent as anyone in this House, including the Minister&mdash;that on account of the mess that was likely to occur, from the accountancy point of view, he could not justify at this period an increase in the income tax of 6d., 1/- or 1/6d in the £.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>My experience in the country is that a considerable number of workmen have had to give up smoking altogether.  They cannot afford it and it is a classic fact that, in regard to certain commodities, if you raise taxation beyond a certain point, the fall in consumption resulting from the people abandoning the use of that commodity <Col N="763" /> brings about a fall in the yield. So far as essentials are concerned, people will go on buying them rather than starve but, so far as tobacco is concerned, a very considerable number of countrymen and agricultural labourers&mdash;in the neighbourhood of Ballaghaderreen in any case, and I speak as a retailer of tobacco who knows what he is talking about&mdash;have simply had to give up tobacco because they could not afford to pay for it. Certainly, between now and the introduction of the Budget next year, the Minister would be well advised to invite the Revenue Commissioners to keep a close eye on the consumption of tobacco, bearing in mind that any forestalling of the tobacco tax may induce the commissioners to advise the Miniister that the yield between the date of the imposition of this tax and the end of the financial year has been injured in that way.  I invite him to tell the Revenue Commissioners to inquire further and more closely into that matter and satisfy themselves as to whether or not the yield has fallen because the people have given up smoking. If that be true, not only on humane grounds but on cold, economic grounds, the tax on tobacco should be reviewed and let the countryman enjoy his pipe again while contributing to the revenue at the same time.</P>

    <P>In a previous discussion on the Finance Bill I raised the matter referred to in this amendment and the Minister, as far as I can remember, at the end of the discussion gave an assurance that he would give sympathetic consideration to any case or cases covered by this amendment that were likely to be put before him.  If I am correctly informed, the Minister should have received representations from a number of the small breweries concerned, and I dare say they have given him a fairly detailed explanation of their financial position and of the consequences of the further imposition of this new tax upon their future.  I have been very reliably informed by some of the people affected in my constituency that the imposition of this additional tax is likely to have very serious consequences for the future of the firms concerned, and I hope the Minister will accept this amendment.  I should like <Col N="767" /> to be corrected if I am wrong when I say that I assume that the cost of accepting this amendment would not exceed £20,000 a year.</P>

I appeal to the Minister to give the subject of this amendment his very sympathetic consideration.  I have received a number of communications in connection with the subject matter of this amendment.  I received one communication from one of the few live Fianna Fáil clubs in my own constituency. I dare say the Minister himself would also, as Minister for Finance, have received the same communication containing a resolution recently passed by that body.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; the branch of the Fianna Fáil Cumann passed this resolution:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Some months ago, members of this Cumann asked the Government to reduce the taxation on beer by 50 per cent., as same would be better for agriculture and would provide more employment.  Seeing that the Government could not find it possible to do so as we requested we now ask them to remove the present tax, as we were previously bound to lose our most important local industry, which loss would create great unemployment among local workers.  This newly-imposed tax is likely to kill outright the malting industry.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That comes from a body of supporters of the Minister who know more about this particular case and the consequences to the workers in the industry than I do.  I have reason, however, to <Col N="768" /> know something about the industry dealt with in this resolution, as I was one of a number of Deputies&mdash;with Deputy O'Higgins, and I think Deputy Gorry&mdash;on a local deputation which met the directors of Messrs.  Guinness, and Company some time ago.  It was then proposed, as a result of certain action by Messrs.  Guinness, to close down this industry.</P>
    <P>The people associated with the passing of this resolution know more than I do about the recent history of the firm and they are entitled to know more about the consequences of this new tax&mdash;if it is insisted upon&mdash;upon the future of that industry.  I would appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment and to realise that the cost of accepting this amendment will be much less in the future if he agrees to give this relief than the other cost which would be passed on to the State through the throwing of large numbers of workers out of useful employment in the industries immediately concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to support this amendment, and in doing so would like to call the Minister's attention to the fact that in the City of Kilkenny in my constituency the brewery there is about the only industry that provides good employment the whole year round.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>It is doing very well, but great uneasiness has been created through this announcement of additional taxation.  While I am not informed by the men themselves, I am told that at least 16 men are already under notice.  If it has that effect already, I venture to say that quite a large number of men may expect to see the other side of the gate in a few months' time.  This is a time of the year when a provincial brewery like the one I am referring to experiences the most dull season of the year&mdash;from now until next May.  They are very good employers, who try to meet the men in every possible way over the dull period of the year; but there is no doubt at all that this extra taxation is going very adversely to affect employment there. <Col N="769" /> Already, I regret to say, there are about 400 unemployed men in the City of Kilkenny.  It is a dreadful state of affairs to have so many unemployed practically half the year in a small city like Kilkenny, and it would be more dreadful still to add possibly another 25 or more.  I hope it will not be more, but at the moment I am told that about 16 are under notice, and it is evident that when this tax is imposed this number will be almost doubled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support this amendment.  The Minister in his Budget speech referred to the fact that the figures supplied to him by his officials were such as to convince him that beer and tobacco were two things which possibly could carry increased taxation.  That may be so, or it may not; but, in regard to the breweries, I should like to remind the Minister that the figures given recently regarding the trade of these small breweries were given at a time and in a year when things were very favourable to the brewing industry.  For instance, the season this year was very favourable; the weather conditions prevailing in the months of May and June were such that, in the brewing industry, sales rose in quantity.  That was due, to a very large extent, to the favourable weather conditions prevailing during those months.  There is no guarantee that we will have the same weather prevailing next year.  Whilst this brewing industry, according to the Minister's statement, may be able to bear this additional burden, I might remind him of the old saying that &ldquo;it is the last straw which breaks the camel's back&rdquo;. This may be, indeed, the last straw, so far as some breweries are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may not be aware of the fact that there exists a loyalty between the owners of the small breweries and their men&mdash;a loyalty which, I am glad to say, has existed for a long time.  There is a great feeling of comradeship between employers and employees.  The heads of the largest brewing firms&mdash;even Messrs. Guinness&mdash;and of the small breweries are men who like to keep their servants, particularly their old servants, in employment.  They are not of <Col N="770" /> the type who dismiss them when they come to a certain age.  I am personally not aware of the effect yet, but it may be that these men would take it into their heads&mdash;when this increased taxation is imposed&mdash;that there is very little recompense coming to them for the way in which they carried on their business under adverse conditions, and it may so happen that, as a result of this extra taxation of 12/- per standard barrel, these people may dismiss some of their employees.  That would be a grave calamity at the present time and one of those things which the Minister himself would not wish to happen. From my personal knowledge, I can assure the Minister that there is just that danger.</P>
    <P>Again, I would say that the amount derived as a result of this increased taxation is likely to be such as not to make very much difference to the Exchequer.  I am not going into the whole question of finance, but this I say: I am not convinced that this extra money required by the Minister&mdash;and which has to be raised by means of taxes&mdash;is of such importance that it could not be postponed, at least in this particular case, for some time.  As far as I can see, most of that money is going, not to make up, as the Minister states, for loss of revenue, but to extend certain services in certain directions.  There would be something to be said for the Minister's contention were it true, but I am not convinced of that at the moment, as I believe that a good deal of this £1,600,000 is being used for the Army and the auxiliary force of the Gárda Síochána.  I do not know whether that is true or not, but I see that we are making certain preparations in order, as the Taoiseach has assured us, to assure our neutrality.  If, to assure our neutrality, it is necessary to endanger such industries as the brewing industry, then I think the Minister is embarking on a very dangerous course.</P>
    <P>The amendment set down here by Deputy Davin, whereby it is asked that the first 5,000 barrels of beer brewed in a particular year should not be subject to this tax, would meet the case, especially in regard to the smaller brewers.  Of course, the Minister <Col N="771" /> would argue that that would also be favourable to larger ones.  Even if it were, it is a big industry and one that gives very much employment. What I am afraid of is that something may happen as a result of this additional burden or burdens in regard to the numbers employed in the small breweries.</P>
    <P>Leaving out breweries altogether, the Minister must be aware that there is a very considerable section of workers who look upon the pint of beer or stout as an essential article of food. Certain people would not believe that, but it is a fact.  There are men engaged in very hard work at the docks and in the building trades, who attach very much importance, in so far as their sustenance is concerned, to a pint of porter or beer.  Everyone knows that the increased cost of that commodity now is going to fall very heavily on that particular section.  That is another reason which could be adduced in support of this amendment.  Realising that this matter has been discussed at great length, I appeal to the Minister to go a certain distance to meet this amendment, and thereby prevent the very probable result of people being disemployed by reason of this extra taxation of 12/- per standard barrel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support this amendment, and I consider that it was moved in a very moderate tone, without any attempt at exaggeration. I think that, in itself, is proof of the strength of the case and the gravity of the situation that prompted the amendment. I am not quarrelling, and would not attempt to quarrel, with the right of financial advisers in difficult times to suggest the procuring of revenue in any direction in which revenue may be procured. That is their job, and it is not their job to consider the possible human reactions after that revenue has been collected.  It is, however, the function of Parliament to consider what the reactions may be, and the final court of appeal is the Minister when he sizes up the amount of revenue he may have to forego by a remission of a proportion of a tax as against the tragedy which may result.  Deputy Davin referred to <Col N="772" /> the fact that in this connection a very big firm was up against the same situation some six months ago, facing the stark tragedy that would result from the closing of their maltings in one Irish town.  That firm did not accept the case put up by a mixed deputation, but they did accept this much, that a <i>prime facie</i> case had been made out and they sent their own representative down to that town.  He lived in that town for two or three days; and, having satisfied themselves that the case was a true case, and that the whole town was living on that particular business, that there was no alternative employment to make good the loss of employment if this place closed down, that firm decided, in view of the appalling situation that would otherwise result, to keep the premises open for a further 12 months, and if and when the time came when they had to close down, to put a considerable lump of their own money in to be administered by a committee for the purpose of breaking the fall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two towns for which Deputy Davin speaks in a peculiarly representative way, the two towns in his county and mine, are towns which have no other type of industry, good, bad or indifferent. One of them had, but it went many years ago, and both of them grew up around the local maltings in one case and the maltings and brewery in the other.  The trade of the town indirectly comes from the brewery and the maltings, in one and the other case. Practically the whole working population depends, directly or indirectly, on that industry.  One of the towns, Mountmellick, is practically under sentence of death at the moment, and the only possible reprieve is a reduction in the duty.  At the moment we are not in a position even to advocate a reduction in the duty; we can only advocate that a new duty will not be imposed.  The other industry, the brewery in Rathdowney, has been carried on as a very useful and leading county institution.  It has been trading throughout the county and it has suffered the knocks which most firms have suffered through the outbreak of war.  The cost of raw materials has gone up very considerably and the cost of transport and distribution has gone <Col N="773" /> up considerably also.  I happened to be in that town last Sunday evening. I was talking to responsible people who have no direct financial interest in the concern as wage earners, salary earners or shareholders, but they are terribly disturbed as to what the position will be unless some particular effort is made to keep the industry going.  They are all agreed on this, that the business is not in such a flourishing condition, with all the indirect penalties and taxes which business has to pay as a result of the outbreak of war, as to be able to stagger along under a new direct tax.</P>
    <P>I do not, and would not presume to argue with the Minister what the loss of revenue would be if this concession to small breweries were made, but I suggest that this tax in its application to the smaller breweries may lead to an increased revenue of £x in one direction and increased expenditure of £x in another.  If the industry closes down in either of the towns I have in mind, those towns will be in the same position as&mdash;a sight which, I am sure, the Minister often witnessed with regret&mdash;a Welsh colliery town where the mine has closed down and where even the people who were prosperous and the leading people in the town have no visible means of existence.  I do not want, and I very seldom expect, statements made by a Deputy in an Assembly such as this to be accepted without reservation by people sitting opposite.  The Minister has more sources of information at his disposal than I have.  He has more sources of information with regard to the human side and the probable results even than I have.  I ask him, before turning this amendment down, at least to take the same steps as the firm I indicated took, that is, that he does not reject it flatly, but checks up to see whether the case made by the movers of the amendment and supported by myself is a correct case.  I am certain of this much with regard to the Minister and his Department, that if they can afford to take their time to satisfy themselves as to the truth of the case being made&mdash;that there is real danger of fairly general destitution in a town which used to be <Col N="774" /> prosperous, he will meet the application made in this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment.  I look upon the general policy in these islands with regard to this industry for the last 30 years as one of jumping to the place where revenue can be found with an utter dis regard for the application of the test that should be applied to all taxation. That policy has been to seek revenue there because it could be got there, with a complete ignoring of the results of that policy.  I have spoken on this matter before both on this tax and the tax on the sister industry.  In my opinion, it is fatal.  Apply to this tax any of the fundamental tests that should be applied to all taxation&mdash;does the tax you impose tend to increase and to distribute wealth&mdash;and it is wrong.  What has happened over the last 30 years with regard to this industry? Ministers, seeking money, pile on taxes because it is a handy way of getting revenue.  I do not know how many times since these financial proposals were introduced the Minister has told the House about emergencies.  Emergencies are serious enough in their way, but there is no use taking a step in an emergency that is likely to lead to destitution.  No tax should be imposed unless it is going to increase the wealth of the country or is likely to result in wealth being distributed among a larger number of citizens in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three matters which have to be considered in connection with this industry.  Firstly, we have to consider the workers within the breweries. There is no use in our blindly imposing tax after tax and burden after burden upon this industry until ultimately we have crushed it altogether out of existence and have displaced the workers who find employment in it. That simply means that those who are working elsewhere must provide money to maintain the people who have been driven out of employment in this industry. Again, the employment afforded by this industry is not confined to the breweries themselves.  We hear a good deal of talk in this House about the necessity for extending our tillage. <Col N="775" /> Here is an industry that is immediately concerned with the extension of tillage and which is connected with a branch of tillage that is indigenous to this country&mdash;the production of barley. Again, in centres where these breweries and distilleries are situated, you have an ample supply of by-products which can be utilised for the feeding of live stock.  Yesterday we were dealing with the Bill to promote the production of pigs.  What will be the result of this tax on that industry and on the production of other live stock?  Will it not further restrict the feeding stuffs available in these districts?</P>
    <P>Finally there is another consideration. Nobody will assert I think, that I am a man who is concerned about the value of drink as a food.  I have never taken a pint of beer or stout in my life but I do not believe in being an extremist either in this or any other instance.  Deputy Coburn, Deputy Davin and Deputy O'Higgins have spoken about the value of drink as a food, particularly beer and stout in the case of working men, but there is so much more than that to be considered. The man who is doing the heaviest work in the community wants beer or stout, not as a food but he wants it because he has been stuck in a horrible atmosphere while engaged at his work. He wants something to slake his thirst. A teetotaller may say: &ldquo;Why cannot he go to the water tap and get a drink of water?&rdquo; Think of the poor man who is stuck in the hold of a ship from early morning until late at night or take a man who is engaged on the first shift from early morning until lunch time.  Picture a poor man coming out of the hold of a ship after several hours laborious work in a foul atmosphere. If that man thinks that it is necessary to have a pint of stout or beer why should a teetotaller seek to deprive him of that?  In my opinion, that would be cruelty.  I am a teetotaller and always have been but I say that we have no right to prevent these men from refreshing themselves in any way they like.  I say that no Finance Minister should make it almost impossible for these poor men who are engaged in the most laborious work that could be performed to take a pint of <Col N="776" /> beer or stout after their work is finished.  There is no use in our entering this House and putting gas masks on ourselves as if we had forgotten all that happens outside.</P>
    <P>Another fact to remember in connection with this tax is that we are simply copying what has been done in England.  I do not mind copying a good example if it is applicable to conditions in this country but this is a case in which England's example is not applicable in this country.  There is no comparison between conditions in England and in this country at present, because in England the workmen have got increased wages.  They are mostly engaged in the production of commodities for war purposes and their wages have been substantially increased. There is no analogy, therefore, between conditions in England and conditions here at the moment.  Workmen here have not got a single shilling of an increase as a result of the war.  In fact the Minister said that they should not get it, that no section of the community should profit at the expense of other sections.  Just consider for a moment how the increased taxes affect poor workmen.  His ounce of tobacco costs 11½d.  I do not know what is the price of a pint of beer as I do not go into public houses, but it must be substantially increased as a result of this tax.  Imagine then the feelings of these men who are performing the heaviest type of work that has to be performed in any community.  It is a type of work that almost crushes the life out of them.  I refer to men who are engaged in the holds of ships unloading coal and other goods.  I do not know whether the Minister has ever had any intimate connection at any period of his life with work of that kind, but I wish to goodness that he had some short experience of it.  I am sure that he would not, after that experience, be so ready to impose a tax of this kind unless there was ample compensation for it, that is to say, that increased wealth was produced and that portion of that wealth would go back to these men.  Nothing of that kind is hoped for as a result of this Budget.</P>
    <P>This is a very modest amendment in my opinion, not that it will give any <Col N="777" /> serious financial relief to this industry at all.  It will, however, convey the idea to those engaged in it that, while we wish them to contribute something to the State in this emergency, the House has no desire to crush the industry finally.  Very probably somebody will attack me for making a speech of this kind, but I do not give a snap of my fingers about them.  This House, and this country, must have its foundations set in truth, justice and fair play, and if this State does not stand for truth, justice and fair play, then the sooner it disappears, and the sooner that I disappear from public life, the better.</P>
    <P>I appealed to the Minister before on behalf of this industry.  While I say that, I want to make it perfectly clear that I have no personal interest in the industry.  I have not as much as a penny in it.  Assuming that I was the Minister responsible for this Budget, then before imposing this tax, or any other tax, I would ask myself this question: In putting forward this imposition am I going to increase the wealth of the country and to distribute that wealth amongst the workers and citizens of this State?  If we judge this tax by that standard, then I say very definitely that we are not doing that here.  This industry, which is situated at various centres throughout the country, is being asked to bear not merely a burden but an impossible burden.  Year after year, during the last 30 years, that burden has been increased both by the British Government and our own Government.  The result is that we are crushing it out of existence.  Very often that is done at the behest of a few faddists in the country.  I am not concerned as to who they are, and I do not give a snap of my fingers.  If a thing is unjust, and is going to do national injury, then it ought not to be done.  I do not want to see anybody abuse themselves with drink.  No one would think of defending abuse, but I am going to defend its use.  We should put a stop to all this. Surely something else could be found, if more money is needed, and if something else cannot be found, then it is time that this House set about trimming <Col N="778" /> its cloth.  We have been cutting at and taxing out of existence one thing after another.  If that policy is persisted in, then we shall ultimately arrive at the position in which the sources of the production of wealth in this country will have dried up.</P>
    <P>What then is going to happen?  Is the attitude to all this to be, &ldquo;Get what you can to-day, and to Hong Kong with to-morrow?&rdquo; Is it in that reckless spirit the House is going to heap impossible burdens on industry?  The whole tendency and atmosphere in this young State would appear to be, &ldquo;Provide for to-day's trouble and forget about to-morrow's,&rdquo; but remember that somebody must face to-morrow.  The House should not forget that it is the poor who will ultimately suffer in all this.  I regard this as a very moderate amendment.  It is some years now since I last spoke on this industry in the Dáil.  I make no apology whatever for speaking to-day.  I say that the man down in the hold of a boat, working throughout the day in a choking atmosphere, ought to be able to get his pint of beer at a price that is in keeping with the wage he earns.  Under this Budget we are imposing a new tax on him, while at the same time we are not giving him any compensation by way of an increased wage.  I say that the tax in those circumstances is unjust, emergency or no emergency.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to grant Deputy Davin the small relief that he is seeking in his amendment.  What I have said about this industry also applies to the sister industry&mdash;the manufacture of spirits.  Both, as I have said, have been subjected to burden after burden both by the British Government and our own Government over the last 30 years.  The result will be that these industries will be crushed out of existence.  We are doing that because extremists ask the public to boycott and strafe them.  The reason they advance for that is that individuals have done injury to themselves by abusing the products of those industries. We all know that people have abused liberty since the very beginning of time, and I suppose they will continue to do that to the end.  Why should we take one extreme class of <Col N="779" /> case as governing all?  I understand that if this imposition is persisted in it will mean the extinction of a number of small breweries.  If that should happen it will be a bad thing for the industries themselves, the workers employed in them, and, further, it will have its effect on the prosperity of the community and on the production of wealth in the country.  I hope the Minister will see his way to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the amendment.  I think that very good reasons were advanced for its acceptance by Deputy Davin, in moving it, as well as by Deputy O'Higgins and others.  All of them pointed to this danger: that if the amendment is not accepted an important industry will run the risk of being extinguished.  I share the views expressed by those Deputies that the imposition of this tax will have a very detrimental effect on the industry.  I believe, and have believed for years, that we have probably reached the limit of taxation so far as this particular industry is concerned. It is problematical, to my mind, whether there is very much more in the way of taxation to be got out of the industry.  In a war situation the Minister might possibly be able to get more out of it, but in present circumstances the Minister is endangering the continuance of the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McMenamin, or any other member of the House who gets up and speaks as he did, runs the risk of being severely criticised by certain interests, but we all know quite well that any imposition which the Minister may put on drink is not going to end drunkenness in the country.  If we thought that it would we would support it, but we know that any tax the Minister may impose on the industry is not going to have any effect.  It is not going to cure the hardened drunkard.  The people who are going to suffer most by this taxation are those who should be the first to be spared the infliction.  The first who have to economise in drink will be those who have been ordered it for medical reasons.  We know that many <Col N="780" /> a delicate woman is ordered by her doctor to take a bottle or two of stout daily because of the state of her health. You have men in certain employments to whom drink is almost a necessity because of the nature of the work they are engaged on.  A tax of this kind will be a hardship on a delicate woman with a family who, because of the state of her health, has been ordered by her doctor to take a bottle of stout.  Every doctor in the House knows that for certain forms of delicacy stout is recommended by members of the medical profession.  For these reasons, I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.  As Deputy Davin has pointed out, its acceptance may mean saving certain industries named by him and by Deputy O'Higgins.  Its acceptance, too, would be a small help as a concession in the matter of the general imposition of taxation.  If the Minister is not going to be induced to drop the tax altogether&mdash;and I have very little hope of that from the smile I see on his face&mdash;I do hope he will accept this very moderate amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am really sorry that I cannot accept that amendment. I would very much like to do so.  I do not think that the tax we propose is going to affect, to any extent, the consumption of beer.  The brewers, of course, pass the tax on to the consumers. With regard to what has been said as to the reduced consumption from 1930 to 1939, in the case of the beer brewed by the small brewers, I must say that there has not been much change in the sale of beer even by the small brewers all over the country. The number of standard barrels sold by the small brewers has gone up and down slightly in that period, but there has not been very much of a change. I do not think any great change will come as a result of the tax now proposed <Col N="781" /> to be added.  No Minister for Finance wants to kill the goose that lays the golden egg.  That would be a foolish policy.  No Minister in imposing taxes does so without serious consideration as to what the results are likely to be.  What applies to tobacco applies equally to sugar, beer and every other commodity that is taxed.  I got from Mountmellick the resolution to which Deputy Davin referred.  I also got one letter from the director of a small brewery and I got a resolution from the Association of Brewers.  These people promised to give me the particulars in detail as to their case, but these were never received by me.  I was certainly impressed by the remarks made by Deputies Davin and O'Higgins.  I would not like at all to imagine that I was going to be responsible for crushing out of existence these small industries, as I realise that they do mean something in the towns concerned.  The same applies to the breweries that exist in other towns all over the country.  I am not going to go into the question of the taxation of beer in general nor into the question of beer consumption.  I am not going to follow Deputy McMenamin along that line.  I know that the consumption of beer and spirits has gone down very rapidly.  The customs of the people have changed very much in my lifetime and especially so in the latter half of my lifetime; they have changed for the better.  In proposing this taxation I want to say that I am not out in any way as a social reformer.  It is not with any radical views of bringing about social reform that I am imposing this taxation.  I am imposing it because I have to get the money.  The amendment that Deputy Davin asks me to accept would very seriously upset the calculation made to bring us to the end of the financial year.</P>

I again say that I am very much impressed by the case made by Deputies Davin, Pattison, O'Higgins and others.  I am very much impressed by the case made by the small brewers.  I want to say this, that within six months the next Budget will be introduced.  In the meantime, I will have this matter very fully and seriously examined.  If I see a way out I will take it.</P>

      <P>I was asked some months ago to arrange for a deputation from the Brewers' Association to meet the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, now the Minister for Supplies. That Minister very kindly agreed to receive the deputation.  I did not accompany them because I have refrained in this House from going into the financial position of the concerns affected by this amendment.  The position is so serious that the disclosure of the details to a Minister would do more harm than good.  I refrained from going into the matter from their financial point of view.  I believe that the people concerned could make a convincing case and a very convincing case can be made to the Minister with regard to the manner in which the small brewers are affected by this taxation.  I was glad to hear from the Minister himself the undertaking now given that he will in the next few months give most careful consideration to this question.</P>

      <P>I have two amendments on the Order Paper, one under Section 10 and one to the Long Title. I understand from the Ceann Comhairle that he has doubts as to whether they are in order or not.  At any rate, I would like to draw attention to them.  It was arising out of a Parliamentary question put to the Minister yesterday that I tabled amendment No. 3 and the amendment itself explains the point that I wished to make.  Perhaps the Minister would give me some opportunity of ascertaining how he would feel in the matter.</P>

      <P>The amendments proposed by Deputy Doyle would not, I think, bring us much further with regard to the law.  As the matter stands at present, the Revenue Commissioners have powers to deal with any similar situation that may arise. They have full powers, without any reference to the Minister or the Government, to decide the method of disposal.  The normal method of disposal of such matters is by sale and it <Col N="788" /> is the usual method.  It is only when it is, in their view, necessary for the safeguarding of public health or public morals or something of that kind that they decide on the method of destruction, burning.  The law does not rule out the method of disposal of these goods by distribution.  Some safeguards would have to be taken by the Commissioners of course, but, as things stand, they have that power.  I think everybody will bear in mind, the Minister and the Government, too, if they are consulted in any way, the feeling that has been aroused as a result of what has happened recently.  I do not think the same method is likely to be resorted to again.</P>

    <P>Question declared carried.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill do now pass.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion of this Finance Bill has ranged over a great variety of subjects.  Some of the Government spokesmen have brought under review the policy of the Government for the last eight years.  One of the reasons that is urged why additional taxation should be put upon sugar, beer, spirits, tobacco, and income-tax payers is that Government policy has made available for the butter industry in this country a sum of £5,000,000; for wheat, £9.8 millions; for beet, £6.2 millions; and the reservation of the home market for bacon is estimated to be worth £6.1 millions; making in all available for agriculture, according to the Head of the Government, a sum of £27.1 millions over the last eight years, which is very close upon an average of £3,500,000 a year. Presumably, the fact that the previous Government had taken steps to deal with the bacon situation in 1931 had escaped his memory.  However, we are left with this situation: that it is claimed for Government policy that the agricultural industry has been benefited to the extent of £3,500,000 per year, and that they have secured the home market entirely for the farmers.</P>
      <P>In the course of the case that the Prime Minister made in support of the Budget he stated that when the Government came into office they found that there was imported into this country food, clothing, drink and other items totalling £17,500,000.  He led his listeners to believe that all these commodities were capable of being produced in this country, that the policy of the Government had been directed towards that end, and that, in fact, they had succeeded in relieving the country of practically all that £17,500,000.  Again, on looking up the items which comprised that £17,500,000, we find amongst them tea valued at over £2,000,000, as well as hops and other items.  However, as we have said on other occasions, it is just as well not to expose too severely the Government's incapacity for dealing with figures, or in fact with a balance sheet of any sort or kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>However delicate a topic it is, it is so appalling for both the Minister and his Leader that they <Col N="791" /> cannot bear any reference to figures of any sort or kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am wise enough to take on the Minister plus his Prime Minister, plus all his other colleagues, one after the other at any time or in any place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Take on the balance sheet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, on the balance sheet.  It is obvious from these retorts and from the heat displayed by the Minister and the incapacity shown by the Minister that he cannot bear mention of these things.  The home market has been secured by the Minister and his chief.  Let us see what the value of it is.  What is meant by the home market?  In the first place, there is meant the consumption of agricultural products on the farms and the products sold in the markets for consumption in the country.  Perhaps the worst year experienced in the whole period of the depression was the year 1931.  The consumption of agricultural products both on the farms and in the homes of the other people in this country during that year amounted to £30,266,000.  Not until 1937-38 was that sum exceeded, if we except a sum of probably £100,000 in 1936-37.  In 1937-38 the value of the home market to the agricultural industry exceeded that for 1931 by £2,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the sum total of all the advantages, of the £3,500,000 a year which the Government claim they have made available for the agricultural industry over these eight years compared with 1931; in respect of which the farmers got more than they got in 1931.  What did it cost the farmers and the people to provide that money?  Two of the items claimed as being wonderful concessions and of great economic advantage to the farmers are sugar and flour.  We consume very close on 3,000,000 sacks of flour in the year, and it would be a conservative estimate to assess the cost to the people at 13/4 a sack over <Col N="792" /> and above what they have to pay in the English market, viz., £2,000,000 a year.  The cost of the sugar industry is approximately £1,000,000.  In order to give them the home market we taxed the people to the tune of £3,000,000, and then we are told the farmers are better off in 1939 over and above the period 1931, by £2,000,000.  That is the balance sheet from their own returns, and however they may twist or wriggle, or however long the speeches may be, the fact remains that in order to increase the value of the home market, and which was only increased in 1937-38, they taxed the people to the extent of over £3,000,000 and gave the farmers £2,000,000.  It is on the basis of that economic situation that we have presented to us a further series of impositions and taxes, and we are told by the Prime Minister, or by some of his able lieutenants, that that is not taxation at all, that it is merely substitute taxation.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his statement estimated a fall in the yield of taxation and gave certain items which he set out.  The items are customs and excise, inland revenue, hydro-carbon oils, intoxicating liquor, motor cars, sugar, and various other duties.  The excise, which has the least effect, will show a loss from hydro-carbon oils, betting, entertainments, tyres and tubes but that is offset by receipts from spirits and sugar.  As regards inland revenue he said a decrease is probable in income tax, death duties, and corporation profits tax I never believed any of the stories we heard from the Government about being interested in the poor man.  I never believed that they had any interest in anyone but in the retention of power and authority for themselves.  We were told that this is merely substitution.  Is there not a lot of difference between substituting taxes on motor cars, betting or entertainment and upon the sugar that the unfortunate working man is bound to purchase for his family?  It is merely &ldquo;substitution&rdquo;! Is there not a difference between taxes on motor cars, betting and entertainment and all the other items and taxes on beer, spirits and tobacco?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="793" /> The case made in respect of this Bill is that we have benefited agriculture to the extent of £3,500,000 per year, not taking into account the advantages derived from the remission of the annuities, or taking a period of eight years to show that they have got £5,500,000 in agricultural grant reliefs more than they would have got in the eight years previous to the advent of this Government.  One thing they are always very careful about, and that is to compare a certain given number of years with another number.  There is a marked difference between the period of peace in which this Government came into power and that of their predecessor&mdash;a very marked difference. They came into office in a country in which there were ordered conditions, in which a real attempt had been made over a period of years to reconstruct various damaged properties throughout the State, during which taxation had to be imposed in order to deal with that. It was a very different situation into which this Government came, having also the experience of ten years to guide them in respect of administration. Of course they set off like every set of theorists, practically to alter everything they came across in the State, but if they did, they altered it at enormous cost.  They were not long in office when it was found necessary to increase and also to inaugurate a whole series of social services, and the sum total of the social services, over what was expended by their predecessors, does not amount to more than £4,500,000.  But they collected over £7,000,000 more than their predecessors and claimed to have saved £2,000,000 which their predecessors undertook to pay to the British Government, so that there is £4,500,000 there of annual squandermania on the part of the Government, £4,500,000 spent on excessive and costly administration, and it is for that the extra taxation has to be imposed on sugar, beer and tobacco.</P>
    <P>When they say in this House that they want the Opposition to show where the money is going to come from that is but another exhibition of their incompetence.  It is not part of the duty of this House to take out the names of <Col N="794" /> officers in any Department, or to go through each Department as if the members of the House were a county council, in which these matters could be discussed, considered and exposed to the public gaze.  All we are to do is to tot up on the one hand the cost of administration, and, on the other hand, point out the increase that has been made in the personnel of the Civil Service in this State.  I find that the number of civil servants has gone up almost by 5,000 since the change of office, and they are costing something like £750,000 extra over and above what they cost eight or nine years ago. What do we get for that?  They pretend that they have improved agricultural production in this country, that they have got more money for the farmers, and that they have got the home market.  I have exposed that humbug.</P>
    <P>Let us take the other case.  There are three methods for the disposal of our agricultural produce: consumption on the farm, sale on the home market, and export.  There has been a catastrophic fall in the export of agricultural produce, during the last six or seven years.  I gave a correct figure in this House some three or four months ago when dealing with the whole matter of agricultural produce.  In 1931 there was a balance of exports in favour of the agricultural industry of almost £13,500,000.  When I say a balance, I mean taking the gross figures of agricultural exports and I deduct from that any agricultural produce or animals that were imported. The nett figure for that in the year 1931 was £13,425,000.  For the succeeding seven years there was an average drop in that figure of £6,000,000 a year, notwithstanding the fact that the Government made available for the farmers £3,500,000 a year over and above what they had six or seven years ago.  I put it that, in respect of that particular industry, this measure by imposing fresh additional burdens of taxation is unreasonable, unjust, and immoral.  One would expect in connection with an industry such as this, over a long period of years helped as has been claimed, by the Government, that <Col N="795" /> there would have been an increase in the number of persons engaged in the agricultural industry or, at any rate, that whatever would happen there would not be a reduction.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce in his speech at the Chamber of Commerce a short time ago had to deplore the fact that the number of persons engaged in agriculture had decreased by 26,000.  If we are to take the statement of the head of the Government as evidence of belief in the usefulness of the measures taken to improve agriculture, we should expect to find in the first place an increase in the number of live animals, and an extension of tillage.  What are the facts?  In the agricultural statistics for June published by the Department of Agriculture we find that in only two items of tillage was there an increase over the figure for 1938.  In wheat, there was an increase of 27,710 acres and in mangolds an increase of 100 acres.  We find that there is a decrease in the acreage under oats of 36,000, of barley 45,000, of potatoes 11,000, and of turnips 3,000.  On balance, we find that there is a net reduction in the acreage under corn and green crops of 78,400.  Obviously, we are spending money now to a much greater extent than was the case in 1937-8, for which I gave the figure, because flour is £1 a sack over the British price and, with 3,000,000 sacks, that amounts to £3,000,000 per annum.  We can give only an estimate in respect of the cost of sugar production.  That is, probably, £1,000,000 extra, so that the total is £4,000,000.  At a time when all these efforts have been and are being made to increase tillage, there is a net reduction of 78,000 acres.</P>
    <P>What is the position in regard to live stock?  There is a net reduction of 4,000 head of cattle, milch cows, heifers and so forth.  In pigs, there is a reduction of almost 16,000 and in sheep of 162,000.  We have an increase in the case of poultry of 32,000 head. That is the agricultural picture.  That is the real balance sheet of agriculture. It is quite true that all that could have happened if sales had been effected of <Col N="796" /> our agricultural produce and the farmers had the money to credit in the bank as a result of the sales.  But we have had no evidence of that and, if there is evidence, I should be glad to hear it.  So far as stock is concerned, at a time when stock is more needed than ever it was in the history of this country, we are down on the results. This is the period selected by the Government to impose additional taxation which they describe as merely &ldquo;substitute taxation&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made during the course of the discussion on this Bill to the increase which has taken place in the taxation of this country relative to other countries.  I have looked up the estimated income of other countries somewhat comparable with this country.  I find that very few of them have as low an income as this country has.  Take the closest approximation&mdash; Norway.  The reputed income per head there is £51.  The estimate here is, approximately, £50.  In Norway, taxation represents about 20 per cent. of the national income.  Here, according to Deputy Childers, it has been estimate at 21 per cent. of the national income.  If you take these figures in the light of their effect on the individual, you find that taxation on every man in this country is £1 6s. Od. per annum more than it is in Norway&mdash; a small sum to people accustomed to dealing with large sums, but it amounts to 6d. per week on the individual.  An impost of 6d. per week in the case of workers with small incomes or with unstable or irregular employment can be very severe.  Taking a family of five or six paying this extra sum imposed by reason of Government policy and considering the extra cost of flour and these additional imposts on sugar and tobacco, the burden on the individual is more than he can bear.  It is unreasonable and unjust in my view to impose this additional taxation.  That the money can be saved I have no doubt whatsoever.  But the Government will have to make up their minds to work harder than they are working. They should not have such measures as the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act and other costly measures introduced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="797" /> I find, on looking up the revenue receipts for this year, that, so far as we have gone, we have got about £500,000 more than was received last year to the same date.  While we are £500,000 over the figure for last year, I find that the receipts from incometax are £200,000 lower than they were last year although the rate of incometax has been increased.  On these figures, something more than a mere statement that there is likely to be a contraction in revenue should be made. We are told that the costs which have to be met in connection with the war situation, or emergency, are censorship, defence, and one or two other items which escape my memory at the moment.  What is censorship costing? What is the extra cost of defence?  After all, this House is responsible for imposing the taxation. It is at least entitled to know how much costs have been increased under each one of these heads.  We are told that we are buying two torpedo boats. Of what use are two torpedo boats in present circumstances?  Of what use is the mobilisation of 10,000 or 12,000 troops if we have not the most modern equipment in respect of them?  Would it be true to say that the Army we have here would not have lasted as long before the Polish Army as the Polish Army lasted before the German Army?  We would not grudge, and we do not grudge, the expenditure of money which will ensure or increase defence in this country.  My view about the manner it which it has been expended is that it is mostly wasted and that, instead of endeavouring to modernise the Army, to get a particularly efficient unit and to get antiaircraft guns and aircraft, it is being used in mobilising these huge numbers of men, and it would have been better to spend the money in the way I suggest rather than in this mobilisation. However, no matter what the situation is, at least we are entitled to know what the extra cost amounts to.</P>
    <P>In the first place, all this extravagant administration and all these efforts that have been made to improve agriculture have not resulted in bringing more money into the pockets of the agricultural industrialists in this country.  They have not even maintained <Col N="798" /> the numbers of persons who were employed in the agricultural industry.  It is quite true, as the Ministers say, that there was emigration during the office of the last Government. There was.  There was considerable emigration, and they are not absolutely free from responsibility for their own particular activities in connection with it, but one thing has to be noticed in connection with emigration during that period, and that is that it had tapered down until in the last year of the previous Government there was none, whereas under the present Government, during recent years, on a rising population, the people commenced to emigrate and we are now in the position of having perhaps as high a rate of emigration, under self-Government in this country, as anybody ever expected to see in the worst times in this country; and now we have a lower population.  We have, according to the Ministry, a larger number engaged in occupations and a larger number of employed.  Now, it is not by cross-road speeches that you are going to deal with those matters.  It is nonsense to say here that there was a free trade policy in operation previous to the advent of the present Government.  The facts speak for themselves.  There were £2,000,000 collected in tariffs in the last year of the previous Government, and in the published finance accounts for the year before the present year the sum collected in tariffs on goods was £2,500,000.  As I said on another occasion in this House, in order to collect that extra £500,000 the Ministry is spending £200,000 more on the Revenue Commissioners Vote.  I should like to know what businessmen or board of directors would keep managers who were responsible for such an extravagant administration. It is not that there has been no case made for this measure; it is that a case has been made for a reduction in taxation rather than an increase, and in consequence we shall have to vote against this Finance Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to emphasise the very important points made by Deputy Cosgrave, but I appeal to the Minister and the Government to consider very seriously the position of the unemployed, of the widows and orphans, and of the home assistance applicants.  I am saying this in all seriousness, because I have a good indication of the mentality of the unemployed and poor of this country. Expressions of sympathy and love for the poor are not what they want, and I was rather surprised on Wednesday to hear the little hope that was held out in the speech of the Taoiseach when he said that the legislation of this House or the Government enabled the weaker sections of the community to exist.  It is most unfair to think that we should have large masses of the people of this country merely existing. I want to say that all those people are living in despair and without hope for the future, and that is a very serious thing for anybody.  I read a figure published in the Press this morning, which is no real indication of the number of unemployed, but from these figures we find that there are over 55,000 people registering at the labour exchanges without any means and 63,000 others who could be put in the very same category because of the rigid means tests that are applied by the Acts.  I have had good reason to know for some time the attitude of the unemployed and the poor, and the growing feeling of resentment to institutions&mdash; I might as well say it&mdash;such as this, <Col N="800" /> because of the legislation that is passed on their behalf, or supposed to be in their interests, and that has been drafted with regard to these very mean means tests as if these people were a section of the community who were different from everybody else.</P>
      <P>I want to remind the Government also that the position of housing for the poor of this country is appalling.  I have reason to be alarmed sometimes at the number of people who come looking for houses in the City of Cork, people with families of six and nine living in a room, and who have no hope.  I do not mind so much meeting a sad or a distressing case if we could indicate hope for the immediate future, but when masses of people have no hope for the future and are always living in despair, I claim there is no social security in any country. I appeal to the Government to go into the question of the position of the unemployed and the poorer sections of the community immediately, because the meagre allowances that are given for mere existence have been much worsened in the last month or so because of the increased cost of everything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to waste the time of the House, but I want to say in all seriousness that I am afraid no section in this House is considering seriously enough the position and mentality of the poor of this country.  I am quite satisfied to admit that the Minister has as much love and sympathy for the poor as I have.  I admit it, but that is no use to the poor and the unemployed. There is a limit to human endurance, and I want to appeal to the Back Benchers and Front Benchers of all Parties here and tell them that we are not fulfilling our obligations to the poorer sections of the community by simply expressing sympathy and love for them without being prepared to make the necessary changes.  I am not unmindful of the emergency through which the country is passing and with which, very likely, we will be faced in the future, but I do say that we are not doing what is necessary for the weaker sections of the community.  I suggest to the Minister that bold changes are necessary, and even though <Col N="801" /> we may be expected to make sacrifices, it would be no thanks to us to make such sacrifices in order to ensure that these people may be reasonably well off and comfortable.  I am quite satisfied that the Government have their own means of finding out what is the mentality of the people at the moment.  I want to say this in all seriousness, that I do not know if the condition of the poor is not worse at the moment than ever it was, with increasing prices, rents going up, increased cost of living, etc.  I would not expect from the Minister or from the Government replies such as were made to me recently, that, owing to the heavy burdens on the community, they did not think it advisable to do anything in the way of an increase in old age pensions or widows' and orphans' pensions. Surely the Minister might consult the heads of his Department to find out the condition of those unfortunate sections of the community.  I must say it is appalling and, as one representing the City of Cork and having direct knowledge of the poor and of the realities of life, I would appeal to the Government to take immediately into consideration the conditions of the poor and the unemployed throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not like to lose even a five minutes' opportunity of having a parting kick at this most deplorable of all Budgets ever introduced. The Government which comes into this House and presents this before the House is full of anxious concern about the state of the country.  In that mood they asked for our co-operation, but when we look at their actions we can only say that their actions belie the phrases that they used, and give rise to anxiety and disquietude.  If the Government wants co-operation, do they regard those phrases as a fair offer to other Parties in the House, when they have to be read in conjunction with their actions? They say that they want the co-operation of every Party in the House for any scheme of theirs&mdash;no matter how fantastic it may be and no matter how it may show even the worst elements of a policy which has worked <Col N="802" /> a large degree of havoc in the course of the last five or seven years.</P>
      <P>If the Government wants co-operation, there must be give as well as take.  Does the Government believe that all the schemes which they started in the past five years have stood the test of even five years' experience? Are there not some who would even say: &ldquo;We do not entirely discard them, but they are schemes which would only be put into operation during periods of relative and comparative luxury, and, when facing circumstances such as exist, there are certain schemes&mdash;although we would not entirely neglect them or regard them as deserving of criticism&mdash;in regard to which we will remit our intentions in this particularly critical period, and attend to the things which really matter.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There is one other side of the Government's conduct that amazes most people who are able to look upon it. What is the reason for the amazing tenderness which they show towards certain sections of the community? They carry on their schemes because they are wedded to them.  They have done a lot of the things contained in their promises, and probably surfeited with that particular type of diet, they do not want to swallow anything more than what they previously promised. Even keeping the schemes they have in hand, why can they not see that those schemes are economically run?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take one glaring contrast.  In this Budget the sum of £1,500,000 is proposed to be collected on sugar.  I look to other countries which, relatively to this country, are not being made bear as heavy a burden as that in its incidence on the poor; and I find in England and in France there are certain special provisions made with regard to those who are likely to make money out of the war emergency.  In England there is a heavy devastating tax of the old excess profits duty type.  In France the situation exists that men, unless they can make a case and show it over a period of years, will not be allowed to get more than 6 per cent. fixed over the war period.  But the Government have here exposed to them two open and unshamed sets of profiteers&mdash;the <Col N="803" /> millers and the bacon curers&mdash;and they will not move a hand to gather in for the benefit of the community, even if only over the three-years period, the amount these people have taken, and are being allowed to take, during the progress of the war.</P>
    <P>If I may refer to one scheme in particular, I would refer to the beet sugar scheme.  The Minister knows well that, economically, in itself it would have brought about a situation good for this country.  We could have bought sugar and got it much more cheaply, to the extent of £1,400,000 a year&mdash;the difference in the cost of importing sugar and the growing and producing of it here. It was not that there was no necessity to make people go into this particular form of production.  There were other things coming in and entering into the play of economics without any further effort being made by the Government to artificially bolster up the price of beet.  Sugar would have rendered, I think, inevitably, a decrease in acreage, and that acreage could have been better employed and would have given us great relief in that particular item.  But the Government is still wedded to their scheme.  They are still afraid to regard it as another one that should be rejected and discarded.  They must now further distort the ordinary pattern of our economy by higher prices for everything, in order that we consumers will pay still more heavily even in the present straitened circumstances. Will the Minister say to the House and to the country what amount is being spent, and why any money should be spent, on A.R.P.?  What money was set aside?  What money was spent?  What necessity is there to spend any money on such a thing as a &ldquo;black-out&rdquo;?  What is the reason for the coast-watching and what is it amounting to in the way of cost?  What is the emergency we are facing?</P>
    <P>There are two new Departments set up: the Department of Supplies and the Department of Co-ordination of Defence.  There was an old Lord Chancellor in England of whom it was said when he left the Bench that he made appointments of people of tried incompetence. <Col N="804" /> That is the slogan that has apparently drifted into the Government. There is the case of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who set up a Department to get supplies and failed to get them, and we are paying £700,000 for his failure in that one item alone.  He is moved to a new Department. The Minister for Co-ordination of Defensive Measures was not a bright example of efficiency, yet he is put into a back parlour now to carry on what is called the co-ordination of defence. Could there not be some examination even at this late stage of these two extra Departments?  Has the Minister no details as to the cost of the new expenditure?  The Minister now decides that the money has to be got, that people who have fleeced the community in every way in years back should now be permitted to fleece them still further.  Instead of taking something from them&mdash;their shoulders are broad and can bear the burden of extra taxation&mdash;he leaves unfortunates to undergo these burdens and fails to contribute to their alleviation during a critical period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>In the time of emergency we came to this House and asked for the co-operation of all Parties in getting over the difficult period that was likely to ensue.  It is true that we did that, and that we were promised that co-operation.  We got it to some extent, for the first month. First of all, we did not expect, and do not expect, anybody to change their political, economic or financial principles in giving any co-operation to the Government during this period of emergency.  We did not, however, expect that we would be asked to drop our economic principles or our political views.  It does not follow that any Party or any individual of any Party, in times like this when co-operation might be secured to the advantage of the State as a whole, either on one side or the other, should necessarily subordinate either principles or policy. Nothing of the kind was expected and nothing of the kind was asked.  But it is expected, however, before we get the co-operation that was promised, and that was given for a time, that we should drop all our economic policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="805" /> That was Deputy Dillon's statement here, and was more or less the statement of the Deputy who has just sat down, Deputy McGilligan.  Deputy Dillon stated here emphatically that there could be no co-operation until such time as Fianna Fáil dropped its economic programme, until it dropped what he called the fantastic schemes in relation to wheat, beet and peat, and other such measures.  That part of the programme and policy was adopted by us after full debate in the country and here.  The country knew what was put before them.  Deputy Davin said here that the people in the country are just as intelligent as anybody in this House. I agree with him.  Those at the rural firesides in the country are able to size things up, just as well as we are. They may not technically be so skilled, but they are well able to size up a programme and what it means to the country.  They are as well able to do that as anybody in this House.  Over and over again, that policy and the policy of the Opposition was put to the country, with the result we know.  It is not, as Deputy McGilligan says, that we are wedded to any scheme, no matter how fantastic.  We are quite satisfied that the economic scheme which we have put into operation, carried through so far and intend to develop still further, is, in the long run, in the best interests of the country. We are not alone in the world in believing in that scheme of protection, and we have seen, despite the views of Deputy McGilligan and others, that it has offered us a very safe margin of protection during this time of emergency. The protection policy put into operation some years ago when this Government came in has certainly been to our advantage in many respects. There is scarcely time to go into them, but this will not be the last occasion on which we will discuss the pros and cons of the economic policy of Fianna Fáil and that of the Opposition.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan stressed the profits being made by certain people and said that they were allowed to get away with them.  The Deputy knows that they are not allowed to get away with these profits.  Any profits made in this country out of any sort of industry <Col N="806" /> are taxed, and heavily taxed. Some people on the Opposition side said, during the course of the debate, that they were too heavily taxed. Before bringing in the Budget, I examined the prospects of getting more money out of excess profits duty, and I should be very happy to put additional taxation on it, if it would bring us in anything, but I was told on the best advice I could get that it would not be fruitful, that we would get nothing out of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

      <P>Deputy McGilligan also referred to the &ldquo;black-out&rdquo; and to A.R.P.  There was some money spent on these matters&mdash;not very much&mdash;but the Deputy knows that, at the outbreak of this war, nobody in Europe, and least of all those primarily concerned in the war on both sides, knew how it was going to develop.  Everybody expected that there were going to be immediate air raids on all the big cities in both countries&mdash;air raids on Berlin, and bombs dropped broadcast, and similarly in England.  I do not think the British Government denied that they anticipated that.</P>

I could imagine the uproar there would be by the Opposition, and nobody would be more eloquent or more sarcastic than Deputy McGilligan&mdash;and he is well able to use the weapon of sarcasm, as we know&mdash;if anybody happened to be killed by a bomb here, and there was no show of protection of any kind for them.  The Deputy would have a lot to say.  We did not know what way the war was going to develop&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No.  Let us be <Col N="808" /> reasonable in this matter.  We made a start.  Look at England.  Hundreds of thousands of children were taken out of the cities and sent to the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>And they have dropped the &ldquo;black-out&rdquo;, have they?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and, after a few weeks, all those children began to come back again, and they had to open schools in the cities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought it was the &ldquo;black-out&rdquo; the Minister was discussing, and not children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>They have a &ldquo;black-out&rdquo; in England, of course. I want to make this remark, however. There was not a lot of money spent on &ldquo;black-out&rdquo; and A.R.P.  I have got protests from my constituents that this Government has spent nothing on A.R.P.  There is that mentality here. Very little was spent on it, but a beginning was made.  In the rush at the beginning of the war nobody knew what was going to happen and there was money spent, but not a great deal. I am devoting too much time to a small item.  I never heard a better exposition of the cross-road speech than the speech delivered by Deputy Cosgrave. He condemned cross-road speeches and said that they were not the type of thing the country should be presented with at this time, particularly in view of this taxation.  He is as capable a hand at it as anybody I know.  He wears a halo&mdash;his head is getting a little crooked from the weight of it&mdash; and suggests that he is above all that kind of thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was the Minister for Justice who said that Deputy Cosgrave got his halo in 1921.  He was a revolutionary, the same as the rest of us, up to then, but, immediately he became Minister, the rest of us became black sheep, and he was Saint William for the rest of his days.  Anybody who <Col N="809" /> differed from him politically was a black sheep and he had to pull his coat tight around him for fear he should be smeared by association with him.  He was as good a cross-road tub thumper as anybody I ever came across and he has not lost the art yet.  He can be as good a humbug as anybody I know. He talked of exposing the humbug of the home market, and he exposed himself to me, at any rate, as a hopeless economist and a worse financier.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a crushing judgment, coming from you.</P>
