      <P>As the body of His Holiness Pope Pius XI is being laid to rest to-day it is fitting, as an expression of national mourning, that An Dáil should adjourn and I, therefore, move, A Chinn Comhairle, that the House do adjourn until 3 o'clock to-morrow.</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 3.5 p.m. until 3 o'clock on Wednesday, 15th February, 1939.</P>
