      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is he aware that on 15th February, 1939, he is reported in column 436 of the Official Debates as saying that the Prices Commission &ldquo;made a full investigation with regard to the bacon position and published a report on it.  That report was printed and delivered free of charge to Deputies &mdash;to Deputies who are now asking what did the Prices Commission do about bacon last year.  It is not three months since Deputies got that printed report delivered to them through the post&rdquo;? I want to know, if that report was delivered three months ago to certain Deputies to whom the Minister referred, why was it not delivered to all Deputies?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he is aware of the importance of Rushbrooke Docks in Cork Harbour as a factor in any scheme of national defence; that, if this country is to maintain its exports and imports in time of war, it is essential that ships engaged in trade should have a docks of the capacity of Rushbrooke in which repairs could be effected; if he has received a resolution from the <Col N="951" /> Cobh Urban Council recommending the taking over of these docks; and, if so, if he will state if such a proposal is under consideration by his Department, and when a decision on it is likely to be reached.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Land Commission are not yet in a position to state whether proceedings will be taken for the acquisition of the lands of Annaghmore or Monasteraden, in the occupation of Martin and Anne Brennan, which are the subject of inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankJCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister indicate from the information at his disposal whether an inquiry was in fact ever instituted by the Land Commission with a view to the acquisition of those lands and, if so, the approximate date of the inquiry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that there was an inquiry somewhere about December, 1937.  There may have been one prior to that, but if there was I have no knowledge of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankJCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister state definitely that the delay in acquiring <Col N="952" /> those lands has not been due to any dispute or doubt as to title on the part of the owners of those lands?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know there was never any question of title in the matter.  It is simply a question of the Land Commission not being able to reach it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state what is the cause of the delay in sinking a well and erecting a pump for Mr. James Christian, who was allotted a holding of land on the Kennedy estate at Bishopscourt, Straffan, County Kildare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Land Commission were unable to find a suitable contractor to carry out this work, it was decided to sink the well by direct labour.  The necessary equipment for the purpose is on order and it is hoped to begin the work within the course of the next few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that that reply of his is almost indistinguishable from one which he gave in this House about six months ago?  Is it possible that the Land Commission have done nothing whatever in the meantime to carry out the promise which they made to this man about two years ago?  The man himself says he could find a contractor to do the work in a week, but the Land Commission with its entire inspectorial staff cannot get a contractor in two years.  This man was offered this alternative holding in lieu of one which he surrendered, and now he cannot get <Col N="953" /> the Land Commission, a State Department, to fulfil the promise they made him.  The Minister should take more interest in this case, and see that this man is not treated in such a grossly unfair fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not possible to get contractors to do the work, and the Land Commission had decided to do that kind of work themselves where they cannot get suitable contractors. I think the delay in getting the machinery is responsible for holding the matter up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will state the cause of the delay in announcing a decision on the representations which have been made to him to hold an examination confined to postmen, grades &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;B,&rdquo; for the purpose of filling vacancies in the post office clerk grade at Dublin.</P>

      <P>The proposals for the holding of a limited competition confined to postmen, for posts as post office clerk, grade &ldquo;B,&rdquo; in Dublin, have involved a comprehensive review of the system of open and limited recruitment.</P>
      <P>The matter has now reached an advanced stage, but I am not in a position at the moment to say when a decision will be reached.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, is he aware that he stated in this House on 26th October last that it was hoped to reach a decision at an early date?  That is five months ago.  If the term &ldquo;an early date&rdquo; means anything it surely means something within five months, but instead of being able to indicate a date now the Minister seems further away than ever from being able to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it possible for us to be informed when the Offences Against the State Bill, 1939, will be circulated?  I understand the Treason Bill, 1939, will repeal the Treason Bill of 1925, and that some of the effects of the Treason Bill, 1925, not being embodied in the Treason Bill, 1939, will be embodied in the Offences Against the State Bill, 1939.  It would be more convenient for the House if they could see both Bills together and compare their contents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The two Bills are not directly connected.  It is true that some of the offences in the 1925 Act, those directly dealing with treason or offences ancillary to treason are in this Bill, and that some of the offences in the 1925 Act will be incorporated in the other Bill.  The intention is that the two Bills should get through the Final Stages practically together.  This Bill, however, can be taken altogether on its own.  As regards time.  I think there has been some drafting difficulty in regard to the other Bill, but I expect we will have it, probably, early next week.  The intention is that the two Bills will come up for final discussion one after the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The final discussion is less important than discussion on the Second Reading, when the principles of the Bill are under review.  Could the Taoiseach not agree to postpone the Treason Bill until the House could see the Offences Against the State Bill, to see into what category the various offences are being sorted, and to be able to know precisely how much of the Treason Bill of 1925 is being repealed, only for the purpose of being incorporated in the new Offences Against the State Bill?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Taoiseach has learned from other Parties in the House that while that is his view, we feel there are some technical points which can only be properly corrected when the two Bills are before us, and there cannot be any serious objection to postponing discussion of this Bill until the other one is before the House.  I mean to say, that some of the very objectionable points that might present themselves to us in this Bill would fall to the ground, if it would appear that there were provisions in the other Bill to meet the kind of cases we apprehend might, unfortunately, arise in connection with it.  Is there any urgency for this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will make for clarity in the discussion, and will expedite business generally, if we take this Bill separately.  There is no reason that I can see why it should not be taken separately.</P>

      <P>I take it there are certain offences, which can be dealt with under certain sections of the 1925 Act, which could not be dealt with at all except under this Bill, and that certain offences, which are now punishable by a comparatively small sentence, will be only punishable by death when this Bill becomes law.</P>

      <P>Deputies can deal with the Second Reading of this Bill as they would deal with any other Bill. They can find fault with it on the ground of what it does or does not contain.  You might as well say that we have to have a complete code in any particular matter before we discuss a certain Bill.  This Bill can stand <Col N="966" /> by itself; it is complete in itself.  It deals with treason and offences immediately ancillary to treason, and can be dealt with by the House exactly as any other Bill.  Otherwise there would be a question of holding up legislation of various kinds.  Every Deputy on the Second Reading can deal with this Bill in the usual way, with the principle of what is or is not in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Taoiseach finds that it is a question of a request from two Parties to postpone this Bill until we see the other Bill, surely that is not a request that should be turned down in a capricious fashion.  There is no urgency for this Bill, and there is no evidence of the existence of treason.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The moment the Constitution was enacted by the people treason had a new meaning. The Constitution was the foundation of a State and, so far as this <Col N="967" /> part of Ireland, and so far as the State here is concerned, was a recognition of things which the Irish people had been struggling for, the right, as indicated in the First Article, to choose their own form of government, to fix their relations with other States, and to mould their national life in accordance with their own genius and traditions.  In order that there should not be any misunderstanding, Article 39 of the Constitution defined what treason was. To make it clear that treason must no longer be understood in terms of allegiance to foreign Powers, and so as to cut out the possibility of any Act applying among those which we were taking over to form the body of law which was to be our law, when the Constitution was passed, treason was definitely limited.  The Article states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Treason shall consist only in levying war against the State, or assisting any State or person or inciting or conspiring with any person to levy war against the State, or attempting by force of arms or other violent means to overthrow the organs of government established by this Constitution, or taking part or being concerned in or inciting or conspiring with any person to make or to take part or be concerned in any such attempt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once the Constitution was passed, treason was defined as an act of treachery against this State, and nothing else.  Everybody who was here in the Dáil at the time of the discussion realised that and realised that it was appropriate that, when the Irish people had established freely a State in accordance with their wishes, those who tried, by violent means, to overthrow that State should be held here as in other countries, to be guilty of the most terrible crime of a public character which is known in civilised society.  It was appreciated that that was right and that it was just and not a single Deputy on either side, from my recollection, questioned it.  This Constitution then went to the people. It was passed and made law.  What we are doing in this Bill that is before <Col N="968" /> us to-day is making that effective, by prescribing the penalties which will attach to anybody who is guilty of treason against the State.  The penalty here, as in most countries, because of the character of the crime, is the greatest penalty that, in modern times, States can impose on an individual&mdash; the penalty of death.  The penalty of death is prescribed for those who may be convicted and sentenced for treason, treason committed against the State, within the State, or treason committed against the State without.</P>
    <P>If death is to be the penalty for crime at all, death ought to be the penalty for the gravest crime which can be committed against the community. No one, therefore, I believe, who thinks that death should be imposed as a penalty at all, will deny that, in the case of this crime, which might lead to many deaths and which could lead to civil war and could lead to the destruction of the community, nobody who thinks that death is a suitable penalty for murder, should doubt that death is a penalty which should attach to the crime of treason, treason committed against a free community.</P>
    <P>As it is prescribed that the punishment to which a person who commits treason is liable is death, so it is reasonable that the method of indictment, arraignment, trial and sentence should be that which is accorded to a person who is charged with murder. That statement and the two I have made as to the penalties are in connection with Section 1.</P>
    <P>In Section 2 you have the ancillary crimes of encouraging, harbouring, comforting a person guilty of treason. Any person guilty, not of treason but of a crime ancillary to treason, such as encouraging, harbouring, or comforting any person engaged in committing treason shall be guilty of a felony and the penalty to which a person who is found guilty of felony is liable is up to £500 or, at the discretion of the court, penal servitude for a term not exceeding 20 years, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years, or to both such fine and such penal servitude or imprisonment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="969" /> The third section deals with misprision of treason, or concealment, by a person who knows that treason is being attempted or committed and does not disclose it.</P>
    <P>As you see then, the Bill is a simple one.  It is making effective the Article of the Constitution which defines the crime but does not provide the penalties and, as we know, merely to indicate that a certain act is a crime is not sufficient.  Unfortunately, society is not so constituted and human beings are not so constituted that the mere indication by law of a crime is sufficient to prevent its commission. We have, therefore, in this Bill the necessary sequel to the Article of the Constitution, the provision of the penalty.</P>
    <P>Were it not for our past history and the fact that, in the past, treason with which our Irish people were charged was rightly held by Irish people not to be treason, not to be a crime against their own community, there would be no question raised by anybody about a Bill of this sort any more than it would be raised in the United States of America with regard to such a Bill, or raised in France or in any other country.  What we have got to make clear is that we have here now a free community, sovereign, able to mould its own institutions in its own way, that any group or section are at liberty to organise to get a majority to support their point of view, and that that majority, if it is obtained, can be effective in changing, not merely the ordinary law but, ultimately, in changing the Constitution itself.  We are free here to act in our own interests in regard to any matter either in our internal or external affairs.  Search the Constitution from the first Article to the last and every Article makes it clear that the Irish people in this part of Ireland are complete masters of their own fate, to have whatever Government or form of government they want and have whatever relations with other countries that they want and only those that they want, only those that they think are in their own interests.  We have freedom, therefore, and it behoves us to try to keep that freedom and we have to maintain <Col N="970" /> that freedom in the same way that other nations maintain it.</P>
    <P>That Constitution gives liberty to individuals.  That liberty has to be preserved, and it can only be preserved by the organised powers of the State.  If we have not got laws to restrain the wrong-doer, the wrong-doer, by violent action, can interfere with the liberties of his fellows.  We have here a democratic Constitution and a democratic State, and democratic States need to watch with far more care how any body or group, by violent means, should seek to overthrow them.  There can be no democracy and no liberty such as is provided for in that Constitution unless violent methods by groups within the community are prevented, and it is to prevent such violent action by any groups within the community, and to draw the attention of the community as a whole to their liberty and to the obligation which that liberty imposes upon them as citizens, and upon the public authority which they have set up, that we are at this time bringing in this Bill.</P>
    <P>As I have said, it follows from Article 39; it is necessary to complete Article 39 and might have been brought in at any time.  In fact, instructions had been given, shortly after the Constitution, to examine this matter and other related matters with a view to having the necessary legislation ready for introduction at any suitable time, suitable either from the point of view of public business, or from the point of view of any happenings which might indicate that there was a threat of violence, or possible violence, against the State.  That was done when the Constitution was being passed.  It was indicated that a measure like this would be necessary in any case as a piece of ordinary legislation and that other measures might also be necessary for which provision in the Constitution was duly made.  I do not think that anything would be gained at this stage by my saying more upon the Bill.  As the particular Article of the Constitution passed the Dáil without any opposition, I think this Bill also merits a passage without opposition.</P>

      <P>With a great deal that the Taoiseach said, I am in complete and entire agreement.  I do believe that the first duty of the State is to preserve itself, to preserve the lives and properties of its citizens against any persons, be they foreigners or people at home, who endeavour to upset that State or to deprive the citizens of their lives, their liberties or their property.  I am entirely in agreement with the Taoiseach when he puts forward that proposition.  It is the law in every civilised State in the world that when there is a real threat, a real danger, to the State and to the lives of its inhabitants, that the State should punish the persons who bring that threat, or take away those lives, with the greatest penalty known to the law. I agree, therefore, to that extent, though I do not agree with the definition of treason, which I think is too wide, nor with the method by which we are legislating, being bound by that definition as it occurs in the Constitution. Though I do not agree with a good deal of this Bill, I do agree entirely with the proposition that a State must defend itself and with the proposition that those persons who endanger the State, or endanger the lives of the citizens of the State by armed insurrection should certainly be punished by death.</P>
      <P>That is the proposition which is embodied in Section 1 of the Bill, and it is a proposition on which every single person in the House who votes for the Bill will put the seal of his approbation, and I am glad of it.  Again and again, we heard ringing from Fianna Fáil platform after platform a condemnation of the Government that followed out the principle which is embodied in Section 1.  I heard denunciations, again and again, of the Government that executed 77 persons for endeavouring to upset that Government, and who did embroil this country in an insurrection against that Government.</P>

      <P>I will content myself with what I have said, that this Bill sanctifies, by the vote of every person who votes for it, the action of the Government which defended itself and its people by those executions.  There can be no question about it.  It is beyond all doubt and all question, and no amount of cavilling, no amount of shouting, &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; can change plain obvious facts which anybody with the slightest glimmer of intelligence can recognise as plain and obvious facts.</P>
      <P>I come now to deal with this definition of treason.  It is embodied in the Constitution and I will read it.  It is set out in the Preamble and is:&mdash;</P>
      <P>WHEREAS it is provided by Article 39 of the Constitution that treason shall consist only in levying war against the State, or assisting any State or person or inciting or conspiring with any person to levy war against the State, or attempting by force of arms or other violent means to overthrow the organs of government established by the Constitution, or taking part or being concerned in or inciting or conspiring with any person to make or to take part or be concerned in any such attempt:</P>

      <P>I am reading the Preamble which sets out, in effect, the words of the Constitution, and if I am to be called to order, it is not by Deputy Cooney.  I think it well that the House should know the meaning of the words: &ldquo;levying war.&rdquo;  The words have been used in the statutes relating to treason from the very beginning and they are words with a technical meaning.  They have been defined in case after case.  In order that there should be a levying of war it is not necessary that there should be an army in the field.  It is not necessary that there should be a vast body of men.  One man may levy war against the State.  Two men may levy war against the State, or three men or any small number, but it need not be a <Col N="973" /> large force.  Now, there is a very considerable number of cases setting out the meaning of those words and I should like, with your permission, Sir, to let the House know the meaning of the words &ldquo;levying war against the State.&rdquo;  I shall read from Archbold's Criminal Law, 1934 edition, Page 1079:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In order to constitute a levying of war the number of persons assembled is not material; three or four will constitute it as fully as 1,000; nor is it necessary that they should be <i>more guerrino arraiaiti</i>, armed with military weapons, with colours flying, etc., although it is usually so stated in the indictment. Nor is actual fighting necessary to constitute a levying of war; for, as the court held in the King v. Vaughan, enlisting and marching are sufficient without coming to battle. But there must be force accompanying that insurrection, and it must be for an object of a general nature. War levied against the King is of two kinds&mdash;direct and constructive.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Of course, in the passage there they are using the word &ldquo;King,&rdquo; whereas in connection with this Act the word &ldquo;State&rdquo; must be substituted.  It proceeds as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;It is said to be direct, when the war is levied directly against the King or his Forces, with intent to do some injury to his person, to imprison him, or the like; such, for instance, as open rebellion for the purpose of deposing or imprisoning the King, or of getting him into the power of the rebels, or of forcing him to put away his Ministers, or the like; holding or defending any of the King's castles, forts, or ships against the King or his Forces, or delivering them up to rebels, through treachery.  To constitute levying war it is not necessary that great numbers should assemble or military arms or array should be displayed or actual force be used. Levying war is said to be indirect or constructive when levied for the purpose of effecting innovations of a public and general nature by an armed force; as, for the purposes of attempting by force to obtain the <Col N="974" /> repeal of a Statute, to alter the religion established by law, or to obtain the redress of any other public grievance, real or intended; or an insurrection for the purpose of throwing down all enclosures, pulling down all bawdy houses, opening all prisons, etc., expelling all strangers, enhancing the price of wages generally, or the like.  Therefore, where a mob assembled for the purpose of destroying all the Protestant dissenting meeting-houses, and actually pulled down two, it was held to be treason.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the case arising out of the well-known Sacheverell riots in London. Now, therefore, we find that things of the nature which I have mentioned here are acts of war against the State.  The joining together of persons, or even the acting of one person, in order to achieve, not a private, but a public end by force, is the levying of war, and those various things which I have read out to the House, and similar things under this statute, are punishable by death.  If persons conspire&mdash;and let me say that I hope that it will never happen in this country as it is happening in Germany at the present moment &mdash;if persons conspire together to pull down Jewish synagogues, all of them, and if they did actually pull some of them down, which, I hope, would never happen, they are guilty of levying war against the State.  There can be no question of that from the authority, and, therefore, under this statute, they would be punishable by death.  There can be no question about that.  It is perfectly clear law. Let me go a little further.  With your permission, Sir, I shall just read what was held in the case of the Queen v. Gallagher, which was one of the Fenian cases.  The case was before Lord Coleridge, Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the Rolls, and Justice Grove and came under the Treason Felony Act.  It was stated that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Secret clubs were formed in America, branches of a society called the Fenian Brotherhood, whose object was said to be to procure `the freedom of Ireland by force alone.' The prisoners, members <Col N="975" /> of these clubs, came to England provided with funds, their intent being to destroy public buildings by nitro-glycerine and other explosives. One of the prisoners appeared to be the director of the movements of the others, another was detected in manufacturing nitro - glycerine in large quantities at Birmingham, and others were employed in the removal thereof, when manufactured, to London under the director's superintendence. There was evidence that the House of Commons and Scotland Yard office of the detective police were pointed out as places to be destroyed, as well as that the nitro-glycerine was to be used for destroying other public buildings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, there was the case of the mere possession of nitro-glycerine in the hands of these people with the intent to blow up Scotland Yard and the Houses of Parliament.  The Lord Chief Justice, in summing up the case to the jury, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The jury had heard an argument addressed yesterday to the court that all that was proved in this case was an intention&mdash;nothing, happily, was carried into effect&mdash;by two or three persons to blow up public buildings and to inflict injury upon public property, possibly with a view of deposing the Queen and forcing her to change her counsels, and to overawe both or either of the Houses of Parliament.  It was further argued that there was nothing for the jury to decide upon, because the levying of war must necessarily be something which answered to the old notions of war&mdash;that there must be a mustering of forces or an irregular mass of men equivalent to a number of troops&mdash;or something of that kind, which must be not only included in but taken as the only legal sense in which the term `levying war' was used in the statute.  He and his learned brothers, however, held that that was not necessary, but it would be sufficient for the jury to find the accused guilty if they thought that one or more of them did compass, devise and intend to force the Queen <Col N="976" /> to change her counsels, and to overawe the Houses of Parliament by violent measures directed against either the property of the Queen, the public property, or the lives of the Queen's subjects, and directed against them for those public purposes, and not with the view of repaying any mere private spite or enmity against any particular subject of the Queen.  As years went on and as science increased and knowledge widened, so the means of war varied from age to age, but if a thing was done with the same object and with the same violent means as would be a levying of war in the days of the earlier statutes it was none the less compassing and intending levying war now, because the scientific means by which it was directed had put it into the power of two or three men to do what could not have been done years ago by hundreds and perhaps thousands.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the position at the present moment.  These men, as a matter of fact, were not tried for treason.  They were tried under a statute which, in my view, at any rate, does not apply to this State.  They were tried under the Treason Felony Act, under which the death penalty could not be imposed, and, in consequence, sentences of penal servitude were passed upon them&mdash;penal servitude for life, as a matter of fact.  But in this State, as it stands at present, indicted like that, they would have to be sentenced to death and no sentence short of death under this Bill, if it becomes a statute, could be passed upon them.  Therefore, my suggestion to the Taoiseach is that he should either withdraw this Bill and completely remodel it, or else that he should undertake to amend it drastically in Committee.  A large number of offences, as I think I have already shown beyond question, can be charged as treason, and there are some that can only be charged as treason and are only punishable by death.  I think that the wise course for the Taoiseach to take would be&mdash; of course, we are bound by the very wide wording &ldquo;levying war&rdquo; in the Constitution&mdash;to divide levying war into two and to make it plain that <Col N="977" /> levying war in this statute will not mean the constructive but the actual levying of war; that it will embrace only those cases in which the public conscience will come to the conclusion that death had been deserved; and that we should not have upon the Statute Book a statute under which a man, for an offence, could receive a sentence of death, thus shocking the conscience of the community.</P>
    <P>As I said, we are bound by the actual wording of the Constitution.  But we are not bound as to our penalties, and the levying of war can be divided up very easily into two.  There can be a real actual levying of war.  That is when a considerable number of persons go out, or are prepared to go out, or conspire to go out, and carry out their objects by means of shooting down soldiers defending the State or policemen doing their duty.  But other classes, those classes which have been called constructive levying of war, should not be subject to the death penalty.  There are cases, many cases, especially when the 1925 Act goes, in which people could either not be tried at all or would be sentenced to death. I may here remark that an over-heavy sentence like the sentence of death, not for real cases such as I have mentioned, but for a lesser offence, will prevent jurymen from bringing in verdicts of guilty.  No jurymen will bring in a verdict of guilty where death must follow unless they are satisfied in their own minds that death should be the penalty.  Here there is nothing now even corresponding to the Treason Felony Act.  Here the State has cut itself down to having, for a large class of cases, the death penalty and nothing but the death penalty.</P>
    <P>Let me take one of the repealed sections, Section 6 of the Treasonable Offences Act, 1925:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every person who takes part or assists in the formation, organisation, or maintenance of any association or other body which purports to be a military or police force, and is not established and maintained as such by law, and also every person who is a member of any such association or body, shall be guilty of a misdemeanour, and on conviction thereof <Col N="978" /> shall be liable to a fine not exceeding £200, or, at the discretion of the court, to penal servitude for any term not exceeding five years, or imprisonment with or without hard labour for any term not exceeding two years or to both such fine and such penal servitude or imprisonment&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Suppose you find an army here in possession of arms, just as the possession of nitro-glycerine was held in the case I have read to you of the Queen v. Gallagher, especially if there are any documents found showing that the intention is to endeavour to upset the Government or the established order in this State, or any purpose of that nature, when this section goes, you will have nothing short of a charge of treason to bring.</P>
    <P>We are told, of course, that there may be some other Bill, but at the same time we are told that we should not consider any other Bills that are coming&mdash;we are to take this Bill on its merits.  Here we discover that if a situation of that kind is to be dealt with, it cannot be dealt with under a section so that the jury will know, if a man is found guilty, he will be fined or given a not-over-long term of imprisonment, and, if they are not intimidated, would find him guilty, if the evidence of it was clear.  But no jury would find him guilty if there had been no lives lost; no jury would find him guilty of treason and therefore see him sentenced to death for treason.</P>
    <P>There are many other instances which I could give if I went through this statute, but I do not want to go through it.  Take Section 3 (1) (a): any person who</P>
    <P>&ldquo;attempts or takes part or is concerned in an attempt by force of arms or other violent means to overawe or intimidate in any way either the Governor-General or the Executive Council or any member thereof or any other Minister duly appointed under and in accordance with the Constitution, or the Oireachtas or either House thereof, or any lawful court or any judge of any such court with a view to influencing their or his actions,&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="979" /> shall be guilty of felony and on conviction thereof shall be liable to penal servitude.  When you take away that section that is treason, that is levying of war.  Instead of having a person indicted under a section in which the punishment could be made to fit the crime, you are leaving yourself in such a position that you can only indict him for treason and with the death penalty. I think that is an exceedingly wrong way of dealing with this matter.</P>
    <P>I would very gladly indeed hear that this levying of war should be divided into two parts.  There should be levying of war which should be actual war as distinct from levying of war which is merely constructive war.  I sincerely hope that the Government will take some steps towards carrying out that principle, because I think it would be entirely against the interests of this State and against the administration of justice, as it is against modern common sense, that there should be crimes which can only be dealt with as treason. There are many crimes which are treason, the perpetrators of which could be indicted for treason, but common sense and the Attorney-General or the public prosecutors decide that they will not be indicted for treason; that they will be indicted for some other offence. The having of explosives could be dealt with under the Explosives Act; the person who is using the explosives might prove he was using them for a public purpose.  He might also be indicted for treason or, in England, for treasonfelony.</P>
    <P>There are a great number of other cases in which there is no discretion left to the State prosecutors and in which the crime would be treason or nothing.  I would like this section dealing with treason to be a commonsense section of a kind over which one could stand.  The Government may say &ldquo;We will never use this Statute,&rdquo; or &ldquo;if we like we can indict this person for treason and the death penalty will follow, but we can charge him with something less.&rdquo;  I do not like that section.  The fact that this section is taken from the Treasonable Offences <Col N="980" /> Act of 1925, is not, to my mind, an answer to placing a law upon the Statute Book which in its ordinary interpretation is against common sense.  I sincerely hope that the Government will not act obstinately in this matter.  I am putting these views forward in the hope of improving this Bill, as it stands.  I do sincerely hope that what I have said will be gravely taken into consideration and that we will get a promise that amendments such as I have suggested will be introduced in Committee.  Better still, my suggestion is that the Bill will be taken back and redrafted.</P>
    <P>There are other things in the Bill which are of a similar nature.  Section 2 of the Bill says &ldquo;Every person who encourages, harbours, or comforts any person engaged in committing treason ...shall be guilty of felony.&rdquo;  I do not think these words &ldquo;encourages,&rdquo;&ldquo;harbours&rdquo; or &ldquo;comforts&rdquo; should stand unless the word &ldquo;willingly&rdquo; is before them.  I think a person who under force harbours, encourages or comforts somebody who has been guilty of treason&mdash;one who is on the run&mdash;should not be subject to a penalty if he is compelled by force or by threats to do so.  As the law stands if he is threatened, if his life is in danger or if he is in grave danger of being hurt, then he would not be guilty of felony.  But if a person is told &ldquo;if you do not give me shelter I will burn down your house,&rdquo; he would be guilty.  I certainly think that the words &ldquo;willingly&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;unknowingly&rdquo; should be inserted there.</P>
    <P>Misprision of treason is a very old offence.  Though it is in the 1925 Statute, there has been no prosecution for misprision of treason or treason felony for hundreds of years.  I do not think it is a good principle to revive a statute that has been obsolete for hundreds of years.  It would be well to let it die a natural death now. The old principle in the matter of being guilty of treason was that there should be some overt act, that something should have been done against the State.  There does not seem to be any such provision in this Bill here. In this measure there is no necessity <Col N="981" /> for any overt act.  In a conspiracy of levying war against this State, an offence which is punishable by death, I think there should be something done in pursuit of that conspiracy. The conspiracy should, in my opinion, be overt.  I should like if the Taoiseach would tell me whether the old three years' limitation would still apply so far as this Bill is concerned. I rather think it would not, because it is like being tried on a murder charge.  I would like to know what is the considered view of the Attorney-General.  For the reasons which I have stated, I wish to make it clear that when there is real treason, when there is a real attack upon the State, when the State is in danger or when the lives of soldiers or the lives of Gárdaí Síochána or when the lives of public men are in danger, from a widespread wholesale conspiracy, that the punishment of death is a proper punishment.  But I do not like the punishment of death appearing upon our statute for offences for which such a penalty is altogether too great.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's action in giving his approbation to this Bill is of the same variety as the approbation the Deputy gave to Public Safety Bills in another period.  The reasons he gave for the Bills which he then introduced did not disagree at all with the reasons he gave for supporting this Bill this evening. The Deputy can pat himself on the back that, at all events, in respect of Bills dealing with public order, he has been consistent inasmuch as what he believes now he believed ten years ago.  But the Government that is asking the House to adopt this Bill to-day and that is going to ask the House to adopt the Offences Against the State Bill in a few days' time, did not, ten years ago believe that it was necessary that this country should have enacted a series of Public Safety Bills one after another.  There is to-day no necessity for the introduction in haste of this Bill.  The Constitution has been in existence for 15 months and for any offences that might be committed against the State since then there was <Col N="982" /> presumably legislation to deal with them under the Treasonable Offences Act of 1925.  There is no necessity, therefore, for the introduction of a Bill of this kind to-day, because if a situation arose which necessitated dealing with the offence of treason the Government could not plead that it had not the power to do so.  We get this Treason Bill, and we get this Offences Against the State Bill at a time when the country, so far as its internal administration is concerned, was never more peaceful.  We get them at a time just when an effort is being made in another country to work up a flame of indignation against Irishmen who are being arraigned on certain charges there.  I think the least that we ought to have done in this connection was to hold our hands in the introduction of legislation of this kind, particularly when nobody can make the case that the country needs legislation of this kind, or that there is any difficulty to be met with in the country.  That is a very happy feature, and something on which we can congratulate ourselves&mdash; that during the past few years in particular the country has been extremely peaceful and intends to continue peaceful.</P>
      <P>Sporadic incidents in widely spread portions of the country do not at all justify the introduction of legislation of the Treason Bill and of Offences Against the State Bill variety.  I think it is particularly unfair to the House that, notwithstanding the plea put forth by two Parties in the House, the Government has not seen fit to postpone the consideration of the Treason Bill until such time as we could examine, and see in proper perspective, the relationship between this Bill and the Offences Against the State Bill.  Although the two Bills were introduced simultaneously, we are now being told that you can study and regard as a self-contained measure the Treason Bill, and that you will not be allowed during the Second Reading discussion on the Treason Bill to see the Offences Against the State Bill even though many of the provisions of that Bill will, presumably, be lifted from the Treasonable Offences Act of 1925.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="983" /> I protest against that method of treating the House on two Bills which are of vital importance in the national and domestic life of the country.  We ought to have the opportunity of seeing both Bills together.  As no case of haste can be made that, I suggest, is an especially strong reason why we should have the opportunity of seeing both these Bills.  As Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has rightly said, the phrase &ldquo;levying war&rdquo; has been deemed from time to time to include a wide variety of offences, but in this Treason Bill before us we are actually going much further than in the Treasonable Offences Act of 1925.  In this Bill you can be arraigned for treason, and you will have to be arraigned for treason for certain offences in respect of which, under the 1925 Act, it was possible to prefer a less serious charge not involving the sentence of death. Under this Bill &ldquo;every person who commits treason within the State shall be liable on conviction thereof to suffer death,&rdquo; and treason is defined in the Constitution as, among other things, &ldquo;levying war against the State.&rdquo;  As Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has pointed out, levying war against the State may, in the long run, mean conspiring to burn a synagogue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the reasons, I suspect, why we are not being allowed to see the two Bills is that to do so would enable us to ascertain what types of offences have been taken out of the Treasonable Offences Act of 1925, and put into the Offences Against <Col N="985" /> the State Bill of 1939.  I suggest to the Taoiseach that when we see the Offences Against the State Bill we will see in it provision for the punishment of certain offences from the Treasonable Offences Act, and if these offences can be at all described on a charge under the Treason Bill as constituting &ldquo;levying war,&rdquo; then it is possible only to charge a person with treason, and to sentence a person for treason. The Taoiseach disagrees so that we can pass from that.  That is my view of the matter, and nothing that the Taoiseach has said in the course of this discussion dislodges the view which I hold.</P>
      <P>There is one section in this Bill which says that</P>
      <P>&ldquo;every person who, being an Irish citizen or ordinarily resident within the State, commits treason outside the State shall be liable on conviction thereof to suffer death.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would like if the Taoiseach would tell us what exactly the commission of treason outside the State means.  Why is this particular section drafted in such a way that you can commit two types of treason: one within the State and the other without the State?  It seems to me that the matter might have been dealt with by merely indicating what would happen to a person who commits treason, irrespective of where the treason was committed.  I think that we are entitled to have some explanation as to why we have this rather extraordinary procedure of cataloguing treason within the State and treason without the State in two separate classifications.  It is indicated, for instance in Article 39 of the Constitution, that treason consists in an attempt to overthrow the organs of government established by the Constitution. Is the King one of our external organs of government for the purpose of our relations with foreign countries?</P>

      <P>I want to put it to the Taoiseach that nothing he has said this evening, and nothing that has happened in this country for the past 12 months, at all justifies the enactment of a Bill of this kind and the enactment also, in the course of a week or two, of the Offences Against the State Bill.  Both Bills are quite unnecessary.  The only thing they will do, the only thing they are calculated to do, and the only thing, in fact, that they are doing, is to cause a very effervescent feeling throughout the country and throughout local boards in the country.  Even Fianna Fáil Cumainn have been loud in their denunciations of these Bills and Comhairli Ceanntair have been protesting loudly against the introduction of these Bills.  Every person in the country will protest against them because the only effect they will have is to create unnecessary yeastiness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cormac Breathnach will tell us, no doubt, as he did in the Press the other night, that no law-abiding citizen need be afraid of these measures.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney tells us the same.  Deputy Cormac Breathnach had something very different to say, I am sure, on the occasion of the introduction of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's Public Safety Act. In my opinion the only effect of these measures will be to cause considerable commotion and agitation.  These efforts at repressive legislation will only beget protests and annoyance which will, in turn, cause offences which everybody <Col N="989" /> desires to see avoided and which are only caused by protests against legislation of this kind.</P>
    <P>I think the Taoiseach might well have allowed the existing position to continue without treating the country to the kind of feeling of yeastiness and commotion which is bound to follow on the discussion and enactment of these measures.  I protest against the Bills as being totally unnecessary.  I protest against the mentality that considers that we must have one Public Safety Act after another in this country. I protest against this addition to the public safety legislation of this country as being an unnecessary addition to a good deal of unnecessary legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to express my views in regard to this measure.  I am speaking as a plain citizen, although I happen, for the moment, to be a public representative in this House.  I am, at least, so far removed from Party politics that I can take an absolutely impartial view of this measure.  In my opinion, having regard to the peaceful conditions which prevail in this country, there is absolutely no necessity for a measure of this kind.  This Bill is not only unnecessary, but it is undesirable inasmuch as it may cause uneasiness, annoyance and bitterness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most plausible, though perhaps not the strongest, argument in support of this measure is that it does not or will not affect in any way the ordinary law-abiding citizen.  I question that statement very much.  I question whether any measure which tends to create annoyance or a certain amount of uneasiness or disorder will not affect the ordinary citizen.  Will it not affect the ordinary citizen if this measure is interpreted as drastically as it could be interpreted under the Constitution? Treason under the Constitution is defined as levying war against the State.  We are told it does not require a great army to levy war against the State; one or two individuals might be regarded as levying war against the State.  One indignant farmer whose stock has been seized and sold at one-fifth <Col N="990" /> of their value might be so incensed that he might try to rescue his stock from the forces of the State.  Would not that farmer, under the Constitution and under this measure, be liable to be regarded as levying war against the State; yet that farmer, excepting that he lost his temper as a result of injustice, would be an ordinary, law-abiding citizen?  Again, would it not be possible that a trade union engaged in an ordinary labour dispute, or a farmers' organisation engaged in a trade union dispute, such as, for example, a milk strike, might become involved in some way in a clash with the forces of the State?</P>
    <P>Would it not be possible, under this measure, that peaceful, law-abiding citizens who might, as a result of the excitement of the moment, or, as a result of harsh treatment that might be meted out to them, become involved with the forces of the State, would be affected by this measure?  I suggest it would.  Would it not be also possible for a peaceful, law-abiding citizen to be affected by the measure in this way?  One of his children might be guilty of some offence against the State which, owing to the drastic nature of this measure, might be regarded as treason and might be punishable by death.  That peaceful citizen might find himself outside Mountjoy waiting for the execution of his son.  Would he not be affected in that way?  I suggest he would.  I, therefore, say that this measure does affect the ordinary law-abiding citizen of the State.  My chief reason for objecting to this measure is that the penalties proposed are altogether out of proportion to the offences outlined.</P>
    <P>It has been said that treason is the most terrible crime of which a citizen of the State could be guilty.  It has been suggested that it is a more serious crime than murder, but you must remember that treason is a very indefinite sort of offence, a very vague type of offence.  In murder you have something solid, something substantial. At least you have the corpse to start with.  In the other case you have nothing substantial.  A group of excited boys might seize a public building and issue a proclamation. <Col N="991" /> These boys would be guilty of treason under this Bill.  They would be liable to the penalty of death.  Again, as I say, members of a trades union might be involved in a clash with forces of the State.  There would be nothing very definite there.  It would be very hard to know how the clash originated in a moment of excitement.  It would be hard to know whether the forces of the State or the members of the trades union were responsible.  Yet, these people would be liable to the charge of treason.  There is one argument which I think I should mention in fairness to the Government which is responsible for the maintenance of the State. It is possibly the strongest argument that could be advanced in support of a measure of this kind, and that is, that a measure of this kind is absolutely necessary for the preservation of society.  That, I believe, is the only argument on which the Government could rely for penalties so drastic as are involved in this measure, that the danger which might arise from unlawful acts is so great for the entire community that the Government of the State is reluctantly forced to take such drastic action.</P>
    <P>I question very gravely whether drastic penalties are always the most effective means of restoring order in connection with offences of this kind. I question very gravely whether it has been proved, either in this country or any other country, that the execution of people involved in offences against the State, or even engaged in war against the State, has always been the most effective means of restoring order.  If execution were the most effective means of restoring order, the Government that was elected in Spain a few years ago would have restored order within a few weeks because they did adopt this method of execution. They had resort to the most drastic penalties, yet it was proved that the adoption of such drastic penalties did not achieve the purpose for which they were intended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was coming to that. <Col N="992" /> We have our own history to look back upon.  If the executions were effective in this country, there would have been no organised effort on the part of the Irish people to secure freedom by force of arms after Easter Week, 1916.  The penalties at that time were of an exceptionally drastic nature.  Again I say that I question very gravely whether executions are the most effective means of restoring order.  I suggest there are more effective means and that the strength, the efficiency and effectiveness of the State, Army, and other forces, are in the last resort the greatest and most effective safeguard which the community could possess and not the drastic penalties that the Government might be inclined to inflict.  I think members of this House who have had a long and painful experience of matters which should not be mentioned in this House, should reflect upon this question from a really detached, disinterested point of view, and ask themselves whether these drastic penalties in the past afforded the best means of restoring order.  I suggest that they have not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was made clear by our Party, when we were discussing the order of business, that the disposal of this Bill would be greatly simplified if its consideration were postponed until we had an opportunity of considering it in the light of the second Bill.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has clarified for the House the distinction between real treason and constructive treason, and the Taoiseach must realise the confusion that the introduction of this Bill alone creates in the minds of some of us.  I have no doubt, from what the Taoiseach has let fall so far, that for certain of the offences described by the terms &ldquo;constructive treason&rdquo; provision will be made in the second Bill, and that there is no intention, in this country or in any other country, of using the letter of the law to exact the death penalty for such offences which technically could be described as treason, but that in ordinary circumstances offenders in these categories will be proceeded against under some other legislation.  If we had an assurance of <Col N="993" /> that kind, by the submission of other legislation, a variety of considerations, which I believe are irrelevant, would not arise at all.  In the absence of the other Bill, this Oireachtas is bound to take precautions to ensure that we shall not pass a Bill, which if it were allowed to stand permanently alone as an Act of the Oireachtas, would in fact bring down on the heads of ordinary offenders penalties that the Oireachtas never meant to bring upon them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume not, but what we suggested to the Taoiseach was that he would bring forward as much of the related legislation as was available so that we could consider this Bill in the surroundings of the existing law and the law contemplated at present.  In that event, we could view the position and make suggestions.  Now, if this Bill must be considered alone, because the Taoiseach thinks it ought to be, we think it must be amended and provision must be made to meet, in some degree, some of the suggestions offered. In my humble judgment, Deputy Cogan, with respect to him, was talking through his hat.  If this Bill stood alone and no other legislation supplemented it, what he said would carry some weight.  It was to avoid any weight attaching to representations of that kind that we suggested to the Taoiseach that these two Bills should be examined together.  Are we to understand that the second Bill will be available before the Committee Stage of this Bill is undertaken and, if it is not available, is the Taoiseach prepared to meet the points raised by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney?  As I read this Bill&mdash;it may be that I do not see all that is in it&mdash;I attach little more importance to it than I should to a Coroners Amendment Act.  I think it is an ordinary Bill, the purpose of which is to declare what is the established law in every civilised State in the world.  But, as is frequently the case with this Government, they have done the job with gross incompetence. They have made a mess of the Bill. The Government always do that, but <Col N="994" /> we are prepared to help them out and assist in clearing up the mess.  They have created a lot of apprehension that I do not think need necessarily have arisen in regard to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like an assurance from the Taoiseach that the legitimate apprehensions of the Opposition will be met and considered and I remind the Taoiseach that, in this kind of legislation especially, the legitimate representations of a Parliamentary Opposition are entitled to very special consideration.  This is a law designed to protect the integrity of the State, which is the concern of every section of this Parliament just as much as of the Government.  Although the Taoiseach might think that certain Draconian legislation was perfectly safe in the hands of the Government, he has got, if he wants to carry out the work of a democratic Government, not only to satisfy himself, but to satisfy the people of the country as a whole that the legislation is of a character which the Oireachtas should adopt.  Restrained and moderate representations have been made to him, as I think of a perfectly legitimate character, taking this Bill standing alone.  I put it to him that in the general interest these representations ought to be met.  They may be met by giving the House now an outline of the second Bill which is in draft or they may be met by expressing a readiness to consider amendments on Committee Stage to meet these objections, but I do press strongly on the Government that it is desirable to avoid a casual rejection of these representations, because that would give rise to apprehension which I do not think would arise now.  I want to repeat that what I say here is said in the belief that this Bill is merely enacting what is the ordinary law in every civilised State&mdash;that is, that if men take up arms to overthrow the legitimate Government of the State, they attack not only the authority of the people but the authority of God and that has got to be defended, and is defended, in every civilised State. To that principle we shall all subscribe. Let the Government not create, by ineptitude or pigheadedness, <Col N="995" /> issues that do not exist and let them judge by the objective character of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's remarks the readiness of Parties in this House to deal with this type of legislation in a calm and businesslike way.</P>

The Minister for Defence asked if there was no other law in the country but the law laid down in this Bill meaning, I presume, that the Government, in its wisdom, would deal with minor offences by other machinery than the machinery which this Bill, when enacted, will give them.  Will the Minister throw back his mind a couple of years when he was robbing the farmers of this country and when a mild protest put those who were present before the Military Tribunal set up by him, while when the foulest murder that ever stained this country was committed at Edgeworthstown, in my native county, and when the culprits were got&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Under Section 2, a person who harbours a person guilty of treason is himself guilty of treason. About 1685, a woman named Alice Lyon was indicted in England for harbouring two prisoners who had taken part in the battle of Sedgemoor and the infamous Judge Jeffries sentenced her to death.  When Macaulay came to write his history later, he said that that decision was a disgrace to British jurisprudence.  How many members on the opposite benches have been guilty of treason and have been harboured within the last 15 years or 16 years? Would they say that the people who harboured them in that friendly way and as an act of Christian charity should be adjudged guilty of treason and sentenced to death?</P>

      <P>One moment; of course I will be told that, if such a thing happened, it would so outrage public conscience that the Government would use the prerogative.  Of course, the Minister for Defence will say &ldquo;there are other laws.&rdquo;  It does not matter what other laws there are, so long as a statutory provision described upwards of a century ago by Lord Macaulay as a disgrace to British jurisprudence is put to-day, in 1939, on our Statute Book.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has pointed the way to the Taoiseach.  According to his interruption to Deputy Norton, he is not going to adopt it.  That is the inference I draw from it, and before the House votes for that provision I want to give them what Lord Macaulay said.</P>

      <P>There are other laws, according to the Minister for Defence.  There are plenty of laws. We know that, and we have not to be told about them by the Minister.  The most lay member of this House knows them, but the moment any citizen commits the offences described here he is guilty of treason, and must be tried in the Central Criminal Court by a judge and jury.  If he is found guilty, the sentence is death.  Does the House approve of that?  I should like to know why the provisions of the English Act of 1847, which were re-enacted in the Treasonable Offences Act of 1925 here, have been deleted so that quasi-minor offences, such as were denounced by Lord Macaulay in describing the case of Alice Lyon, could be dealt with on a similar charge.</P>

      <P>But there are plenty of other Alice Lyons.  I am very curious to know what is behind the inclusion of the smallest offence. Is it in order to turn the law into a farce, or is it that anybody who commits the smallest offence is going to be harshly dealt with?  Is the jury going to be asked to convict in those trivial cases?  Take this penal servitude for minor offences; could there not be a provision with regard to a sentence of imprisonment for them&mdash;something that is in keeping, as Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said, with common sense, and with the common conception of justice and natural law?  Would not the public conscience be outraged if there was a suggestion of doing things like that in 1939?  There is no use in the House thinking that there are plenty of other laws.  Everybody knows that.  That interruption by the Minister for Defence was entirely beside the question; it was not relevant to this.  This is a positive piece of law.  Let the House not forget that.  All those treasonable offences under Section 1 are joined together, and the penalties are all the same.  Everybody knows, <Col N="998" /> of course, that there is a wide difference in various acts of treason; a whole series of acts could be brought within the definition, and the person guilty of them would have to be indicted for treason, and, if he was found guilty, sentenced to death.  I agree with Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney that this Bill should be withdrawn and redrafted.  It is obviously a badly drafted Bill.  What I am curious to know is whether it was deliberately badly drafted.</P>

      <P>We have a very serious Bill to consider here in this House.  We are dealing with a Bill that affects the State fundamentally. It treats of attacks upon the State, nothing less, and surely Deputies in dealing with it ought to deal with it seriously.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney raised a few points.  The first was the question of levying war.  The Bill, he considered, was wider than it should be.  Now, that is a point of view which I can quite understand.  We limited treason in the Constitution to be exactly what is defined here, to be the offences defined here, levying war, encouraging the levying of war, and by violent means overthrowing the organs of State established by the Constitution.  It is limited to that. Somebody says we should limit it more.  I want to hear the arguments. Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney says that levying war has been interpreted in British decisions as being, as he put it, I think, a constructive levying of war.</P>

      <P>A constructive levying of war; that is, not a real levying of war as we understand it in the plain meaning of the terms.  I do not know that those decisions are going to cover us here.  I take it that Irish judges interpreting the Constitution would be quite at liberty to decide what was the intention of the Legislature, and what was the intention of the people, and what is the intention in the Constitution in regard to levying war.  I do not think we can contract it, or define it, or limit it.  That is my own view at the moment.  I have not had time to consult with legal advisers on the matter.  We cannot here in an Act interfere with a definition as it has been put in the Constitution.  It is there.  The courts will have to decide in any particular case what is the levying of war, and I have no doubt whatever that, in approaching that, they will approach it from the commonsense point of view.</P>

      <P>I am not going to take that just because it is said.  I understand that a case could be made in that direction, and I promise the Deputy to have it examined more closely.  It is an important matter, and it would have been a very appropriate point, for instance, to raise at the time of the Constitution, when this Article was going through the House.  I appreciate and understand the point that is made, and I promise the Deputy that I will have it looked into, but at the moment my view is that an Irish court coming to deal with that particular matter in a particular case would not feel themselves bound at all by decisions in regard to treason in British courts.  They might perhaps look at what is done in cases in America, and they might look at views that were taken in other countries in regard to this particular matter; I do not know, but it is a right and proper thing that it should be raised.  It is one of the important things that have been raised in the debate, and I promise the Deputy that I will have the matter examined.  If there is any particular amendment necessary to prevent the term &ldquo;levying war&rdquo; from covering something which was certainly not in my mind when I was bringing it in here in the Bill, and was not in the minds of the average people as regards levying war, or could not be reasonably construed to be equivalent to levying war, we will see what can be done in the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always ready to <Col N="1001" /> listen to any reasonable point put forward from any quarter.  One has to use one's reason and common sense to do that, and the Deputies opposite would be extraordinary people if, as an Opposition, now and then they did not, at least, make a point.  There were some other things said by one Deputy with which I am not in agreement at all&mdash;that because we did not have in this Bill a number of minor offences which are treasonable, or related to those of a treasonable character, or that if we had this Bill without the promise of another Bill, we would be compelled in cases like these to bring a person to trial for treason and nothing else.  I told the House that the two Bills would probably be before them before we came to the final stages.  If minor offences were not provided for here, it would obviously be open to them, when they knew another Bill would be coming along dealing with offences against the State, to put in amendments.  We are not closing the door by the passage of this Bill.  We would not be closing the door to the possibility of having offences against the State, more or less of a treasonable character, dealt with in a new measure and, therefore, there would be no danger whatever in passing this Bill as it is.  We have been told that we might not put them into the other measure.  I can only say that with our majority, if we were disposed to act in that particular way, we would not put them into this Bill.  It seems to me we are losing nothing in the direction the Deputy indicated, by taking this Bill separately.  I suggest that we are gaining a good deal.  We gain clarity, and we prevent confusion. The other offences of a different type are many.  The Bill is a long one.  This is relatively a simple Bill, confined to the act of levying war, or inciting, or conspiring to levy war, and to use violence against the organs established by the State.  What is the opposition to this?  Why have we opposition to this?  Is there a State in the world that can depend solely on the goodwill of its citizens to maintain itself?  It is an unfortunate fact that the State does need force to maintain its authority here and elsewhere.</P>

      <P>Every State in the world, unfortunately, needs force to defend itself.  If we do not protect the State, having got our freedom, we will soon lose that freedom.  Everyone knows that.  Why then do we find objections to the passing of this Bill? Is it that the State can exist without these powers of defending it?  What is there in this Bill that is not the law in any State?  Obviously there are people who want to confuse the public mind at the present time to try to gain a little political kudos out of it. I am not speaking of people on the other benches, but there are people on this side who have proved that they wanted to win freedom, and now having got it for this part of the country, they want to see that freedom protected. This Bill is to protect the freedom that has been won, to see that this community will act as a whole, if possible, and where there are differences of opinion, to see that the methods which are provided in the <Col N="1004" /> Constitution will be used to resolve these differences, and that force will not be appealed to.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton spoke of the undue haste in bringing in these Bills.  There is no undue haste.  As I have said, the Constitution limited treason.  It obviously was indicated by the Constitution that there would be a separate Bill implementing the Constitution in that regard.  Other powers which the State may require to defend itself will be taken in the other Bill, but this is purely a Treason Bill and there has been no undue haste in bringing it in.  As I said to the House when I was starting, shortly after the passage of the Constitution, in fact, when the Constitution was going through, I indicated that there would be certain supplementary Bills which would be necessary once it was through&mdash;there was, for instance, a possible modification of the Ministers and Secretaries Act which might be considered&mdash;and this was one of them. It has been in draft for a considerable time.</P>
      <P>The Deputy says we are in a state of peace.  Thank God we are.  Since the passage of the Constitution we have had peace here.  I was right, I believe, in the policy which we put forward from the time we came into this House.  We said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;There are certain things which are inducing people here to resort to violent methods.  Can we not get rid of them?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a national risk in getting rid of them, I know.  It was not an easy thing to do it but, by persevering, we have got there and everybody ought to be thankful and I believe everybody is thankful that we have got there.  We have done it so quietly that people throughout the country do not appreciate what position has been reached.  That is a fact.  If some of the things that have been reached in the last decade&mdash;let me go wider than our own time&mdash;were fully appreciated, we would have a very different public mind from the public mind which, unfortunately, we have in many cases to-day.  It is not appreciated.  If <Col N="1005" /> some of the things which have been secured over the past decade were secured in battle, they would be appreciated but, because they have been secured otherwise, as a result of previous battles, they are not appreciated yet.  I hope that this Bill and this discussion will help to get the people to understand the position they have arrived at as far as national freedom is concerned.</P>
    <P>We have had that peace, but we know that we may not be left with that peace, and we who are in these benches, who are charged with the responsibility of trying to preserve peace, have got to look ahead.  When we see signs which indicate to us that there may be troublous times ahead, are we to be without any arms, any weapons, any powers to forestall such possibilities?  I say we need these powers, and by having them there we will be, from an early stage, in a position to prevent developments which, if they were let run, might very well involve something very different from what we have to-day.</P>
    <P>Very reluctantly, I will admit, very unwillingly, with bitter hearts, if you wish, we had to use a measure which was brought in here by our predecessors and which we opposed.  We opposed it because we thought, in accordance with the general policy which I have indicated, that it would be very much better for us to try and get rid of the causes rather than to rely on State protective measures of the kind that were introduced.  From the opposite benches I begged the Executive of the day to try that method, but when we ourselves found ourselves in office we were faced with a situation and, standing here as a responsible Minister, I state that if we did not have at that particular time the legal powers which were there the country would have been in a very short time in a state of chaos.  We had all the elements to make it.  We had an armed body and another body that could quickly arm and, I believe, and state it now as my conviction, looking back upon it, that if those powers were not at our disposal at that particular time we would have had armed conflict here between two <Col N="1006" /> groups within the State and the State powerless in front of them and what would have happened ultimately would be the loss of those liberties which the Constitution is intended to maintain.  With that experience and that knowledge, are we to allow the State to remain in the defenceless position that it is in at the moment? Are we, simply because there is at the moment here a state of peace&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As I have said, this Bill is brought in at a time of peace here, peace which we are very glad exists, but it is brought in because the experience of mankind in other States shows that laws of this kind are necessary, and because there are certain indications that the peace which we have we may be robbed of unless the State is able to protect itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I go back again to this point, that because certain minor offences of a treasonable character are not mentioned here, a person might be construed as being guilty of the greater offence, and that the Attorney General of the day would not have the opportunity of being able to indict a person for the lesser crime.  As I have said, the place for dealing with that is in the other Bill.  The voting power of the Dáil is not going to alter between now and the time when the next Bill comes before us.  The long title of that Bill has been published, and these minor offences will clearly come within that title, and, therefore, it would be <Col N="1008" /> competent for any Deputy to meet a point such as that which Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney has raised by bringing in a proper amendment at that stage.</P>
    <P>With regard to the death penalty, I know that there is a difference of opinion as to whether there should be a death penalty in the State.  It is a question upon which people in different countries differ, but the point is that, in most States, treason, as the gravest of crimes, has been visited, and is visitable, with the greatest punishment known to the law.  In our case, I think it should not be said that treason against the State is an offence more lightly treated than murder, and, consequently, the present punishment for murder is the punishment indicated here.  I will have the other points that were raised looked into.  I do not think that any of them are of such a character that they could not be met in Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>With regard to levying war, there is a difficulty at the moment.  I do not see how you could change the meaning that would be held by a court to attach to it in the Constitution.</P>

With regard to Deputy Norton's contention that the King was here <Col N="1009" /> introduced, or that this had some relation to the King, I tried to give him, in the most precise and concise way I could think of, the answer that he does not; that is the advice given to me by the legal department and it is my own belief.  The King, so long as our External Relations Act, which is not the Constitution, remains, is used as an organ performing certain functions when directed or advised so to do by the Government, but he is not an organ of the State established by the Constitution, and does not come in in any way whatever under this Bill.</P>

I tried to make that <Col N="1010" /> answer as clear and definite as possible, and when I make the answer clear and definite, Deputy Norton evidently is not satisfied.  I wonder what was he asking the question for. Was he putting a rhetorical question, was he putting it to himself or to other members of the House, or was he addressing the question to me?  I accepted that he was addressing the question to me as the person introducing this Bill, and I wanted to assure him from the very start that the view he held was not the view of my responsible advisers in the matter, and that, even attempting to construe it myself, I could not see any point whatever in his construction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Deputies may recollect that it was announced about a year and a half ago that we proposed to bring to an end the payment of certain grants under certain sections of the Housing Acts, 1932 to 1937.  Last year there were protests from different parts of the House at different times and requests to me to reconsider the decision to bring these housing grants to an end on the 1st September last year and many requests to extend the period.  There were also a number of requests from different parts of the House for further facilities in regard to the remission of rates.  This Bill proposes to deal with these two matters and these two matters only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to extend the time for the completion of houses for which grants may be made to private persons and public utility societies under the Housing (Financial <Col N="1013" /> and Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts, 1932 to 1937, and to extend the rating provisions of Section 10 (1) (b) of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932, to houses in urban areas affected by grants under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1936.</P>
    <P>Under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts, 1932 to 1937, the amount of money provided for such grants is £3,500,000.  Of this sum there remained to be allocated on the 1st instant a sum of £390,790.  It is anticipated that this amount will be sufficient to cover likely allocations up to the end of October next and, accordingly, the provision of further funds at this stage is not considered necessary. The existing Acts, however, would not permit of the allocation or payment of grants for houses built or reconstructed after 31st March, 1939.  The Government have decided to extend the dates for completion, and the Bill before the House makes no change in the rates of grants.  It proposes in respect of grant-aided houses, to extend (1) for a further year, i.e., to the 31st March, 1940, the date for the completion of houses in rural areas by private persons and public utility societies; (2) to 31st March, 1940, the period for the acquisition by urban local authorities of houses capable of conversion into family dwellings and their sale or lease to a philanthropic society or body of persons approved by the Minister and to the same date the period for carrying out the improvement, enlargement or repair of such houses; (3) for a further period of three years, i.e., to 31st March, 1942, the date for the completion by public utility societies in urban areas of new houses built for letting in accordance with the provisions of Section 5 (1) (i) of the Act of 1932.  The practice hitherto has been to grant a year's extension, but it is considered, owing to the length of time it takes to carry out such schemes, necessary to make greater provision to enable arrangements to be completed; (4) to the 31st March, 1939, the date for the completion of houses in urban areas by private persons and public utility societies provided the houses shall have been commenced on or after the 1st <Col N="1014" /> July, 1936, and before the 1st day of June, 1938.</P>
    <P>Under the Housing and Labourers Act, 1937, all houses which were being built by private persons and public utility societies in urban areas, with the aid of grants under the Housing Acts, were required to be completed by the 30th September last, but for various reasons a limited number of persons were unable to complete their houses by the statutory date.</P>
    <P>Any person who intended to avail of the grant would, it is believed, commence the erection of the house at least four months before the expiration of the statutory period, and in making the concession proposed by the Bill, viz., to allow grants to be paid where the erection of the houses was begun before 1st June last and satisfactorily completed by 31st March, 1939, all cases of hardship are being reasonably met.  The number of houses affected is about 260.</P>
    <P>The amount of money allocated to private persons and public utility societies at 1st instant for the erection of houses in urban areas was £612,627 for the building of 11,775 houses, and in rural areas £1,369,114 for the erection of 20,340 houses, making a total of £1,981,741 for the building of 32,115 houses.</P>
    <P>The amount allocated for the reconstruction of existing houses at the same date was £1,125,744 in respect of 29,639 houses.  These figures, with a sum of £1,725 for the reconditioning of houses so as to form 23 flats, represent a total of £3,109,210 in allocations in respect of the erection and reconstruction of 61,777 dwellings.</P>
    <P>The number of new houses completed under these grants at 1st instant was 25,539, of which 10,354 were erected in urban areas, and 15,185 in rural areas. At the same date the total number of houses reconstructed by small farmers and agricultural labourers was 19,631. The total number of new houses built and reconstructed by private persons and public utility societies up to 1st instant was 45,170, as compared with 34,846 at 1st February, 1938.  The amount paid by way of grants from the Act of 1932 to 1st instant was £2,475,405.  At the present date the <Col N="1015" /> outstanding approvals cover over 15,000 houses, showing that there is a considerable volume of work in hand for the ensuing year.  To enable these to be completed with the aid of grants and to permit the allocation of further grants this Bill is presented to the House.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill deals with the remission of rates and is in the nature of a section to remove doubts.  It has been contended that paragraph (b) of Section 5 (1) of the 1932 Act relating to houses erected with the aid of grants in urban areas and entitled to the partial remission of rates was replaced by paragraph (k) inserted in the 1932 Act by the Housing Amendment No. 2 Act of 1936 but it is considered desirable to remove any doubt in the matter.</P>
    <P>The section continues the partial remission of rates for seven years provided for under Section 10 of the Act of 1932 in respect of all houses erected, with the aid of grants, in urban areas and is retrospective in its application to the date of the passing of the No. 2 Act of 1936.  So far as the Department are aware local authorities have in fact been granting the remission without question.</P>

      <P>He is going to stop the provision of grants to private persons and public utility societies for the building of houses after the 1st April next.  The occasion of making differentiation between urban areas and rural areas in respect of grants to public utility societies is contained in this. Perhaps the Minister would tell us something of what the general effects of his Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) policy has been in the last six years.  The Minister has given us some figures with regard to the up-to-date position.  I prefer to take the figures of actual achievement, and to base anything I say here on the figures given recently in Parliamentary answers as to the actual position of completed work on the 31st December last.  The Minister implies that he has sufficient money in hands to go ahead to October next without asking the House for any further funds.  I suggest, in view of the stoppage that has taken place, and the money spent on the completed work to date, the Minister should have sufficient moneys on hand to go through the whole year.  The Minister has told us that he has already provided, as grants for housing, a sum of £3,500,000.  An examination of the replies given to Parliamentary questions as to the work done to the 31st December last, shows that there was only £1,523,000 in grants to private persons and public utility societies, and £742,000 on grants actually paid for reconstruction work carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have no fear that the Minister will be asking for additional money before the end of the present financial year.  Therefore, for that reason, I think the Minister should take advantage of the present occasion to take us more into his confidence.  I want first to deal with the grants to private persons and public utility societies.  I do not stand for the giving of grants to private persons for the building of houses.  When I introduced the Housing Bill of 1931, I indicated my own <Col N="1017" /> personal outlook and the outlook of my colleagues on this question.  I provided that grants would be given if the local authorities were prepared to assist housing in the same way.  But the Minister thought differently and he has continued these grants to-day.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear the argument as to why a person who builds a new house in Baldoyle or Malahide should get a grant of £45 while a person who builds a house on the Sutton front should not get it?  I should like to hear why the person who builds a house in Kildare should get a grant of £45 while the person who builds a house in Naas should not get it; or why the person who builds a house in Roscrea should get the grant while the person who builds a house in Nenagh should not. I think the decision that has been taken here bears the stamp of absolute want of a review of the realities of the housing situation.  I do not think the Minister can be accused in the matter. He has standing by him a housing board or council to review every aspect in connection with housing.  I do press for some kind of explanation as to why a distinction should be made between Baldoyle and Howth, between Kildare and Naas and between Roscrea and Nenagh.  The same thing applies all round.  I would ask when the Minister is extending the grants to private persons in urban districts up to the 1st April next, why he shuts down the grant because a person had not commenced to build his house on the specified date&mdash;1st June?  The Minister must be aware that there has been a lack every year in the declaration of his intentions as to whether he would continue the grants to private persons or not.  Persons dealing with the building of houses for private persons, say during the whole of last year, could not be very clear as to how they stood with regard to the possibility of obtaining grants.  Summer is the obvious time for the starting of the building of a house.  A substantial number may have been begun in June, July or August and these may be completed by the 1st April next.  I think it is bad enough to have a discrimination made between people building outside, say, 100 yards of the urban district <Col N="1018" /> and persons building 50 yards inside the boundary.  It is bad enough to have that discrimination, without any review of the whole housing position. But it is really too pernickety entirely to say in respect of houses that are completed before the 1st April: &ldquo;I am not going to give you a grant because you put up your house in four months,&rdquo; or &ldquo;you put up your house in five months,&rdquo; or &ldquo;you put up your house in eight months.&rdquo;  I think the Minister should review that particular position.</P>
    <P>However, as to the position as a whole, the Government have been very insistent that they want to solve a particular type of housing problem, of giving people in every part of the country decent housing.  When the position was reviewed in the census of 1926 special emphasis was laid on the kind of inadequate housing that was to be found in certain rural districts. It was pointed out that Donegal was the second worst, and that the County Wexford was the best.  When we look at the work done under the 1932/37 Acts, we find that substantially more houses have been built in the County Wexford, where the housing conditions were good, than in Donegal where they were said to be very bad.  In Donegal, we find that 868 houses were built in rural districts, and in Wexford 1,158. When we review the work done from the beginning of the 1924 Act up to date and try to get a picture of what the general achievements in the country have been&mdash;taking it that there may have been a small amount of overlapping&mdash;we find that when the work done under the 1924/31 Acts is added to the work done under the 1932/37 Acts we have a fair idea of the additional houses provided since the 1926 Census.</P>

      <P>The Chair is not prepared to hear the Deputy at any length on the general housing position owing to the fact that this is an amending Bill of very limited scope. The question is, whether or not the date for giving grants to private individuals or public utility societies, should or should not be extended. Debate on an amending Bill is confined <Col N="1019" /> to what is in that Bill or the main Act as affected by that Bill and only in so far as it is affected.

      <P>We are here discussing an amendment to the 1932 Act, which does a particular thing&mdash;cuts out urban housing from certain grants. Six years have passed since that Act went through.  In the interval we have had a fairly responsible examination of the financial position, with regard to housing, in the Report of the Banking Commission.  The Minister, I submit, ought to welcome the opportunity of discussing the whole housing question on this particular measure. I take it that, if that were the wish of everybody in the House, the Chair <Col N="1020" /> would accommodate the House by agreeing to have a wide discussion on housing on this measure.</P>

      <P>The Chair has been pulling me up for travelling beyond the scope of the present measure which, the Chair has ruled, only deals with very definite things in the Bill.  The point I made was that we are now amending the 1932 Act and that on the Minister's Estimate I will not be allowed to discuss changes in legislation.  Because of the financial position as revealed in this Bill, I do not see any prospect of the Minister having to come to the House to ask for more finances either for reconstruction purposes or to enable him to make grants to private persons or public utility societies during the year.  I have urged that this is the last occasion, in this year, in which the housing policy can be discussed in any kind of a general way.  The Chair has intimated that if there is no objection, and if there is a desire for it in all parts of the House, he will not mind the scope of the debate being widened a bit.  I am asking the Minister's co-operation to enable that to be done.  It will not, I think, mean prolonging the debate.  In fact, I think the debate would be more direct and more interesting.  There are things that one would wish that one could hang his hat on to.  There are also things that some of us would be trying to hang our hats on to in the wrong place.</P>

      <P>I am sorry I do not feel inclined to facilitate Deputy Mulcahy on this particular Bill.  This Bill was brought in at the definite and repeated requests of different parties in the House, particularly Deputies of Deputy Mulcahy's own Party.  They pressed very strongly that I should extend the date for the payment of <Col N="1022" /> these grants to private persons and public utility societies, and I took the opportunity to bring in another section into the Bill to remove doubts with regard to the remission of rates.  That is all this Bill deals with, and I do not think that on that Bill it would be right or proper to expand into a debate on the whole subject of housing.  With all respect, I think, Sir, that you said very properly that it is quite likely that Deputy Mulcahy has certain things that he wants to say and would like to say on this subject, and he would not unduly expand the debate, but he cannot guarantee what other people might do, and I am not inclined, although personally I am very sorry, to extend the debate further than the limits that you would allow it to be extended to.</P>
      <P>With regard to the other matter mentioned by Deputy Mulcahy, as to the fact that it would be unlikely that they would have another opportunity of discussing matters relating to housing, I hope to bring in a Bill before the autumn asking for further moneys for housing and, if Deputy Mulcahy or any other Deputy wants to speak on any aspect of housing, I shall be happy to hear him.</P>

      <P>The Minister is as well able to put two and two together as I am, and that is the position as it appears to me from the figures officially given.  I suggest that as regards the stoppage of grants to persons in urban districts, the same thing has not been done in rural districts, and that is unjust and is wrong.  I understand the Bill extends the date for the paying of grants to persons in rural districts and we can discuss the position of persons who are going to get grants in rural districts.  I want to point out that the second worst county in the whole country is not having its housing developed, although it has a bigger population than Wexford, and Wexford is the best.  I will have to leave it at that.  When I return to the withdrawal of grants from persons in urban districts, I am forced to use that point to hang this particular hat on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to ask the Minister what is going to be the effect of withdrawing grants from private persons in towns like Ballina, Thurles and other places, when he takes into consideration the amount of money the local authorities have been spending on their housing and the condition into which these local authorities are getting.  Private persons in Ballina will not be able to get <Col N="1024" /> grants for houses after 1st of April next.  This brings us back to a consideration of the housing position in Ballina.  We have to look at two towns together, because the population and the population trend are something the same, and in those circumstances I will take Thurles with Ballina.  Ballina, according to the 1926 Census, had a population of 4,873.  The population slightly increased by 1936, when it came to 5,674.  Thurles was something the same.  Its population, in 1926, was 4,815 and it increased in 1936 to 5,648. In 1926, there were 914 inhabited houses in Ballina and there were 814 inhabited houses in Thurles.</P>
    <P>A housing deficiency was disclosed in both these towns in the Census and, as in the case of every other urban district in the country, an inquiry was made from the Department of Local Government in 1929 as to the number of houses that the local authority in each of these towns considered would be necessary in order to relieve overcrowding and insanitary dwellings. The Urban District Council in Thurles considered they wanted 221 houses to replace insanitary dwellings and 200 to relieve overcrowding, making 421 in all.  The Department estimated that the overcrowding would be appreciably relieved by the building of 81 houses. How many houses have, in fact, been built since then?  In a town with 814 houses in 1926, 470 houses have since been built and 336 of these were built since 1932.</P>

      <P>If the Minister looks up the figures he will see that in Ballina in 1926 the population was 4,873, and in 1936 it was 5,674.  The Minister will also see that in Thurles in 1926 the population was 4,815, and that shows a difference of 58.  In 1936 the population of Thurles was 5,594. That is what I mean by saying that Thurles and Ballina are substantially towns of the same kind and with the same population trend.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why I take them for the purposes of comparison. In Thurles, where over the period from 1924&mdash;that is, all the house building done since 1926&mdash;the local authorities built 345 houses as against 125 built by private persons, and in Ballina where the local authority built 465 houses as against 94 houses by private persons, the trend in rates and the trend in expenditure for housing of the people were very different indeed.  In Thurles, where loans for housing in 1924 amounted to £7,700, the figure has increased to £71,000, and the town rate has increased from 13/2 to 14/2.  In Ballina there was an increase of £91,535 in housing loans, and the rate in the town increased from 12/6 to 18/11.  Whereas in Thurles the increase <Col N="1026" /> in rents paid out of rates was £2,400, Ballina at the present time is saddled with an increase in the payment of rates, between 1932 and 1937, of £5,200.</P>
      <P>As I say, the throwing over of the building of houses on local authorities, without a review of the whole position, is going to turn out badly for some of the local authorities.  I have to confess that I am straining my argument in this matter a little bit in order to bring under the Minister's notice that the continuance of the provisions for financing local authorities, is putting a great strain upon a certain number of local authorities.</P>

Such persons can build within ten yards of the outskirts of an urban district and they will get a free grant but if they come ten yards inside the boundary of the urban district they will not get a free grant. That is the purpose of this Bill.  No wonder the Minister will not allow a general discussion on housing.  I think the Minister is unfair to himself.  I think he is unfair to the Department which has the responsibility for expending this enormous amount of money because it is an enormous amount of money.  Not only has he got £3,500,000, not only does he tell us that he wants more, but for what was done up to the end of December last he has saddled local authorities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to say that we on this side of the House appreciate very much what the Minister has done for housing in recent years.  We welcome this Bill very much because we have been agitating and asking the Minister to bring forward such a Bill. The particular clause in the Bill with which I am principally concerned is Section 2, clause (i), which states: &ldquo;The erection of such house shall have been commenced on or after the 1st day of July, 1936, but before the 1st day of June, 1938, and shall have been completed on or after the 1st day of April, 1937, but before the 1st day of April, 1939.&rdquo;  I want to ask the Minister if he would, on Committee Stage, bring forward an amendment substituting for the 1st day of June, 1938, the 1st day of August, 1938.  At that particular time of the year, in an ordinary year, it would be quite possible to finish a house in two months, but last year the weather was very, very bad.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister to have that clause amended.  Of course, it is not feasible for an ordinary member of the House to bring in such an amendment because of the fact that it would involve an expenditure of money.  Only the Minister can introduce such an amendment. Coupled with the fact that we had extremely bad weather last August, there was a scarcity of tradesmen and I do know that a certain number of people were held up owing to the fact that the weather was bad and that it was impossible to get tradesmen.  It is a pity that the Minister would not agree to the same extension in the case of urban houses as he is granting for rural houses and allow these grants in respect of both types of houses until the 31st March, 1940.  As Deputy Mulcahy has pointed out, it will be possible for, say, a town dweller to build a house immediately outside an urban area and receive a grant of £45 while a person building inside the area will not receive the grant after the 31st March next. The result of that in the past&mdash;and Deputy Allen, who is Chairman of the Wexford County Council, is aware of this&mdash;has been that immediately outside certain towns there has been a good deal of what is known as ribbon building. After these houses were erected the owners immediately applied to the local authority, the county board of health with a view to being provided with sewerage and water.  The county board of health had no control over the buildings at the time the houses were built but, immediately they were built, demands were made for water, sewerage and facilities of that kind.  It is very hard for a county board of health to refuse to supply services of that kind. If that danger was there up to now, it will arise more frequently when this Bill becomes law because nobody will start to build houses from this date to be completed before 31st March, even if it could be done.  There are not two months left.  Certain people have got certificates already indicating that they are entitled to the £45 grant.  Will it be necessary to ask for a renewal of these certificates or will they stand?</P>

They have involved themselves in certain expenditure, thinking they would be able to have their houses completed.

      <P>I am glad to see that grants in favour of housing in rural districts are being extended but, as regards urban districts, I cannot understand the Minister's point of view in refusing to give a private person a grant for the erection of a house or houses.  In certain urban districts steps have been taken by private people to erect houses, and they have erected very good houses.  In some cases, they have erected much better houses than urban councils or local authorities.  If the Minister looks at his files or at the questions or letters I addressed to him about Galway Urban Council, which is now a Corporation, he will be convinced that his attitude is rather strange.  The activities in Galway at that time were not the activities of the Galway Corporation, but of the Galway Urban Council. Houses which were partially erected during the period of office of the Urban Council are now unfinished to the number of 19 and are shuttered. Galway Corporation do not know who is responsible for the completion of these houses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that, in depriving a private person of the grant, the Minister is putting back housing <Col N="1031" /> because a number of local authorities are not able to engage in housing operations.  We had a scheme&mdash;if you will allow me just to put it before the Minister&mdash;for 19 houses, which were partly erected, and are shuttered at the present time.  Neither the Corporation of Galway nor the Minister knows who is to complete them.  I do not think the Department of Local Government knows who has got to complete those houses.  Before the start of the houses they knew there was neither a water supply nor sewerage&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all I want to say on that.  The Minister should remember, in regard to town planning and so forth, that the one person who is always prepared to carry out the instructions of the local authority engineer or the urban council or corporation engineer is the private individual. The private individual is always prepared to build a good house. He will build a good substantial house that is a credit to the district.  You will always find the private individual giving more employment in the erection of houses than any corporation or local authority.  That is the point I wish to make.  I should like if the Minister would take it into consideration, and not persist in depriving people in urban area of the right to a grant.  As General Mulcahy has said, for a house ten yards outside that particular area there is a grant of £45 given.  If another member of that family builds a house ten yards inside the urban area boundary he is deprived of that grant.  I think that is most unfair, and I think it is a set-back to building in this country.  The Minister himself knows very well what is needed at the present time.  For a number of years there has been a great fillip to building in urban and town commissioners' areas.  Now there is a falling off, and the one thing which I think the Minister should do is to try to help the continuation of building in urban areas, in order to give employment. The only way in which he can do that is by giving the private person <Col N="1032" /> the same rights.  The private person should have as much rights in this country as the ordinary urban council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that this Bill gives the Minister power to extend for another year the period for the giving of grants for reconstruction of houses in rural areas.  I should like to say that the Minister and the Government deserve to be congratulated on providing those grants for rural houses. They have been a great advantage to the rural community, and have contributed very largely to improving the conditions of a certain section of the rural population.  There is, however, one great disadvantage, and that is in regard to the valuation.  I should like to ask the Minister if it would be possible to amend the Bill so as to extend the valuation.  At present the figure is limited to £25, and I should like to ask the Minister if he could possibly extend the valuation to at least £45.  We must understand that in rural Ireland there is a majority of small or medium sized holdings under a valuation of £45, on which houses were erected perhaps 200 or 300 years ago&mdash;houses which are at the present time in a rather deteriorated condition. If the valuation limit were raised to £45 it would, I think, remove from our rural areas almost all those houses, which have fallen into a very bad condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to point out also that, in making those grants, consideration should be given to the condition of the existing dwellings.  I notice that in many places we have grants given for the reconstruction of houses which are not capable of being properly reconstructed&mdash;houses which are in such a condition of deterioration that a £40 grant is absolutely no use.  The result is that we find throughout the country many small thatched dwellings, with three or four rooms, to which as a result of those grants an additional room has been added.  What is the result?  The result is that the older portion of the house has been allowed to decay.  Thus, you have those houses in a worse condition than they were in when the grants were first made available. That applies of course only to a certain number.  In the majority of <Col N="1033" /> cases those grants have resulted in a very decided improvement in the houses so reconstructed.  I would ask that, if possible, there should be a review of some of the cases in which grants have been made, and in which one room has been erected, to see if it would be possible to make an additional grant to complete the work.  I would also suggest that the valuation limit should be extended, not only in regard to reconstruction but in regard to the erection of new houses, and that in addition there should be some provision for a long-term loan in order to enable a complete job to be made of any house for which a grant is obtained.</P>
    <P>I do not quite agree with those speakers who have suggested that it is undesirable to concentrate too much on making grants for rural areas as against urban areas.  I think at the present time the whole policy of the Government should be directed towards extending housing in rural areas.  We have, at the present time, tremendous provision being made for the protection of towns and cities.  Surely anybody who looks into the future must see that it is altogether undesirable, even from the point of view of national defence&mdash; apart from the deterioration caused by diverting the population from the rural areas into the towns&mdash;to go on extending and enlarging the towns at the rate at which it is being done at the present time.  Deputy Mulcahy has referred to medium sized towns which have increased in population to the extent of 1,000 each inside one year.  I think that is an altogether undesirable state of affairs, having regard to the fact that the rural areas are becoming depopulated.  I think, therefore, that the Minister should direct all his attention, or should direct his attention to a greater extent than at present, to the provision of the necessary grants for housing in our rural areas.  I should like to remind the Minister that the £40 grant is very little use where a house has become so deteriorated that it is not fit for habitation.  The only result of giving a grant in such a case is that the inhabitants of that house move into one room, which is not a desirable state of affairs.  I would ask <Col N="1034" /> the Minister to give consideration to that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the scope of this Bill is so limited.  It really resolved itself into a year's extension of grants for houses in rural areas, with an accidental extension of the time for grants in urban areas.  The position of affairs at present is that grants ceased in urban areas on the 30th September last, and will cease in rural areas on the 31st March.  The giving of grants is one concession, and the remission of rates another.  There are seven years remission of two-thirds of the rates on houses that got grants.  The maximum remission on houses that did not get grants is five years.  Am I right in saying that there are five years remission of two-thirds where no grants are given?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will put Deputies right about that.  Assuming that the legislation has lapsed, the difference will be greater.  If it has not lapsed, there is a loss of two-thirds of the rates for two years.  That is a big item, amounting to about half the grant, and would mean a loss of £60 or £70.  I suppose the Minister is aware that this has produced strange results around the City of Dublin.  The boundary of the 1936 Act is not always cut straight across a road, one side for quite a distance belonging to the city, and the other side to the county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Bill goes through in its present <Col N="1035" /> form, a man on one side of a road could, for the next 12 months, build a house and get a grant of £45, with a remission of two-thirds of the rates for seven years; while a man in the city, building on the other side, would get no grant.  It is not clear if he would get remission of rates.  The most he would get would be two-thirds for one year.  The Minister should remedy that position, and if he is extending the time in the rural areas, he should extend it in the urban areas. I can speak on this question with firsthand information.  I was stopped building on one side of a road, but I continued on the other side, the reason being that one side is in the county, and the other in the city. Of course, I will build where I get the most money.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the first time I heard an appeal of this kind.  I am sure the Minister did not agree to the extension without a good reason.  I do not know any reason why there should be an extension of time for the rural areas, and not for the urban areas.  There is, at present, only a difference of six months between them, but now the Minister makes it twelve months, or more.  Theoretically, he is giving no extension in the city, except to a few cases, where accidentally building was not completed, and where grants will be given, while in the rural areas there is an extension for one year for every house.  If the Minister thinks that the grants should be stopped in both urban and rural areas, let them be stopped together, say a year hence.  If he cannot do that, he should extend the time without any <Col N="1036" /> condition in the case of urban houses, completed by the 31st March, regardless of when they were started.  That is only asking an extension for six months there, as against 12 months in the rural areas.  If the case the Minister considered was one where some people did not happen to finish houses, and that it will take until the end of the financial year to do so, what does it matter when they were started, if he gets more houses finished in that time?</P>
      <P>After all, the Minister never conceived giving grants or the remission of rates in order to put money into any builders' pockets.  That was a method devised to induce house building.  If the houses are built by the 31st March, why should he say: &ldquo;I will only give grants for the completion of houses started within a certain time?&rdquo; If the houses are completed, is not that good enough?  I suggest that the Minister should seriously consider the giving of grants to urban and rural areas alike up to a certain time, and if he thinks they must be stopped, to stop the two at the same time.  I did not catch the Minister's explanation why grants should be continued for virtually one and a half years longer in one case than the other.  I notice that the Bill proposes to allow local authorities 60 per cent. of the cost of renovating houses. I know that the Minister and the Chair would not like me to develop that side of the question.  These renovations are very tiny, but I should like the Minister, as he has fixed a standard of 60 per cent. for that, not to forget subsidies. They would mean a far greater jump in the provision of houses for the working classes, and the clearing of slums, than this little gesture.  He knows that present-day subsidies are not related to present-day costs.  I will not go beyond that, as the ruling of the Chair has been very clear and definite in this matter, and I do not want to even appear to be out of order.</P>

It is not much good as it stands, but it could be improved.</P>
      <P>I would finally appeal to the Minister, particularly as he knows that not for years has there been such unemployment in or around the City of Dublin, in the building trades, as there is at the present time.  This is one very substantial way which will increase building and take many workers off the dole and home assistance.  It would be very welcome to builders, and all building operatives in the City of Dublin.  The Minister should consider very seriously, and I hope sympathetically, the extension of the grants and the remission of rates for another 12 months.  Of course, I would hope that he would continue it longer, but if he and his Government have made up their minds that they cannot continue it any longer, I do think that no case can be made for having it on one side of the road and not having it on the other.  This would be an immediate way of relieving unemployment in the building trades in Dublin, and I would appeal to the Minister to consider the extension of the grants and remission of rates for 12 months in urban areas.</P>

      <P>I would be prepared to support all the speakers to the fullest extent that I am capable of in urging the extension of facilities for the urban areas.  I realise the difficulties and the hardships that have been inflicted by the withdrawal of these grants, but I feel that we were very much restricted from the development of the subject on this Bill.  I fancy we are dealing to-night with something that originated in the Bill of 1937, and that the Bill we are dealing with now is simply introduced to remedy the grievances of some persons who were debarred on account of the statutory date, their buildings not having been completed by that time.  I am thankful for having at least that small mercy extended, because I know of many cases of undoubted hardship that has been inflicted.  I <Col N="1038" /> would like to ask the Minister, when he is remedying these grievances, if he would extend it a little further, so as not to leave further grievances existing for the sake of a few.  I was going to follow Deputy Corish by asking to have the 1st of August substituted for the 1st June, and I think that would undoubtedly remove some very severe hardships.  If possible, I would follow Deputy Belton in asking that houses finished by the 31st of next March ought to come within the ambit of the Minister's proposal.</P>

I would be delighted to pursue that point, if it were possible, but I would go the distance of asking the House, in the case of such of the houses that are already built or in course of construction, to try and give the benefit of that grant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made a statement, in answer to Deputy Mulcahy, that it is intended to introduce a comprehensive measure in the near future, before August, I think, which will give a chance to deal with the housing question in a general way.  I would suggest that on that occasion he should take into consideration the provisions that used to benefit urban dwellers in common with rural dwellers.  Deputy Cogan is selfish, I think, in that he wants to confine all activities to the agricultural population and sees, in fact, an absolute danger in giving grants to people who are condemned to live in cities.  He is afraid of the air attacks that might possibly come.  He would like that the bombs should destroy the shacks in the city and make place for the erection of good houses. Pending the aeroplanes, we are anxious in the cities and towns to get decent places to live in.  We may even welcome the aeroplanes if they are going to shift us out.  I am not going the distance of suggesting that we want a monopoly for urban areas.  I am asking to have the facilities given to rural and urban districts generally.  I am not going to say that, if the Minister finds <Col N="1039" /> himself in the position now that he cannot continue the facilities to urban districts, that he automatically should stop giving them to the rural districts. I think that, also, would be a very selfish outlook because all our problems do not exist around the borough boundaries or on the fringe of the urban areas.  There is a considerable amount of good work being done in the remote rural districts, remote from urban places entirely, and I think it would be an awful tragedy if anything should stop that.</P>
    <P>I want to disagree with Deputy Cogan fundamentally when he states that the £40 grant is a cause of retrograde action being taken by the building of an additional room on houses that are deteriorated to the extent that they should not be built on or helped at all.  I have never seen a case of that kind and I have real experience in my own county.  The inspection by the housing inspector is a very rigorous one before he will allow any additional grant to be given for reconstruction work.  I have had experience of trying to get him to agree that a house was capable of being reconstructed and I think the position is the reverse of what Deputy Cogan says.  At least, that is my experience in the building and reconstruction of houses.  I say that it has been a most beneficial grant to the rural areas and I hope that it will be continued.</P>
    <P>As I said, I feel restricted from the many rulings we have had from the Chair on the subject to-night, but I would certainly urge with the other Deputies that the Minister would go the fullest distance possible, under the terms of this Bill, to extend the period for making these payments to people who have been engaged in building, legitimately and honestly, with the intention of securing a grant, whose houses are under construction or have been completed, but who are unfortunate not to conform with the statutory date.  If, as has been promised to us, we are going to get a further measure on housing&mdash;which I believe is essential, as we have only just tipped the fringe of the problem yet&mdash;and that we are going to have another Housing Act in the course of this year, we would <Col N="1040" /> only be asking the Minister to go back again to try and include some people who have been left out.  I think, if his financial resources would allow it, the Minister should cover houses completed before the 31st of March, irrespective of the date of their commencement, and there would be no cause for complaint by any section of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>In making a few remarks I will try, as far as possible, to keep in order.  At the same time, this is a very big and wide subject and a very narrow Bill.  I would like to ask the Minister, when replying, to give us, if he can, some information about the extended term to help the purchases of houses, as has been suggested. I understand that is under the active consideration of the Minister's Department and I would like to ask him how soon we may hope to see that Bill.</P>
      <P>There is another Bill, or part of a Bill, that apparently will also have to make its appearance.  The Minister spoke about Section 3 of this Bill&mdash; Remission of Rates.  I take it that is merely to clear up a doubt as to whether five or seven is meant in certain cases but there is the still much larger case of the houses where the grants have lapsed at the present time.  The Minister stated in Dáil Debates, 17/12/'37, column 2809, volume 69,</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Mr. O Ceallaigh: The Local Government Act of 1925 must come up for consideration, probably within the next couple of months.  I am sympathetic to the idea of continuing the provisions, i.e., the remission of rates, for seven years.  Under the Local Government Act it is only allowed for five years.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Even though that was said 14 months ago, I hope the Minister's sympathy is still strong, and that at any time we will see these provisions in the new Bill which has been promised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I need not remind him of some other promises, because I think he is perfectly sympathetic and intends that these provisions shall be introduced, but I want to point out to the Minister that although people know he is quite <Col N="1041" /> sincere, a number of transactions are being held up.  There are people who want the statement in black and white that the rates are going to be remitted on the houses they have purchased, and quite a number of house purchase transactions are held up for the appearance of that Bill.  Every builder builds so many houses, and when the sale of them goes slowly, he goes slowly, too.</P>
    <P>Another matter which I want to bring to the Minister's attention is this matter of these varying dates and the different ways in which people are treated.  I am like Deputy Keyes&mdash;I do not want to be a dog in the manger. I do not want anything that has been given to people taken from them, but I should like them all to be put on the same footing.  I cannot understand what objection the Minister has to the urban areas.  Is it that they take too much money and build too many houses?  That is the only thing I can think of.  I am not going to suggest that the Minister has any spite against the City of Dublin, or does not want to see houses built.  If I lost my temper, I might level that charge against him, but it would not make it true.  There is something, however, underlying it, and I should like the Minister to tell us why the urban areas, where the cost of building is greater, where the valuation is probably higher, and where everything is higher, should not get the very longest day that is given to anybody else.  There are a number of points of that type which I should like the Minister to consider.</P>
    <P>He spoke, amost with a sense of pride, of this not costing us any money until next autumn because there was a sum of £300,000 available.  Anybody who has any knowledge of the housing problem knows that this Bill is not meeting the demand for houses.  There is a very big demand for houses, and I suggest that some of the sections which are being repealed contributed very little to the housing problem.  I notice that certain sections of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932, No. 19 of 1932, are being repealed.  Amongst the provisions of that Act is sub-section (d) of Section 5, which provides that an agricultural labourer erecting a house for <Col N="1042" /> his own occupation in a rural area shall get £70 grant.  I am a townsman, and I know very little about the country, but I imagine that agricultural labourers who have £300 or £400 to spare and who are prepared to put up houses for their own occupation, probably employing an architect, are few and far between.  Under some of the other provisions, very small sums must have been expended.  They must have cost very little in grants, and I suggest, like other Deputies, that the real demand and the biggest demand is in the urban areas.  The population has increased in those areas, and it has increased in Dublin.  One Deputy suggested that houses should not be encouraged in the urban areas, but does the Minister want to keep houses out of the urban areas?  If so, he ought to bring in a Bill to send some of the people back to the country, but I suppose he will tell us about that when replying.  Meanwhile, I ask him to tell us what the city has done that he treats it so harshly.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I must congratulate the Minister on the fact that the number of houses erected in the past year shows a big increase compared with previous years.  He spoke of 10,000 in the urban areas and 15,000 in the rural areas, and said that in all there were 19,000 houses reconstructed in rural areas.  There are one or two matters in regard to the grants payable in respect of the reconstruction of houses in rural areas to which I want to draw the Minister's attention.  A few cases have been brought to my notice of great hardship being inflicted on people who have reconstructed houses in County Louth. As we are all aware, when a house is reconstructed, it must, when finished, have a certain floor area.  I think it is 500 square feet.  It has happened in the cases to which I refer that many of these people, some of whom are widows, having little or no experience of building or floor areas, found, when they had the house finished and applied for the grant, that they had not got the requisite number of square feet.  That was due to ignorance, but the fact remains that, after an expenditure of anything from £30 to £40, they find that they are not eligible for a penny <Col N="1043" /> of the £40 grant.  I have in my pocket at the moment a letter from the Department to a widow who I know personally had a very nice house, and who deserved the highest credit for the reconstruction she had carried out on it.  It cost something like £35, but because the house was about 25 or 30 square feet short of the requisite floor area, she has received nothing.  I impress on the Minister that it would be well if the Department would use a little discretion in cases of that kind, and that if they were not prepared to give the full £40 grant, they should give at least some portion of it.  It is undoubtedly a great hardship on these people, as I say, who possibly were not aware at the time they undertook the reconstruction of these houses that the grant would not be available. In fact, in this particular case to which I have referred, it was left to the man who took on the reconstruction of the house, and the woman depended on him to see that all the conditions were complied with in so far as the Department of Local Government were concerned. As I say, to her consternation, now she has received this letter notifying her that she is ineligible for any grant at all.  Perhaps the Minister could see his way to allow the officials, under the powers they exercise at the moment, to make some grant in cases of such a nature that are brought to the notice of the officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the extension of the time for the completion of the houses in rural areas, I think that is a concession that will be very much appreciated by those people who are not, at the moment, in a position to complete their houses within the specified time.  As regards the question of the discontinuance of the grants to people in the urban areas, I think it would be well that these grants should be continued in urban areas so long as they are being continued in rural areas, and that if the Minister decides to discontinue them in the one case they should be discontinued in the other. You have people in towns like Dundalk, where one side is in the urban area and the other side is in the rural area, under the county council, and the <Col N="1044" /> people under the county council would be entitled to £45 while the people living on the other or the urban side would not be entitled to any grant.</P>
    <P>We have been reminded by the Ceann Comhairle that we cannot go outside the scope of this Bill with regard to housing generally, but as we have been promised by the Minister that a Bill of that nature will be introduced in the near future, I hope he will take advantage of the period between this and the introduction of that measure to devote some of that time to the question of the cost of building here.  It does seem strange that at the moment in this country the cost of building is anything from 20 per cent. to 35 per cent. higher than in Great Britain, and there is great hardship on people who, as a result of the high cost of building, have to pay high rents.  I should like to have an argument with those Deputies who want grants all the time, in connection with that matter, and to tell them that I believe that if building costs were reduced here there might be a great deal more building. I think that is a matter in which the Minister should interest himself very much in the near future; that he should endeavour to bring down the cost of building in this country.  There is no reason why it should be so high. I would almost advocate, as I said here before, with regard to the cost of certain materials, that the Minister should open the ports of this country and allow material in here if that were necessary in order to bring down the cost of building.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is farcical to think of the cost of building materials here in this poor little country as compared with other places, and I think that the Minister should interest himself in that connection in view of the measure he hopes to introduce in the near future. In conclusion, I again appeal to the Minister to exercise his discretion, as I know he is willing to do in all such cases, in connection with those cases of hardship where people who reconstructed their houses were under the impression that they were complying <Col N="1045" /> with the conditions laid down in the memorandum form that has been issued by the Department, and that he will give instructions to his officials at least to give portion of the grant of £40 in cases of that description.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I represent a rural area but, as the Minister and many other Deputies have often said in this House, the housing problem is a national problem and the welfare of the whole country largely depends on its solution. I learned with great regret that the Minister proposes to differentiate between rural and urban areas to the disadvantage of the latter, because I have often pressed on him&mdash;and I am sure I am right&mdash;that the housing problem can be divided appropriately into two parts, one the rural problem and the other the urban problem.  The solution of the rural problem never presented difficulty.  It was simply a matter of assembling money and materials and the problem was solved &mdash;there was plenty of land and plenty of labour, and no difficulty presented itself at all beyond the raising of money.  The urban problem, however, has always had the additional difficulty of sites, the finding of places in which to put the people.  A lot of people forget this.  They see a tenement house and say to themselves that the only solution of the problem presented by that tenement block is the erection of another tenement block of a better character to which to remove those people and clear the other site, but that is only part of the solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Side by side with that activity you can carry on another activity which solves the tenement problem, and that is inducing the people who are living in fairly good houses to avail of an opportunity to satisfy a long-cherished desire to build a new house of their own.  When they complete the new house, they move out of the fairly good house, and somebody who is in a good tenement graduates up to the vacated house, while somebody who is in the bad tenement moves into the good tenement, and in that way a material contribution is made to the solving of the acute slum problem which is perplexing every city authority in the world.  It is a very material <Col N="1046" /> contribution, so do not let this House imagine that, in inducing the erection of urban houses designed for the accommodation of a comparatively prosperous person, you are doing nothing to help those who are in urgent need of help, the slum dwellers.  You are.  The more you can induce the urban population to graduate up into new houses, the more you are relieving the pressure down at the bottom in the rotten, condemned tenements that we are all concerned to vacate.  Try to remember that a family at present resident in Dublin is not resident in the leaves of a tree or on the bough of a tree like a bird.  Wherever the family is in Dublin, it is in a house, and if you vacate that house by the erection of a new one it will provide accommodation which will ultimately relieve the family in the basements whom we want to get out and whom we must get out at whatever cost.  The radical way to go about that is the erection of new suitable flats, but we can help that along by inducing those who can afford to build themselves to build houses and move out of the accommodation in which they are now in order to make room for those whose moving will make room for the residents of the tenement basement room.</P>
    <P>For that reason, inasmuch as the building of houses in the urban areas of places like Dublin, Cork and Limerick, is relieving the slum problem and helping to abolish it, I would deplore anything which would check that eminently desirable development, and I think that if the Minister is prepared to extend the time of grant for rural areas, as this Bill proposes to do, he ought to be at least as generous to the urban areas, where, I submit, although I come from a rural constituency, the problem is infinitely more acute and infinitely more grave to-day than it ever was in any rural area since the Land Act of 1881 was passed.</P>
    <P>Now, the object of all these grants and all this machinery is to secure the building of houses in order to relieve the present congestion.  I apprehend that, although the Minister finds money to extend the period for these grants, his purpose is going to be largely abortive <Col N="1047" /> if the citizen who, he hopes, will avail of these grants, cannot get the capital to start their building at all. I think it is impracticable to suggest the Government should directly provide capital for that purpose, but I think there is something worthy of consideration, and I will not put it higher than that.  You have the great building societies in England.  They are immensely wealthy corporations and they have gigantic accumulations of funds at the present time, because, with the intensification of the armaments industry in England, the inducements to building in England have been rather soft-pedalled for some time.  The demand for money during the previous decade in England was so great that the building societies put up a great publicity drive to get deposits, and they got them.  Now that the demand for loans has fallen off, the money is still rolling into the societies, and they cannot get anyone to borrow it.</P>
    <P>I believe that these societies would be very glad to lend the money here. Remember that in England any man who puts down £15 can build his house. That is a remarkable fact, but I think it is true.  The reason English building societies are reluctant to lend money or operate here is that they are sceptical of the security of Irish houses.  Irish tenements and hereditaments have a bad reputation as security in Great Britain owing to our agrarian history and the reluctance of our people to see the security on a house realised. Could not the Government discuss with these building societies terms whereon they would be prepared to extend their activities to this country and to lend money here?</P>

      <P>I had intended to make a brief reference to the cost of building and to the consequences of an undue rise in the cost of building in America. However, if the debate has kept strictly within the limits of the amendments proposed, we can defer that to another day.  I do, however, urge strongly on the Minister, and I have no doubt that I urge it on a sympathetic hearer, that the representations made by Deputy Dockrell, Deputy Belton and other Deputies whom I may not have had the advantage of hearing, are well worthy of consideration, and more especially when we reflect upon them in the light that every new house built in Dublin, though it may accommodate a well-to-do family, ultimately helps to empty the condemned tenement basements. If that be true, I do not believe anybody in this House will want to restrain the Minister if he would extend the grant for urban areas in the same measure that he proposes to extend it for the rural areas.  The urban question is a very much more difficult one, a very much more urgent one, and a much more dangerous one; any money spent in relieving that is well spent, and we will combine to find it in the confidence that we are getting good value for it when we lay it out.</P>

      <P>I am sorry that it was, in my opinion, unavoidable that the discussion of this Bill should be so restricted, but I was anxious to get the Bill through, as the matters with which it deals are urgent.  I was particularly anxious to get all stages through well before the 31st March, for a variety of reasons, mainly finance.  The Bill, as I stated in introducing it, is very strictly limited in its scope.  It is introduced owing to representations made in the House here several times by Deputies, some of whom are on the Opposition Benches now, and by one or two others who saw me privately and pointed out hardships that the non-amendment of the law would inflict on certain builders of houses.  The representations seemed to me so weighty that I have introduced this Bill.  I am not taking away anything from urban areas, or from any place, urban or rural.  I am not giving any new grant.  I am simply extending certain benefits contained in the pre- <Col N="1049" /> vious Acts from 1932 to 1937 for a further period.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with the attitude of mind of Deputy Belton and one or two others.  Deputy Dockrell I was glad to note, though he like myself is a Dublin City man, would not like to see the benefits that flow to builders of houses in rural areas taken from them.  I thought Deputy Belton would be of the same mind.  He has more of a rural mind, at any rate, and generally displays a friendly attitude to rural people.  When he discusses agricultural matters you would imagine that there was nobody in the country but agriculturists, that they ought to get everything done for them, and that nothing is done by the Government for the rural dwellers and the agriculturists.  Now, here is one definite effort made in this Bill to show a deliberate bias in favour of the dwellers in rural areas.  That is the deliberate intention.  I think there are very few Deputies who object to that, and I am surprised that Deputy Belton is one who objects to seeing the people in rural areas getting the benefits that even he may be deprived of.</P>

      <P>The Deputy was not the only one who was of that mind &mdash;there were some others.  In 1937 the grant was taken away from the urban areas.  That was after experience having shown and evidence having been given to me by people interested in building houses that the grant did not <Col N="1050" /> encourage speculative builders to build houses.  I got that information more than once from people who built many houses in their time&mdash;that they were not interested in the grant so much as in seeing money provided under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act or otherwise for the building of houses. That was the thing they were principally interested in; the grant did not matter very much.  That is what I was told.  I said that here many a time already.</P>
      <P>I am surprised that the Deputies on the Opposition Benches speak with so many voices on this question.  Deputy Mulcahy who, I take it, always speaks here representing the Party&mdash;he is the principal spokesman anyway on housing matters&mdash;objects to any grants.  It is his definite opinion that these grants are of no value, in urban or rural areas.  I would like him to put that to a vote in his own Party.  Judging from what I heard to-day, it is not the view of the members of his Party.  It certainly is his view.  He repeated here to-day that we are going on wrong lines in giving grants of any kind to encourage people to build houses. It would not be a bad idea if Deputies Dockrell, Belton and Mulcahy got together and decided what their policy was in this matter and see if they could come to be at one on the question.</P>

      <P>Well, I did.  In reply to Deputy Mulcahy, I have to say that I have no objection in the world at any time to have in this House an all-in debate on housing.  This Government has nothing to be ashamed of in the matter of its housing policy. If we can claim to have achieved anything it is with regard to housing. There are houses built in urban and rural areas, including labourers' cottages.  If we include the completed houses, houses in course of erection <Col N="1051" /> and houses reconstructed the figure is very large.  There are about 20,000 houses reconstructed.  If we add these to the new houses there are more than 90,000 houses to the credit of the Government since the 1932 Act came into operation.  That is a very respectable achievement and we need not apologise to Deputy Mulcahy or anybody else for that achievement.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that there will be a difference of opinion in many places with regard to this question of housing. Dublin City is a big problem.  I will not go into that now.  Deputy Dillon is right when he says that largely speaking the question of the rural areas is not a great problem.  He is quite correct in that.  In certain parts of the country there certainly were housing conditions that were abominable. Very largely these have disappeared through the operations of the 1932 Act.  I do not want to take credit to the Government or myself for that, because without the help and sympathy and the active co-operation of the local authorities all over the country, and the co-operation of all Parties in this House we could not have achieved what we did achieve.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the details mentioned by Deputy Corish and one or two other Deputies, as to the point about commencing the house on the 1st June, all I can say is that I will look into that and see what we can do.  That date was in the Act that we are amending. At that time it was expected that the grants would expire on the 30th September. It was natural to expect that if a person had not commenced a house on the 1st June he could not have finished the building by the 30th September. Deputy Corish said that that <Col N="1052" /> could not happen in Wexford at all. They are wonderful people in Wexford.</P>

      <P>I will look into it. Deputy Cogan raised the question of grants being given to houses that were reconstructed.  He said some of these houses were in a bad way and that the grant was given without proper examination.  I think the Deputy is misinformed.  In every case there is an examination of the house for which the grant was applied.  When the application is made the house is examined, and if the house is not considered a fit house to be reconstructed no grant is given.</P>

      <P>What I spoke about was in connection with the old thatched houses in which a room had been added.  These old thatched houses may be in some repair, but because the small-holders might be expecting an additional grant, the older portion of the house in many cases was neglected or fell into disrepair.</P>

      <P>Yes, it is only when the house is fit for human habitation that the grant for reconstruction is given.  Only one grant is given.  There would not be a second grant given in respect of the same house.  With regard to the question raised by Deputies Dockrell and Belton about the remission of rates, the position is that buildings erected without grants get a remission of two-thirds of the rates for five years.</P>

      <P>It includes all classes of buildings.  Buildings that get housing grants get a remission of two-thirds of the rates for seven years. There was, during the last few months, <Col N="1053" /> a doubt about the eligibility of certain houses to get a remission of rates.  I hope to bring in a Bill, perhaps next week, to remedy that situation.  I believe that the remission of rates has regularly been granted all the time by the local authorities.  Personally, I have not heard of any case where the remission of rates was withheld.  I do not know whether it would be possible to do what Deputy Coburn has asked. Officials have to carry out the law, and they cannot use favouritism or differentiation between one person and another.  If the law is not complied with, persons must, I am afraid, suffer.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the time has arrived for the introduction of a Bill such as this.  One reason why I think so is that the rates to-day are four times greater than they were ten years ago, the cost of living has doubled and incomes have been reduced by half.  When I say that incomes have been reduced by half, I want to emphasise the fact that the capital of the farming community has been reduced to so low a figure that the greater part of their land is not being utilised as it should be.  As regards tillage, they have neither the stock nor the capital to make use of their land.  There is another reason <Col N="1054" /> that I would urge against this Bill.  In the rural and urban areas a big number of new houses have been built principally on borrowed money, loans or grants.  That money is now going to be recovered from the people in the form of increased rates.  It is really putting a premium on people who improved their houses and who have little gardens attached to them.  In the rural towns we have a big number of houses that were improved.  The occupiers were in much the same position as the people I have been referring to. The money had to be borrowed to carry out the improvements, or they may have got a grant or a loan.</P>
      <P>This Bill will react on such people in four ways.  In the first place it will increase their rates; in the second, their licence duty; in the third, their income-tax, and, lastly, it will mean an increase in the ground rent electricity rate.  An increase in valuations will mean an increase in rates.  If the valuation of licensed premises is increased, the licence duty will be increased. There will also be an increase in income-tax as well as an increase in the ground rent when the electricity bill is presented to a house-holder.  In the rural towns the electricity is supplied on a ground rent charge based on the valuations plus a unit charge.  If the valuation of a house is £4, the ground rent payable for the whole year may work out at 9d. a week.  If the valuation is doubled, it means that the ground rent charge is going to be doubled whether the occupier burns electricity or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A big number of houses have been built in the Gaeltacht areas.  As Deputies know, the houses and the accommodation there are very poor. The valuation on the old houses averaged from 5/- to 10/- a year. Many of them have been replaced by new houses on which I expect the valuation will be £2 or £3 a year.  Take it that the rates are 16/- or 17/- in the £, if the valuations on these new houses are doubled, it will bring the rates on them up to £5 a year as against the small amount that had to be paid in the old days when the rates were based on a valuation of say 10/- a year.  The result will be to tax these poor people very heavily.  I do not know how they <Col N="1055" /> are going to meet the demands to be made on them under this Bill.  They live in mountain areas and have to eke out an existence from the bit of land attached to their homes.  The remainder of the land they hold is of very little use.  Difficulty will be experienced, too, in collecting increased demands from the people in the urban areas.  As far as one can judge many of them are unable to pay their present rents or rates.  If these are doubled what is the position going to be, especially when so many of them find it impossible to get employment.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see that both agricultural land and the property of the railways are exempt from the provisions of the Bill.  That surely is an admission that agricultural land is not able to bear any further taxation.  I have observed that people up and down the country are passing resolutions protesting against this measure.  The people in those resolutions declare that they cannot afford to pay the increased taxation foreshadowed.  I have here a resolution passed by the Mayo County Council which I propose to read to the House.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That we, the members of the Mayo County Council register an emphatic protest against the enactment of the proposed Bill for raising the valuation on all houses, buildings, shops and factories.  When we consider the excellent manner in which the people of Mayo have discharged their responsibilities in the matter of the payment of their rates, notwithstanding the adverse circumstances with which they have had to contend in recent years; we consider that any proposal calculated to increase the burdens on them is iniquitous.  We call on our representatives in the Oireachtas, irrespective of Party affiliations, to unite in vehement opposition to a Bill that if enacted would place increased responsibilities on the shoulders of the people already staggering under the burdens that at present they have to bear.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That resolution has come from the premier body in the County Mayo.  The members of it have a good idea of the <Col N="1056" /> demands that farmers have to meet. They know that they are not in a position to meet any further demands.</P>
    <P>In the bigger towns we have a number of people who had to borrow money from different sources to buy out the houses they occupy.  At the time of their purchase the valuations on them were at a certain figure.  In many cases these houses were purchased on bank loans to be repaid in from ten to fifteen years.  If many of those people are finding it difficult to meet their repayment obligations to the banks, or other sources, what is their position going to be if their valuations are increased? They will not be able to bear the burden.</P>
    <P>I submit to the House that this is not an opportune time for the introduction of a Bill such as this.  At this time the people were not looking forward to increased demands being made on them.  In fact, their hopes were in the other direction.  We have inspectors and engineers going around the country at the present time.  They will not be very welcome people when they come to the little towns and the big towns to do the work foreshadowed in this measure.  I appeal to the Minister to make an inquiry into the condition of the people before he proceeds further with a measure such as this, a measure which proposes to place additional burdens on the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the Fine Gael Party know their own business better than any outsider, but, at the same time, I cannot help remarking that it is a pity they have decided to make this Bill a Party measure. In my opinion, the question of national valuation is a very big question that deserves objective criticism and objective examination. There could be a very serious discussion on the principle and its application.  But, of course, directly it was decided to make this a Party measure&mdash;it was decided by the Opposition that it was to be treated as a Party measure&mdash;you open the way for all the bunk about the Bill affecting every phase of life, every class of people, increasing the cost of living, and even affecting unemployment. That sort of thing, to my mind, is not <Col N="1057" /> worthy of a measure of this kind.</P>
      <P>Listening to the speeches that have been delivered, it looks to me as if there was no particular desire to treat the Bill on its merits.  There was a sentence in Deputy Cosgrave's statement which I took to be the official reply to the case made for the Bill. The sentence is almost too flippant to be so regarded, but yet it is the only sentence in the speech in which the arguments laid down in the White Paper are dealt with.  The sentence is this: &ldquo;As things are, we can settle between ourselves that if somebody is not paying enough he can salve his conscience by realising that somebody else is paying too much.&rdquo;  That is an extraordinarily flippant sentence to be, as I say, uttered as the official reply to the arguments for the Bill.  Would Deputy Cosgrave, if he were head of the Government, make that statement? If he were even a member of the Government, would he make that statement, that a person who is not paying enough can salve his conscience by realising that somebody else is paying too much?  What about the person who is paying too much?  Does Deputy Cosgrave not acknowledge any responsibility to him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we are told that there are big anomalies and big injustices in the present system of valuation, is that the way that big question should be dealt with?  Deputy Cosgrave was supported by Deputy O'Sullivan in a speech that was even more flippant.  I must say of Deputy O'Sullivan that he seemed thoroughly to enjoy his own speech. Though he quoted Section 14 of the White Paper, not for a moment did he deal with the arguments in Section 14. He referred to the &ldquo;aesthetic&rdquo; and &ldquo;mathematical&rdquo; niceties of the Bill. He referred, in what one might call a sneering tone, to the case that is made in the White Paper that there are at the present time big anomalies and big injustices as between one taxpayer and one ratepayer and another. Deputy O'Sullivan devoted practically the whole of his speech to the question: Is the Bill demanded by the local authorities?  It seems to me that the Government, in a big question of this kind, should not wait for any demand; if they are conscious of big anomalies <Col N="1058" /> and big injustices, it is their job to put those things right, and if that is not the duty of the Government, I do not know what their duty is.  If the position was, with regard to injustices of that kind between one citizen and another, that the Government said: &ldquo;Do not bother about those things; the persons concerned can salve their consciences&rdquo;&mdash;to use Deputy Cosgrave's statement, &ldquo;in a particular way&rdquo;&mdash;then that Government would be taking a very irresponsible view of their duties.</P>
    <P>Curiously enough, Deputy O'Sullivan, as he made the case that the local authorities do not want the Bill, forecast that the local authorities will make the fullest use of it, when it is passed, for the purpose of squandermania. It does not look to me&mdash;and I challenged the Deputy on the point&mdash; that the two things go together.  It is an extraordinary thing, if the local bodies feel so much that this Bill is not wanted, that they feel at the same time that, when it is passed, they will not be able to resist the temptation to plunge into squandermania.  Deputy O'Sullivan dwelt at considerable length on what he said almost inevitably would happen, on the inevitability of extravagance on the part of local authorities.  One can almost see him visualising the Kerry County Council digging new lakes in Killarney or broadening the Kenmare River or perhaps trying their hand at draining Bantry Bay, he was so confident that the increased valuations, which he seems to expect from this Bill, would give the chance for extravagant expenditure.</P>
    <P>But is it true that local authorities generally are keen to increase taxation and squander the ratepayers' money? It seems to me a big injustice to local authorities to make the allegation.  It is the boast of most local authorities, it is the proudest thing they can accomplish, whenever they are able, to reduce the rates.  It is very rarely it happens, and in that connection I would remark that the statement repeated throughout the debate that increased valuation has always been followed by increased taxation is a fatuous statement.  I submit that statement could not be tested, and for <Col N="1059" /> this reason: that in our generation both central and local governments have always been faced with increased expenditure regardless of valuation. When the demand for increased services was made, taxation had to be increased.  There has never been any test, and the person who says that increased valuation has always been followed by increased expenditure has no way of supporting his argument by evidence.  It has not been possible to test that point.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy can attack the Minister on whatever bad headline he may have given, but in regard to the Valuation Bill, to talk in that way and repeat a statement of that kind is not contributing to the criticism that such a Bill deserves.  I submit it is not at all fair to local authorities to assert that they are always eager to go out on extravagant expenditure or increase taxation.  I do not know whether this Bill is going to lead to increased valuations or not, but I should like to hear some reply to the arguments in that White Paper that there are the most serious anomalies existing, and the most serious injustices. I should like to hear some suggestion as to how the Government can deal with them otherwise than by a Bill of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk <Col N="1060" /> about the necessity for encouraging farmers to improve their buildings. Everybody agrees on that, but how? Surely, it might have been suggested prior to this that the principle of valuation ought to be suspended?  Why did the Deputies opposite wait for this Bill to be introduced to ask that the principle of valuation should be suspended in the case of farm buildings? Surely, we can deal with that in a separate way?  If the principle of valuation should be suspended as a means of encouraging farmers to improve their buildings, we can deal with that at any time.  Deputies can put down a resolution on that subject at any time in the next seven years, and it can be dealt with on its merits.</P>
    <P>At present the principle of valuation, I understand, is in operation.  Deputy Hughes suggested that it was not in operation, that rate collectors have been ignoring their statutory duties and have not been reporting improvements to farm buildings.  He gave that as a reason why the present Bill should not be passed.  That is a curious way of helping farmers, that local rate collectors should be encouraged to ignore their statutory duty and not to report improvements on farm buildings. Surely, we ought to have a more direct and honest method of helping farmers than that.  I doubt very much if what Deputy Hughes stated is applicable to the country in general.  It may be the case in his county, to some extent, but it is certainly not generally true of other counties.  Remember, if farmers are to be helped in that way, this Bill will not be operating for at at least seven years, probably for ten years, in rural areas.  It is a rather strange proposal, put forward by the Leader of the Opposition, that seven years or ten years hence the principle of valuation should be suspended in the case of improvements to farm buildings. That is put forward as a means of helping the farmers.  If they do not require any more immediate help than that they must be in a stronger position than we thought.  I think that is an example of the very strained effort there has been to make a case against this Bill.</P>
    <P>I am really curious to know what it is that actuated the Opposition to <Col N="1061" /> decide to make the Bill a Party measure and to oppose it.  There are curious political implications in the opposition.  There is the implication, for instance, that the present Government is not likely to be removed for seven or ten years&mdash;a rather extraordinary implication and not a very healthy sign, in my opinion.  Again and again, it has been said that the Minister's sole purpose in introducing the Bill was to enable him to increase taxation, both local and central.  One Deputy&mdash;I think it was Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney&mdash;went so far as to say that he was preparing the way for a withdrawal of the agricultural grant. Well, that is intended either to imply that the present Minister for Finance and the present Government will be in power seven or ten years hence, or it is a very considerable bouquet to throw at the Minister to suggest that he is so anxious to pave the way for his successors to carry out that policy.</P>
    <P>Then, it would look as if, on their own premises, Deputies opposite were running away from derating.  Last year they toured the country and they told the farmers that it was quite wrong that they should have to pay rates on agricultural land, that it was right that the urban community should take over these charges, or that they should, at least, be made national charges.  Now, on their own premises, the valuations of urban property are going to be considerably increased.  On their own premises again, the rates on such property are going to be much more substantial and consequently the rates on farmers should be a great deal less.  Yet, Deputies protest against that and apparently consider that their attitude here is quite consistent with the principle of derating that they have advocated so strenuously throughout the country.  I think the two things are rather inconsistent and I should like to hear somebody say how they can plead that urban dwellers are not in a position to bear anything in the way of increased charges and, at the same time, how they can tell the farmers that urban dwellers should bear the expense of derating agricultural land.  I think that there is a very big discrepancy between these two arguments and I should like to hear it explained.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1062" /> It looked, at times, as if Deputies had made a very extraordinary discovery in pleading that the person of enterprise, the person who had extended his buildings, who had improved his business, should not be penalised.  It looked as if they had made a discovery by which the poor, the lazy and the inefficient should pay the cost of government, local and national.  It is a very regrettable thing &mdash;it is one of the bad features of valuation&mdash;that those who do show enterprise, those who do extend their businesses and improve their buildings, have to pay increased charges, but I should like to know what is the remedy for that?  Income-tax has been described as the fairest of all taxes, but the same argument applies to income-tax. It is the industrious and the successful who pay income-tax.  The inefficient and the lazy generally have nothing to tax.  When Deputies make use of that argument, they should have some alternative in their minds.</P>
    <P>One learned Deputy seemed to enjoy very much his own wit when making remarks of this kind: &ldquo;There is no market for cathedrals of late days; there are no tenants lining up at house agents looking for cathedrals.&rdquo;  As I read the Bill, cathedrals and churches are excluded from its provisions.  It looks as if that Deputy had simply decided to make a speech on the Bill without bothering to read it.  The same Deputy, I think it was, who made the case that there was an altogether new situation during the past 20 years.  I think that is one of the very big reasons why a new valuation is so urgent.  There is undoubtedly a new situation, an entirely new situation in our generation, a situation that was not even thought of 30 years ago, a situation in which, in the big centres at least, it is very hard to get houses to rent.  Consequently the valuation of houses that are available for renting are very considerably increased.  It seems to me that that alone would create a need for a new valuation, instead of being regarded or used as a reason why valuation should not be proceeded with at the present time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton similarly dwelt on that situation to-day, and, when <Col N="1063" /> I ventured to interrupt him, and to ask him when did he hope that that situation would change, he could not attempt to give an estimate. As far as we can see, there will be no change for a very long time. Surely, it would be a very grave neglect of duty on the part of the Government to ignore that situation.  It comes curiously, indeed, from Deputy Norton that he should invite the Government to ignore that situation&mdash;a situation where there is a very great scarcity of houses, particularly houses bringing big rents&mdash;that he should tell them not to pay any attention to it, and that he should say there is no need for this Bill.  It comes curiously from a Labour leader that he should say that that is not a situation that should cause any anxiety, and that we have more important things to look after.  Again, I think in his case he had not thought out the need for the Bill, and that he is mistaken in his approach to it.</P>
    <P>The Bill is very carefully constructed, and a very strong case has been made for it.  It is regrettable that there should be so many prophecies of increased taxation and of all sorts of evils arising from it.  During the debate, there were a great many references to the report of the Banking Commission.  Deputy Cosgrave used what I considered to be a laborious argument, but one that everybody would be prepared to sympathise with if put forward on its merits.  He said that the question of the balance of payments was causing anxiety and would be likely to cause anxiety in the future, that it was essential, for that reason, we should encourage exports, that, in order to encourage exports, farmers should be encouraged to improve their buildings, that in order that they might be encouraged to improve their buildings it was desirable that improvements to buildings should not be revalued or subject to increased taxation.  As I said before, that is a thing we can debate at any time.  The principle is legally in operation at the moment, and it has not been brought to our notice as a thing deserving remedy. There is plenty of time within the next seven or ten years to consider whether that would be a useful method of <Col N="1064" /> encouraging farmers to improve their business.  We can consider that matter at any time within the next seven or ten years, but, even if it were so decided, it would, I think, be desirable to proceed with the valuation of all immovable property.  We have to remember that we are largely governed by statistics at the present time, and it is not at all in accord with the importance we give to statistics generally that we should have on this matter figures which are out of date by half a century, figures which at the present time have really no meaning.</P>
    <P>Revaluation will not commit us in any way to taxing farmers or to taxing anybody.  The question of valuation can be entirely separated from that of charges arising from valuation.  We ought to be able to trust ourselves, in spite of all these prophecies regarding the action of local authorities.  We ought to reject that argument and say that we can trust ourselves to create and apportion charges that are according to our means, irrespective of any figures bearing on valuation.  When Deputies quote the Banking Commission, I would remind them that a witness before that Commission, Mr. Sherlock, was questioned as to why the credit of Dublin was not as good as the credit of Belfast or cities in England which basically were in no better position than Dublin.  Mr. Sherlock replied: &ldquo;You have only got to go over to the Oireachtas and you will hear speeches threatening pending bankruptcy and things like that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was a pretty serious charge. You had the City Manager of Dublin telling the Banking Commission that certain Deputies were really preventing him from being able to get money to proceed with housing and other schemes.  Surely, Deputies might be warned by that statement and not indulge in prophecies that the country is about to break down, that this Bill will mean that both central and local charges will rise to an intolerable extent and that the country will be in a tragic position.  The Bill before us deserves more serious consideration and I suggest that until we have heard some definite contradiction of the case made for the Bill in the White <Col N="1065" /> Paper, until a really serious case is made against the Bill, we should not refuse to pass it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello pleaded for a scientific system of valuation.  He did not give us any indication of what he meant by a scientific system of valuation. If he had, we might be able to say that this Bill should be amended so as to be made more scientific. &ldquo;Scientific&rdquo; is rather a vague word and the bulk of us were, I think, wondering whether the Deputy had anything in mind when he used it or whether it was only a word.  I think that it was only a word and until I hear more about that &ldquo;scientific system&rdquo;, I shall be content to vote for the Bill before us.</P>

      <P>In the opening and closing portion of his speech, Deputy Moore thought well to lecture the political Opposition for having treated this Bill as, what he described as, a Party measure.  I would remind Deputy Moore that Opposition Deputies have their responsibilities as well as Government Deputies and that they face up to those responsibilities just as seriously as Government Deputies do. There is a responsibility on every Deputy in a Parliament to criticise to the full every measure introduced by any Government and, particularly, a measure that appears to carry within it new taxing possibilities.  The Deputy told us that because we did that we were treating this as a Party measure.  I wonder where Deputy Moore was for the last three weeks. There have been, I think, 27 speeches on this Bill since the Minister introduced it.  With the exception of Deputy Moore himself, every speaker was in opposition to the Bill.  From this Party, from the Labour Party, from Independent members of the House and even from the Government Party, speeches were delivered in opposition to the Bill.  Are members of Deputy Moore's Party joining with us in making this a Party measure?  If ever there is evidence that a Bill is not a Party measure, it is when you have all Parties joining either to support or condemn.  In this particular case, so far as this House has been vocal, with the exception of the distinguished <Col N="1066" /> Deputy himself, every Deputy who has spoken has been opposed to the Bill.</P>

I am reminded that there is another distinguished exception and I make the Minister a present of him&mdash;Deputy Corry, With the exception of Deputy Moore and Deputy Corry, every Deputy, irrespective of Party, was joined on a common platform of opposition and linked together by a common bond of fear of the consequences of this Bill regarding his constituents. Deputy Moore, having given us that little lecture on parliamentary behaviour&mdash;that we should not oppose a taxing Bill because it is a great national instrument &mdash; proceeded to quote from one individual who gave evidence at the Banking Commission to the effect that credit was jeopardised because speeches were made at times pointing out the possibility of bankruptcy in the offing.  When the Deputy was giving that particular quotation, I wondered to whom he was referring, because I remember very distinguished Deputies making speeches not only in the Dáil but at every cross roads in the country telling all and sundry that the country was going headlong into a bog of bankruptcy, and that the financial outlook for this country was as black as night.  Consequently, I think the Deputy's little lecture might be given in a more appropriate atmosphere if it had been given in his own Party rooms, instead of to other Deputies in this House who do not belong to his own Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy spoke at great length as to the enormous injustices that were going to be rectified by this great instrument, this new Bill.  The Deputy has represented one constituency for a very considerable number of years, and he must know it intimately.  In spite of those grave injustices and inequalities, and with his very deep knowledge of one county here on the flank of Dublin, he was in the same position as his Minister&mdash;he was not prepared to <Col N="1067" /> give even one example of those appalling injustices and inequalities. Quite glibly he slipped over the fact that, if there were grave injustices in the past or at the present moment, the people suffering under those grave injustices must be blessed with the patience of Job, because they never utilised the ordinary power that is there for an individual to ask to have the injustices removed and his premises revalued.  Those people, suffering under crushing injustices, if we are to believe the Deputy, must have been functioning under the most inhuman public boards, because none of the public boards in those counties in which the people are suffering from such grave injustices ever utilised the ordinary machinery, which was there all the time, to ask to have the injustices removed.  The Deputy was in the position of a man doing his job.  It was his job to support the Bill, and in supporting the Bill he did not worry what tosh he slung on to another bundle of tosh once he put in so many minutes by the face of the clock.</P>
    <P>On occasions like this, I want to say frankly that my sympathies are always with any Minister for Finance.  It is the function of a Minister for Finance to be the collector for his colleagues. When his colleagues go around the country collecting golden keys and silver trowels, and being feted and banqueted, there is scarcely a body of people from Cork to Donegal who would ever get up a reasonable pretext for a banquet for any Minister for Finance.  He has always got to take the kicks, while the others lower &ldquo;the bubbly&rdquo;.  He is merely doing his job, and the only real defence for a Bill such as this is a defence which the Minister could not or dare not make, namely, that he is merely doing his job; that it is his function to devise ways and means of getting more money out of the pockets of the people to satisfy the demands of his colleagues.  He could not make that case, but that is the only honest case which could be made for a Bill of this kind.  The Minister knows, probably as well as I or anybody else, that taxation at the present moment, both local and central, has reached what should be considered the <Col N="1068" /> peak point, what fair-minded people should consider the peak point, and that every possible effort should be made to prevent its going above that point.</P>
    <P>The people of this country have been wonderfully patient in the way they have borne one burden after another, but the fact that they have been patient should not encourage anybody to keep piling it on.  In most countries which went into the Great War, when they were anxious to pay tribute to the soldiers who represented them in the fight, when they wanted to pay tribute to the soldiers who made sacrifices in an uncomplaining manner, an institution grew up, a shrine where all people pay homage, a shrine to the unknown soldier, not homage or tribute to any particular individual but a tribute to him as representative of millions of other gallant men.  We have no such institution in this country, but in front of the Department of Finance we could, with an equally strong case, build up such an institution to the unknown taxpayer, and every one of us could join in paying tribute to that unknown individual, representing all, for the uncomplaining way in which he has borne the burdens of years gone by.  In my opinion he is the greatest hero of them all&mdash;the man who has the courage, as things are, to build and found a home, with everybody apparently busy in endeavours to place new burdens on him, not only now but in the future, new and continuing burdens.  He is the greatest hero of all.</P>
    <P>We had the Minister, in his introductory statement, pointing out that this Bill was really seriously required, because we had no general revaluation in this country for 80 years, and that there were all kinds of anomalies, inequalities, and injustices, but his main case seemed to be based on the fact that it was 80 years since we had a revaluation in the country.  That particular argument at least cuts both ways.  If we have got along without it for 80 years, and if we have done very well without it for 80 years, why select a moment like this&mdash;when taxes are at their peak point, when people are getting seriously alarmed and seri- <Col N="1069" /> ously perturbed with regard to the tendency for every tax to go up and up, and for no tax ever to go down&mdash;to place further burdens on the people, or at all events to forge an instrument which may have the result of placing further burdens on the people?</P>
    <P>If the people have been patient and tolerant, and have been restrained from anything in the nature of noisy demonstrations against high-pressure taxes, we should not presume on their patience being unlimited, and we should not do anything to provoke widespread and general complaints, particularly if the only case that could be made for precipitating such a situation is the case that a thing was not done for 80 years and, therefore, should be done now, or because a thing is done every ten years in Great Britain, that we must keep in step, and must obviously do it every ten years, too.</P>
    <P>There is no parallel between the two countries, fortunately in some ways, unfortunately in others.  Great Britain is a country highly industrialised.  If you visit any village in Great Britain, and visit it again after five years, it is completely changed, either by big industries coming in, or some pre-existing big industry going out.  The real values, aside from valuation of premises, change over there from day to day, or certainly from year to year, because places that were merely tiny cross-road villages at one date would be comparatively large and prosperous towns five years later.  There is apparently a very sound case in a country subject to such violent changes for a periodical revaluation.  But the idea of suggesting that, merely because we live near that country, under entirely dissimilar conditions, we must do likewise, is not arguable.  Everyone knows that, more or less, our Civil Service grew directly out of the British Civil Service, and that kind of headline, that what is done over there must necessarily be right, is the Civil Service mind.  It is the Civil Service mind that has dictated this Bill.  It is not the gravity or the number of injustices. If there are injustices, many or few, there is machinery at the disposal of this State to rectify them, and to remove anomalies.  It is an extraordinary <Col N="1070" /> thing that that machinery has been either deliberately ignored or, if it has not been invoked, it is at least reasonably evident that the injustices, in fact, are not there.</P>
    <P>What do the alleged injustices amount to?  That myself and, say, another person, own premises, that my valuation is £20, and the valuation of his premises, which are three times as good as mine, only £20, and, therefore, I am suffering under an immense injustice. How is it proposed to meet the injustice?  By putting my valuation up to £30, and his valuation up to £60?  My injustice is relieved or removed by putting an extra £10 penalty on my back for the purposes of income-tax directly, and potentially for paying higher rates, and I have the satisfaction of knowing that, if I am carrying more, my neighbour is carrying three times as much.  It is very little satisfaction, if I have to curtail the amount of money for the household at the end of the week, to know that the other man's wife is suffering three times as hard.</P>
    <P>We had different points of view expressed here with regard to the position of farmers under the Bill.  We had Deputy Moore's political reminder of the fact that this Party had advocated the complete removal of rates off agricultural land, and that in this Bill agricultural land is specifically ruled out.  I agree with those who regretted that particular point.  When we advocated that policy, as we still advocate it, and when a commission was appointed as a result of that advocacy to inquire into the question of the advisability of removing rates off agricultural land, it was because we believed that the pressure of the rates at present on agricultural land was too heavy, and too severe an overhead burden on the land itself.  But, at least, there was always in my recollection a demand for reducing the rates on agricultural land.  Now, apparently, the group or class of people to be ruled out of the possibility of a reduction are those who, all the time, have been demanding a reduction, and that, even the Minister for Agriculture in the present Government admitted, time and again in this House, and outside it, had a fair case either for removal or <Col N="1071" /> for a reduction, if the money could be found.</P>
    <P>But the people, who, according to this side of the House were unable to bear the burden of rates, and according to the Government side had a fair case for getting the rates removed, are the one class of people specifically picked out, not even to have their case considered, with this exception, that while the rates on land cannot go down, at all events under this Bill, the rates on their houses and buildings are likely to go up.  Assuming I am correct in saying that the rates are likely to go up on every piece of immovable property in city, town and country that comes for investigation under this Bill, the valuations will go up.  We will leave the rates out for the present.  The White Paper circulated with the Bill is clearly indicative that that is the result expected.  The Minister's statement, and Deputy Moore's substantiation of that statement, to the effect that public authorities would have more facilities for borrowing to a greater extent, after revaluation is effected are clearly indicative of the fact that the result that is calculated is that the valuation of premises will go up.</P>
    <P>In addition, we have our own experience, within this State and outside of it, that every place and every time where there was a revaluation carried out, the valuation of premises went up. The odd case where the valuation of a premises ever went down, if it is not non-existent, is certainly just as rare as a white blackbird.  It is not a thing unknown.  It is a thing seen, perhaps, once in a life-time.</P>
    <P>In addition, we had the Minister's Budget anticipation of two years ago where he assessed income-tax on houses on that Fianna Fáil fraction of five-fourths and, for that abnormal fraction and that new extortion from the people, the justification and the defence and the explanation were based entirely on the fact that a revaluation was overdue and that that was, as it were, in anticipation of a revaluation.</P>
    <P>It is because of all those things and all those signs, that I assume that the result will be an increased valuation on every premises and any premises that come under the survey.  We had <Col N="1072" /> it in Dublin; we had it in Waterford; we had it in Ennis.  The people ever the Border, in the North of Ireland, had a revaluation and the result in every case and every place where there was a revaluation was for the valuations to go up.  The next result was for the rates to keep in step with the new valuation.  I agree that it is not imperative, when a valuation goes up, that the out-goings for rates must necessarily go up.  If we were like children, working with a pencil and slate, we could show that if the valuation is £X and the rates are 20/- in the £, if you make the valuation twice £X the rates then will only be 10/- in the £.  Life is not as simple as that and human nature is not controlled and human weaknesses, too, by the slate and the pencil.  At all events, experience is worth something, and experience should have taught us that when a rate has been for years, we will say, 10/- or 12/- in the £ and the valuation is doubled, there may be a drop for the moment or there may be a stationary period, but it will not be many years until, based on the new valuation, the rates are back again to the old figure.  Very useful work may be done out of that but you have not increased the financial value of the people by doubling the valuation of their premises.  Nevertheless, you will be extracting twice as much from them.</P>
    <P>With regard to the premises of farmers, it has been the position in rural Ireland that the amount of the valuation placed on the farm and out-offices, as compared with the amount of the valuation placed on the farm itself, that that on the house and out-offices was practically insignificant and I believe it would be still insignificant in a joint survey.  But, if the residence of the farmer is to stand alone as an isolated building, and if the headline set for the impartial examiner that is carrying out the survey is to be the net rental of those premises, and if the new valuation is to be the net rental of the farmer's residence, I do not know in rural Ireland where they can get sufficient samples.  The only samples of houses let in rural Ireland are the labourers' cottages all around <Col N="1073" /> and that will be a standard to build up from.  With tariffs and increased costs of one kind and another, the average weekly rent of a labourer's cottage at the moment is in the neighbourhood of 2/6.  If you have 15 to 20 labourers' cottages in a townland, with a rental of 2/6 a week each, that is £6 or £7 a year, and the farmer's house is, we will say, twice as good as a labourer's cottage, the valuation placed on that house must, according to the headline set in the Bill, be £14 for the house alone and the new valuation set on the cottage will apparently be the annual rent.</P>
    <P>I do not know if the position of rural Ireland has been fully considered before it was included in this Bill.  It strikes me that there a number of very grave injustices that will arise and, even assuming that the case made is a sound case, that there are some injustices at the moment, which it is hoped to remove, you will not be doing any good by removing some injustices if you replace them by thousands of other injustices and by revaluing labourers' cottages and farm-houses just after a period, as the Minister for Local Government told us, of intense building, and intense building at the peak point of cost, when the cost of the building was increased by a number of factors, internal and external, by an increase in the price of the raw materials, by tariffs on these materials coming in and by the increased price of the home material as a result of the tariff.  Those new houses can only be set at a rental arrived at by working back from the gross cost of the house.</P>
    <P>Now, on a rental, inflated because of a number of accidental conditions, we are to have the valuation increased because of that figure, that is, we are increasing the valuation because of a number of accidental and, possibly, purely passive factors.  We are getting very near the point where you are taxing people, or propose to tax people, on taxes already paid.  Those tariffs on incoming raw materials are taxes.  There is a subsidy paid towards the building of every house; that is met by taxes.  We have paid our taxes on the raw material.  We have paid the subsidy out of the taxes and now, on those taxes, we will pay further <Col N="1074" /> taxes because it is the gross cost of the building that decides the rental and the valuation is to be based on the rental and the rates will depend on the valuation.</P>
    <P>There has been a matter referred to by other speakers which, I presume, the Minister will make some attempt to clear up when he is closing this debate, that is the reference to gardens, as distinct from farms Gardens around a house are to be taxed separately with the house, or as a common unit with the house.  I do not know how exactly in rural Ireland you would discriminate between a garden proper, a lawn and an agricultural field in front of or behind the house.  There are houses here and there where attempts have been made to turn out the place in a better style than, let us say, 50 years ago.  A little piece of land around the house had been turned into a shrubbery, or has some kind of fancy hedge around it.  Heretofore, that house stood in its nakedness in the middle of a field, with the cattle, sheep and goats grazing up against the front door.  Now, a little ornamental plot is in most cases enclosed, with perhaps a little wicket gate leading into it.  If that is to increase the valuation, and, consequently, the rates, and if people are to be driven back to old slovenly standards, if they are to be taxed, in addition to everything else, for cleanliness and tidiness, I think we are going in the wrong direction.</P>
    <P>Cleanliness, tidiness and neatness, and more cleanliness, more tidiness and more neatness are what is wanted in both city and country, and far from putting penalties on the back of the exemplary person who has set a headline in that respect, I would say that you should consider the advisability of giving relief to people who have devoted portion of their land, not only to beautifying their own houses, but the appearance of the countryside generally. That particular portion of land devoted to the ornamental garden is not productive; it is not profit-making.  It is a part of the land available for profit and for production which has been freely and voluntarily surrendered in the interests of neatness, tidiness and <Col N="1075" /> beauty.  A relief should be given in such cases rather than to make that an instrument for further taxation, or a possible instrument of further taxation.</P>
    <P>In cities and in urban towns, I believe there is very real, very general, and very genuine alarm at this Bill.  So much has already been said that I did not intend to speak.  This is the third or fourth day of the debate, and I have listened to many speeches. I saw that everything that could be said had been said, and I had no intention of speaking, but I was inundated with such volumes of correspondence, most of it from people I had never met or seen, putting it up to me, as a Deputy representing two counties, that strong opposition must be given to this Bill, and that they were entitled to have their feelings and sentiments voiced in Parliament.  It was the volume of demand from people who do not belong to my particular political persuasion as well as from those who do, that made it imperative that their demands should be expressed here.  In rural Ireland, in the village, the town and the urban centre, there is alarm and uneasiness.  No one living in any of those areas can see any result but the one&mdash;further demand, higher rates&mdash;and that at a time when they are going through, in many towns, perhaps as difficult a time as ever they went through, with business slipping away by reason of greater transport facilities, with the buses taking their customers and bringing them up to the bigger stores in the city, or the larger towns, and with the same problem down there as is up here, of the person attempting either to repay the building cost of a house, or to repay the purchase price of a house, by the instalment, hire purchase system.</P>
    <P>There are hundreds of thousands of people now dwelling in houses which they are purchasing on the instalment system.  They are not the wealthy people.  They are the comparatively poor people, living out of small salaries or wages, and people living out of a small salary or out of a constant wage are people who lay out every penny of their income from week to week or month to month.  So much provision <Col N="1076" /> is made for rent; so much for fuel and light; so much for provisions; so much for the other purposes of the family; and so much for meeting rates and taxes.  For the amount which the Minister or any public body is going to get out of these unfortunate people by increasing their valuations and their rate demand, is it considered how gravely the family economy will be upset?  The whole equilibrium of the household of humble people living out of a fixed salary or wage could well be upset by an extra demand of 1/- or 2/- a month, and not a week.  The housewife in such places lays out the money, and the better the household, the more accurately the monthly income or weekly wage is laid out.  It is laid out to the odd ounce of tobacco; it is laid out to the last sixpence.</P>
    <P>If, through State interference, there is a new burden placed on them, even to the extent of as much as 1/- in the month, it may very well cause a very serious upset in the economy of such a household.  The new charge cannot be offset by any reduction in any of the other fixed charges.  Every penny, every sixpence and every shilling has already been laid out, and there is only one field for economy.  That is, in the money allowed for provisioning the family.  If they have to economise to the extent of 1/-, 2/- or 3/- a month, there is that much less to be expended on food, or perhaps on some little comfort, some modest article that such people might regard as a luxury.</P>
    <P>If the Bill is as outlined by the Minister and as outlined by Deputy Moore, not a Bill to increase revenue and not a Bill to increase rates, but merely a Bill to remove certain inequalities and anomalies that exist here and there; if that is the only reason for the Bill, I think there is no excuse or justification for going on with a Bill which is causing consternation in five out of every six homesteads in the country.  I suggest that the real reason is the one I stated at the beginning, that it is imperative to get more money, that it is absolutely essential, because of the demands of others on the Minister, that every possible expedient and every possible device be utilised in order to extract more money from the <Col N="1077" /> people.  That may be, but at least the people are entitled to know what is being done and why it is being done, and, above all, Deputies in this House are entitled to know, before they vote for a Bill, the reasons they are voting for it and what the result of that Bill is going to be.  Deputy Moore may call it Party prejudice or anything else, but I think it is high time Deputies of all Parties in this House refused to vote for any Bill, no matter how plausible a case is made, if they are expected to vote in blinkers, as they are on this occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MatthewOReilly" hpid="Mr. O'Reilly Mr. O'Reilly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Higgins that it is his duty, as a member of the Opposition, of course, to be extremely critical when a question of taxation arises.  I suppose I must also agree that it is his privilege to exaggerate somewhat the principles of any measure of that nature when it comes before a House such as this.  I do not know that it is proper to state, as one Deputy has already stated, that this is not a Bill to revalue, but a Bill to increase taxation.  As far as I can see, it certainly will increase taxation in certain cases, in certain areas, certain towns and certain houses, and that it will decrease taxation in others.  I do not know much about the City of Dublin, but I am sure that there are parts of the City of Dublin paying, say, in local taxation huge sums that they really should not be paying and that there are portions of the city paying much smaller sums than they should really be paying. Great changes have taken place, much the same as down the country.  I see towns in which there were three or four or five people who were industrially-minded, who speculated some money in the setting up of industries there and created a population in that town, and I see other towns, that about 40 or even 30 years ago were just as prosperous, and possibly more prosperous, rapidly decaying.  The prosperity of the last kind of town I mentioned was due to its being, perhaps, the terminus of a railway; people came in and stopped in the town before fairs, stayed there the night before, took the train and that sort of thing, and gave an added value to the town and to its business <Col N="1078" /> houses.  Transport has its effect also.</P>
      <P>I do know quite well that it is possible for Deputies, who believe it is correct, to scare people, especially ratepayers down the country in the rural areas&mdash;to scare them with the threat of higher rates.  The rates are extremely high, and, unfortunately, they had to be high, because when we took over control as a Government here we found a very unfortunate situation. The people in almost all cases were houseless, and the labouring classes had not had any houses built for them for many years.  I am not saying that from any particular political motive.  The Ministers in the last Government, either the Minister for Local Government or other Ministers, possibly were engaged in repairing roads, but certainly there were very few houses built.  Very many houses had to be built during the last five or six years, and very many more houses will have to be built in the next few years. Those houses cannot be built without an appeal to the local ratepayers, and consequently it seems to be fruitful to talk a lot now about the desperate situation that will arise when these rates are increased, and this Bill is called, not a revaluation Bill, but a Bill to increase taxation.  In quite a number of resolutions that I read, that appeared without any doubt whatsoever.</P>
      <P>Now, I also agree with Deputy O'Higgins that the Minister for Finance has not as happy a position as Ministers in other Departments.  He has to collect money and to be very severe on the collector, and he has to pay out money and be very severe also. He must be exact in collecting it and he must be exact in paying it.  Hence he is a target for a great number of people, but this measure is going to take seven years to be carried out, and I wonder does the Opposition believe that this particular Minister will be the then Minister for Finance or that this particular Government will be the Government?  Do not they all agree that there is a principle involved, and the principle is to try to get those who can afford it to pay more and to try to get a reduction in the case of those who have to pay when they really cannot pay?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>Of revaluation.  There is nothing wrong with it.  Of course, if I were asked to criticise the thing I am not so sure that the method of revaluation might be all that one would desire, and I am not so sure that it is not possible to improve it.  Therefore, I think it can be agreed that the principle is right, and that some questions might be raised and some doubts expressed as to the methods that are going to be adopted.  It is not easy to adopt methods for a revaluation Bill, and it is incumbent that such a thing should be done.  As I said we are living in an age of change.  Very many things have to be done that were not even contemplated three or four or five years ago.  Towns are rapidly changing in value and it is essential that some steps be taken to see that the burden that is carried by people is equal to what they can bear to some extent.  That has not been the case up to the present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not, and it has not been the case for some years. Griffith's Poor Law Valuation and the valuation of houses operates to a very large extent on the value of land and the other valuations on the value of houses, and the time is ripe for some form of revaluation.  I should like to go a step further and see that there was a revaluation of land also.  It is a sort of stocktaking, and all <Col N="1080" /> countries do this sort of thing.  There is not anything unusual in it or anything to frighten people about it.  I believe that it is essential that it should be done.  Now, for example, take the valuation of any of the older type of houses in Dublin, houses that a few years ago were of great value, in which important people resided.  If you took those houses, say, by the weight of the bricks or the weight of the stones in them they would be extremely valuable, whereas the new style of house is the one that is needed to-day. Domestic servants have to get higher wages; they are scarcer; modern conveniences are demanded, and hence a new style of house is wanted.  Motor cars take people outside the cities and towns, and the result is that these houses are possibly of less value, so far as poor law valuation is concerned, than the older houses that are rapidly turning into tenements.  So that I cannot understand what is the great objection to the principle, if there is an objection, and I believe there is.</P>
      <P>The real matter that I should like to hear a good deal about is, what method and what standard are you going to apply.  When you satisfy yourself on that, you come back to the other side of it, and that is, that you hand that valuation over to the local authority.  A good many Deputies on the Opposition side, and possibly on this side, and I myself would agree, believe that many of these local councils, when they feel the pinch or a little pressed, will rub their hands and say: &ldquo;That is a nice, juicy, fat poor law valuation.&rdquo;  I am quite sure that if the valuation is increased all round &mdash;I do not believe it will be, only in certain instances&mdash;but suppose it is, is it not the duty of the Government to introduce legislation, and legislation can be introduced to prevent an excessive exaction of local rates?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it was Deputy Moore accused us on this side of the House of making a Party measure of this Bill.  As a matter of fact, I do not think there was ever a Bill brought into this House which received such an amount of public comment outside, nor was there ever a Bill which received such universal condemnation from all classes as this Bill has received.  In fact, if there was any independence or any freedom of thought left on the Fianna Fáil Benches, not alone would they not be able to get three members to stand up in favour of the Bill but the whole of the 77 Deputies, if they followed the exhortations of those whom they represent here, would have come out unanimously and vehemently against the Bill.  Everywhere up and down the country, at every council and committee meeting, in fact in some Fianna Fáil clubs, the opinion has been expressed universally that this is a very dangerous Bill.  I am of that opinion myself, apart from the opinion of those whom I represent here.  This is a very dangerous Bill, one of the most dangerous which has come before the House for a long time.  In fact, it is a much more dangerous Bill than the A.R.P.  Estimate or the Army Estimate which we considered last week, which was described as &ldquo;Aiken robbing the poor&rdquo;&mdash;A.R.P.  This Bill has got another name which I shall give it later.  I want to emphasise that this Bill is being shoved through the House not alone against the wishes of the representatives of the people in the House, but contrary to the expressed will of the people themselves.  I think that is a very grave step for any Minister to take at this particular time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My particular protest against this Bill is made in the interests of what I call the small town, the little national unit in the country which is fast disappearing and which is going to be hardest hit by this Bill.  In the County Cork we have 16 towns of a population of over 1,500.  These towns are going to feel the brunt of this Bill, and are going to feel it severely, particularly at a time when they are unable to stand up against it and when they can do <Col N="1083" /> nothing else but protest that they will not be able to resist the exactions that the Bill will make upon them.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that this Bill has been expressly brought in to remove inequalities in the present valuations, particularly with regard to the devaluation of money.  The Minister at one time had a great penchant for bringing in Bills for removing doubts.  If this Bill is going to remove inequalities, it has removed any doubts from my mind as to the ultimate end of the Bill.  It is, of course, a Bill to increase taxation, increase it very severely, and increase it in such a way that it is going to make the increase progressive.  The increase in local rating will be by geometrical progression in future, on a scale that has not been heard of in the past.  The White Paper attached to the Bill showed us exactly what to expect.</P>
    <P>The whole feeling underlying that explanatory White Paper is that this is a Bill to wipe out anomalies and to wipe out irregularities and that as money is less valuable now more taxes should be paid.  I want to point out that whenever valuation has been increased it was followed ultimately and very shortly by an increase in taxation. That experience ought to be worth something to the public.  Then we know that the Minister for Finance is needy and greedy.  We know that he is up against finding large sums of money for national and local purposes. We have that tendency of his already expressed in the very cute move he made with regard to the five-fourths valuation in connection with the schedule of income-tax.  At that time by one stroke of the pen he increased the valuation of the country by 25 per cent. Is not that enough to show what this Bill means in the mind of the Minister?</P>
    <P>The effects of this measure are going to fall heaviest upon the small towns in the country.  Farmers are nominally exempt.  Some of the cities have been already revalued.  But the depressed and small town is going to be hit hard. These small towns are already fast disappearing. Their business is decreasing and their population already is going down at an alarming rate; something must be done to keep up the <Col N="1084" /> rates of revenue to the normal level. Last night we had a speech from a Cork Deputy instancing the position of two local towns in his constituency. The valuation of these towns is in actual fact going down.  He knows the position.  Of course the valuation will go down because there is nothing to put up the real value of the two towns he represents.  The Deputy might extend that to the town from which I come and to nine or ten other towns in County Cork.  The valuation of all these towns will come down because the buildings, houses, stores, warehouses and other hereditaments have ceased to have any value at all&mdash;that is if the valuation is assessed on the money or earning power of the buildings. These towns are decrepit.  Now if the valuation of these towns goes down the social service demands which are increasing will have to be met.  That means that more rates must be paid by the survivors in these unfortunate areas.  In the last ten years a whole town has disappeared off the face of the earth from the County Cork.  Does not the Minister know it?  We have 16 small towns in County Cork and the population of these 16 towns has decreased in the last ten years by 2,100.  That is equal to the population of one small town.  These 2,100 people who have gone out of these 16 towns are the best of the people.  The people left behind are the people who did not have their bus fares to get out in time.  The condition of these towns is a problem that calls for the attention of the Government.</P>
    <P>I have often referred to the unreal atmosphere under which people in Dublin are living.  I would like if the Minister would leave the rich and wealthy atmosphere of Dublin and go down and look into the condition of the West Cork towns.  Indeed, he might look into the condition of all the towns in the South and West of Ireland.  I invite the Minister to pass down by Arklow, examine the position of the towns all along the Eastern and Southern coast, and wind up in Ballydehob. I would invite him to go to these towns and see how the people manage to live or exist.  Then he would have some idea of the real condition of the people who live in these small <Col N="1085" /> communities.  If he did so, he would come to realise the unreal atmosphere in which the people live here in Dublin as compared with the actual conditions of the rest of the country.</P>

      <P>If they did, it was by the pure force of ability and brains.  It was certainly through no love extended to them by the Dublin people.  These urbanised towns to which I refer have suffered in particular from one disadvantage, and that is with regard to the rates raised for poor law relief.  The ordinary urban town has no control whatsoever over the making of the rate for poor law purposes.  The county council simply puts a demand before that body and says, &ldquo;We want £2,500 or £3,000, and you must give us that.&rdquo; The little urban town has to provide that sum&mdash;indeed, a larger sum, because there is the cost of collecting it, and the deficiencies, if any, have got to be made up out of the town rate to meet this demand of the county council. The town commissioners or urban councillors have no voice whatever in the spending of that money.  There is there a great anomaly with regard to the rates raised for county purposes by the county authorities, and that is a matter on which the Minister should introduce legislation so as to give fair play to the urban authorities and relieve them in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Moore a while ago who told us that we should not be talking about local bodies increasing the rates; that these local bodies did not increase the rates for love of extracting the money from the people. No, I agree, but these local bodies are being pushed by Government policy. Under new legislation fresh demands are made upon them, and owing to a certain atmosphere that has been created by the Government and to meet demands for social services and other expenses over which they have no control, the local bodies have no choice in the matter.  The worst of it is that this sort of thing is going to continue.  The general tendency is for all taxation to go up, and it is going up at a time when <Col N="1086" /> the productivity of this country has gone down.  That is the time when taxation has shown a frightful increase. In 1931-1932 this country was producing £67,000,000 worth of agricultural produce.  That produce is down to-day to £41,000,000 and less.  In 1931 the national taxation was £22,000,000, and this has gone up now to the present figure of £30,000,000.  The general tendency is for productivity to go down and taxation to go up.  We have been told that agricultural productivity is going down because we are paying more attention to the industrial outlook. I believe it is now becoming clear that even in regard to the industrial outlook we are in a very critical condition.  A lot of the props keeping up the industrial side of our production are showing signs of decay.  There is every appearance that there is going to be a collapse.  I think the scandal revealed to us this morning in the Press with regard to bacon and pig prices is a forerunner of many others. We have heard this evening how the oil refinery in Dublin has been closed down&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to prove that this Bill is going to increase taxation. I am urging the Minister to have the Bill postponed.  The Bill is creating uncertainty and a feeling of instability in the minds of the people.  I think I am quite entitled to make that case. The outlook in the country is uncertain. We have just emerged from an economic war which has cost this country £50,000,000.  We are trying to put agriculture on a sound basis and we are endeavouring to bring about stability in the country.  This Bill is to take seven years to implement or put into operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, if we are to have seven more years of uncertainty and instability following the seven years of the economic war, I put it to the Minister what does he think will be the effect on the country?  Nobody will invest money in land or go into real estate while all this uncertainty continues.  There cannot be prosperity when the state of business is precarious and productivity <Col N="1087" /> of every kind is on the decline.  I put it to the Minister that this is the most inopportune time.  I urge him that it should be postponed until stabilised conditions are produced in the country. In addition to all the other things against the Bill there is the fact that we will have to pay for this valuation. The Cork County Council will have to pay £11,000 and not only that but the revision each year will cost the county £1,700.  This annual revision is going to become a general tax on the small poor towns to the bad financial position of which I have been referring. This annual revision will cost the unfortunate people in these towns 3d. in the £ in their rates, plus the 2½d. tax for the original revaluation.  I say this is a very inopportune time to bring in this Bill.  I am thoroughly against it, and I think that every member of the House who has any regard for the feelings of the people he represents must be as much against it as I am. It is said that there is no freedom of opinion left here.  We are accused of making this a Party matter.  We are doing nothing of the kind.  We do not regard it as a Party matter, but as one of very grave national concern.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows quite well that this Bill is going to do nothing except to extract more money from the people at a time when they can badly afford it.  I think I did understand the Minister to say that he intends to introduce later, arising out of this measure, legislation to deal with Electricity Supply Board charges and publicans' licences.  In view of the fact that the Electricity Supply Board is referred to in a section of the Bill, I think I will be in order in referring to that body.  The Electricity Supply Board came into some of the small towns in the country and took over the local undertakings which had certain easements in the matter of valuations.  The Electricity Supply Board increased those easements in value, in some cases to the extent of practically three times the amount of the original valuation.  I have a case <Col N="1088" /> in mind where a local undertaking had an easement valuation of £60.  After some reconstruction work had been carried out by the Electricity Supply Board, when they took over, the valuation was increased to £165.  But the position is that the Electricity Supply Board are not paying rates on the £165.  They are paying on the original valuation of £60.  The county council, or other outside rating authority, come to the local council and say that they want rates on that valuation of £165.  They are told that they cannot get it, because the Electricity Supply Board have gone into court and, as a result, are only obliged, they maintain, to pay on the original valuation no matter what it may be.  The Electricity Supply Board, this big semi-Government corporation, get away with that so that the balance of rates due must be made up by the local poor people.  The people in these depressed towns must pay up because the Electricity Supply Board will not do it.</P>
      <P>As I have said, this Bill is going to fall heaviest on the small towns.  The farmer is not going to get away with it so far as his lawn or garden is concerned. They are to be valued separately and will not enjoy the exemption provided for the remainder of his agricultural land.  Is there any Deputy in this House who knows what a &ldquo;lawn&rdquo; is?  I do not know.  I have heard the description &ldquo;lawn&rdquo; applied to a 30-acre field in front of a farmer's house.  It is a very serious thing if land of that kind is to become subject to the provisions of this Bill, and if what is described as a &ldquo;lawn&rdquo; is to be valued separately.  The same thing is to apply to a bit of ground where a few apple trees are put down on the advice of the local horticultural instructor. We are told, too, that the labourers' cottages will be valued separately as well as the homes of the poor people in the Gaeltacht who were given special facilities under the Gaeltacht (Housing) Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that, under this Bill, there is going to be a kind of rake-off between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government&mdash; to get back, by means of these increased valuations, a share of the <Col N="1089" /> money provided for housing schemes. The money that they have already given by way of grants to encourage house building is now to be taken back through the operation of this Bill. If time permitted there are many other aspects of the Bill that I would like to deal with.  I would appeal to the Minister to give special consideration to the small towns.  Most of them are in an extremely precarious financial position at the present time, and if the Minister insists on putting this Bill into operation it will have the effect of practically blowing them out of existence altogether.  Cork County has lost 2,100 of its urban population in the last ten years, and 12,000 off the land.  In view of that, how can you expect the towns to progress?  The potentialities that would make this valuation worth while at another time are becoming less and less.</P>
    <P>The time, as I have said, is inopportune for a measure such as this.  The country is poor and things are in an uncertain state.  This measure is going to cause more uncertainty and do great damage, especially amongst people likely to invest money in any form of real estate.  The members of the Minister's Party should, by this time, have become alive to the strong public feeling that has been aroused against this Bill.  They must be aware that resolutions have been passed by Fianna Fáil cummain in all parts of the country expressing strong and vehement opposition to the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahRyan" hpid="Colonel Ryan Colonel Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not heard one word in favour of this Bill in any part of the country.  Deputy Moore was the only member on the opposite side who gave unqualified support to it.  Deputy O'Reilly also spoke, and he gave it a sort of approval.  He did not seem to like some parts of it.  I suppose, in view of the fact that it has been introduced by a member of the Government, he had to try to support it.  We have been told from the opposite side that the Bill will not have the effect of increasing valuations.  I am convinced from my reading of the explanatory statement that that is the very purpose it will serve.  In paragraph (8) of that statement I find this:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1090" />&ldquo;Owing to the increase in the value of property in terms of money which has taken place since the middle of the last century, and particularly since 1913, not being fairly represented therein, the values in the cadastre are for the most part too low to represent the present net annual letting values.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What does that mean but that every bit of property will be valued, and that the valuations will be raised?  If this Bill is not going to increase taxation it will certainly, in my opinion, raise valuations.  In that paragraph it is further stated: &ldquo;Although it has been, from the outset, the practice of the Valuation Office, with the approval of the courts, to endeavour to secure rating equity by valuing the comparatively small number of properties which came before it for revision every year on the same basis as that upon which the mass of the properties stood valued in the rating area concerned, this practice has not been successful in preserving relativity between by far the greater number of such values.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is quite clear to me from what is set out in that paragraph, as I think it must be to anybody who reads it, that this Bill will not only increase valuations, but will also lead to an increase in taxation.  If the Minister thinks that the money value is not fairly represented at the moment, is he not well aware that since 1913 the rates have risen nearly threefold?  You would think that that should equalise things as far as the money value of houses was concerned; that, with the added 25 per cent. for the purpose of income-tax. That should fairly equal things so far as the people are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that this is purely to remedy the inequalities.  I think it is going to create more inequalities that ever, especially in rural Ireland.  We have been told about towns not being as well off as they were, and many causes are suggested, such as railway termini closing down, and other things of that sort.  If that is the case, then the houses in these towns ought to have their valuations reduced.  If they are taken in terms of stone, bricks, mortar, slates, or any of the things that form the house, then <Col N="1091" /> all the houses in these towns, where the people are becoming poorer, are going to have their valuations raised, it would seem.</P>
    <P>Take the case of the farmers.  We are going to have the valuations on farm buildings considered, and they are to be based on their letting value. I wonder what is the letting value of a big farmer's house, with all the sheds and other buildings around it, when the land is taken away from it?  I wonder has it any letting value?  I doubt if you could find anybody to rent a farmer's house, with a lot of outbuildings; perhaps in one case out of every 20 you might get a person so inclined.  I believe that in many cases the revaluation of such buildings is going to cause greater inequalities.  I admit that so far as land values in rural Ireland are concerned, there is some inequality, but if this proposed valuation scheme is carried out, there will be many more added.</P>
    <P>In many cases the house was valued at a low rate and the land was subject to a high valuation, but, setting one against the other, the valuation was fairly normal.  In the present case a house valued at a medium rate and with highly valued land attached is likely to have its valuation raised, and that will be especially so in the case of an industrious man, the type of man who, during and after the war, made money and put that money into buildings, in the way of cattle sheds or a new house or by way of improvements in his old house.  That man, I believe, is going to suffer considerably because of his hard work and industry, and I think that is unfair.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were right, he would withdraw this Bill.  It is significant that the Minister has left land and railways out of this Bill.  Land and railways are at the moment supposed to be the two least paying propositions in this country.  The railways are not paying and, definitely, land is not paying. He has brought in every bit of immovable property.  Apparently he is not anxious to withdraw the Bill and, seeing that he is not prepared to do so, there are a few points that I would like him to consider.  First of all, there <Col N="1092" /> is the matter of the labourers' cottages and the labourers' houses built in the towns, and especially the old labourers' cottages which are now being bought out.  After their purchase the individuals who occupy them will have to pay the rates.  If the cottages are valued on the basis the Minister speaks of, not alone will the valuation be quadrupled, but the rates will be quadrupled as well.  The same thing will apply to the houses in towns.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is anxious to do away with inequalities he should give the right to the farmers to apply for a revaluation of their land.  The farmer has never had that right.  The Minister declares that this Bill is not for the purpose of collecting more money or raising valuations.  If it is not, then he should at least allow the farmers some means by which they could have their valuations reconsidered and assessed on a reasonable basis.  The basis on which many of them were assessed under Griffith's valuation was the basis of growing wheat, with a differentiation where the land was adjacent to a market town.</P>
    <P>That valuation has turned out more irregularities than any other system of valuation in the State.  At the time that valuation was made there was a great deal of land in Ireland under wheat.  There were good wheat-growing areas and bad wheat-growing areas, but the land was all assessed on the same basis, and there is, therefore, terrible inequality so far as land valuation is concerned.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister should amend the Bill in order to give farmers a chance of applying for a revision of their valuations.  Under previous Bills they were given no such opportunity, and something should be done in that direction now.  There is another important point.  In many parts of the country, and especially in my county, we have had this year thousands of acres flooded, and they were of no use to the owners.  There should be some consideration given to the owners of flooded land.  There could not be a beast put on it for at least six months I might say that the lands were of no use to some of those people since last June.  I am sure the same applies to other counties.  The important point is <Col N="1093" /> that some of that land is very highly valued.  There is some of it in the Golden Vale, and it is very highly valued, possibly the highest valued in the country, and the fact is that it was almost useless this year.  The Minister should make an effort to give these people some means of redress.</P>
    <P>I think that everything that could be said on this Bill has been said.  The Minister should endeavour to see that his word is kept, that this Bill will not raise valuations or mean an increase of rates.  Somebody on the other side of the House suggested that the Minister might bring in another Bill in order to make sure of that.  I suggest that if valuations are increased, and it seems to me they must be under this measure, the Minister should bring in another Bill to ensure that the rates are not proportionately increased.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to cover the ground that has been covered by speakers during the last few hours, but there is one thing I should like to point out to the Minister.  We consider that it is very unfair that the buildings occupied in Cork City by the Electricity Supply Board should be exempt from rates.  We have quite a number of buildings occupied by the board there, and they are benefited by all the social services, and we think it very unfair that they should be exempt from rating.  I hope that the Minister will bear that in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>For a few weeks this Bill has been before the House, and by this time the Government should know the trend of public opinion on the measure.  But apparently the Government, at the present time, takes very little notice of public opinion.  I would not intervene in this debate were it not that since the Bill was circulated, and since it appeared in the Press, I have had numerous communications from various districts, from different individuals, and I have also had interviews, as to the possibilities of this Bill.  From every side I have had complaints.  Reading over the papers for the last few days, you can see that there were protest meetings of different local bodies, such as boards of health and county councils.  Even the Mayo County Council, whose chairman <Col N="1094" /> is a prominent member of the Fianna Fáil Party, have protested against this Bill.  Very prominent public bodies, including the Dáil-Cheanntair, have protested, and they have asked the Fianna Fáil Deputies not to support the Bill.  I should like to know on what basis valuation in the past took place.</P>
      <P>From the time the Free State was established, even up to 1937 and 1938, many buildings were erected each year, and as soon as they were erected they were valued.  I should like to know from the Minister what is the basis of valuation for buildings, or is it related to any particular year?  That is not a point on which I am clear.  I have seen houses, each of which had the same accommodation, but although there was five or six years' difference between the times these houses were built, each house bears the same valuation. Yet, there was certainly a great difference in the cost of erection during that period.  It would be interesting to know whether the valuation of a house in 1938 was based on the building costs of 1937, or whether a house valued in 1937 was based on the building costs of 1936.  Building costs in 1937 increased by almost 20 per cent. as compared with those in 1936. Although the Conditions of Employment Act applied to some part of 1936, it came into full operation in 1937, and the effect of it was to increase building costs by at least 20 per cent.  Then you had a number of tariffs on articles used in the building trade.  I think I would not be far wrong in saying that the net effect of the Conditions of Employment Act, and the tariffs on building materials, was to send building costs up by at least 25 per cent.  Is that the basis upon which the valuation of this country will be started?  If so, I think it is a false basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know whether, under this Valuation Bill, we have to go back a certain number of years and say that the value of a building was a certain figure at that time&mdash;say ten years ago.  Take the case of the ordinary artisan earning from £3 15s. to £4 15s. per week or the labourer earning say £2 10s. per week, whose house was erected as a result of loans raised by <Col N="1095" /> a local authority.  He knew where he stood at that time.  He knew what he was going to pay on the instalment system.  He knew what it was going to cost him per week, what the valuation of his house would be and also the rates.  Now, he is faced with the position that the valuation of that house is going to be increased.  I say that there is no object behind the Bill other than to increase taxation and to get in more revenue.  The artisan or the labourer took that house at 8/- or 10/- a week, with rates in addition. He is now faced with an increase in valuation which will certainly also mean an increase in rates.  Inside the last few years in a county in the West of Ireland which I know very well the rates have increased from 8/6 to 15/- in the £.  I am afraid that that tendency will continue and that increased valuations will also mean increased rates.</P>
    <P>Another matter we have to remember is that the more valuable a building is, the higher the valuation will be. A house built in brick or stone is much more valuable than a house built of concrete.  The result of that is that a house built of materials produced within the country will have to bear more taxation than a house built out of materials that are imported.  As I say, a house built with brick or stone is much more costly than a house built of concrete, and the taxation of these houses will therefore be higher than the houses built of imported material. An ordinary hut roofed with galvanised iron may provide the same accommodation as a house built of stone but its valuation would be only about £5 against a valuation of about £15 for the house built of stone.  The better the building the more employment provided and the more money spent in employment the higher the taxation.</P>
    <P>That, in a sense, means that you are putting a tax on efficiency, because the fellow who gets away with a jerrybuilt house will have a lower taxation to pay than the man who erects a proper house.  The occupiers of houses in our small towns have been taxed up to the hilt.  In fact, many of them have been <Col N="1096" /> driven out of business owing to high taxation.  A Bill such as this has been in operation in Northern Ireland for some time, and the Government need only look at the returns from Belfast alone to see the number of business premises that have been closed for no other reason than that they were unable to carry on owing to the high taxation imposed there under the new Act.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister might give public opinion in this country a chance. Public bodies throughout the country have been voicing their protests for the last fortnight against this Bill.  While undoubtedly revenue has to come from some source, this Bill will impose a great injustice on certain people who are least able to bear it.  Take the small farmers throughout the country who have spent every halfpenny they can afford in the reconstruction of their houses, or in making some addition to their houses so as to qualify for the £30 grant.  Now they are going to be taxed for having made these improvements. Similarly, a man who got a loan for the building of a pig house or the erection of hen houses, in order to increase production and efficiency in this country, is going to be taxed for his enterprise.  It is the industrious person who will be taxed under this Bill. Some Deputy stated here this evening that you can get nothing out of the poor man or the lazy man.  That is certainly a fact, but I think it most unfair to increase taxation on the industrious man.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would ask the Minister to reconsider the Bill having regard to the position of the country at present.  Every industry in this country is taxed up to the hilt.  Agriculturists, businessmen and other classes are fully taxed.  Owing to the hard times they have gone through, many of our people are unable to meet their ordinary debts.  The time is very inopportune for such a Bill and it is not right that the people should be harassed in such a manner.</P>

      <P>Strong objection has been taken to this Bill in the country. So far as I can see, there has been no demand on the part of the people for <Col N="1097" /> the Bill.  The people are of opinion that, since the advent of Fianna Fáil to power, they have been taxed almost out of existence and it is well known that the people who pay most of the taxes are not supporters of Fianna Fáil.  Therefore, you can, with great comfort to yourselves, increase taxation, fortified in the belief that it is your political opponents who will have to pay the major share of these increased taxes.  According to Deputy O'Reilly, there was nothing in this country until Fianna Fáil came into power.  Until this Government attained office, we went without any clothes and we had to lie out in the fields, according to Deputy O'Reilly. However, we, on this side of the House, are of opinion that there is absolutely no necessity for this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister may try to convince the House and country that his aim in introducing this Bill is to remove anomalies as well as to remove injustices as between the valuations placed on different hereditaments.  I, for one, do not take that view, because I believe that the Minister is introducing this Bill to get more money.  It is not for fun he is introducing the Bill. The cost of preparing for the operation of the Act and the cost of operating it will be very heavy, and the Minister will see that he will recover these expenses by increased taxation.  Certain increases in other charges will emerge when the Bill comes into operation. These do not appear on the face of the Bill, but the people will get a rude awakening when the measure comes into force.  Everybody knows that people now pay their electricity accounts on valuation.  The cost of one's electricity supply is based on the valuation of his house.  If valuations are increased as a result of this Bill, the consumers of electricity will have to pay more for their supply.</P>

Everybody knows that the E.S.B. at the present time is making plenty of money, and I am of opinion that, instead of increasing electricity charges, the time has arrived when they should be reduced.  If this Bill is passed, we shall have to pay increased charges and these charges will fall on thousands of poor working people.</P>

      <P>May I ask the Minister to repeat that statement in a louder voice, so that I may hear him and understand what he is saying?  It is not the first time the Minister contradicted what I said.  In regard to the increase in the allowances of Deputies, he said I was not telling the truth, but if I had been in the House when he said that, I would have made him apologise.  If he wants to contradict me now, I want him to speak audibly so that I can deal with his statement. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent the charges for electricity being increased.</P>

      <P>Is that not a natural corollary to the passing of the Bill? The vintners and licensed grocers will have their licence duties increased, because these are based on their valuations. Surely, these men all over the country are not talking nonsense.  They are passing resolutions protesting against this Bill, and these resolutions are not confined to the political opponents of the Government; they have the hearty support of the Government's political friends.  Outside the House, there is much more agreement amongst the people than there appears to be here between Deputies sitting on these benches and on the Government Benches.  These people seem to work in harmony in the country more than their representatives do here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1099" /> Income-tax will also be increased as a result of this Bill.  It is quite the thing to take all you can from income-tax payers but, as one who is not in a position to pay income tax, I say that income-tax payers are a great asset to any country and the sooner Fianna Fáil get rid of their present mentality the better.  The income-tax payers are the people who are earning the money by the exercise of their brains and by hard work and they are the people who keep the Government going, no matter what Government is in power.  If this Bill is passed the burden will be increased on income-tax payers.  I know decent craftsmen who were assessed for income-tax in previous years and who have been idle for from seven to ten weeks this year.  Yet, they have now to pay income-tax on their earnings of the previous year, because they exceeded a certain amount.</P>
    <P>I am one of those who think that the country is taxed at the moment as much as it can bear.  As this Bill is for the purpose of exacting more money from the people, I should oppose it even if it were designed to provide more employment by the State because I believe that every time a Government attempts to solve the unemployment question they increase, instead of decreasing, unemployment. It would be far better to leave the money with the private citizen.  He would use it to greater advantage than the Government can.  It would be well if the Government would realise in regard to the solution of the unemployment problem that they can make no progress by present methods.  The Bill is going to exact more money from the tax-payers and, as an excuse for it, we are told that it will provide employment.</P>
    <P>That is no use, because we have the experience of the past six or seven or eight years that, notwithstanding all the millions which have been expended in providing employment in this country, unemployment at the moment is as great as it was prior to the spending of that money.  If you were to spend millions more, you would find that you would be as far off a solution of that problem as you were before <Col N="1100" /> you started.  That is one of my fixed ideas, and all the experience I have had has made me hold more to those ideas than ever.</P>
    <P>I think that, to use an old saying, the Minister should let the hare sit, or in other words, let things remain as they are.  We have got on very well for the past 60 or 80 years under the old valuation laws.  This country has not changed very much, and, in my opinion, the present is a most inopportune time to introduce a Bill of this nature. Everybody knows that, all over the country, business men of all descriptions are finding it exceedingly difficult to carry on.  Everyone who has any connection with public affairs at the present time, or who keeps in touch with public opinion, knows that that is so.  In many cases, were it not for the facilities given by the banks, a very sorry tale could be told by the business men of many of our small towns.  I am speaking now on behalf of both the large and small towns in the constituency I represent.  They have been very severely hit as a result of the Border.  The Border question is one which has very much affected the towns immediately adjoining the Border.  I know streets in the capital town of Louth where, 20 or 30 years ago, there were houses in which very successful businesses were carried on&mdash;the valuation in those years was just&mdash;but to-day some of those houses which were once the pride of those streets are a home for flies, cobwebs and spiders.  There is no doubt about that.</P>
    <P>What used to be one of the finest buildings in one of the streets there is to-day used as a broken-down bicycle shop.  I suppose the house is valued at probably £30 or £40, and it is not earning 30 pence.  What is the use of talking about valuation in a case of that sort, or about increasing one and decreasing another?  Everybody knows that at the present time it is almost impossible to carry on business with all the increased charges which have been heaped on the business men of this country.</P>
    <P>I hold the view very strongly that the go-ahead man who improves his property should, instead of having the <Col N="1101" /> valuation on that property increased, get a recognition of his efforts by having it decreased, because that man is an asset to the country.  He gives added employment in the reconstruction and renovation of his premises, instead of keeping the money in the bank.  It is more of that type of man we want in this country, and they deserve all the support they can get from the Government, instead of this move in the wrong direction by increasing their valuation.  For that reason alone I think the Government are very ill-advised in introducing a Bill of this nature at this particular period.  I do not think a Bill of this kind could have been introduced at a worse period than at the present time, because things are not going well.  I am not a pessimist; I am not one of those who are always making the poor mouth.  I should like to give the Government every credit for any good they have done for the country, but you cannot get over hard facts.  I know the condition of affairs which exists at the moment.  It is no hearsay that the business men in our towns, both large and small, are finding it exceedingly difficult to carry on their business at the present time, and they are not in a position to bear any further burdens.  It goes without saying that this Bill will impose additional burdens on them by raising their valuations, and by the other increased costs which will be incurred as a result of the passing of this Bill.  I think the Government would be well advised to hasten slowly in so far as legislation of this kind is concerned.</P>
    <P>Again, it is a well-known fact that there are hundreds if not thousands of people who have built their own houses through the medium of the Small Dwellings Act during the past few years, and the valuation of those houses will be raised if this Bill is passed.  The people who live in those houses are not millionaires.  They are artisans earning something like £3 10s. to £4 per week.  They incur a very big <Col N="1102" /> liability by the erection of those houses, and are finding it sufficiently difficult to find the money for the payment of the annuities due on those houses each year.  Some of those annuities, whether paid monthly, or quarterly or half-yearly, work out at the rate of anything from £1 to 25/- a week, exclusive of rates.  Now those people will be called upon to pay increased rates as a result of the valuation of those houses being increased. That will impose upon them a burden for which they are not prepared, a burden for which they had made no preparation or contribution or allowance. I think it is most unfair and unjust on the part of the Government to increase the valuation of those houses built through the sacrifices made by that class of people who, anxious to own their houses, have denied themselves many of the comforts of which they could have partaken.  The only reward they are going to get from the Government now is that they will have their valuations increased.  There are many other matters in connection with this Bill upon which one would like to speak.  It is sufficient to say that it is a Bill which is not popular in the country.  It is a Bill, which has not, in my opinion, the support of any considerable section of the people.  Above all and beyond all, it is a Bill the primary object of which is to extract more money from the ratepayers of this country, who at the present moment are in a very bad position to pay any more taxes.  For those reasons, I think it is only right and proper that the Government should think twice before they pass a Bill of this nature which would place such impossible burdens upon the people of this State. I move the Adjournment.</P>
