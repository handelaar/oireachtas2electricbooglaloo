      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that hundreds of cottages in County Wexford are in a very bad state of repair, and that numerous complaints have been made to the board of health on the matter; and whether, in view of the fact that any delay in the formulation of a comprehensive scheme will make it uneconomic to repair many of these cottages, he will now state when it is intended to send an official, as promised, to make a complete inspection of this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have ascertained from the Wexford Board of Health and <Col N="1642" /> Public Assistance that during the year ended 31st March last complaints were made to them as to the need for the repair of cottages.  I am satisfied that the board of health and public assistance are fully alive to the necessity for keeping the cottages in repair, and that the rate of progress on this work is reasonable.  During the last financial year 543 cottages were repaired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, my information in regard to those cottages is that they have been in a bad state for the last five or six years.  The matter has been reported to me several times.  I have gone to see some of the cottages, and found that they were not fit for human habitation.  Surely to goodness it is the duty of the Minister to see that those unfortunate people will not have to spend another winter like the last one. Some of those cottages are neither windproof nor weatherproof.  In many of them the people have to pull their beds into the middle of the room to get them away from the damp walls.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that 44 people in Sheephouse, Baldwinstown and Rathyork, all in the Bridgetown district, are dependent for water on a private well situated threequarters of a mile away from them; that this well is unfenced, subject to pollution by cattle, and was condemned over four years ago by the county medical officer of health; and, if so, whether he will instruct the official, whom he has promised to send to County Wexford on the matter of cottage repairs, also to investigate the provision of a proper water supply for this district.</P>

      <P>The provision of a proper supply of water for the various parts of the Wexford county health district is a matter for the board of health.  I understand the Wexford Board of Health and Public Assistance have under consideration the improvement of the water supply for <Col N="1643" /> these areas.  I will cause inquiry to be made as to the present position and communicate with the Deputy in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, does he not consider it a great hardship on those people that they have to go threequarters of a mile for water, and even then they are liable to find cattle standing in this well?  That has been going on for years, and I should like to ask the Parliamentary Secretary to see that something is done to remedy it as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state what is the present position in regard to the comparative failure of the Cahirciveen water supply; what steps are being taken in conjunction with the Kerry Board of Health to remedy matters; and whether in view of the seriousness of the position as regards the health of the people of the town and the hardship caused, he will hasten the provision of a proper water supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Following upon the representations received from the Deputy at the beginning of last month in regard to the inadequacy of the Cahirciveen water supply, the Kerry Board of Health, whose duty it is to <Col N="1644" /> provide a pure and adequate supply for the town, were asked to obtain a report from their Engineer on the present position of the supply.  It appears that the board had the matter under consideration at their meeting on the 22nd ultimo and that the adequacy of the supply is being investigated by officials of the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware of the severe hardship imposed on the people of the Ballylibernagh and Tullabards Great districts, in the Bridgetown locality, by the absence of a proper water supply; and, if so, if he will instruct the official, whom he has promised to send with a view to cottage inspection in the county, also to investigate the necessity for a water supply in these districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply is in the negative. If the public water supply in this area is inadequate the question of providing a proper water supply would be a matter for the Wexford Board of Health and Public Assistance.  It is understood that no application was received by that board in recent years for the provision of a water supply at Ballylibernagh.  It is also understood that the board have decided not to provide a pump at Tullabards where there are only six families who derive their water supply from three private wells.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply.  I should like to say that in the case of Ballylibernagh I myself made a report in regard to the absence of a proper water supply, so it is not right to say that no application has been received.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware of the decision of the Great Southern Railways Company to transfer their workshops from Wexford town to Rosslare Harbour; that this removal would seriously interfere with the livelihood of many railway workers resident in the town of Wexford and reduce the revenue of the Wexford Urban Council; and, if so, whether, in view of these considerations, he will ask the company to reconsider their decision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, I hope he will use his influence to try to get the company to <Col N="1646" /> reconsider their decision, so that those unfortunate people living in the town of Wexford will be able to remain where they were reared, and where their children have proper facilities for attending school.  I hope he will consider the loss it would be to have those 40 families leaving the town of Wexford.  I think the Minister would be doing very good work if he could get the company to reconsider their decision.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether his attention was directed by the Limerick and Clare Milk Producers' Association to the fact that, on analysis, samples of milk taken from the yield of morning milkings in a large number of cases fail to attain the standard of milk fat required by statute; whether, in the same cases, the analysis of the evening milkings shows a standard of milk fat in excess of the statutory requirement; and, whether, in view of the evidence furnished to him in this matter, he is prepared to issue instructions that analysis for the purpose of the Food and Drugs Acts shall be based on balanced samples consisting of equal parts of morning and evening milkings.</P>

      <P>I received from the Minister for Local Government and Public Health copies of communications sent to him on behalf of the Limerick and Clare Milk Producers' Association regarding the minimum standards of milk fat prescribed for whole milk.  This minimum has been fixed as low as 3 per cent. and I consider there is no justification to modify this standard in any respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that owing to the practice of the inspectors concentrating on taking samples from the morning deliveries practically all suppliers to the City of Limerick have had their samples found deficient from the minimum standard, whereas it has been established that on the evening deliveries the samples are far in excess of the required minimum standard?  In view of the fact that under the regulations these suppliers are in danger of having their licences taken from them while not actually guilty of any offence, does the <Col N="1651" /> Minister not consider it necessary to comply with the reasonable request made in the question?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>From information supplied to me it is invariably on the morning delivery that weakness is shown owing to the greater amount of milk lying in the udder with a corresponding lesser percentage of butter fat.  A number of cattle having been set aside and tested morning and evening and then over a balanced period have given the following results: morning, A. cow, 2.70; B. cow, 2.85; C. cow, 2.95; evening: A. cow, 3.50; B. cow, 4.00; C. cow, 3.40.  These figures average 3.10; 3.42; and 3.17, with a milking period of from nine to 15 hours.  The same cows over a balanced period, 11½ to 12 hours, gave 3.20 in the morning; 3.35 in the evening, and 3.27 of an average.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he is aware that the Land Commission in September, 1937, agreed to give Mrs. Mary Joyce, Frenchgrove, Hollymount, an exchange for her holding on the Ruttledge estate, Castleville, Hollymount; that she signed the usual purchase agreement and was promised possession by March 15, 1938; and if he will now state the cause of the delay in giving Mrs. Joyce possession of the new holding.</P>

      <P>In connection with the preliminary proposals for the division of the lands of Lecarrow on the former estate of W. E. Ruttledge, Mrs. Mary Joyce agreed, on 10th September, 1937, to exchange her holding in Frenchgrove for a new holding in Lecarrow. Following the exclusion of portion of the Lecarrow lands from the acquisition proceedings, it became necessary to obtain fresh proposals for the division of the lands and Mrs. Joyce signed a fresh undertaking to exchange, on 5th January, 1938.  The arrangement with Mrs. Joyce was made by the Land <Col N="1660" /> Commission inspector subject to the commissioners' approval and no promise of possession by any definite date could have been given.  Owing to the large number of prior cases awaiting the attention of the Land Commission, it has not been found possible to complete the arrangements for exchange, but the matter will be expedited.</P>

      <P>In page 3, to delete Section 5 and substitute a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Where the Land Commission is (whether before, at, or after the passing of this Act) the landlord of a dwelling-house, the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Acts, 1923 to 1930, shall not apply or be deemed ever to have applied to such dwelling-house at any time while the Land Commission is or was the landlord thereof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the conclusion of the Committee Stage Deputy Cosgrave raised a question, which was raised earlier, as to whether the Title was right, seeing that this Bill sought to amend an Act retrospectively in some respects, and I undertook to look into it.  I propose to delete the section and substitute a new section.  In that case it will preserve, for any person who may have got them, some rights under the Rent Restrictions Act before the Land Commission got the house, and will <Col N="1670" /> ensure that if the Land Commission has become the owner or the landlord this Act will not apply.  I think this amendment is better than what Deputy McMenamin suggested previously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>This is in better shape, but I think the Minister might have been more generous.  In some respects the new section is just as bad as the old one.  There is no qualifying provision.  It is very well for the Minister to tell the House that nothing drastic will be done to a tenant occupying such premises, but that is merely verbal and does not bind anyone once the Bill becomes law.  I feel that it is very drastic to allow the section to remain in its present form.</P>

      <P>May I intervene at this stage to say that on Section 6 I left the House under the impression, on the last occasion, that charges under the Church Temporalities Fund were not allowed to have priority as well as sums due to the Land Commission. That was wrong.  What is provided is that they would not be retrospective&mdash; that priority would not apply retrospectively. In future, we are claiming priority for moneys due under the Church Temporalities Fund as well as other moneys due to the Land Commission. We claimed that right in the past in respect of other moneys, but not in the case of money due under the Church Temporalities Fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>All I want is to be clear about it.  Supposing a citizen of Eire has a charge upon a property which is also charged with a Land Commission annuity and a loan due to the Church Temporalities Fund, heretofore the priorities were the Land Commission, then the first mortgage granted to any citizen and then the Church Temporalities Fund.  Is it proposed now in respect of persons who were mortgagees by statute to deprive them of the priority hitherto enjoyed, or is it proposed to fix all future mortgagees with notice that, if they take a mortgage on land which is charged with a loan from the Church Temporalities Fund, their first mortgage will not take precedence of that loan any more than it ever took precedence of moneys charged in favour of the Land Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think these mortgages had priority&mdash;the Church Temporalities had not priority over them.  It was a matter for someone else to decide which of them had priority.  It would be an open question. The point was that up to this the moneys due under the Church Temporalities had not priority.  Other sums due to the Land Commission had, but I do not think it would follow from that, that other mortgages would have priority over Church Temporalities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Are you saying to the existing mortgagees: &ldquo;That priority <Col N="1672" /> which you have enjoyed to date, we are going to take from you,&rdquo; or are you saying to future mortgagees: &ldquo;Be warned that if you choose to make a mortgage in future your mortgage will be postponed to a Church Temporalities loan which is now being invested with all the privileges of a Crown debt?&rdquo;  It is an important point.  It is quite unprecedented by statute to walk in on top of a mortgage in respect of which a person has lent money and take from that mortgagee by statute the bargain he made.  Take the case of some person who has advanced money on a Land Commission holding.  He may, for one reason or another, have advanced, by way of a first mortgage, the balance of the capital value of that land, after deducting the redemption price of the land annuity.  There is a Church Temporalities loan annexed to that land.  He suddenly discovers that, as from to-day, what is a valuable mortgage no longer has any value at all.</P>
      <P>Take the case in which a farmer is charged with nothing but the church loan.  A mortgagee comes in and taking priority, as he believes, over the mortgage connected with the other loan, he advances the full value of the land.  He is now informed by statute that we are taking from him the security he got in accordance with the statute law of this country, the security the State itself registered; that we are simply sweeping that away and are passing over to the State the assets he held.  It is well to bear in mind that a mortgagee&mdash;I think I am right, but I speak subject to correction&mdash;is the owner of the property.  The mortgage is an instrument of conveyance.  The property is conveyed by the mortgagor to the mortgagee with an equitable provision recognised by the law of equity and in the event of the mortgagor paying his debt the mortgagee will be constrained to reconvey the property back to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 6 here purports to go to the mortgagee and take from him property that has been actually conveyed to him and transfer by seizure that property to the Church Temporalities Fund. That is an entirely revolutionary <Col N="1673" /> principle.  I cannot think of any statute that has been brought before this House which has enshrined a principle of that kind.  In the strict theory of the law, this is barefaced expropriation of property in favour of the State.  The State is walking in and taking from a man a material asset that he now has and appropriating it to the State without any compensation, good, bad or indifferent.  The Minister should indicate if there is any statutory precedent for that procedure.  Has he adverted to the fact that this is the expropriation of property from its present owner and its vesting in the Government?  It is not only, to my mind, bad in itself, because it is unjust, but it creates a most dangerous precedent. I think the Minister ought to tell us whether he can point to any anterior precedent and whether he proposes to stand over the establishment of such a precedent as Section 6 appears to enshrine.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not retrospective, not as far as Church Temporalities are concerned; but as far as mortgagees are concerned the position would be that they would have to take second place.  This whole business arose out of the case of Gilligan and the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Defence.  It was a case in which there was doubt as to whether money due to the Crown had priority, whether we had the same right as the Crown in a former instance.  It was just in case a matter of that kind might again arise, where the Land Commission would claim priority, that we brought in this section in order to safeguard the position.  Up to this the Church Temporalities did not get priority.  As they are State charges and the money is to go into the Exchequer, I cannot see why they should not have the same priority as any money due to the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no objection in principle, whatever objection there may be in general, but an important <Col N="1674" /> point arises if the Minister is to say to future mortgagees: &ldquo;Mortgage here at your peril&rdquo;.  Another aspect to be considered is that you may go behind an already registered mortgagee and alter the security.  I think the Minister's legal advisers will tell him that that is, in law, the expropriation of the mortgagee without compensation.  The mortgagee is the owner of the hereditament subject to his equitable obligation to return it to the mortgagor in the event of the payment of the debt.  You now propose to expropriate it, and I put it to the Minister that there is no precedent for such a procedure.  There is ample precedent for saying hereafter: &ldquo;Mortgage at your peril&rdquo;.  There is no precedent that I know of for the procedure suggested in the section.  If there is, I would be glad if the Minister would quote it for me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The only thing that I can say is that I do not know of any mortgage which would have priority. Deputy Dillon is assuming that some private mortgage would have priority over a charge like that.  I do not think there would be any such thing.  A judge might decide to give priority to one person's mortgage over Church Temporalities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Church Temporalities registered as a mortgage at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a tithe rent; it is State revenue, and I imagine it would at least have as much chance of getting priority as any other mortgage would have on land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But the question that arises there is that when the land is sold or disposed of, there comes the question of marshalling the various charges that must be discharged out of the proceeds of the sale.  When that happens, the first debts to be discharged, I take it, are the Crown debts, now transferred to the Minister. Then the question arises as to whether the first mortgage on the Church Temporalities Fund takes priority.  As I understand it, there has been a judgment in the courts depriving the Church Temporalities Fund of what they had <Col N="1675" /> enjoyed hitherto.  It seems that certain prudent people have taken first mortgages on such land, saying to themselves that the first mortgage gave them an equality with the Church Temporalities Fund.  If that is so, you could not set that forth by statute, although, I admit, that it would be legitimate to say that, henceforward, the Crown debts will come first and that, amongst them, will come debts for the redemption of tithe rent charges.</P>

      <P>I may say that I am prepared to give the Minister powers in this Bill to act retrospectively with regard to certain matters, but surely the Minister will agree that it will be a wrong thing to take away the rights of citizens, particularly where, perhaps, the sum of money concerned is small, and where, although the amount concerned is small, people are solely dependent upon it.  I do not think the Minister intends that.  The Minister seeks to put in this sweeping amendment in this Bill, but I think that this is a bad time of the day to come in with such an amendment.</P>

I wanted to meet the various points, but I am advised that it is most unlikely and, in fact, almost inconceivable, that any charge would have priority to a tithe charge, and the tithe charges have existed from the Sixties.</P>

      <P>Yes, but is there not a judicial decision to the effect that the tithe rent charge, for purposes of redemption, is not chargeable in the same way as the land annuities for purposes of redemption; and is it not ambiguous whether, in the event of the redemption of several charges on a holding of land, the tithe rent redemption would take precedence of the redemption of a first mortgagee's interest?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that a decision was given in one particular case&mdash;I think it was in the House of <Col N="1677" /> Lords&mdash;where there was a question of a debt being statute-barred; and it was held there that they had not got priority.  That, however, was another case.  The actual fact, and the actual practice, has been that they always got priority, and that is what we are providing for in the Bill now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Was there not a decision given some time ago by Mr. Justice Gavan Duffy, in a case at the suit of, I think, the Department of Defence and the Department of Industry and Commerce, in which it was set forth that certain categories of debts were to be treated as Crown debts, and so on? Now, so far as I am aware, where the debts are Crown debts, their Crown quality, so to speak, gives them unquestioned precedence, but if the tithe rent charges have not got that Crown quality, their precedence over other mortgagees' charges is not so clear, and it may well be that it may be determined that the fact is that their priority is regulated like other charges by the order of their registration.  In that event, I suggest that it is wrong to alter that order retrospectively, whatever you may desire to do henceforward.</P>

      <P>In this particular case to which I have referred, it was not a matter concerned with the Land Commission, but a case of liquidation in which the Department of Industry and Commerce was concerned.  In that particular case the Department of Industry and Commerce claimed priority over others, and the judge held that the Revenue Commissioners, and only they, had the privilege of the Crown in this matter.  It is because of that, that we want to have assured to the Land Commission what they always had.  In the case to which I have referred, the judge held that it was only the Revenue Commissioners who had the right in this case.  It had nothing to do with the Land Commission, but was a case of liquidation in connection with the Department of Industry and Commerce, and the question there arose as to priority of claim.</P>

      <P>(a)  for the purpose of relieving congestion as defined in sub-section (4) of Section 73 of the Land Act, 1923;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment goes much too far and, in my opinion, paragraphs (c) and (d) should be deleted.  Paragraph (c) gives the right of resumption &ldquo;for the purpose of increasing the food supply of the country&rdquo; and (d) &ldquo;for the purpose of improving or rearranging the holding.&rdquo; In my opinion, a provision such as (c) should not be inserted in a Land Bill.  There should be some other machinery for dealing with matters of that kind.  With regard to paragraph (d), I think the duty should not be thrown upon the Land Commission of fixing up fields and cutting off corners. We have one Department of the State for cutting off corners and putting them on again.  That should be sufficient. These farms have been there for centuries, marked out as they are at <Col N="1681" /> present.  I do not, of course, object to the Land Commission marking out new holdings on big estates which they take over, but I think this paragraph is inserted to deal with farms that have been already demarcated.  I do not know what can have inspired these paragraphs or what is the justification for them.  In particular, I do not see how the Land Commission is going to take steps to improve the food supply of the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">

      <P>I do not agree with Deputy McMenamin as far as paragraph (d) is concerned.  I consider that paragraph (d) is absolutely necessary. There are very many cases of holdings throughout the country where a certain amount of &ldquo;striping&rdquo; is necessary.  The boundaries of some farms are ridiculous as they stand and I think the Land Commission should be given this power.  I think, however, that paragraph (c) is pure eyewash. It is a matter for the Minister for Agriculture and not at all for the Minister for Lands.  I think the Minister should not try to insert provisions like that which have no meaning in fact and which deal with powers of a rather unusual kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall vote against this amendment.  It is perfectly true that conditions exist in many parts of the country which would appear to justify paragraph (d). I have had the experience myself that when the railway company were making their line through my land they cut off half a rood from the remainder of the holding.  It would be a great source of relief to me if the Land Commission would come along and acquire that half rood because it costs me much more to keep the half rood fenced than the land is worth.  It would be worth something to the man whose land adjoins but he will not buy it because he thinks his donkeys will graze on it in any case. On the other hand, I am extremely reluctant to widen the scope of the Land Commission's authority to acquire land which has become vested in the tenant purchaser for the simple reason that every such widening of the</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1682" /> Land Commission's power further confuses the public mind in rural Ireland on the question of security of tenure. I shall vote against this amendment, and challenge a division on it, on account of paragraph (c), because it is a pernicious, poisonous kind of paragraph which is pregnant with every danger.  If you adopt a paragraph such as this&mdash;and to many people it may appear a perfectly innocuous clause&mdash;the security of every man's tenure in this country becomes the plaything of political Parties.  I may take one view as to what type of husbandry is best calculated to increase the food supply of the country, but the Minister for Agriculture may take a wholly different view.  Deputy Norton, if he were Minister for Agriculture, might take yet another view and my security of tenure in my farm would depend exclusively on what the passing view of the existing Minister for Agriculture might be as to what is the best way to increase the food supply of the country.  If he happened to disagree with my view on that matter, he could turn me into a cobbler, take my land from me and do what he pleased with it.  The Minister must see himself that to make that the excuse for taking back a person's land, in respect to which he believes he has absolute security of tenure, is recklessly irresponsible.</P>
    <P>I would be prepared, reluctantly, to pass over paragraph (d).  It is not the kind of land law that I like at all but it is generally in the spirit of the land code as established by the 1933 Land Act and I do not believe in heel-tapping of principles.  <i>Pro tem,</i> for the present, we have been beaten on the issue of the principle involved in the 1933 Land Act.  That being so, we have got to accept it and I do not think that sub-paragraph (d) goes beyond that principle.  I think paragraph (c) most clearly does and adds a wholly new and immeasurable reason for compulsorily acquiring land.  If the Minister indicates his readiness to withdraw that paragraph (c) then I will not vote against this amendment, much as I dislike it.  I direct the Minister's attention to the wording of it.  If he will turn to the first page of the amendment paper <Col N="1683" /> he will see that the amendment reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It is hereby declared and enacted that the Land Commission have and shall have power to resume, in whole or in part, for any one or more of the following purposes, any holding vested under the Land Purchase Acts in them or in the late Congested Districts Board for Ireland...</P>
    <P>Does that mean that these powers of acquisition relate only to land that has not yet been vested in the tenant purchaser? This only relates to that land held for the period while the tenant purchaser is paying rent in lieu of annuity?  I would like to have that point clarified.</P>

      <P>This whole Section 39 deals with resumption cases.  There was an outcry from the Opposition during the Committee Stage because it appeared from the original drafting of the Bill that we were not going to state the authority under which we were acting or the purposes for which we were acquiring land.  The objection I had to that was that I objected to specifically mentioning the precise section and the precise purpose for which these lands were to be used.  We are now proposing that this is to be the section which will be quoted.  In that respect, we are codifying the law anyhow, taking all the different sections under which land could be acquired and instead of referring any Deputy to several other Acts that have been passed, this is the authority now under which we are proceeding and the purposes are set down.  These two clauses which are objected to are taken out of existing legislation, not out of the 1933 Land Act but the 1923 Land Act.  I will read it for Deputy Dillon.</P>

    <P>The Land Commission shall have, and may exercise all or any of the powers exercisable by them as <Col N="1684" /> respects holdings on estates vested in them, including powers of resumption of the whole or part of the holding, whether the holding is or is not part of an estate or subject to a judicial rent; and in exercising the powers aforesaid shall have regard to the necessity of relieving congestion, the desirability of increasing the food supply of the country, and the manner in which the holdings have been used.</P>

      <P>Neither had I. Even if I had, a man that never admitted a mistake never did anything. I think the Minister might cut this short by excluding (c) and (d) from this section.  They are not relevant to this Land Bill.  The Land Commission is not the Department for dealing with this matter.  I think the Minister will admit that.  The Department of Agriculture can take power to do it.  We have gone very far in including the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Acts, in the Title of a Land Act.  Let us not make ourselves absolutely ridiculous. Talk about an Irish stew, this Bill will surely be an Irish stew.  This is entirely a matter for the Department of Agriculture, and I take it, in cases of emergency, it will be dealt with by the Department of Agriculture, not by the Land Commission.  Why should we do things like that?  One job is given to you to do, that is, to complete land purchase in this country.  You have extended that to relieving congestion and dividing up land.  Surely that is enough.  The rest should be left to the Department of Agriculture.  I think paragraph (c) should be deleted immediately. I think the Minister should agree to that and not waste time talking about it.  Deputy Lynch supports (d).  I do not mind if everybody in this country supported (d) and agreed <Col N="1685" /> to it; I think it is wrong.  I consider that it would create confusion.  It looks quite simple on its face.  You are dealing with land that has already been taken, in respect of which vesting proceedings have taken place and the maps set forth, and are you going, for the sake of one little corner of a place to create disorder throughout the country in every acre of land where a patch of that kind exists?  That should have been attended to at the time.  If the railway company went through Deputy Dillon's field Deputy Dillon should have seen to it at the time.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister not alone ought to eliminate sub-paragraph (d) from the amendment but should send the whole amendment to the Seanad.  My objection to the amendment is much the same as the objection I had to the original intention of the Bill, that was, to make the resumption of <i>bona fide</i> purchased tenant land easier.  This certainly puts other difficulties in the way of a tenant defending himself against the resumption of his land than there were in the previous Act.  We objected to the Land Commission having power to say that they would take land without giving any particular reason.  The Minister said he would rectify that to some extent by bringing in an amendment on the Report Stage.  He has brought it in and to me it is almost as objectionable as the original section. If the Land Commission resumes land now, they do not give any reason, beyond the reasons set out here&mdash;a conglomeration of reasons, two of which, since the Committee Stage the Minister and his officials have had to ramble through the various Land Acts to find&mdash;or invent.  Whoever heard of land being taken for the purposes of (c) or (d)?  I do not know whether Deputy Lynch did or not, but I never heard of land being taken or resumed for those particular purposes. The objection that I have is that it leads the way to resumption and puts greater difficulties in the way of the tenant.  The Minister takes land to relieve congestion, and when a defence is made, if the Minister or the Land Commission find that they have a bad case on that particular point, all they have to do is to say: &ldquo;We proceed under (b)&rdquo;, and if (b) makes a particularly bad case they say: &ldquo;We are going to take it for the purpose of increasing the food supply of the State&rdquo;, and, in the possible event of all three failing, they will say that they are going to square the holding. The poor unfortunate tenant is in a quandary and does not know how he should defend himself.</P>

      <P>It is to ask a question. I am still somewhat puzzled regarding the form of the amendment.  It refers to a holding vested under the Land Purchase Acts in the Land Commission or in the late Congested Districts Board for Ireland.  I understand that the procedure is, that the Land Commission acquire land, they then divide it up and establish tenants on the land who pay rent in lieu of annuity. After ten years these tenants have their holdings vested in them, with retrospective benefit regarding land annuity, and with the annuity fixed to be paid annually thereafter in reduction of the capital sum outstanding. Are we to understand that this section applies only to tenants of land who are paying the Land Commission rent in lieu of annuity, or does it apply also to persons whose land has been vested in them subject to a land annuity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is called &ldquo;acquisition&rdquo; when it is vested land not subject to an annuity.  This is land for which one may be paying a purchase annuity but which has not yet been vested; unvested land is what is provided for in this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>I will formally move the amendment, at any rate.  I move amendment No. 10:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 22, Section 39 (1), after paragraph (c), to insert two new paragraphs as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(d)  if, on consideration of such petition by the Lay Commissioners under the immediately preceding paragraph of this sub-section, it is shown that the person appearing to be in occupation of the holding occupies and uses it in the same manner as an ordinary farm in accordance with proper methods of husbandry, the Lay Commissioners shall order that such holding be not resumed;</P>
      <P>(e)  where, prior to the passing of this Act, the Land Commission have applied for and been granted permission to resume such a holding as is referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph of this sub-section, and such holding has not yet been taken over from the owner thereof by the Land Commission, then the Land Commission shall not proceed with the resumption thereof.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1689" /> I think the Minister has gone quite a long part of the road to meet me and I will go quite a distance of the road to meet him, too.  I think that his amendment would be perfectly satisfactory if he made a small amendment in it.  It says in amendment No. 12 that &ldquo;where the Lay Commissioners are satisfied&rdquo; and so on, that the holding is being worked, &ldquo;notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing provisions, the Land Commission shall not resume such holding or any part thereof for any purpose other than the relief of congestion in the locality&rdquo;&mdash;I have no fault to find with that&mdash;&ldquo;or the provision of sportsfields, parks, pleasure-grounds, or playgrounds for the inhabitants of villages, towns or cities&rdquo;&mdash;I have fault to find with that&mdash;&ldquo;or for schools, or the provision of gardens for schools&rdquo;&mdash;I have no objection to that.  If the Minister would say that he would not take any well-worked holding that is giving a good deal of employment except for the purposes of the relief of congestion or the provision of schools or school gardens, I would accept his amendment instead of my own.</P>
    <P>My own amendment was based on the fact that the Minister said that it was not the practice nor the intention of the Land Commission to resume any holding which was properly worked.  I told him in the Committee Stage that that was no use to us.  The mere saying of it was of no use, and it was because of that that I put in this amendment.  My amendment goes very far&mdash;quite much further than his as it is.  It does not allow any resumption where the land is well-worked.  I am prepared to meet the Minister if there is a general case of congestion in a locality or land is required for the purpose of providing schools or school gardens; I will be quite prepared to agree with him that no matter how well worked the whole thing was it should be liable to be resumed.  Of course the second portion of my amendment was following the Minister's bad example, and that of another Minister, by giving retrospective effect to the first portion of my amendment.  I wanted to secure that, where certain holdings have been undoubtedly well worked, in spite of the fact that they <Col N="1690" /> had been resumed but not yet taken over, the Land Commission would withdraw any further proceedings for their resumption.  With regard to that portion of my amendment I am going to withdraw it entirely, because there is no provision for that at all in the Minister's amendment; but, since the Minister has gone so far to meet me I am prepared to go a good distance to meet him, and, if he would consider wiping out those provisions for sportsfields, parks, and so on, as a ground on which well-worked farms could be resumed, I am prepared to withdraw my amendment entirely.</P>

We are <Col N="1691" /> a very imitative people and when a claim is made in one place, claims will also be made in other places, and it will lead to a lot of unnecessary agitation. You will have a boom to-day and some land will perhaps be taken, and then the thing will die down as it has died down before.  I think it is an unnecessary provision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have looked into it since.  The position was that these drainage maintenance charges were held to be redeemable only subsequent to 1936, and it was intended that that should be the case in all cases.  To make that clear, we brought in this section.  I have looked into the matter since and I think it only right that, where a drainage system got out of repair and a sum of money had to be advanced to put it right, that money should be redeemed in regard to land on which there is a drainage charge&mdash; not a drainage rate, which will be kept on, I suppose, as long as a drainage system has to be kept going.  When land is taken over, that is a charge on it.  Other charges have to be redeemed and I think a drainage charge is a proper charge, which should also be redeemed.

      <P>I do not think the Minister is reasonable.  Take the case of a river in the vicinity of Roscommon, which the Minister will know. A drainage scheme in connection with the Hind river had to be restored under the 1924 Act away back in 1927. A certain sum of money was spent at that time as a kind of capital charge for the benefit of the land.  The repayment was fixed over a certain number of years which was supposed to cover the annual benefit to the occupier. That annual benefit was over a certain number of years and was fixed at a very small sum per annum, because that is what the benefit was worth. Take the case of some of the tenants along that river.  Suppose you were resuming one of the holdings to-morrow. The tenant has had only six years' benefit out of the drained land, whereas, in the opinion of experts, it would run for 35 years before he would have his own back from it.  Is it fair to ask that man to redeem the charge? He has not had the benefit, but you say to this man, for whose benefit the work was done, but who has not yet reaped the benefit: &ldquo;This is a liability which you must discharge and you must redeem the whole annuity, even though you have not got the benefits.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister did not appreciate my point.  My point, as to the maintenance charges pure and simple with which this section deals, has not been realised by the Minister. Outside of paying back the capital there is such a thing as maintenance <Col N="1699" /> charges, that is for completing the work year by year.  In the future say I am paying maintenance charges year by year.  Is it fair if the Land Commission resumes my land to-morrow that they should make me redeem the charge for work that is to be done in the next 50 years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid the Deputy is confusing two things.  One is the maintenance charge rate and the other is the repayment of the capital sum advanced to put the drainage systems which have got out of repair into repair.  We will have to go on all the time keeping the drainage area or system right.  Anyway the land after it has been drained is of more value and will fetch a higher price than it would fetch before the drainage. Theoretically the enhanced value of the land is greater than the amount that has been spent on the drainage. That is generally the case.  In valuing the land this value will be added to the added increment that is accruing to that land because of the drainage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit there is something in that point but I think that the word &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo; used here is the cause of the confusion.  In ordinary administration the words &ldquo;maintenance charges&rdquo; are not used down the country.  Maintenance is always regarded as what is accruing from year to year.  It is no wonder therefore that Deputy Bennett would see confusion in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the point in this case?  Reconstruction and restoration would be one thing where a drainage scheme was in existence, but where the system needed reconstruction and restoration that is quite a different thing from maintenance. Maintenance would mean restoration to keep it in proper order.  If it needed restoration the fault was due to the Land Commission originally.  This was property of the State and the Land Commission should have seen that the security of the State was being deteriorated. They should have asked for powers, but they did not ask for <Col N="1700" /> powers to deal with that matter.  This should now be a State liability.  The trouble generally arose in this way:&mdash; there is a water-way going through three or four or a half dozen holdings. Any one of these holders who is careless enough can dam the drainage at any particular point.  I mean dam not damn.  Any one careless man amongst these holders can ruin that particular system if he chooses.  Neglect at any one particular point will ruin the whole system back of it.  This is all due to the fact that provision was not made for this by the Land Commission. When the landlords' supervision was lost then the Land Commission became the guardian of the property.  The Land Commission did not ask for the measures required to keep that drainage in a proper condition of maintenance.  Therefore I say that anything that is needed now is a responsibility of the State because it is due to their neglect.  There is no question at all about that because the individual farmer who had land in such a drainage area could not help himself. He had no power to go into his neighbour's land and force his neighbour to keep the drainage system as it should be kept.  If that thing is traced back to its source it will be found that the Land Commission and not the farmer is to blame.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 30, before Section 53 (2), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  In making an order under sub-section (1) of this section the Lay Commissioners shall not empower the Land Commission to interfere with the water sources of, or supplying, a canal or other navigable waterway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of Section 53 of the Bill <Col N="1701" /> is to empower the Land Commission &ldquo;to make such water courses or such drains as may be specified in such order,&rdquo; and so on.  There seems to be some apprehension that if this section is passed it will empower the Land Commissioners to make orders which might affect the waters of the Grand Canal or other waterways. The Grand Canal is one of a number of water courses in the country.  If the Minister can see his way to accept this amendment it will remove any apprehensions there may be as to the powers given under the Bill to the Commissioners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no necessity for apprehension because of this section. The Land Commission only deal with very small waterways and there is no necessity whatever for this amendment.  Section 53 deals with only such cases of very necessary work that may arise.  I could not accept the amendment.  I can assure the Deputy that there is no fear of the Grand Canal being interfered with.  If I were to accept the amendment we would find ourselves tied up.</P>

      <P>I intend to oppose the passing of this section.  Public opinion in Waterford disapproves of the dissolution of the committee of management appointed under the Tuberculosis Prevention (Ireland) Acts, 1908 and 1913.  This section proposes that the committee of management appointed by the Council of the County Borough of Waterford is to be abolished and that the functions, powers and duties of the committee are to be transferred to the corporation. This committee of management&mdash;it has existed up to the present&mdash;had the advantage of the service of persons who were not members of the corporation. They rendered most useful service.  The help that they are able to give should not, in my opinion, be refused.  Opinion, locally, is that a separate committee is able to give the matters dealt with here closer attention than they can get under the proposed new arrangement.  The Minister, of course, will reply that what is proposed here applies in every case where you have a city manager.</P>

      <P>I would point out to the Deputy that <Col N="1705" /> this is a purely administrative function. The work to be done under this section comes within the ambit of the duties and responsibilities of a city manager. I do not want to say one word against the voluntary workers who were put on the committee originally, but I am quite satisfied that in the future the work will be done efficiently and well under the manager's supervision.</P>

The committee members were in close touch with the people living in the different portions of the city.  I do not want to say one word against city managers or officials, but I do say that because of their local knowledge the members of the committees were in a far better position to deal with those cases than any official could hope to be.  You do find people who have a natural disposition and inclination to assist in work of this kind.  It is humanitarian work of the highest importance, and when people's services are available I think they ought to be availed of.  It is not fair to poor afflicted people that they should be left entirely in the hands of an official.  I would earnestly appeal to the Minister to agree to the deletion of the section.</P>

It will deprive poor afflicted people of the generous help and assistance that they have been accustomed to receive from people who for years have been taking a most praiseworthy interest in this work.  I am not finding any fault with city managers or with officials, but, as I have said before, I do not think that an official could be expected to give to afflicted people that sympathetic attention which they have been accustomed <Col N="1706" /> to get from the kindly disposed citizens who have been acting on this committee for years.  I do not like to force this question to a division, because if I do I know in advance what the result will be.</P>
      <P>The Minister must be aware that numbers of people suffering from tuberculosis, especially in its incipient stages are, one may say, reticent in the matter of revealing their state of health.  It is really only in the last stages of the disease that they have resort for assistance to those occupying official positions.  There is, as we all know, a certain amount of hesitancy on their part to admit to anybody that they are in a delicate state of health.  I would appeal to the Minister to agree to the deletion of the section.</P>

      <P>The Chamber disapproves of this section, the effect of which is to render vacant premises, even though incapable of being let, liable to half rates.  There are similar provisions in the Limerick and Dublin Bills but not in the Cork Bill.  Waterford has been heavily hit by the decline in trade, the burden of revaluation and the failure to obtain new industries in the city.  In this regard it is in a much worse position than the other boroughs and this section will result in greater hardship to the city owners. The Chamber recognises that the aim of such provision is to discourage selfish owners from taking and holding stores and premises to prevent their being acquired by rivals.  In view of the great number of idle premises in the city and the scanty demand, or even inquiry, for them, the Chamber feels that these considerations do not apply to Waterford.</P>

    <P>The corporation feel intensely on this matter, that they should have the power to create stock.  It would be a great advantage if they could do so and would provide the opportunity for the investment of local money which, in many cases, would be diverted from other objects.

      <P>Strictly speaking, this is not a matter to be dealt with in this Bill or in any similar Bill, because it would necessitate an amendment of the Trustee Act, which should not be amended by a side wind.  I have a certain amount of sympathy with the proposition, but I do not think it proper that it should be done in this way.  I know that the question of amending the Trustee Act in this direction has been under consideration by the Department of Finance for some time.  I do not know when that consideration will be finally completed, but I know that there is a disposition to reconsider the provisions of the Trustee Act with a view to widening its scope in some directions, or lopping off branches in another direction.  When it is proposed to deal with it I cannot say.  I am not familiar as to how far the Department of Finance has gone in the matter, but I know it is under consideration.  I do not think it would be proper to amend the Trustee Act in the manner proposed here.</P>

      <P>This section deals with the decoration of the city out of the rates.  The feeling locally is that if any occasion arises, when it is proposed to show appreciation of distinguished people or visitors, that should be a spontaneous gesture and not be done at the expense of the ratepayers. Another point worthy of consideration is that occasionally we become politically minded, when one section of the corporation, or one section of the people, might be inclined to use the rates for the reception of distinguished people who think as they do.  That might lead to contention, and although I appreciate that the rate would not be used except by a decision of the majority of the corporation, it <Col N="1719" /> would be far better if such gestures of appreciation came spontaneously and not be levied on the rates.</P>

      <P>I do not feel inclined to accept the amendment.  I would like to give councils all the powers possible.  They need not use these powers, which are purely permissive. I do not think that such an occasion will arise very often.  If at any time it did arise and that something of importance locally or nationally happened any municipal council ought to have such powers.  Nowadays it is hardly likely that they would be used with any strong Party bias.  I suggest that such powers ought reasonably be at the disposal of municipal bodies if they wish to use them.</P>

      <P>This section is similar to one that is in the other Managerial Acts, and it was put there originally to give the mayor power in case of an emergency.  If say the City Manager fell suddenly ill, or met with some accident, and that some documents or cheques had to be signed, and that it was a matter of urgency, a deputy could be appointed <Col N="1721" /> by the mayor.  Personally, I do not feel very strongly on the matter, but we have similar sections in the other Managerial Acts that have been passed here and, so far as I am aware, it has worked out satisfactorily in Dublin and Cork.  I do not think any difficulty has arisen in the past and there has not been any objection to the mayor, who is the elected head of the municipal council, having that power.  It would probably be wise to leave it there.</P>

      <P>This is to meet the case that was put forward on the Second Reading.  I tried to put it in as liberal terms as I could.  If the majority of the people from a townland or portion of a townland that is sought to be included in the borough wished to go in, I have so worded the amendment that it would be possible for them to go in.  I think the proposal is reasonable.  I do not want to stop progress, if progress ever comes on the other side of the river, but this provision is a safeguard.  If the people do not want to go in, they cannot be forced in, and the other provisions of the Bill would not arise. I would like to have the Minister's opinion on this matter.</P>

      <P>My opinion is that there can be no extension of the boundaries of the City of Waterford without full inquiry and investigation and anything the Minister proposed to do, arising out of any inquiry that might be held at the request of the local authority, he would have to lay before the Oireachtas and there would be full opportunity for discussion. No order extending the boundaries could or would be made by the Minister without giving the fullest possible opportunity for investigation on the part of everybody concerned on both sides of the river.  People would have every opportunity of coming along and laying their views&mdash;individuals as well as organised bodies&mdash; before the person holding the inquiry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not heard any suggestions that there are likely to be extensions on the Kilkenny side of the river.  It has not been suggested to me directly or indirectly. This section is exactly a copy of what is in the Limerick one.  It was not put in specially with the view of allowing an extension of the Waterford City boundary on the Kilkenny side. It was put there in order to give the <Col N="1724" /> Minister power, if asked by the local authority, to hold the necessary inquiry to extend the boundary.  There has been no suggestion that there is going to be a demand to extend the boundaries on that side of the river.</P>

I do not think we would oppose it very much provided we had a guarantee that people living in other townlands of Kilkenny would not be forced in against their will.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 21:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 39 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The council shall, in addition and without prejudice to any power of acquiring land conferred by any other Act, have power to acquire land for playgrounds, sportsgrounds, and bathing spaces by way of purchase on lease and may contribute to the support of playgrounds, sportsgrounds or bathing spaces provided by any person whosoever.</P>
      <P>(2)  The council may make by-laws for the regulation of any such playgrounds, sportsgrounds and bathing spaces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with this amendment, I would urge on the Minister the necessity of empowering the council to acquire land for playgrounds for the people, and particularly for the children, of Waterford City.  A remark was made by a district justice <Col N="1727" /> in Waterford City recently with regard to offences committed there by children, but in my opinion, and in that of the members of the chamber of commerce, it is not so much the fault of the children themselves as of the lack of proper provision of playgrounds and sportsgrounds.  Besides the lack of such playgrounds being very dangerous for the children themselves and for people driving motor cars, it has become a nuisance to the people generally.  On these grounds, I would urge the Minister to accept this amendment.  According to the Land Acts, I understand that it is possible to acquire land for the purpose of playgrounds and sportsgrounds, but it is felt, in Waterford City, that it would be much more effective if such power were in the hands of the local council or corporation to acquire the land that they think is best fitted for the provision of playgrounds for the children, rather than to leave it in the hands of those administering the Land Acts.</P>
    <P>Another item in this connection, to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention, is that we are anxious to acquire land for the provision of public baths.  It seems to me to be extraordinary that, in Waterford City, there is no such thing as a public bath, and I think it is only right that this matter should be brought to the attention of the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I can tell the Deputy that it is not the fault of the law that Waterford City has not got playgrounds and recreation grounds before now.  There is plenty of law available for the Council there to use, if they want to use it.  As a matter of fact, I have a list here of, I think, about ten different Acts, all empowering the local authority there to acquire lands for such purposes, and yet these powers have never been used.  I suggest, therefore, to the Deputy that this amendment is not necessary.  These Acts, a list of which I have here, go back to, I think, 1859&mdash;that is, about 80 years&mdash;and any time within the last 80 years laws were available for the use of the old <Col N="1728" /> Corporation in Waterford, if they had cared to avail of them for such purposes. I suggest, therefore, that you cannot very well blame the law, but perhaps one could blame the lack of interest of the people themselves there in the welfare of their children and of their city.</P>

      <P>That it is expedient to authorise the payment out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas of such grants and expenses as are necessary to give effect to any Act of the present Session further to increase the amount of the Agricultural Grant referred to in Section 48 of the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, and to provide for the application of the said grant as so increased and for other matters connected with relief from rates on agricultural land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. Michael Brennan Mr. Michael Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Michael Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are making provision in this motion for the financing of the Rates on Agricultural Land (Relief) Bill, and I must say that it does seem an extraordinary thing to me that the present time was chosen for making a permanent measure of that Bill which, previous to this, was an annual Bill, and which gave the members of the House annually an opportunity of reviewing the rates situation and of expressing their opinions as to the adequacy or otherwise of the provision that was being made for the relief of agricultural rates.  Now, the Minister has chosen the present time, as I say, rather, I think, inadequately, to bring in this measure and make it permanent.  We are going to make permanent now a measure which was introduced away back in 1931 or 1932 for the relief of agricultural rates, and I am sure the then Government, in making the provision, had in mind the same type of comparison between the provision they were making and the then rate.  Well, whatever comparison could be made at that time or whatever relationship <Col N="1730" /> there was between the provision that was being made at the time to supplement the agricultural grant and the particular rates all over the country, that relationship has disappeared completely since then.  In 1931-32 the rates all over the country amounted to £2,445,269, and, as against that, a certain allowance was made by the Government of the day to relieve those particular rates.  To-day our rates have increased to £3,298,037; yet the Minister proposes to make permanent the relief which was granted in 1931-32.  I do not think any case has been made for making it permanent at the figure established in 1931-32.  I think that there should be at least the same relationship between the relief now granted and the present rates as there was between the relief granted in 1931-32 and the then rates.  As far as I can see, no reference has been made to the relationship between the relief granted now and the present rates.  The Minister has introduced, as a permanent measure, the 1931-32 Act in relation to a rate which has very materially changed since that time. The Minister may make certain statements with regard to the provision made to assist the agricultural community and the very generous way in which they have been treated, but I do not think the provision made in this Bill as a permanent measure bears out what the Minister has said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other points in the measure to which I think the Minister might have adverted when he was introducing the Bill, but I find from the Official Report that he made no reference to them.  Certain innovations in the original Bill were, in fact, experimental and were merely being tried out.  The Minister ought to be aware of the complications which arose as a result of the introduction of these innovations.  He should have told the House the result of the innovations and whether they had in fact achieved the object which he had in view.  For instance, we had employment grants provided for and we had also a credit note system.  I have drawn attention on other occasions to the very serious disadvantages which have accrued to some people, particularly people who <Col N="1731" /> have young, weak families, in connection with the employment allowance. We find that a man with sons over 17 or 18 years of age&mdash;I do not know whether the age is 17 or 18&mdash;is entitled to a certain allowance off his rates if he employs these boys on his land.  So also is the farmer who employs outside labour.  On the other hand, the unfortunate man who happens to have a long weak family, none of whom exceeds 17 years of age, or if any members of his family exceeding 17 years of age are daughters, does not get the allowance.  I have one such case in mind, the case of a man who lives right beside me.  That man has 11 children, none of whom has reached the qualifying age.  One of them may have reached the age, but she is a daughter, and that man can get no relief in his rates. Right beside him is a police pensioner who employs two men but who is doing very little.  He gets an allowance in respect of these men, while the man with the 11 children receives no allowance. If we apply the test as to whether this innovation has resulted in more employment on the land, the returns which have been made in regard to employment by the Department of Industry and Commerce are far from reassuring on that point.  In fact they show that there has been a diminution in the number employed, that we have not to-day nearly the same number of people employed on the land as we had before the measure was introduced.  Consequently, that particular innovation introduced in the Bill in 1932 has not had the desired effect.  Notwithstanding that, we are going to continue that particular provision as a permanent measure.</P>
    <P>We have also the credit note system. I admit that the credit note system is simply a permissive matter.  Power is given to local authorities to use the credit note in a particular way.  Again I say that the credit note system, wherever it was operated, inflicted a very great hardship on the very poorest people.  In the county which I represent, we abolished the system after it had been in operation for one year because what we found was that a man who paid his rates in time and <Col N="1732" /> who was able to pay them in time, got the allowance while the man who was not able to pay had the full amount carried forward against him and the following year he was confronted with a bill for an amount which his more well-to-do neighbour had never to pay. As a result of that, we dropped the credit note system.  Now, in this very inadequate measure, we are continuing all these innovations which in my opinion have not been a success at all.</P>
    <P>Results are what we must go by. What have been the results?  As far as the employment allowance is concerned, we have a fewer number of people employed than when the allowance was first introduced.  As far as agricultural production is concerned, we have less agricultural production. Consequently, the innovations which are being continued in this permanent measure have not had the desired effect.  I think that in view of the fact that a very strong demand could be made, and is being made, in this country for a system of derating, at least the agricultural community were entitled to more consideration to-day when their rates are in the neighbourhood of £3,500,000 than they were in 1931-32, when their rates were only about £2,500,000.  The relationship which existed between the then rates and the then grant does not exist to-day; yet we are proposing to make that measure of 1931-32 a permanent measure.  I do not think that due consideration has been given to the needs of the agricultural community in this matter.  I think that this is a very inopportune time to put this measure of 1931-32 on the Statute Book as a permanent measure.  I do not think it serves any useful purpose nor do I think any case has been made for limiting the relief of agricultural rates to the very inadequate amount provided at the present time.</P>

      <P>We cannot meet on a holyday because of the Minister's attitude in this matter, but he wants to take advantage of this House to give the lie to everybody in the country who states the position as they know it in the country.  One would be inclined to say hard things of the Minister because of the things he says and where he says them.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;They have lived better than most of the people comparable with them who are living in the cities and towns.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What does he mean by that?  Who are the people comparable with them?  I would like to know what he means and whom he means?</P>
      <P>&ldquo;They have reared their families and educated them.  There are more children going to secondary schools and more young people going to universities out of the farms of the country to-day than there were ten, 20, 30 or 40 years ago.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What authority has the Minister for saying that?  Has the Minister spoken to any school or college authority in the country, and, if he has, what information <Col N="1734" /> could he get?  Or did he want to cloak the actual facts of the case as they exist to-day?  The position in every county college and secondary school in the country is that there is not a president of a college who has not been struck by the fact that for the last five or six years, and more particularly at the present moment, the class of student is not going to their schools to-day who went five or ten or 20 years ago.  The students of the colleges are mostly the sons of schoolmasters, of doctors and of professional people, to such an extent that the college authorities are taking alarm at the position.  Does the Minister know that?  I do not wish to refer to a certain case that was heard in the courts here a few weeks ago in which four students were involved, but none of them is the son of a farmer.  The fact is that the farmers are not sending their sons to college.  How many of the farmers' sons who have been going to college are going in on a burse?  How many of them are going on a scholarship? How many of them are going to universities on scholarships?  And how many are going there who are paid for by their parents out of their own pockets?  The Minister raises that up as the hallmark of prosperity in the country.  That is the one argument he uses&mdash;that they are sending their children to school and giving them a higher education.  Have not they as much right, if they can afford it, as anybody else, even if they go hungry, as many of them do, in order to send their children to school?  The Minister has been more honest in that direction than a good many other people.  He has let the city mentality out of the bag.  I suspected that for a long time, and the Minister is more honest than the rest of them, and has given expression to it.  There is a feeling in this city that they do not want country students coming in; that there are not enough jobs for the sons of the professional people and all the others to be found around the City of Dublin.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that the Minister was trying to make a case, trying to blacken the agricultural community. Every argument that he used here was a lie, a misstatement of the <Col N="1736" /> actual position, and not one line of the whole speech he made has done him credit or justified his case.  I think it is a disgraceful speech and a disgraceful attitude to adopt on this measure. Time will justify the claim that we made.  There is no question about it. The Minister may be there to see proper justice done to the agricultural community.  If he is not there somebody else will be, and that in the very near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to repeat anything that was said on the Second Reading debate.  I think that the peculiar position in regard to this Bill is that while very effective criticisms were put forward in regard to certain provisions in the Bill, the Minister in his concluding statement did not reply to any of those criticisms but confined himself to a lecture upon farmers, upon their general outlook, and advising them to adopt a more cheerful attitude in regard to their present position.  If the Minister knew anything at all about farming, or if he had any contact at all with the agricultural industry, I think he would realise that whatever gloom exists in regard to the agricultural industry is not assumed by those who are speaking on behalf of the industry but is caused by the facts as they are at the present time.  The facts in regard to agriculture are gloomy facts, and the Minister cannot deny it.  It has been said that the present grant is absolutely inadequate. In order to show how inadequate the grant is I shall quote the figures for the County of Wicklow&mdash;the present rate estimate for Wicklow, as compared with 1932.  In 1932 the total rate estimate for County Wicklow was £57,921. In 1938 the total estimate was £120,940. These figures indicate that the total expenditure for the county has been doubled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again, as this Bill relates mainly to rates on agricultural land, it may be worth while to consider the rates in 1932 as compared with the rates at the present time or the rates last year.  In 1932 the rates on agricultural land in the County Wicklow were 3/4½ in the £.  In 1938 they were 6/2¾ on the £20 valuation, 6/3 on that part of the land affected by the employment allowance, <Col N="1737" /> and 9/2½ in the £ on the remainder of the land.  As every farmer Deputy knows, if the grant for relief of agricultural rates in 1932 was inadequate, surely when the rates on agricultural land have now been more than doubled, the allowance is absolutely ridiculous.  Surely the Minister should make up his mind to study agricultural conditions more closely, to study the facts regarding agriculture&mdash;not in the colleges of this city or of another city.  There is no doubt&mdash;and it is generally admitted&mdash; that farmers have always endeavoured to educate their children, even at great sacrifice to themselves.  Everybody who knows anything about educational institutions knows that the number of farmers' children at present being educated at such institutions does not compare with what it was five or six years ago.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister ought to have put forward some sound argument in support of this Bill, which makes permanent a system of distributing the agricultural grant which is condemned by everybody who knows anything about agricultural conditions.  He should try to justify that system, particularly in view of the fact that the Agricultural Commission is inquiring into the whole question of rating.  Yet here to-day we have an attempt being made to make the present system of allocating the agricultural grant permanent for all time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the objection to the system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>My objection to the system of distributing the whole agricultural grant is that it makes no allowance for children under 17 years of age, no allowance for female employees or dependents on the land, and is altogether inadequate for people employed on the land.  It is altogether an unjustifiable system of distributing the agricultural grant.  The whole grant is absolutely inadequate, as the Minister must know and as Deputy Corry must know.  Having regard to the fact that rates have been doubled since 1932, surely the agricultural grant should have been at least doubled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be inclined to <Col N="1738" /> treat with contempt what the Minister said in reply on the Second Reading Stage, but for the fact that he is a responsible Minister of State and I assume that he expressed the views of the Government in the matter.  If that represents the real view of the present Government, I must say the situation is utterly hopeless from the agricultural point of view.  If the Minister says, and persists in saying, that agriculture generally here and the people living by agriculture are fairly well off, and that they are fairly prosperous, the Minister fails and the Government fail completely to realise the position of agriculture in this country.  If the whole agricultural position is approached by the Government in that frame of mind I think the situation is utterly hopeless.</P>
      <P>There is no getting away from the fact that the vast majority of people appreciate that agriculture is in a very difficult position.  Our attitude on this Bill is that the help afforded under it is altogether inadequate to meet the present conditions when one considers that rates&mdash;as has been pointed out by Deputy Brennan&mdash;have gone up by over a million pounds since 1932.  In 1931-32, the rates were, approximately, something under two and a half million pounds and last year's rate was something over three and a half millions, so that it has gone up by over a million pounds; and this year's rate is higher again.  As well as that, the agricultural grant has gone down during that time. When Fianna Fáil came into office they increased the grant by a quarter of a million pounds the first year.  Afterwards, they reduced it by half a million, so that the agricultural grant to-day is actually less than it was in 1932, by a quarter of a million pounds.</P>
      <P>The general burdens on the agricultural community have gone up in the same proportion, and, side by side with that situation, our agricultural output has sunk and is sinking to an alarming extent.  The output then was £62,000,000 and that has fallen to £47,000,000.  In face of that situation, in face of a reduction in income&mdash;and a serious reduction in income, to my mind, is reflected in the cost of production being relatively greater than it was in 1932&mdash;the agricultural community are faced with this charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1739" /> The present relief afforded by this Bill, we are told by the Minister, is a generous allowance and taking, he tells us, the halving of the annuities into account, more has been done for the agricultural community than for any other section of the people.</P>
    <P>There is one thing I would like to point out to the Minister and to the Government.  It is the absolute necessity of preserving the agricultural community intact and preserving them as producers.  If anything happens our main industry, the whole fabric of the State is going to crack up and collapse, and I think we are far nearer to that than the Minister appreciates.  The Minister commented on the fact that every time that he hears certain Deputies&mdash;like Deputy Broderick and myself&mdash;we are getting more and more gloomy about the agricultural position. Evidently we have not penetrated the Minister's mind in the matter. Evidently he is living quite happily in a fool's paradise.  It is his serious responsibility to realise that the one important industry in this country is definitely in a very dangerous position at the present time.</P>
    <P>I am not attempting&mdash;and it is of no benefit to me&mdash;to paint a gloomy picture.  I am sorry we are in such a position, but I treat it as my responsibility in coming into this House to put the position of that industry before the responsible people.  The Deputies named by the Minister have completely failed to impress him.  The Minister went on to tell us of his experience, but is he aware that that is not the position?  I would be very much inclined to treat the Minister with contempt and scorn but for the fact that he is a responsible Minister living in the City of Dublin, in the environment of the city and without any contact with the country.  I do not know where he got his information: I was told that he got it from friends&mdash;he has a number of friends down the country; but it is an extraordinary situation if the Minister is getting reports from his friends showing that agriculture is in a good position at the present time, and does not require help.  I am afraid he is being misinformed: <Col N="1740" /> I know that he is being misinformed if that is the case.</P>
    <P>Our attitude definitely is that this relief to agriculture is not nearly sufficient in present conditions, and it is doubtful whether this Bill should be made a permanent measure, in view of the fact that a commission has been set up to examine the whole agricultural position.  This question of rates on agricultural land is a point raised by a big bulk of the agricultural community, as to the justice of such a charge at all, and when outside competitor countries in the market in which we sell our surplus produce are free of such rates, we must realise that if we are going to continue to hold that market, in competition with the keenest producers in the world, we must be put on the same basis.  If we are handicapped in any way, we are going to fall back, and that is what is happening at present.  It is not that our people are lazy, indifferent as regards their work, or do not know their job. We fail at present because the cost of production and overhead charges are relatively greater than those of the people against whom we have to compete. I appeal to the Minister not to make this Bill a permanent measure, and, in view of the fact that there is an enormous increase in local taxation and in the burden thrown back on our agricultural people, with, at the same time, a reduction in the grant of £250,000, I say that this relief is altogether inadequate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We would all wish to see more provision made for rates in this grant.  I did not intend to intervene at all but for the views expressed by some Deputies.  Deputies opposite evidently want to get back to the old system of rating, under which the rich man paid on the same scale as the poor man, and the small holder paid just as much on his valuation as the big holder.  We changed that, and we stand over it, as we stand over also the amount allowed for employees on a holding.  We stand over the whole lot, and we have every right to do so.

      <P>I did not interrupt Deputy Brennan.  Some two or three months afterwards, acting on the result of that action, when Deputy Brennan, Deputy Gorey and the rest of them went back to their constituents and saw what their attitude had cost them and what their neglect of the farming community had cost them, they came in here and passed an increase of £750,000 in the agricultural grant.  We increased that to the full £1,000,000 when we came in.  We have taken a little off since.  And why?  Because in the meantime we brought in the 1933 Land Act and relieved the farmers of £2,250,000 a year in land annuities.  We hear statements made by Deputies opposite in complete ignorance&mdash;I cannot describe it otherwise&mdash;of the position of the ordinary small holder, the holder under £20 valuation.  He is getting relief now and the ordinary man who works his farm and gives employment gets relief in his rates for every man he employs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies opposite want to abolish that.  That must be abolished because there are on the benches opposite not representatives of farmers but representatives of ranchers.  That is the sole reason.  Let us look at this matter straight and let us not have to listen to the kind of nonsense we have heard from the opposite benches for the past five years.  Ever since we attempted to hold the annuities their cry was: &ldquo;Give us back our markets <Col N="1742" /> and we shall be all right.&rdquo;  They have the markets back now and, in addition to that, practically every bit of produce from the land is subsidised out of the public purse.</P>

They had to go up because when Deputies opposite were the Government they absolutely neglected social services.  Rates have gone up because we have had to build cottages for the labourers whom they left without houses when they had the countryside as a slumland and a disgrace of such a character that one wondered how any human beings could live under the conditions under which they were living.  We had to put in water and sewage schemes for them. These things are driving up the rates, and are an undue burden on the community. But you had a Government which neglected these social services for ten years, and when a Government comes in which has to make up, in a short time, for the period during which these matters were neglected, rates are bound to go up.  The community certainly have to suffer under increased burdens in consequence.  I am as anxious as any Deputy here to see the rates reduced and to see increased grants given, but I am not going to stand here and listen to complaints from Deputies who were here during the period when those social services were neglected, and who in those times did not make their voices felt in their Party circles when they saw the condition of the unfortunate agricultural labourers down the country.</P>

      <P>Deputy Brennan does not like what I am saying.  I am certainly anxious that we would get increased allowances on rates, but when we are faced with the position in which we have definite arguments and definite opposition to the little relief that the ordinary small farmer and smallholder is getting at present, and a definite objection to the manner in which this grant is being administered and distributed we must address ourselves to the position.  Here there is a very decided and a very definite objection to the man who employs three, four or five men on his holding getting a larger relief in rates than the rancher who employs no man at all.  When we have that definite objection voiced here by Deputies who represent constituencies where there are no ranchers&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to give agriculturalists living in urban areas the benefit of the Agricultural Grant. These agriculturalists have a good many <Col N="1746" /> limitations even though they have one advantage.  In the old days when the relief of rates was first passed, the Bill was not framed in this country and urban areas were excluded.  The urban area in Great Britain is very different from the urban area in this country. The urban area in Great Britain has other potential values.  Anyway, we have adopted the British Act here, but it does not work fairly.  I am satisfied that the advantage to which I wish to refer arises in this way, that the urban rates here are in two sections, first, the town rate, and the other the rate for the country services.  In the town rate the urban areas have an advantage in the matter of land; they are charged only 25 per cent. of the rates on land.  But they have to pay the full county rate.  It is with the county rate I want to deal.  The urban owners of land have the disadvantage of high valuations, and it is on these high valuations the rates are struck. What was formerly the reason for the high valuation on land in urban areas was the proximity value.  That has now gone.  People living four, six or ten miles away from an urban area have the advantage of the local markets ówing to the improved transit facilities, just as well as the people living in the neighbourhood.  The urban holders have the disadvantage of a line of demarcation.  You have one set of agriculturalists on one side of the fence which happens to be in the county, and there obtains there the relief on agricultural rates.  The man at the other side of the fence, at the urban side, has not that advantage.  As I pointed out on the Second Reading, that has led to a great deal of unrest amongst the owners of land in urban areas.  They cannot see why they should not get the benefit of the Agricultural Grant on the rates they pay for county services. That is not such a very big matter to the county rates or the urban rates. There are not so many urban areas, and the land in urban areas is not so extensive.  I believe it would be an act of justice to pass this amendment.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Ministry hold that there is a corresponding relief in the town rate, inasmuch as the town rate is levied only on 25 per cent. of <Col N="1747" /> the value of the land.  But the town rate in most urban areas to-day is extremely high, and even 25 per cent. of the town rate means a very substantial rate on the owner of the land. However, it is not with that section of the services that I am now dealing.  In tabling this motion I would have much preferred, because it would be more in conformity with my views and sense of justice, if the rules of the House permitted me to put down an amendment extending the grant or increasing the grant to the people in urban areas. Unfortunately, I could not do that within the rules of the House.  So I have to content myself with this subterfuge in trying to get in this amendment in this particular way in which it is drafted.  The merits of the case stand out very clearly.  The amount of money involved is not large.  The increase of this grant to land owners in urban areas would be very largely repaid by the sense of justice and fair play that would welcome it.</P>
    <P>On the Second Reading of the Bill I stated that, in my opinion, in order to encourage everybody in the State to give of his best, the first essential was to give a feeling of a sense of fair play, that the laws were being justly administered, and that there could be no exemptions.  I know that the position with regard to this Agricultural Grant is one that the Minister has inherited, and that there are big difficulties in the way of meeting it, as the Minister himself pointed out when winding up the Second Reading debate.  It is in order to give him an opportunity of understanding those difficulties that I have put down the amendment.  What is the Ministerial point of view on this; what, in his view, are the disadvantages, and will he, if not now, at some future date consider extending the relief afforded under the Agricultural Grant, as a matter of justice, to farmers living in urban areas?</P>
    <P>In urban areas you have this position: you have valuations varying from 42/- to 51/6 an acre.  Even where the owners of land are allowed half the town rate, they still have to pay on a substantial valuation; but when you come to the levy for county services, <Col N="1748" /> on the full amount of their valuation, whether it be 40/-, 42/- or 45/-, you find that the rate in the urban area is extraordinarily high, whereas the county rate may be only about 50 per cent. of it, and in many cases not even 40 per cent. of the urban rate. In view of all this, I would ask the Minister to inquire into the matter. My submission is that, so far as the urban areas are concerned, the portion of the agricultural grant called the county services rate should be made operative in them.</P>
    <P>I gave some examples the last day of the injustice of the present system. On one side of the fence you have a man with a farm of 50 acres.  If he is living in the county area his rates may be no more than £23 or £24.  A man holding the same amount of land in an urban area will have to pay £65 or £70 in rates.  These two men have to meet in the same market.  They get the same price for their produce; they have to pay the same wages to their labourers.  In fact, all their expenses are about the same, but yet one man has to pay almost three times as much in rates as the other.  I think that if the Minister were to meet this demand from the urban areas it would go a good way to inspire a sense of evenhanded justice and fair play.  Agitations which have no justice behind them do not concern me.  This, at any rate, is a case calling for justice and fair play.  I believe that the people in the urban areas have a just claim for an extension of the benefits of the agricultural grant.  If the case made for them is not met now, I believe it will have to be met at some future date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support the amendment.  I am aware that the Minister stated on the Second Reading of the Bill that this question was complicated in various ways.  He mentioned that he had met deputations on a number of occasions and had gone into the matter fully with them.  Many farmers living in urban areas who are concerned in this matter are of the opinion that the people on those deputations did not truly represent them or their interests.  They believe that the representations were <Col N="1749" /> made by people in urban areas not directly concerned with this matter at all.  I would be glad if the Minister would sympathetically consider, if not now, as Deputy Broderick said, then at some future date the case that has been made for the extension of the relief given under the agricultural grant to farmers living in urban areas.</P>
      <P>I can speak on this from local knowledge. You have, for instance, a number of farmers living in the City of Galway and in the town of Ballinasloe. They feel that they have a greater grievance than any other section of the agricultural community in the country, because of the fact that they are not getting any relief from the agricultural grant, and further because of the fact that they are not enjoying now facilities which they once had.</P>
      <P>At one time the farmers living in both centres used to do a considerable amount of carting.  Since the advent of motor transport they have lost all that work.  Consequently, they have to live now solely out of agriculture and out of the produce of their holdings.  They are in just the same position as people living farther out. All have to sell their produce in the same market, but the farmers in the urban areas are denied this relief under the agricultural grant which goes to their competitors on the other side of the fence.  I would feel very pleased if the Minister would sympathetically consider this matter: that if he cannot see his way now to extend the full benefit to those people that, anyhow, he will extend portion of the benefit to them so as to help to ease their situation, and give them the impression that they are not being forgotten.</P>

      <P>I also desire to support the amendment.  In my opinion every genuine farmer, whether he lives in an urban district or outside of it, should be eligible to receive the benefits conferred by the agricultural grant. There may be difficulties in the way of giving effect to the amendment.  The last speaker ran in on some of them when he suggested that at one time farmers in urban areas were engaged in other operations than agriculture. I know from my own knowledge <Col N="1750" /> numerous farmers in urban areas who are solely engaged in agriculture. They are doing just the same work as men living out in the country.  If we are to take it that the agricultural grant is intended to afford relief to those engaged in agriculture, then the farmers in the urban areas to whom I have referred are, in equity, as much entitled to this benefit as those who are receiving it at present.</P>

Grievances such as that farmers in Counties Cork, Limerick and Galway suffer under in this matter also exist in the County Mayo, particularly in the urban areas.  I hope that the Minister will respond to the appeal that has been made to him from all sides to extend the benefits of the agricultural grant to those who have land in, and reside in, urban areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret I cannot give any consideration on this occasion to the appeals made in support of the amendment.  I think that if we were to adopt, and put into operation, this amendment without any further consideration, we would be simply creating new anomalies in addition to those that exist at the moment.  I know that Deputy Broderick has given a lot of study to this matter.  He knows it as intimately as I do.  He has discussed it in his own area and in the Department of Local Government.  There are many other Deputies who are also familiar with it. The whole situation in relation to this is anomalous.  It has grown up piecemeal. Certainly, since I became Minister no opportunity has presented itself of getting at this problem in the fashion that a Minister would like to get at it; that is of cleaning the slate and of starting with a new foundation.  That is what will require to be done some day.  I hope that the opportunity will be given some time to do that.  I would like, as far as it is humanly possible, to clear away the anomalies that exist on all sides with regard to this agricultural grant.  There are many laws connected with it &mdash; many <Col N="1751" /> Acts of Parliament.  Grants were given at different times on different bases, and were apportioned in entirely different ways.  It would be well to have the whole system reorganised and co-ordinated.  As I said here when I spoke on the Second Reading &mdash;a speech that seemed to create a good deal of interest&mdash;if possible I should like to see more money got for the agricultural grant, but it is not possible at the present time.  One reason is that we have a Valuation Bill under consideration in the House at present, and I do not think it would be wise to do anything in the way of reorganising or co-ordinating this matter until the valuation has been completed.  Then there would have to be a reconsideration of the whole rating problem.  It will all have to be reconsidered and perhaps reorganised. I suggest that after the Valuation Bill passes and the valuation has been completed would be the proper time to take into account the reconsideration and re-organisation of the rating system, the agricultural grant, and the division of the agricultural grant.</P>
      <P>From my study of the situation, I do believe that we would create practically as many anomalies as there are at present by giving that grant to the urban areas.  We would be giving it to people who do not deserve to get it &mdash;people who have agricultural land, so called, in urban areas.  We have had to pay as much as £1,000 an acre for what is called agricultural land in those areas when we wanted it for a housing scheme.  Is it right that those people should get the agricultural grant?  I do not think so.  That is what would happen.  That is what has happened in Dun Laoghaire, for instance, and, to some extent, in the City of Dublin, County Dublin, County Wicklow and County Cork it would happen.  It may not perhaps be £1,000 an acre, but it is a very great sum.  Galway was mentioned by Deputy Beegan.  I have heard of plots of this so-called agricultural land&mdash;plots for one house&mdash;costing £300 or £400.  Is it considered that those people would be entitled to share in the agricultural grant?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>I expected that there were difficulties in the way, and, as I said, it was in order that the Minister would understand those difficulties I put down the amendment.  I have to admit that I was not impressed by the difficulties which the Minister has put before us to-night.  His first point was that it would create anomalies, and that rapacious people who got the extortionist price of £1,000 an acre would get the benefit of the agricultural grant.  Is that any justification for refusing assistance to the hardworking farmer, with purely agricultural land, putting up with all the limitations which agriculture has at the moment?  We know that there are sites which have a potential building value, and are entirely outside the sphere of agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I distinctly remember an application from somebody to get in under one of the old Acts, and the answer of the Commission at that particular date was: &ldquo;No; this land has a potential building value, and cannot come under it.&rdquo;  I thoroughly understand the different bases on which the agricultural grant is administered, but I can see no administrative difficulty at all in the case of the bona fide agricultural farmer inside the urban area, who has no hope at all that his land will ever become a building site.  Is it fair to point to him and say: &ldquo;Because <Col N="1753" /> your neighbour down the road, and your neighbour bordering on the seacoast, and your neighbour within the extension of the local suburban area, have got £150, £200, or £1,000 for an acre of land, you are not going to get what you are entitled to&rdquo;?  I do not think that is an argument of any substance. Again, you must remember that you have undertaken building schemes of greater volume than anyone who preceded you.  But that has got to end some time.  It cannot continue indefinitely.  That in itself is no reason why the agricultural grant should not be extended to the bona fide agriculturists within the urban area.</P>
    <P>The Minister did refer to one point which I readily admit had some substance in it, namely, that it would not be an easy matter to differentiate between what can be termed an agricultural holding and what would be a residential holding having a potential building site value, but it is not impossible.  In this amendment I am asking that those words be deleted only in favour of those who are bona fide agriculturists; people who have no hope of their land acquiring a building site value or anything else; people whose ancestors for generations back have been agriculturists in purely agricultural areas.  It must be remembered that many of our own towns are not extending.  Unfortunately, they are contracting.  Potential building sites in many of our provincial towns are getting less attractive and less valuable every day.  The farmers in the neighbourhood who are supplying those towns have less advantages and less facilities.  As I said, the Minister's arguments have not impressed me.  I am not ready to admit that there are administrative difficulties which it is not possible to surmount.  I believe that those people are entitled to be included, and I think they could be included.  On the question of a division I should like to say that there are people on the opposite side who hold the same view as I do on this matter, and if I were to challenge a division they would be brought in to vote against their convictions.  I do not <Col N="1754" /> believe I would be justified in putting those Members into that position.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 5 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If and whenever an increase of the agricultural grant in respect of any financial year is provided under Section 4 of this Act the council of a county shall make out of the sums so provided to every person rated in respect of a tenement of agricultural land (being a hereditament or tenement which consists wholly or partly of agricultural land situate within the rating of such council) an allowance calculated according to the proportion <Col N="1756" /> that the valuation of such hereditament or tenement bears to the total valuation of such agricultural land as is situate within the rating area of such council.</P>
    <P>This amendment was tabled with the idea of making the distribution of the agricultural grant more equitable.  It would help to do away with the difficulties that the Minister has in mind in regard to the distribution of the grant and the difficulties of the county councils in assessing the proportions of the different ratepayers and the cost of doing that, and, incidentally, in the collection of the rates.  As to the reasons for this, we have had it advocated from the other side that the present method of distributing the grant has several advantages.  The main argument in favour of it is that it assists the small farmer and helps to relieve unemployment.  There are some 300,000 odd holdings in this country and something over 268,000 farmers, big and small, of which 50,000 are what one might call the larger farmers; at least they are the people who employ labour. Apparently it is the desire of the present Government that these 50,000 people, who I might say are the backbone of this State as agriculturists, should be impeded, hampered, and persecuted in every way.  Legislation in this State seems to be directed mainly against that particular 50,000. The people against whom the provisions of the Land Bill which we have been discussing would operate would be some of these 50,000 who employ labour.</P>
    <P>Before this Government interfered with employment in this State there were 130,000 labourers employed by these 50,000 people.  The Minister proposes in this peculiar measure to make permanent a system under which about one-sixth of the entire grant is to be given as an employment bonus. In other words, out of the present grant, £326,000 will be given as an employment bonus.  So that, to continue to employ 130,000 people, £360,000 is to be given as an inducement.  That sum would scarcely suffice, as some Deputy said the other day, to pay for the insurance stamps.  The niggardly bonus that is given under the distribution <Col N="1757" /> system in this measure is not an inducement to anybody to employ men.</P>
    <P>Deputy Broderick moved an amendment to include urban districts in the distribution.  I said I approved in principle of his amendment although there might be difficulties in the way, as there probably are.  I approved of the principle because I hold that, if this House votes any money for the relief of the farming community generally, then the division of that money should be <i>pro rata</i> amongst the various members of that community and not in different shares as between one and the other.  I said in another debate not long ago that we in this House ought not to advance the principle that a differentiation should be made between the smaller and the bigger farmers.  There has been a tendency in this House, and Deputy Corry emphasised it to-day, to say that we stand for the big farmers and that the Government Party stand for the small farmers.</P>

      <P>We offered them more material help than Deputy Corry.  I am not speaking of lip service.  I leave it at that.  The Minister, in his references to the Bill on Second Reading, was unfair to farmers generally.  The Minister made the references he did probably because he was ignorant of his subject.  He freely admitted that he knew nothing about land and that, if he were offered land, he would not take it because he did not know anything about it.  If he was ignorant as to the use of land, he was certainly ignorant as to the position of the people who live on the land.  Otherwise, he would not have used the expressions he did.  We may be &ldquo;monarchs of all we survey,&rdquo; but there are many people disputing our rights. If we are monarchs of all we survey, so is the tramp on the road.  He is free to come and go as he likes and to do <Col N="1758" /> all the things that the Minister said we were free to do.  Does anybody say that the tramp should be held up as an example to members of this House?  The Minister was rather unfortunate in his references, and I shall leave it at that.</P>
      <P>This grant will have no effect whatever in helping employment.  At best, it would offer a very small inducement for the employment of an additional man.  The spreading of £300,000 over 130,000 workers is not going to induce anybody to employ labour.  There were 50,000 farmers employing labour.  These 50,000 farmers paid rates in 1931-32 amounting to £2,400,000 and they employed much more labour than they are employing now.  Their rates have since gone up by the greater part of a million pounds.  The prices of their commodities have not risen with the increase of rates and they have been forced to economise.  It may be that some of them have been obliged to economise at the expense of labour. When you reduce an industry to breaking point, labour must suffer.  Labour has suffered under the legislation introduced by the present Government dealing with farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry, who is taking notes, will probably get up later and say that I am denying the rights of the small farmer.  I am not.  The poor farmer &mdash;if you like to call the man with a valuation of £5 or £2 a poor farmer&mdash; has many benefits.  It will make little difference to him how this grant is distributed.  His rates are small.  In most cases, it will not make 10/- or £1 difference to him.  This grant will make no material difference to the £5 man and he is the man who generally finds it easy to pay his rates because he is compensated for his payments. He is eligible for the services which are mainly provided at the expense of the larger ratepayer.  As Deputy Corry knows, he is eligible for relief work and for road and other works which are provided mainly by the larger ratepayer.  He is eligible for all these&mdash;and more power to him.  In addition, he is eligible for all the health services provided by the rates, including hospital treatment, for which the larger farmer is not eligible.  The <Col N="1759" /> larger ratepayer contributes the bulk of the cost of these services and he is not entitled to share in them.  If this were an annual measure it might not be so intensely objectionable but an attempt is made to convert this into a permanent measure.  I cannot agree to that.</P>
    <P>It was to afford the Minister an opportunity of understanding the position that I put down my amendment, because I do not believe that he does understand the position.  Does the Minister fully realise that the 50,000 people who are the main providers of the public services under the local authorities are the people who are being deprived of their fair share of the grant?  Does he know that, when you hamper those 50,000 persons, you reduce employment?  Does he know that, by every section you put in a Bill making the distribution of a grant difficult, you impose a greater responsibility on the local bodies?  Does he know that by every burden you put on the larger ratepayer&mdash;the history of the last four years has proved this&mdash; you make the collection of the rates more difficult?  The Minister knows that the largest amount of arrears of rates is due by the larger ratepayers because they are the people who found it most difficult to pay.  Many of them were endeavouring to keep men employed when they could not afford to do so.  They were endeavouring to maintain the position they previously occupied.  Eventually, some of them had to retrench, with consequent loss of employment.  The distribution of the agricultural grant, as carried out by the present Ministry, has not been effective in improving employment or improving the position of any farmer, whether large or small.  No sound argument can be advanced for such an inequitable distribution of this grant as is proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>My main objection to the present system of distributing the agricultural grant is because of the injustice to the farmer with children under 17 years of age.  In the income-tax code and in every reasonable system of relief from taxation, the <Col N="1760" /> citizen with helpless dependents is given first consideration.  In this Bill for the distribution of the agricultural grant the farmer with helpless dependents is absolutely excluded from relief except in so far as the first £20 of his valuation is concerned.  The Minister has not made any attempt to defend that.  Neither has he made any attempt to defend the exclusion of female dependents or employees on the farm from any abatement.  Does the Minister consider that it is not desirable to have female domestic servants employed on the land?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that if this amendment is carried, it will completely rule out the other amendment dealing with a flat rate in connection with the agricultural grant.  Of course it will be said that this system confers great benefits upon small holders.  The rates on agricultural land under £20 valuation in my constituency were 6/6¾ in 1938, and in 1932, when there was a flat rate&mdash;such as is contemplated in the amendment&mdash;the rates upon all agricultural land were 3/4½, so that they have practically doubled.  Of course that is due to the burdens that have been piled on to local taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>6/3 on that part of the valuation which is subject to the allowance for employees, and on the balance 9/6½.  Surely the Minister must acknowledge that as the rates on small holdings have been doubled, no benefit is now being conferred upon them. The solution of the problem lies in increasing the agricultural grant to a certain extent, or the complete derating of agricultural land.  We suggest that there should be no difference made between the various valuations.  The main purpose of the amendment is to have the grant equally distributed on <Col N="1761" /> all agricultural land.  The Minister has not faced up to the question, and has not gone into the grievances of the agricultural community.  He has not taken into account the hardships imposed on agricultural ratepayers for the past seven or eight years.  The time has now come when the Minister should face up to his responsibility, and, as a first step, should accept the amendment, and, as a second step, increase the grant to such an extent as would derate agricultural land.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cogan has hit the nail on the head.  The Deputy's interest in the small holders would result in making them pay an additional 2/8 in the £.  That is the Deputy's interest in the small holders, that they should pay 9/2 as well as ranchers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the Deputy's suggestion on behalf of the small holders.  Deputies should not object, when I say that they do not represent the ordinary farmers, if they take up such an attitude or bring in such an amendment, endeavouring to have the little relief that this Government has conferred on small holders whose valuations are under £20, and on those who employ labour, taken away. They are endeavouring to put these people in the same position as men with 1,000 acres who employ a man and a dog.  I submit that they have no mandate from anybody to come here and to take up such an attitude. Before this relief was given the question was very carefully considered by those who represent the farming community much more than Deputy Cogan does.  While I am more than anxious to see the farming community getting all the relief that it is possible to give them, and if possible getting the agricultural grant doubled, I say that if the grant was increased, I would apply it to those who give employment, rather than to men with 500 or 600 acres who employ only a man and a dog, If there is any relief to be secured, as far as it is within my power, I will see that it goes to ordinary working farmers.  I have no sympathy whatever for the individuals <Col N="1762" /> for whom Deputy Bennett and Deputy Cogan spoke.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I took a note of the figures Deputy Cogan gave.  He says that on small holdings they were paying 6/6¾ and 9/2 on the larger ones. Deputy Cogan's interest in the small holders is such that he thinks they should be made pay 9/2 in order to relieve men with 1,000 acres, who employ a man and a dog.  That was a most nonsensical attitude for any Deputy to take up.  I have seen that attitude adopted repeatedly.  We had the same attitude and the same mentality for three years in connection with the Land Bill.  I do not think the amendment would be accepted by anybody who did not wish to go back to the old bad days.</P>

The Deputy who said &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; was the Deputy who assisted the previous Administration to reject district water and sewerage schemes, and that completely neglected to provide for the reconstruction of small farm houses or dwellings in rural areas.  If social services were neglected until this Government took up the question, blame those who neglected them for years.  If the rates have now gone up, that is the main reason.  Let us not have nonsensical amendments brought forward in order to bolster up a tribe that, thank God, is fast dying out.  There will be very few with 500 acres who employ only a man and a dog, in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>They gave a grant of £750,000 to relieve the position of agriculture. The Fianna Fáil Party at the time said that was not enough, and that the position of agriculture demanded more.  When they came into office they raised it to £1,000,000. What did they do then?  The next year they reduced it by £448,000. They brought in the trimmings that have been referred to by Deputy Corry, but they reduced the agricultural grant by £448,000.  A certain reshuffle took place with regard to the reliefs that were so necessary because <Col N="1764" /> the small farmers were passing through the trying period of the economic war.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt Deputy Corry, but if he wants to interrupt me it is only fair to let him know that I am quite able to deal with him.  If he will permit me to go on, I will explain why the amendment should be supported.  Various reshuffles took place, allegedly for the benefit of the small farmers and the labouring men.  There was that reduction of the agricultural grant and together with that we had an increase of rates.  This increase took place annually, and the rates were going up as the years rolled on.  The rates were increased because of the various social services imposed on the country by the Minister.  That loaded the dice completely against the large holder, the man with the large valuation, the man who was giving a very large amount of employment, the man who is carrying on production and who is able to spend money, and did spend money.  When that type of man had to stop his activities, largely because of Government policy, it meant an immense loss to the local towns, and the shopkeepers there are bitterly regretting the exodus of such men. The dice was loaded against them by the reshuffle which took place, and the increasing rates bore heavily on them because of their large valuations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a matter for regret that the Minister has not realised the very serious position in which these men were placed.  He has not realised the serious plight of agriculture.  Deputy Corry had some experience of those difficulties in several directions, except in the sale of new milk which he carries on and where such men are in a privileged position, and they are able to carry on without the disadvantages suffered by men in areas such as Deputy Bennett represents, in the various creamery districts.  These men are suffering because of the reduction in the agricultural grant and because of the increased costs and the high impositions thrown upon them through the policy of the Government.  It is <Col N="1765" /> a matter for regret that the Minister has not seen his way to increase the grant towards the relief of agriculture.</P>
    <P>As regards derating, I am not one of those who believe that the halved annuities in any way gave the relief that derating of agricultural land would give.  The small farmer, of whom Deputy Corry speaks in such glowing terms, is the object of our sympathy.  He has borne up against many troubles and hardships because he has his own labour.  The large farmer is not in that position.  The small man had his own labour.  He had workers who did not mind working long hours if the occasion demanded it.  In the case of the large farmers the hours of the agricultural labourers were short, and the employers had to cope with that as one of their difficulties with increased wages.  I am not saying that that is a thing that should not happen.  I am not anxious to see the agricultural labourer a slave to long hours.</P>
    <P>Very definitely the amendment brought in by Deputy Bennett is necessary. These men I have referred to, the men with over 100 acres, are only 8 per cent. of the farmers of the country, but is that any reason why they are to be disregarded?  Is it because they are numerically few they may therefore be disregarded by a Party anxious to secure the votes of the people?  Is that the reason they are to be disregarded when it is known that the effects of their exodus will be seriously felt, not alone by the agricultural labourers but by the business people in the towns?  The fact that the Government proposed £1,000,000 to relieve the farming community, the fact that they raised the grant by £250,000 over what the last Administration gave, showed how they regarded it as necessary to relieve agriculture.</P>
    <P>I feel that the strictures made by Deputy Corry were not justified.  I am certain the action of the Minister is not in keeping with the promise to help agriculture, to relieve it from the serious embarrassments in which it is placed.  Is the door closed on derating?  Is the action of the Minister, in passing such a Bill as this, limiting the amount of the agricultural <Col N="1766" /> grant to its present figure and closing the door on relief to others than those he has already set out to relieve?  Does it mean that we are not to have any further relief from ever-increasing rates?</P>
    <P>It is very well known that the rates are increasing for every county council in the country.  The Minister insisted on them striking a certain rate in Cork. Only a few years ago the Cork County Council wished to strike the same rate as they had struck in the previous year. The Minister carried them into court and insisted on a mandamus and we had to strike the higher rate that the Minister demanded.  When the Minister has the power to insist on increasing rates, he ought not to close the door against the relief to which the agricultural community are entitled and without which they cannot carry on.</P>
    <P>I daresay Deputy Corry is very amused.  I do not care a jot.  He has often been amused at a great many sensible things that were done.  He is in disagreement very probably with the Minister and he is very likely opposed to the action of the Minister in secret.  He has a fairly large holding himself, and if it were not for the privileges that are being given to milk vendors, together with certain well-stabilised prices, he probably would be a rebel against the Bill to-day.  I certainly say that it is not for the good of the country, that the larger holders will be thrown out of benefit and definitely wiped out, because that is the position of affairs that will take place if agriculture, in all its various branches, does not get the relief to which it is entitled.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan was subjected to a certain amount of cross-examination as to the amounts of the rates.  Now, in various counties those rates vary very much.  In Cork County, for example, the rate varies to an enormous degree, as Deputy Corry himself knows.  A farthing in the £ in East Cork will make as much money as a penny in the £ in West Cork, where the upkeep of the roads was starved, in the past, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle himself can bear out, and as the upkeep of the roads all over the county is very <Col N="1767" /> largely a burden borne by the East Cork farmers, I do not think Deputy Corry will have the hardihood to contradict me on that point.  Deputy Corry and I have found agreement in regard to certain items of taxation in connection with Cork City and the relation it bears to rural areas.  I think he will also bear me out in connection with the heavy burden that the ratepayers of East Cork have to bear in comparison with the comparatively light burden that is placed on the ratepayers of West Cork; and this is going to hit the farmers of East Cork very severely.</P>
    <P>We did imagine that the many promises of relief that were made at the elections, and made particularly by the Deputy opposite who spoke last, were going to be carried out, and I must express my disapproval and disappointment as to the position in which farmers are placed under this Bill.  I am sure that the Minister has not been blind to the fact that there was a very unanimous protest against the attitude taken up by the Minister in connection with this Bill, made in Cork last Saturday, and I hope the remarks made there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Before Deputy Brasier came in I had explained, in the debate on the Money Resolution, the change that had been brought about by the £1,000,000 for derating introduced by this Party when in opposition, and for which the then Government gave £750,000.

      <P>If I understand Deputy Bennett's amendment correctly the intention is to alter the system that has been in operation for the last five or six years and which it is proposed to continue indefinitely under this Bill, whereby the total amount of the agricultural grant was divided <Col N="1769" /> under certain conditions&mdash;a certain amount of it a primary grant, a certain amount of it an employment grant, and a certain amount for a supplementary grant.  The purpose of the employment allowance is to give the maximum of rate relief to farmers who give employment on the land.  The employment allowance amounts to £333,000.  That is divided amongst those who give employment.  The supplementary allowance is £325,000.  The £333,000 employment allowance is given on a valuation of £1,076,000, and the supplementary grant of £325,000 is given on a valuation of double that amount.  That is the principle that is laid down in the Bill.  If I were to accept Deputy Bennett's amendment, or if the amendment were carried in the House, it would mean that the whole Bill would have to be withdrawn and recast.  That, I presume, is the intention, and therefore I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, Sir, I should like to say a few words on the amendment before the matter is concluded.  I am still unconvinced by anything that either the Minister or Deputy Corry has said in this connection.  The Minister said very little.  In fact, what the Minister said did not make his case either good or bad, and he kept as far away as possible from the issue; but I may say that Deputy Corry's lip service to the gallery, as I might call it, did not impress either his Party or the House, because I did not see any Deputy from his own side of the House get up to support him.  I want to tell Deputy Corry that any attempt he makes to put this Party in the light of seeming to support one section of the farmers against another section will fail now, as it always failed&mdash;and will fail definitely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If any material assistance, apart from lip service, can be given to a small farmer, or to a big farmer, there are some of us who have given it, and who will continue to give it, where Deputy Corry might not be so certain to give it.  I shall not put the House, Sir, to the necessity of walking into <Col N="1770" /> the Lobby to divide on this, because I can see that the Minister has no intention of accepting the amendment, and it would be impossible to convince some of the members of his Party of its justice.</P>

    <P>Sections 5, 6 and 7 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 8.</P>
    <P>(1)  In this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;the qualifying period&rdquo; means the period of twelve months ending on the 31st day of December next preceding the commencement of the financial year in relation to which the expression is used, and the expression &ldquo;adult workman&rdquo; means a male person who, at the commencement of the qualifying period in relation to which the expression is used, was not less than seventeen years of age nor more than seventy years of age and who was not and whose wife was not, at any time during the qualifying period, the rated occupier of agricultural land the valuation or the aggregate of the valuations of which during the qualifying period was equal to or greater than five pounds.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 29, to delete the word &ldquo;workman&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;worker&rdquo;; in line 30 to delete the word &ldquo;male&rdquo; and in this and subsequent sub-sections to delete the word &ldquo;workman&rdquo; wherever it occurs and substitute the word &ldquo;worker&rdquo; in each line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is another amendment aimed at securing justice in the distribution of the grant.  A lot has been said about the employment of labour, and the niggardly £326,000 to which the Minister referred, spread over 130,000 workers, but even on this question of the allowances for employment, the Minister is not just in the method of distributing the grant as between one farmer and another.  I have repeatedly brought this question before the House until, perhaps, some Deputies have got sick of it, but I again avail of this occasion <Col N="1771" /> to try to remedy the injustice inflicted on certain farmers.  When on previous occasions I brought this matter before the House, Deputies on the Government Benches said that it could not be remedied then, as it was in the Act.  We have now a new Bill, and I hope the opportunity will be availed of to remedy this injustice.</P>
    <P>I am proposing to delete the word &ldquo;workman&rdquo; where it occurs in the section and to substitute the word &ldquo;worker&rdquo;, and to delete the word &ldquo;male&rdquo; altogether, in other words, to make the employment portion of the grant applicable to both female and male workers.  In my county, and, apparently in others, because other Deputies have spoken on this matter, there are several women employed in agriculture.  In these days of equal treatment for men and women we should be fair, apart altogether from the question of being fair as between farmer and farmer, as between men and women employees.  Evidently we cannot sufficiently impress the Minister to be fair as between farmer and farmer, but we may be able to appeal to him on the basis of sex&mdash;it is a question of sex-appeal, if you like&mdash;to give equal treatment to men and women who are employed by farmers. There are numerous women workers employed in my county and, I daresay, in other counties, getting the same wage as male workers.  As I say, some farmers are in the position that they cannot participate in this part of the relief which refers to employment, because they employ women.  In dairies, for instance, women are sometimes employed exclusively.  The farmer who employs men, if they are over 17, is given the benefit of this allowance, but if he employs women at the same wage he gets nothing.</P>

      <P>In page 4, to delete Section 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill as drafted did not apply to the Dublin City and County area and on the Second Reading debate Deputy Doyle expressed a desire to have a number of the provisions of the Bill applied to Dublin City and County area but we found on examination of that position that it was not possible to apply certain desirable features of the Bill to Dublin without applying the whole of the Bill as there would be considerable difficulties in relation to drafting.  The position in Dublin City and County at the present time is that the Poor Relief Acts are still in force.  No scheme was ever adopted in pursuance of the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923 for the amalgamation of the poor law unions and the abolition of the workhouses. In Dublin City and County there are three poor law unions at present, Balrothery, Dublin and Rathdown. Each of these unions is administered by a board of assistance elected, in the case of Balrothery and Rathdown, by the county council and, in the case of Dublin, by the county council and corporation.  As I have <Col N="1774" /> said, all the Poor Relief Acts are still in force in Dublin City and County. An additional Act passed in 1929 the Dublin Poor Relief Act, enabled poor law authorities to give outdoor relief to able-bodied persons.  Before that they could only assist such persons in the workhouse.  It is now proposed to apply the full provisions of the Bill to Dublin City and County and amendments are being submitted to the House for that purpose.  The amendments, of course, are all consequential, or would be consequential, on the acceptance by the House of amendment No. 1, deleting Section 2, which excluded Dublin City and County from the operation of the Bill.</P>

The only comment I wish to make is that which I made on the Second Reading of the Bill.  I am sorry that now that he has made a further change, the Minister did not see his way to try and bring all the Local Government Bills before the House in or about the same time. However, I think the list of amendments that he has tabled here will be very acceptable.  I am only speaking on my own behalf.  I think they will provide a very useful piece of machinery for the carrying out of relief administration throughout the country, and especially in Dublin.  I hope at a later stage to ask the Minister to give some consideration to other matters.</P>

      <P>The point is that one portion of this amendment&mdash;I allude to clause (2)&mdash;is continuing the injustice which has been forced on the rural area of Cork for a considerable period. The amendment in the first place is wiping out clause (1) of Section 8, but it is inserting a new clause which perpetuates the injustice.  On the Committee Stage of this Bill I raised this objection, and the Minister said we were a happy family, that there was no objection in Cork to this measure or to this amalgamation.  I have here a copy of this day's <i>Cork Examiner,</i> which shows that all the representatives <Col N="1777" /> of six rural districts in Cork, which comprise the South Cork Board ri = "6"of Health area, unanimously objected and protested to the Minister against the inclusion of this clause in the new Bill.  It is a rather extraordinary thing that Limerick City, which is by far a smaller city than Cork, has a separate assistance area.  We have the extraordinary position of Limerick City being a separate entity for home assistance purposes and Limerick County being another entity, and, on the other hand, Cork City and a portion of the rural area of Cork bound up together.  We have the unfortunate position in Cork that the rural population, for whom all Parties in this Dáil seem to have a great amount of sympathy, lip sympathy, at any rate, subscribe eightpence out of every shilling of the cost of home assistance in the area.  When the division of the shilling comes about, eightpence of that shilling is spent in Cork City and four-pence goes back to the rural areas. The Parliamentary Secretary and the Minister are not in ignorance of this matter.  For 20 years there have been protests to the Minister from all sides.</P>

      <P>I hope that the Minister will not take the statement made by <Col N="1778" /> Deputy Corry very seriously, because a very large percentage of Deputy Corry's constituents are within the area and come under the Corporation housing scheme.  The Minister himself was in Cork last week, and was really alarmed at the extent to which the city is expanding into the country.  I am afraid that Deputy Corry could say a good deal more about the way the county council is favoured by getting the rates from these houses.  Over 1,600 houses of the Corporation housing scheme are within the county council area, and the occupants are Deputy Corry's constituents.  I am surprised to hear Deputy Corry make the case that that district should not be included. We are not claiming it; I personally will not interpret the Bill in that manner.  One might say that each area should pay its own home assistance, and I think Deputy Corry would agree.  One of the greatest revenue districts is within the suburbs of Cork City, and that is the reason why the Bill is framed as it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 10, line 50, at the end of Section 18 to add the following words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;save that in the County of Dublin and in the County Borough of Dublin, the provisions of Section 2 of the Poor Relief (Dublin) Act, 1929 shall remain in force and no person to whom that section applies shall be granted Home Assistance unless such person, at the time when he is so relieved, has been resident for a continuous period of not less than two years either in the County of Dublin or in the County Borough of Dublin or in the said county and county borough.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1782" /> The Parliamentary Secretary is aware that Section 2 of the Poor Relief (Dublin) Act, 1929, provides for the granting of relief to destitute poor persons, who before its passing, might be relieved only by the county home and that the grants of home assistance to able-bodied persons in the Dublin area who are relieved on account of want of work are made pursuant to its powers.  I would draw his attention to the fact that it enacts that no person shall be granted home assistance unless at the time when he is so relieved he has been resident for a continuous period of not less than two years in either or both of the county or county borough of Dublin.  I feel that the omission of this safeguard will be availed of by all and sundry who have any desire to come to Dublin from the country and to bring their dependents here, and, in the case of unemployment, to be placed on the rates in the city.</P>
    <P>I also point out that there is every possibility that the unemployment list in Dublin will be considerably augmented if this safeguard is omitted. The Government's policy is to endeavour to keep people on the land, and I feel that if the Parliamentary Secretary examines the position as we know it in Dublin&mdash;and I presume the same might apply to Cork, and it might be a matter for Deputy Corry to argue that the section ought equally to apply there, or, in fact, to any of the cities, because there is a tendency for people to fly from the country into the cities &mdash;he would agree that some provision should be made to protect the ratepayers of the city.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will see his way to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to oppose this amendment.  I think it is a case of parochialism gone mad.  After all, if there is any pretence to any conception of Christian responsibility and Christian standards of conduct, surely we do not contemplate a situation whereby a person may come from any provincial centre&mdash;Cork, Donegal, Mayo or anywhere else&mdash;obtain employment for three, six or twelve months, then unfortunately lose that <Col N="1783" /> employment and find himself in such a position that he is unable to go back whence he came.  Such a person may not even have a home to go to there. What is a person like that, who has lost his employment, to do?  Deputy Doyle's remedy is to deport him back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>And pay his fare back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deport him back and get rid of him in Dublin.  Dublin people are not to behave as Christians. No person deliberately gets into a state of need.  Nobody deliberately gets into a state of economic distress, and nobody deliberately invites a state of destitution and hunger to himself. I say if persons living in Dublin are in need of assistance, whether they come from Kildare, Donegal or anywhere else, they ought to be relieved by the public authority charged with the function of relieving distress.  Deputy Doyle says, &ldquo;Put them out of Dublin.&rdquo;&ldquo;Put any person who is likely to be a charge on the rates out of Dublin.&rdquo; Now, suppose every other county did the same, what is the position?  You have got the very worst form of parochialism, and got it at a time when it is most undesirable to get into any such state of thinking.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary will set his face against this amendment, and that he will insist that the people who are in need will be relieved by the statutory authority in Dublin, whose function it is to relieve them, and that every other local authority must do the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider this a most amazing amendment.  I am surprised at this amendment of Deputy Doyle's, the more so when we consider that in the first instance there has been disbursed in Dublin 90 per cent. of the salaries that are paid in this State. All the civil servants who are living in and around Dublin are being paid their salaries here.  They spend their money here.  The wealth of the entire country pours into Dublin.  Now, if an unfortunate fellow from the country happens to come into Dublin for a day's work and does not get it, what is to happen to him?  Deputy Doyle would deport him back or send him to the workhouse. <Col N="1784" /> The Deputy does not want anybody here but a member of the family. I cannot understand the mentality of the Deputy who produced that amendment. Surely this is Dublinitis gone mad.  God knows we have enough Dublinitis around the country without bringing this into it.  It is an extraordinary position that first of all the Deputy wants all the wealth of the country to concentrate in Dublin.  All the salaries paid by the State, or nearly all of them, are paid to individuals living in Dublin and all of that money is spent in Dublin.  Then the unfortunate country boy who has no salary comes along to Dublin looking for work and cannot get it.  At the end of the first week Deputy Doyle would deport him home.  I suggest that the Deputy is not serious.  I cannot believe he is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very fully considered this amendment standing in the name of Deputy Doyle, and I hope he will not be unduly disappointed when I tell him I cannot see my way to accept it.  Apart from the arguments that have been advanced against the amendment by the two Deputies who have taken part in the debate, there are some other snags in relation to it, of which perhaps Deputy Doyle himself is aware.  I do not think that the amendment is fully understood by some Deputies who have contributed to the discussion.  The amendment does not propose that people who come into the Dublin area from outside and who are in need of assistance shall be debarred from all forms of public assistance but that they shall be debarred from home assistance.  It would be open to the local authorities, as it is open to the public authority at the present time, to afford them institutional assistance or medical assistance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish Deputies would not interrupt me when I am trying to explain the position.  I hope to make <Col N="1785" /> my position reasonably clear.  I do not think Deputy Doyle will find himself in full agreement with me in this.  I do hold very strongly that in the case of young people or in the case of able-bodied people looking for work that the workhouse is not a suitable or a proper place in which to afford them assistance.  If the Dublin Board of Assistance do not think well to return these people to the area from which they came, I think, taking the long view, that much better results would be obtained by affording them home assistance.  There is a point of view that can be advanced from the other side, too.  Deputy Doyle must have feelings of uneasiness lest there should be a wholesale influx of people from rural areas into Dublin, attracted by the generous scale of public assistance afforded by the Dublin Board of Assistance.  I do not think that is likely to occur.  If people come to Dublin seeking employment they will probably be able-bodied persons entitled to unemployment assistance. Not many of them will be attracted by the possibility of getting public assistance from the public authority here. At any rate, under Section 18 of the Bill, the Dublin Public Assistance authority will have full discretion in the matter.  &ldquo;It shall be the duty of every public assistance authority to give, in accordance with this Act, to every person in their public assistance district who is eligible for public assistance, such public assistance as shall appear to them to be necessary or proper in each particular case and to make, in accordance with this Act, due provision for that purpose.&rdquo;  Now, it will be open to the public assistance authority in Dublin to refuse to give them home assistance if they think that that is a proper thing to do.  At any rate, they have full discretion.  I do not think the Minister or the House should be asked to put a statutory barrier in the way of the public assistance authority in Dublin and to say: &ldquo;In no circumstance must you give home assistance to any person who has not been resident for a continuous period of not less than two years in the County of Dublin or the county borough of Dublin.&rdquo;  I would like to point out to Deputy Doyle that very <Col N="1786" /> serious hardship might be inflicted on even the ordinary residents of Dublin under his amendment.</P>
      <P>If there is any interruption whatever to this two years' period of continuance residence a hardship might be inflicted on a Dublin resident looking for home assistance.  A Dublin resident might go to some other area in quest of employment.  He may not succeed in getting employment or he may succeed in getting employment for a few months.  If the amendment were accepted by the House, the Dublin Board of Assistance would have no option but to put these people into the workhouse after they had come back and applied for home assistance. These people could not be afforded home assistance in their own homes.  I think that would be an undesirable thing.  Under the Bill, as it stands, the Dublin Board of Assistance have full discretion.  If they think it a wise and a good policy not to afford home assistance to certain classes of people the decision rests with them.  But, having fully considered the matter, I feel that I cannot accept the amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  In the original section the Minister was empowered to specify officers who were to have power to give assistance in cases of urgent necessity.  The word &ldquo;officers&rdquo; is now changed to &ldquo;persons&rdquo; for the reason that in practice it may be found that this power to give assistance in urgent cases should not be limited to officers.  In cases of urgent necessity it may be desirable to empower other persons to give assistance. For example, we had a discussion the last day on the question of appointing wardens for the purpose of issuing relief tickets.  Now, wardens could not be &ldquo;officers&rdquo; but they would be other &ldquo;persons&rdquo; concerned in the administration of relief.  The Deputy need not have any fear that the powers and functions of statutory officers existing at the present time will be interfered with.</P>

      <P>This amendment proposes to substitute two sub-sections for sub-section (2) of the original Bill to make it clear that the public assistance authority may, if they think proper, bring home for burial the body of any person eligible for assistance who has died outside their district.  This is merely bringing out, in more detail, what we had intended to bring out on Committee Stage.

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I have very fully considered the position as I think Deputy Hughes knows.  I find that it is not possible to introduce an amendment that will cover the position that the Deputy has in mind.  There are two classes of persons that Deputy Hughes and many other members of the House were concerned about: the person who <Col N="1789" /> is injured in an accident in a public roadway, and, as a consequence, receives treatment in a hospital under the control of a public assistance authority.  I would like to draw the attention of Deputies who are interested in this matter to Section 174 of the Road Traffic Act, 1933. Under that section, if a person receives hospital treatment for injuries sustained by him by reason of the negligent driving of a mechanically propelled vehicle the governing body of the hospital can recover repayment from the person liable up to a maximum of £35 in respect of treatment, and also a reasonable sum not exceeding £15, in respect of special treatment such as massage or electrical treatment.  That deals with one class of accident case where a local authority may maintain a poor person for a long period in hospital, and perhaps has not fully availed of the possibilities of that section in the past.</P>
      <P>The other class of case could only be dealt with by amendment of the Workmen's Compensation Act.  As Deputies will appreciate, we cannot amend the Workmen's Compensation Act in a Public Assistance Bill. Therefore, I have not been able to do anything to meet the type of case that Deputies have in mind, because it would mean materially amending the Workmen's Compensation Act.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 17, before Section 35, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a district institution provided by a public assistance authority is available for the assistance of a particular class of persons, or provision has been made by a public assistance authority with the consent of the Minister for the assistance of a particular class of persons in a home, hospital or other institution not provided or maintained by such authority, the Minister may, by Order, direct that such particular class of persons shall not be assisted by such public assistance authority <Col N="1791" /> in any institution except (as the case may be) such district institution or such home, hospital or other institution, and thereupon it shall not be lawful for such public assistance authority to assist (except in cases of urgent necessity) any person of such particular class in contravention of such Order.</P>
    <P>This amendment is brought forward in consequence of discussions on Committee Stage.  The effect of the amendment is that where a special institution is available for a particular class of persons and the Minister directs that such class of persons shall not be assisted by a public assistance authority in an institution other than such special institution, it shall not be lawful for the public assistance authority, except in cases of urgent necessity, to assist any person in contravention of such direction.  We had a good deal of discussion on the principle involved in this on the Committee Stage.  The amendment makes this change in the position as contained in the original draft of the Bill: that if such institutions are provided for particular classes of persons, the public assistance authority cannot assist such persons in any other institution.  The bar to affording them home assistance, for example, is removed.  I think that completely meets the Deputy's point.</P>

We have, as you know, an organisation in the country boarding out children without the knowledge and consent of the public assistance board, and giving a certain sum of money for maintenance over a period of four years.  This has became a very serious problem for the public assistance board, particularly the one <Col N="1793" /> of which I am a member, because a number of those children have come to the board for assistance.  We have sometimes been compelled to give assistance, but they are not covered by those Acts.  The boarded out children under the public assistance board cost the board something like £15 a year.  In the case of children in industrial schools they get a grant from the State, and we feel that that should apply also to the public assistance board.  We feel that in the case of boarded out children in the board of assistance areas there should be the same concession.</P>

      <P>10.  Every board of public assistance shall hold meetings for the transaction of their business at least once in each month and at such other times as may be necessary for properly exercising their powers and performing their duties.</P>
      <P>11.  The first meeting of a board of public assistance shall be held after the election of members of such board has been completed on a day to be appointed by the Minister, and shall be an annual meeting.</P>
      <P>12.  Every board of public assistance shall, at its first meeting appoint a day of the year not earlier than the 17th day of July nor later than the 1st day of August for the holding of subsequent annual meetings, and may at any subsequent annual meeting alter the day so appointed.</P>
      <P>13.  Every board of public assistance shall hold an annual meeting in each year, and such meeting shall be held on the day which is for the time being appointed for the holding of such meetings under these rules, unless such day shall be a Sunday or bank holiday, when such meeting shall be held on the next following day which is neither a Sunday nor a bank holiday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>14.  If the first or any other annual meeting of a board of public assistance is for any reason (including a quorum not being present) not held on the day appointed for the holding of such meeting under these rules, <Col N="1797" /> the secretary of the board shall as soon as may be summon a meeting of the board for a convenient hour on the day which appears to him to be the earliest convenient date for the purpose, and the meeting held in pursuance of such summons shall be for all purposes an annual meeting held on the date appointed under these rules.</P>
    <P>This amendment was indicated on the Committee Stage.  The original draft provided a fixed date for the annual meeting of boards of public assistance.

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The object of the Bill is to provide, under certain special circumstances, a special compensation allowance to the person who held the office of Clerk of the former Seanad Eireann prior to its abolition by the Constitution (Amendment No. 24) Act, 1936.  The person appointed to that post took it up under very special circumstances. The post was not one which might be described as being in the ordinary Civil Service, but its holder at the date of his appointment happened to be a transferred officer. He was pressed to take up this post, and only did so on the understanding that his Article 10 rights would be fully secured to him, and an undertaking to that effect was given by the head of the Government of the day with, I understand, the full sanction and approval of the Government of the day.  When this particular post came to be abolished it was discovered that, because the appointment to the post had not been in the ordinary course of promotion in the Service, the officer would not be entitled to Article 10 rights, notwithstanding the very specific undertaking which had been given by the then President of the Executive Council, now Deputy Cosgrave.  Deputy Cosgrave pointed out that public faith was fully pledged in this matter; the present Government is fully satisfied that that pledge was given, and it only remains now, in view of the defect in the Act of 1929, to bring in this special measure to honour that pledge and undertaking.</P>
