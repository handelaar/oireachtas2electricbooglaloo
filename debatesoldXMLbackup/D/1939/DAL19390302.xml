      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that Deputy Hickey's question asks for the number of persons indicted under each of the sections of the Treasonable Offences Act, 1925, and that treason is covered in that Act, I would like if the Minister would say how it is a separate question.  Is that information going to be supplied to Deputy Hickey?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am supplying a tabular statement and perhaps the Deputy will be good enough to wait until he sees it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is only asked to indicate the number of persons charged under each of the sections of the Treasonable Offences Act.  Will he say now, seeing that the information is to be published in tabular form, how many, if any, persons have been charged with the offence of treason proper?</P>

      <P>At the request of a Minister the Chair may decide that, if a reply is a lengthy one, it should be published in the Journal of Debates.  If it is so decided, Deputies may not endeavour to elicit particulars in a supplementary question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say whether the Chair, having seen the reply, has given consent to its publication in tabular form, but I submit that where a question is directed to the Minister asking him to indicate specifically the number of persons indicted under the various sections of the Treasonable Offences Act, and when a relevant supplementary question is put, asking how many persons have, in fact, been charged under the section of that Act which makes it possible for such persons to be indicted for treason, that supplementary question ought not to be regarded as a separate question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order.  May I submit that one of the most valuable constitutional privileges we have is that of Parliamentary Question and, if it is necessary to elicit the information which a Deputy requires, he is surely entitled to ask the Minister to read out his answer so that occasion may be taken to put a supplementary question or raise the matter on the adjournment, if the Deputy thinks it is of sufficient gravity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I submit further, in view of the fact that we are discussing a Treason Bill to-day, that it is a particularly relevant question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That point does give the supplementary question some basis of reason.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only give the total in each year of the prosecutions that have taken place and the number of persons who have been indicted under the Treasonable Offences Act. I have segregated them into particular sections.  If the Deputy wants to have the information supplied in another form, I shall try to get it for him, but the question as presented to me was the number of persons indicted and the number of persons prosecuted under the Treasonable Offences Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware (a) that the Prices Commission in their recent report on bacon have reported that combination for interference with trade competition in the bacon industry does exist and, as proof of such combination, have instanced the fixing of minimum prices for bacon by the Bacon Marketing Board between January, 1936, and March, 1938, and (b) that a bacon curer has publicly alleged that one of the chief causes of the high prices of bacon in Ireland during 1934-37 was the encouragement given to the Bacon Board by his Department to fix minimum prices of bacon; if he will state whether there is any truth in this allegation; and, if so, under what statutory authority such encouragement was given, and whether it was in secrecy and without the cognisance of Dáil Eireann; and whether at any time since the passing of the Pigs and Bacon Acts he had become aware that the machinery established by these Acts had been diverted from its intended purpose and was being utilised by the curer members of the boards to promote the interests of the curers and to secure excessive profits for themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The rule to which the Deputy refers applies to all women teachers, lay or religious, who are serving in a pensionable capacity under the National Teachers' Superannuation Scheme, 1934.  It accordingly applies to members of religious communities who are paid personal salaries out of State funds in classification convent national schools.  It does not apply to a nun who is serving in a convent national school paid on a capitation basis as she is not paid a personal salary and her service is not pensionable.  Each such case is considered on its merits.</P>

      <P>The position is as I explained on the Committee Stage. Loans will be available for persons undertaking building operations in the same manner as they will be available for any other manufacturer undertaking the production of some other class of commodity.  Under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, we shall not <Col N="1273" /> be concerned with, and shall have no power to grant, loans for the purpose of financing house-purchasing.  That is a different problem altogether.  So far as house-building is concerned, for considerations of policy I would not be disposed to consider any application which did not involve a fairly substantial number of houses, or, in other words, that did not arise in connection with large-scale development.</P>

      <P>It is very hard to discuss this question on the Fifth Stage of a Bill which, if it be passed, means nothing, but I think this is a suitable occasion for asking the Minister whether he has given any consideration to the matters that were brought before either himself or the Minister for Industry and Commerce when we were dealing with the Second Stage of the Bill.  Is it the intention of the Government to set up any body for the purpose of examining the future five years of possible industrial development in this country and outside?  What are the main industries that have to be taken definitely into consideration in a five <Col N="1274" /> years' development of industry, with a view to concentrating all the attention that is necessary on safeguarding development in that particular direction instead of having some of the most essential phases of our industrial development neglected through attention and interest being scattered over a very wide field, involving a very considerable amount of experiment and of trial, error and loss.  When dealing with the matter before, we pointed out that neither the Department of Industry and Commerce nor the Prices Commission&mdash;the only two bodies left now&mdash;could, as a result of their experience or general attitude during the last six years, be expected to sit down to a systematic and concentrated review of the position.  We pointed out that it would be found here, as it was found in Australia, that no systematic trading relations with Great Britain which would be in any way harmonious or which would safeguard our interests could be ensured unless there was concentrated thought immediately on the main, solid, sound lines of industrial development which we want to see carried on here.</P>

      <P>For the guidance of private enterprise, if you like.  I do not think you will have any sound industrial development if it is to be carried on here by boards hand-picked by the Executive Council or hand-picked from outside or inside the Civil Service. What we do want is some sort of group or body or commission that will outline for the people, as a whole, the lines upon which the concentrated part of our industrial development might be expected to follow within the next five years, so that all the widespread energies and intelligence of our people, being invited to travel along these lines, we may have these energies concentrated. If I understand the Deputy to be against private development, then I should like to tell him that industrial development by means of direct Government action is sweeping aside any chance of the ordinary people bringing their energy into play.  No Government action can make up for <Col N="1275" /> setting aside the energy of the individuals that comprise the people so far as the proper lines of industrial effort are concerned.</P>

      <P>I had nothing further in mind than to ascertain what the Deputy's idea was.  I do not understand what the Deputy means by &ldquo;concentrating the energies of the people on certain industrial lines.&rdquo; That is not the way industry arose in any country.  Did it not arise by the people concerned with a particular line of development concentrating upon it and endeavouring to express their ideas in action?  Surely, it would be a waste of time to ask the farmers, for instance, to consider what the lines of industrial development should be and to concentrate&mdash;to use the Deputy's word&mdash;on these lines.  What does concentration of the people's energies mean?  To me, it conveys nothing.  The Deputy has not sufficiently explained what is in his mind.  If he wants a board to direct private enterprise, that, again, seems contradictory of a number of things said by members of his own Party in this House&mdash;that private enterprise is well able to look after itself and that a Government body is not the best organisation to direct private enterprise as to the investment of its capital or anything of that nature.  I am afraid the Deputy has left us all very vague as to what is in his mind.</P>

With that unerring gift of his, he has placed the tip of his finger on the kernel of this problem, but he has not touched it with any other part of his body.  Surely, he says, you would not provide facilities for the farmers to express their views on the lines of industrial development.  That is the kernel of the whole problem. This Bill operates to abolish the Tariff Commission.  When this commission goes, there will be nothing left&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Tariff Commission was in operation, the procedure was that an industrialist applied to the Government for a tariff.  The Minister put on an anti-dumping tariff at once and announced that he was referring the matter to the Tariff Commission. The Tariff Commission published a notice that they were going to consider the desirability of imposing a permanent tariff on the commodity referred to and that all interested parties could come before the commission and make their case.  If you were about to put a tariff on galvanised buckets, nobody might think that that would affect the people down the country but, when the notice appeared in the paper, a farmers' organisation could intimate that they had a word to say in the matter and that they wanted to be heard so that they might explain to the Tariff Commission that while a tariff on buckets might promote their manufacture, that tariff would increase the farmers' cost of production and that, while you might put people into employment making buckets in Dublin, you might put more people out of employment down the country.  The Tariff Commission would weigh those considerations and, having weighed them, they would set them out <i>in extenso</i> and give the Government their view of the relative merits of the various representations made to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We, on these benches, apprehend that, with the abolition of the Tariff Commission, we are going to have no review of a forward-looking kind. Anybody who goes and asks for a tariff representing that the industry he is going to start will employ 25 or 30 men is liable to get the tariff without affording the person who is going to be hit by that tariff an opportunity to make any representations at all.  We all know that the home market is not sufficient to accommodate a potentially great industry.  If we want to build up really solid, growing industries, we have got to get industries which will supply the home market but which will <Col N="1277" /> also strike out into the export market and extend.  If you are going to raise the costs of the raw materials for an established industry, you can still keep the home market by raising the tariff on the finished article further, but you absolutely cut that industry out of the foreign market because, as you raise the cost of materials, so you raise the cost of the finished product, and the Irish-finished product ceases to be competitive in the markets of the world. That is of vital importance to all our industries.  There are many industries &mdash;splendid industries&mdash;run by enterprising men which would get admirable markets abroad and add to the national wealth by their exports, which are being prevented from doing that because tariffs have been put on their raw materials to such an extent that the cost of the finished product has been raised above the possible export price.</P>

      <P>While that is true of industry, it is peculiarly true of agriculture. Fifty per cent. of the tariffs have operated to raise the cost of production of agricultural produce to our farmers who could not raise their price.  The result has been to impoverish them and drive them out of production.  Let us consider what happened under the old Administration. When application was made for a tariff on boots&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to a case which was actually brought before the Tariff Commission which we are going to abolish.  When a tariff on boots was asked for the Tariff Commission advised the Government of the kind of tariff which would protect the industry, but they also advised the Government of the measure of the burden which it would impose on the rural community.  Acting on that advice, the Government of that day put a tariff on boots; estimated what <Col N="1278" /> that tariff would yield both in Customs and Excise and in increased cost of boots to the rural community, and sought to remit in the indirect taxation which was being levied on the rural community a sum equal to the extra cost of the boots and shoes protected by the tariff.  What was the result?  I know, because I was dealing with boots and shoes at the time. The tariff on boots and shoes represented no burden on the people at all, and we built up in this country a farmer's heavy boot industry which in 1931 was producing a farmer's boot superior to the British farmer's boot. If the tariff had been dropped in 1931 any intelligent boot factor in this country would have gone on buying the heavy boot in Ireland even though he could buy the heavy boot from England without paying any tariff at all. That was largely due to the prudent advice offered by the Tariff Commission. Nobody in this country felt under a grievance on account of the tariff, and the Government could not have got that information&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This much is true, that we have had acrimonious debates in this House on tariffs which have been <Col N="1279" /> proposed.  You have had men on one side of the House feeling deeply that the tariff ought to go on, and men on the other side feeling just as deeply that the tariff was going to do infinitely more harm than good.  I think the Deputy will admit that. Those debates could not have arisen so long as you had the evidence which the Tariff Commission accumulated to present to the House, and there was goodwill on all sides in regard to the industrial advance which was being made.  Now, an industrial advance is being made along lines which, in the opinion of many of us, are doing greater harm than good.  It would be a great help to us to know that if the Minister proposes to abolish this Tariff Commission some other body will be provided to discharge those functions in the future. Does the Minister intend to provide such a body?  If he does not he is doing good industry in this country very material injury, and he is doing them that injury for the benefit of bad industry.  I want to see, and everybody else here wants to see, good industry thrive and prosper.  I do not want to see them confounded or confused with the bad industry, the fly-by-nights, who are trying to rob our people.  The Tariff Commission was the best instrument for separating the sheep from the goats, for showing up the fraudulent tariff-monger, and showing up the honest industrialist who wanted to give the community value for its money.  I deplore the passing of an instrument which operated to that end.  We all ought to be proud of the good industrialist, and we ought to chase the fly-by-night out of the country.  The Tariff Commission was the machinery by which you could segregate those two categories of persons.  In the absence of that commission they are being confused. The good man is being tarred with the same brush as the bad man, because there is no proper machinery for distinguishing between them.  I want a machine which will distinguish between the good industrialist, who is a public benefactor and a national asset, and the fly-by-night, who is a <Col N="1280" /> public menace, public enemy No. 1 in this country.  I want to be able to chase the fly-by-night with all my resources, and encourage and help the decent industrialist with equal enthusiasm. Unless we have something to take the place of the Tariff Commission we cannot effectively distinguish between them.  I want to do that.</P>

      <P>The debate to which we have just listened would be very interesting to a student of folklore, because he would have seen how folklore was created upon a basis of sheer fanciful, exuberant imagination.  Deputy Mulcahy has endeavoured to leave the House under the impression that this Tariff Commission had very wide powers, powers in fact to lay down a plan of campaign for the whole industrial population of this country.  It had nothing of the sort, and Deputy Mulcahy knows that as well as I do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>This Tariff Commission had very limited powers.  As I said on the occasion upon which I was moving the Second Reading of this Bill, I think the real purpose of the Tariff Commission was to fight a rearguard action on the part of the hide-bound free-traders who then constituted the Executive Council in this country. During the whole period of its existence it considered thirteen applications, including such intricate questions as a tariff on down quilts, rosary beads, and fish barrels, and I think its recommendations in regard to tariffs upon certain of the other things were extremely limited and of little value.  Not merely is Deputy Mulcahy an artificer of folklore, but Deputy Dillon far excels him. We have heard from the Deputy a very eloquent speech about the magnificient work which the Tariff Commission did in regard to the proposal to put a tariff on boots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The application for a tariff on boots was never referred to the Tariff Commission. <Col N="1281" /> That tariff was, in fact, introduced and made part of the fiscal code of this country two years before the Tariff Commission was set up.  That is the sort of argument, based upon figments of the imagination, that this Government and the country are expected to treat seriously.  There was no reference whatever to the Tariff Commission of a proposal to put a tariff on boots.  What was referred to the Tariff Commission were applications for tariffs on margarine, flour, rosaries, down quilts, fish barrels, woollen and worsted tissues, vehicles and vehicle bodies, cement, glass bottles, packing and matting paper, cardboard, sole leather used in the manufacture of harness, a modification of the existing tariff on woollen and worsted tissues, paper, linen piece-goods and made-up household goods made of linen.  The case that Deputy Dillon made for the maintenance of a body of this sort in existence, on the basis of good work done with regard to the boot industry, completely vanishes.  It might as well be part of the mid-winter snow of the present year.  It has melted away, the same as the whole of the arguments for the retention of this useless body vanish, once we begin to examine them in the light of the true facts.</P>
    <P>I am perfectly satisfied that the <Col N="1282" /> Department of Industry and Commerce keep under continuous review the need for proper industrial planning in this country and the manner in which industries have been started, not all of which have been successful.  No one is going to contend that every effort of any body of human beings is going to end in full success, but the manner in which industry after industry has been started during the past five or six years, each one fitting into the other like mosaic, must have convinced the people, and would convince the Opposition, if they were open to conviction, that there has been a proper planning for industry.  It does not suit the Opposition to say so.  That a Bill like this, designed to abolish a body for which there is no use in the present scheme of things, a body which has done no work for the past two or three years, and which is costing the ratepayers and the overburdened farmers, about which we heard so much last night and at the election, £3,000 or £4,000 to keep up&mdash;that such a Bill, designed to secure useful economy without injuring any interest, should be opposed, as I understand the Opposition are prepared to oppose it, and to press it to a division, beats my sense of reason or fair play.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Deputies have already received a short explanatory memorandum showing the scheme of the Bill. I do not propose, on the Second Reading of the Bill, and certainly not in the opening statement, which is a short statement, to go into details which perhaps more properly might arise on the Committee Stage.  I will just refer to the principle of the Bill.  I should say, I think, at the outset, that the sole object of this Bill is the prevention of the display, the use, or the advocacy of force as a method to achieve political or social aims.  I am sure that the House realises the necessity for such a measure and that it will get very wide support in this House.  As Deputies are aware, when the new Constitution was enacted the Government here found itself without certain powers&mdash;I refer to legislative powers&mdash;which it previously had to exercise and which it had found necessary for the prevention of disorders and the preservation of peace.  We had in mind that the position might arise where we might require somewhat similar powers.  This was visualised in the Constitution that was enacted, and Article 38 of the Constitution, as Deputies are aware, provided for the setting up of special courts.  I will refer to that again.  I do not want to take this out of its context at the moment.  I only refer to it because it was enacted in the Constitution at that time.</P>

      <P>I only refer to this particular part of this Bill because Article 38 of the Constitution visualised the position where it might be necessary to bring in legislation to deal with a certain situation.  Immediately after the Constitution was passed we recognised the importance of a Bill of this sort.  We had it at that time under consideration and we have had it under consideration since. There could be two points of view with regard to whether a measure such as this should be introduced at that time or during the intervening period. There was the point of view that perhaps it would be better to introduce a measure such as this when there is absolute calm and quiet in the country, so that it might be discussed in this House calmly, and calmly con- <Col N="1285" /> sidered, rather than wait for some incident that might be cited as a justification for such a Bill.  There was also the point of view that we should wait until the necessity for it arose.  The introduction of this Bill at this time is what I would call a compromise between those two points of view.  It is true that there has been comparative quiet in the country over a period but now there are sufficient indications to the responsible Government that that peaceable condition is not going to continue unless the Government steps in and takes the necessary steps to preserve that position.</P>
      <P>I referred here the last day to certain documents that were issued, termed proclamations, and while I know that most Deputies are conversant with the terms of these documents, I have to weary the House to the extent of reading them in order to put them on the records of the House.  I will comment on them afterwards.  The first document was published in a paper known as the <i>Wolfe Tone Weekly</i>, dated Saturday, December 17th, 1938, and it is headed &ldquo;I.R.A.  Take Over the Government of the Republic.&rdquo;  It goes on to say&mdash; I am quoting from the newspaper:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;One of the most memorable events of our time took place on December 8, the anniversary of the Four Martyrs, when the Government of the Republic of Ireland was taken over from the Executive Council of Dáil Eireann by the Council of the Irish Republican Army.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Then there is the proclamation, a translation of which reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann: In consequence of armed opposition ordered and sustained by England, and the defection of elected representatives of the people over the periods since the Republican Proclamation of Easter, 1916, was ratified, three years later, by the newly inaugurated Government of the Irish Republic, we hereby delegate the authority reposed in us to the Army Council, in the spirit of the decision taken by Dáil Éireann in the Spring of 1921, and later endorsed by the Second Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1286" />&ldquo;In thus transferring the trust of which it has been our privilege to be the custodians for 20 years, we earnestly exhort all citizens and friends of the Irish Republic at home and abroad to dissociate themselves openly and absolutely from England's unending aggressions; and we urge on them utterly to disregard England's recurring war scares, remembering that our ancient and insular nation, bounded entirely by the seas, has infinitely less reason to become involved in the conflicts now so much threatened than have the neutral small nations lying between England and the Power she desires to overthrow.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Confident, in delegating this sacred trust to the Army of the Republic that, in their every action towards its consummation, they will be inspired by the high ideals and the chivalry of our martyred comrades, we, as Executive Council of Dáil Éireann, Government of the Republic, append our names: Seán Ua Ceallaigh, Ceann Comhairle; Seoirse Noble Cont Ua Pluingcéid, Brian O hUiginn, Cathal Ó Murchadha, Máire Nic Shuibhne, Uilliam F.P. Stoclaigh, Tomás MacGuidhir.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was published on 17th December, and, on the 15th and 16th January, this year, another proclamation was issued.  It was posted up outside the Churches and other public places throughout the country on 15th and 16th January, 1939, and was in the following terms:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the twenty-third day of April in the year 1916 in the City of Dublin, seven men, who were representative in spirit and outlook and purpose of the Irish Nation that had never yielded to nor accepted the British conquest, set their humble and almost unknown names to the foregoing document that has passed into history, making the names of the seven signatories immortal.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These signatures were sealed with the blood of the immortal seven, and of many others who followed them into one of the most <Col N="1287" /> gallant fights in the history of the world; and the Irish Nation rose from shame to honour, from humiliation to pride, from slavery to freedom.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Three years later (on January 21st, 1919), the Republic proclaimed in Easter Week, 1916, was ratified and formally established by the elected representatives of all Ireland and a solemn declaration of independence sent out to the nations of the world.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;To combat that declaration and to prevent the proclamation of the Republic of Ireland from becoming effective, the armed forces of the English enemy made war upon the Irish people.  They were met by the Irish Republican Army and challenged and resisted so stubbornly that after two years of bloody warfare the English were forced to ask for a truce with a view to settlement by negotiation.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Unfortunately, because men were foolish enough to treat with an armed enemy within their gates, the English won the peace.  Weakness and treachery caused a resumption of the war and the old English tactics of `divide and conquer' were exploited to the fullest extent. Partition was introduced, the country divided into two parts with two separate Parliaments subject to and controlled by the British Government. The armed forces of England still occupy six of our counties in the North and reserve the right `in time of war or strained relations' to reoccupy the ports which they have just evacuated in the southern part of Ireland.  Ireland is still tied, as she has been for centuries past, to take part in England's wars.  In the Six Counties, a large number of Republican soldiers are held prisoners by England.  Further weakness on the part of some of our people, broken faith and make-believe, have postponed the enthronement of the living Republic, but the proclamation of Easter Week and the declaration of independence stand and must stand for ever.  No man, <Col N="1288" /> no matter how far he has fallen away from his national faith, has dared to repudiate them.  They constitute the rallying centre for the unbought manhood of Ireland in the fight that must be made to make them effective and to redeem the nation's self-respect that was abandoned by a section of our people in 1923.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The time has come to make that fight.  There is no need to redeclare the Republic of Ireland, now or in the future.  There is no need to reaffirm the declaration of Irish independence. But the hour has come for the supreme effort to make both effective.  So in the name of the unconquered dead and the faithful living, we pledge ourselves to that task.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We call upon England to withdraw her armed forces, her civilian officials and institutions, and representatives of all kinds from every part of Ireland as an essential preliminary to arrangements for peace and friendship between the two countries; and we call upon the people of all Ireland, at home and in exile, to assist us in the effort we, are about to make, in God's name, to compel that evacuation and to enthrone the Republic of Ireland.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Signed on behalf of the Republican Government and the Army Council of Oglaigh na hEireann (Irish Republican Army):&mdash;</P>
    <P>Stephen Hayes, Patrick Fleming, Peadar O'Flaherty, George Plunkett, Lawrence Grogan, Seán Russell.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When I referred to those proclamations on the previous day I gathered that Deputy Norton's view was that these things are not to be taken seriously, but anybody who knows the position in this country has got to take them seriously.  Here was a group, or a body, who maintained that they were the Government, and the only legitimate Government, of this country. They come to a time when they hand over, or assume to hand over, whatever powers they claimed previously to possess, to delegate those powers, as it were to an armed body.  Now <Col N="1289" /> we know that that armed body exists. It may not be a very large group, or a very large body, but there does exist in this country an organisation which has arms and war material at its disposal.  It has been training and organising, and it has been receiving funds from outside sources for the explicit and sole purpose of using that position militarily.</P>
    <P>We had a position on 28th November last in which three well-known members of that army, as it calls itself, were killed in Donegal in an explosion. We also know&mdash;it is common property&mdash;that explosives were put on buses in the area within the effective jurisdiction of this State.  With our knowledge of that position, this Government, I feel, would be wanting in its duty if it were to allow that position to continue.  It is all very well to treat proclamations and documents of that kind lightly when one is satisfied that there is not the will, or the force, or the power behind it to do anything about which the Government, as custodians of the people's interests and the people's rights, need worry, but it has gone further than that.  This body has assumed the right apparently to declare war.  That is a right which is not vested, under the Constitution, even in this Government. It is a right which is vested in this House, and in this House solely. I do not think that anybody here desires to go to war with anybody. This House has not declared war on any other people or State, nor, as I say, does any individual Deputy, I am sure, desire to make war on any body of individuals or any other State. There was a Constitution enacted in this country.  It was enacted by the Irish people and it is a Constitution which defines and secures the liberties of the citizens of the country.  It provides for freedom of opinion, freedom of speech and freedom of meeting. It placed this part of the country, at any rate, in a position of absolute freedom.  Since that Constitution was enacted by the people there has been an election, and everybody was perfectly free to go up, without any barrier or tie, and without any let or hindrance, to contest that election. <Col N="1290" /> No matter how foolish his policy might be, or no matter how wild his policy might be, if a person could get a majority of the electorate of this country to endorse that policy, he was quite free to come into this House, and if he and his followers got a majority of the electorate to support them, they could become the Government of this country.</P>
    <P>Now, the first four parts of this Bill are intended to do no more than to replace the Treasonable Offences Act of 1925 in such a form as will bring that Act into consonance with the altered constitutional position here, and also to make provision by ordinary legislation for the protection of the rights accorded by the Constitution to freedom of association and freedom of meeting.  Those provisions are provisions that you will find in any civilised State.  They are precautions that are taken by any civilised State to protect itself.  Part V of the Bill, to which I have referred already, is an emergency provision and so is Part VI.  Part V was the provision that I have referred to as being visualised and enacted in the Constitution.  I know that that has been met to some extent, on the First Reading of the Bill, from one side of the House, by saying that we have adequate powers already.  This provision, I think, indicates that we have no such powers.  I am not for a moment reflecting in any way on the civic spirit of any individual in this country when I say that, for offences which may be brought before such a tribunal, one could hardly hope that jurymen could be expected to bring in verdicts in accordance with the law or in accordance with the evidence.  As I say, I am not reflecting on the civic spirit of anybody in saying that.  The sort of offences that would have to be dealt with in those special courts are offences that to armed intimidation and to violent methods.  Nobody could hope that every juryman who might be summoned on that panel could get adequate protection from the State against any form of intimidation.  I want to make it quite clear, and to emphasise it, that it is not a reflection on the civic spirit in this country to say that you could not expect to get a <Col N="1291" /> jury to deal with such offences as are expected to be brought under a provision such as this.</P>
    <P>As I have said, this is an emergency provision.  It is a provision that will come into operation on a proclamation made by the Government.  When they are satisfied that an emergency exists with which the ordinary courts are unable to deal, or with which the ordinary courts are inadequate to deal &mdash;when that situation arises, in the opinion of the Government, they may, by proclamation, bring in this emergency provision which is provided for under Part V of this Bill.  When they are satisfied that that situation no longer exists, the provision can come to an end under another proclamation; but the Dáil, at any time, can annual, by resolution here, that proclamation, and this emergency provision will cease to have effect.  That, I suggest, is a safeguard against any abuses that Deputies might fear&mdash;perhaps there should be no ground for fear, and I hope there is not &mdash;but it is a precaution at any rate, or some kind of assurance, that the Dáil can deal with this position at any time. Part VI of this Bill provides for internment. It is intended to deal with offences against the State in connection with cases in which there is a moral certainty, although legal proof is lacking. There, again, that provision comes into operation on a proclamation by the Government when the Government are satisfied that such an emergency exists, and there, again, it goes out by proclamation, and, as in the case of the previous part of the Bill, the Dáil, by resolution, can annual this provision.</P>
    <P>Every member of this Government regrets that it is necessary to introduce legislation of this sort.  Since we came into office we have striven here by every means to carry on, as far as we possibly could, the government of this country by normal or ordinary legislation, and when we have had to have recourse to other measures we have tried to act as leniently as we possibly could.  In 1932, when this Government was first elected, an amnesty was declared.  In 1937, when the Constitution was passed, there was a similar position, <Col N="1292" /> a similar jail clearance.  Then, over a technical case in the courts, on another occasion, I think that some 34 prisoners were released.  We have tried to do everything possible to carry on as a Government with the least possible force and the least possible infliction of penalties on any citizen of this country.  I am afraid, however, that we have reached a position that, I suggest, if it is allowed to develop, is bound to deteriorate until in a very short time this country would find itself in a catastrophe.  I have seen a document&mdash;I think most Deputies here have got it&mdash;from some person speaking on behalf of the old I.R.A.  He reminds Deputies that, with regard to those particular measures, the responsibility is a dreadful one.  He tells them that we are precipitating this country into a civil war.  What we are doing under those measures here is to prevent this country from being precipitated into a civil war, and if the same energy were directed by people holding those views outside towards inducing those people to see the futility of the line they are pursuing at the present time, perhaps some headway might be made. We want to see normal, peaceful conditions continue in this country, and while there is a threat, such as is indicated in these proclamations, and while there is a likelihood of that being pursued, there can be neither social nor political freedom in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem which this Bill is designed to meet calls for consideration under two main heads (1) is there a case made for the measure; and (2) if a case be made for it, is this the proper measure for the circumstances of the case?  In so far as there is not only a duty but a right and an obligation on the Government of this State to preserve order and to take such steps as, in their wisdom, are designed to meet that situation, we here, notwithstanding the discreditable events of the last 17 years, stand wholeheartedly for the maintenance of orderly government and security in this State.  If the situation be as serious as the Minister has <Col N="1293" /> described it, it is all the more necessary that there should be as widespread support for such steps as the Legislature considers necessary as is possible throughout the country. It is in that frame of mind that I will approach this subject.</P>
      <P>The Minister's explanation of the necessity for this measure, and of the desirability or otherwise of having a measure of this sort brought in in peace time, as contrasted with waiting until it was absolutely necessary, and his statement that we had a sort of compromise between the two, is scarcely borne out by the facts.  However, that is not of very great importance. So far as this House is concerned, the members of it have had this Bill in their hands for two days&mdash; not even a week-end.  It is not reasonable treatment to expect careful and exhaustive examination of a measure of this sort in that short space of time, and it is obvious from the previous measure&mdash;the Treason Bill&mdash;and this Bill that the minds of the Government have been torn and, to some extent, mixed in connection with its treatment to-day.  However, that, too, is not of such importance as to prevent us giving careful consideration to this whole matter.</P>
      <P>On the question of the security of this State and of the various institutions in the State, which is the object of this measure, one is struck with the absence of any reference to the possibility of aliens interfering with the State.  We had before us within the last couple of weeks a very extensive, elaborate, and costly scheme of defence.  Neither in the proposals put before the House in connection with the expenditure of that large sum, nor in this measure or the Treason Bill is there a single reference to the possible activity of aliens in this country.  If the situation were as was described, a likelihood or a possibility of a war, it does appear to me that it was the Government's duty to have in this measure or in the Treason Bill some precautions to deal with a situation of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, on the general principle in the Long Title of this Bill I propose to support it, with some reluctance, <Col N="1294" /> because of the construction of the measure, in the first place, and because of certain clauses in it, in the second place.  Some 30 clauses of this measure are going to be the normal law of this country.  Even the Minister himself, in introducing it, did not profess to give a date, however far in the future, at which it would be fair to put before a jury the trial of a person charged with an offence under any of these 30 sections.  But that is going to be the normal law.  It does not appear to me that it is going to be a workable law.  If I am not mistaken, the Treasonable Offences Act has been almost nonexistent, non-operative.  There are powers taken in some of these clauses which, it appears to me, should not be put into a Bill of this sort.  While it is the duty of the Legislature to deal with attacks on the State it is also the duty of the Legislature to ensure that the Government itself will not make an attack upon citizens of the State.</P>
    <P>Power is taken in the Bill to proclaim public meetings if it is considered that disorder would ensue.  Surely, it is not the intention that ten persons who are going to obstruct or create disturbance at a public meeting have a right to stop it.  While the Minister can complain about the attitude of certain persons and their disposition towards the State and State institutions, the best way to satisfy all persons in the State is to ensure that the liberty of the citizen cannot be tampered with by any Government: that it cannot be lawful to hold a public meeting which disturbs public order or causes or leads to a breach of the peace.</P>
    <P>Other clauses in the first parts of the Bill which includes 30 sections are also open to objection.  Speaking merely as a layman it is possible to conceive that a solicitor or counsellor bringing a seditious document with him to court can be arrested for having it and if he refuses to give it up he may be prosecuted.  Printers have got to keep copies of everything they print in certain cases.  It appears to me to be unreasonable to ask them to do that.</P>
    <P>Some 19 clauses out of 30 are subject to penalties.  Penalties can only be <Col N="1295" /> secured in the event of conviction.  I do not believe that within the next ten years it will be possible to get a jury, or that it would be fair to ask a jury to decide such cases.  The risk is too great.  There is power to proclaim certain organisations unlawful.  It is quite true that the organisation can appeal to the High Courts.  But even if the High Courts find that these are lawful it is open to the Government, to the Attorney-General, to bring them along to the Supreme Court.  And from the moment that the Government declares they are unlawful until the moment when the Supreme Court decides that they are lawful, they are and have been unlawful during that whole period.  In the event of the operation of suppression order it is possible for the Government to enter into possession of the property and the cash of the owner.  It appears to me a difficult thing in a case of that sort to ensure that the owner can defend himself; that he can take the necessary steps to make his defence.  Those are matters which may be dealt with on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Unless we are satisfied&mdash;and we will not be unreasonable in seeking to be satisfied though we are, nevertheless, determined that we will require to be satisfied&mdash;we cannot support this measure in the further stages.  I do think that more than half the value of a measure of this sort passing through this House or becoming the law of the land will depend upon the measure of support that it gets in the Legislature.</P>
    <P>In connection with the setting up of the special courts I want to say that it is true that there is provision there that the procedure of the High Court should govern the procedure of those Courts.  I require something more than that.  Merely setting that down is not a guarantee that it will happen.  I think that in the case of a conviction there should be the right of appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal.  While in a measure of this sort it is our duty to ensure that every step will be taken to secure the State and the institutions of the State, to preserve order and ordered conditions, we have, as well as <Col N="1296" /> that, the responsibility of compelling the acquiescence of those men against whom this instrument will be brought to bear, with the feeling that they will get a fair trial, that they will have got no cause of complaint in connection with the justice that has been meted out to them, that whatever their political feelings may be in connection with public matters, they will have to admire the sense of fair justice and fair treatment meted out to them.  That is as much our duty in this measure as the steps we are taking to secure and strengthen the institutions of the State.  Those, shortly, are my views in connection with this measure.  I will make no appeal or exhortation or anything else of the sort to the Government in connection with it.  I am treating them fairly, much more so than, perhaps, I was treated when I was in that position.  I make no complaint of that.  I am not bringing it in at all for that purpose, except just to say that it is the duty of every man in this State to make his contribution so that the general feeling and the goodwill of every man in this State will be behind the legislation that is passed in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>We intend to oppose this Bill.  Whatever case could be made for the measure which was brought before the House last week, there is not in any way a case to be made for this measure. We are told that certain events in the country have caused the Government to introduce this measure at this particular time.  The case which has been made by the Minister for Justice is not in any way a convincing case.  I do not think he was convinced himself by the arguments he put forward in support of this Bill.  There is always a danger in a measure like this, where the liberty and, shall I say, the individuality of the citizen is curbed, that instead of remedying what is regarded as the cause of such a measure, we may go to the other extreme.  We of the Labour Party see many sections in this measure which are, if not exactly of a dangerous kind, certainly reactionary. Some of these sections may be put into operation against the ordinary people of this country with very little justification.  There are sections of the <Col N="1297" /> Bill which will probably require some elucidation, if not amendment at the proper time.  I refer particularly to those sections which take away the right of organisations to meet and those sections which take away from a body its title of being a lawful organisation.  Sub-section (1) of Section 16 provides:&mdash;</P>
      <P>If and whenever the Government are of opinion that any particular organisation is an unlawful organisation, it shall be lawful for the Government by order (in this Act referred to as a suppression order) to declare that such organisation is an unlawful organisation and ought, in the public interest, to be suppressed.</P>
      <P>To my mind, that is a very dangerous clause, one which could, under certain circumstances, be used against trade unions, for instance.  I wonder would the Minister be prepared to amend it by saying that the organisations visualised under it do not apply to trade union organisations.  Trades unions have from time to time made themselves objectionable in a certain sense to the authorities not only in this State but other States, and for a very slight pretext such a sub-section as that could be put into operation against trade unions, and could, in fact, destroy their whole ramifications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I may be told, it has, in fact, already been said with regard to the Bill generally, that no honest man need fear this measure.  At the same time, the giving of such wide powers to any Government is, in my opinion, a very dangerous proceeding for this House and for the Oireachtas.  As Deputy Cosgrave has said, we have not had time to study this Bill with the care that we would wish to devote to it.  It was put into our hands yesterday. It does contain sections such as the one I have referred to which are particularly dangerous, and I think more time should be given for the consideration of the Bill.  The right is also being given under the Bill to a member of the Gárda Síochána to interrogate and, if necessary, arrest a citizen on some very flimsy reason. That is giving to the Gárda Síochána very wide powers, with the danger of <Col N="1298" /> those powers being abused.  I remember that when a similar measure to this was passed by the Dáil that powers such as those I refer to were inserted in it and were very often abused.  The members of the Fianna Fáil Party who were in opposition at the time were, I remember, very loud in their denunciations of the manner in which those powers were abused.</P>
    <P>We see dangers in this measure, dangers to the freedom of the individual and even to the law-abiding individual.  There is the fear that in all innocence a person who would have no intention of violating the ordinary law of the State, much less an emergency measure like this, may suffer under it.  This Party definitely takes the stand that, especially at the present time, a measure such as this is not needed, a measure giving such wide powers to the Government, which the Government can delegate to the officers in the Army and police force. We are of opinion that those powers should not be in the hands of the Government without very special reasons.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of his speech, read certain documents.  If their publication is the only reason which he can bring forward for this measure, then I think he has made a very poor case for it.  As far as we can see, and as far as the ordinary man in the street can see, this country for a number of years has never been as peaceful as it is at present.  There have not been any acts of intimidation or of violence reported.  As a matter of fact, Deputy Hickey, the Lord Mayor of Cork, has drawn my attention to the fact that the Circuit Court judge in Cork yesterday received white gloves as a tribute to the peacefulness of that city.  I think that is typical of the peaceful conditions prevailing over the country generally.  Therefore, I cannot see any reason for the introduction of a measure such as this, one which gives such wide powers to the Government, powers which, as I have said, may even be used against persons who have no criminal intent of any kind.  We think that this is not the time for the introduction of such a measure, and we intend to oppose the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The people of this country have always, and certainly within the last 15 or 16 years, earned for themselves the reputation of being a peaceful and a commonsense people.  In the last analysis it is the commonsense, the goodwill and the spirit of friendship and of Christian charity among our people that will preserve and maintain order and peace in the country.  It is, therefore, the wish of everyone, having regard to the peaceful conditions that prevail at the moment, that no drastic action should be taken by the Government which might tend to upset these peaceful conditions.</P>
      <P>We know that statements have been made here by the Government that there is a serious danger threatening the peace of the country, but we all remember that in 1931 another Government came into this House with exactly the same plea.  They told us that the country was faced with a very serious situation and that unless they were armed with very drastic powers it would be absolutely impossible to maintain order.  As a result of that plea, they secured the powers which they asked, and in the exercise of those powers they took into custody a considerable number of people whom they regarded as dangerous to the State.  At that time a lot of law-abiding citizens were impressed by the arguments put forward by the Executive Government. They believed that there was serious danger to the State, and honestly accepted the statements of Ministers. Yet, three months later another Government came into power and immediately released all the people who had been arrested by their predecessors, thereby showing that the danger was not as serious as had been represented by the previous Government, as well as upsetting all the arguments that had been made in support of that very drastic measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all, in our school-days, were familiar with the fable about the boy who was in the habit of crying &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; and alarming the people of the little village where he lived with the story that a wolf was approaching to destroy the sheep which he was herding.  We have some what the same condition in this country.  We have had at almost <Col N="1300" /> regular intervals the Government raising the cry of &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; and the people have, to a great extent, ceased to be alarmed by that cry.  They are beginning to have the feeling that it is not altogether genuine.  We have had the example which I have quoted, where it was definitely proved that the danger was not as great, and could not have been as great, as was stated when the Act of 1931 was passed.  When a number of people were imprisoned a good many law-abiding citizens felt a great danger had been averted and that Deputy Cosgrave, who was then the President, had saved the country. Three months afterwards when those persons were released from prison the others naturally felt alarmed and they believed they would be faced with a serious menace, that they would be shocked by some alarming occurrence. What happened?  So far as we know, nothing happened and peaceful conditions remained for a few years longer.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect to this question, an aspect which most impresses the plain people of the country, and that is that we are placing extraordinary powers in the hands of the Government to suppress organisations and to interfere with the liberty of the Press and the citizens generally.  It is our duty to make sure that these powers will not be abused.  Of course, it will be stated definitely, and has been so stated, that such powers will not be abused.  The same statements were made when the 1931 legislation was being passed, and yet we found that the powers conferred in that Act were abused; we found that the people who introduced that measure and sponsored it and succeeded in getting it passed were the very people who were penalised afterwards by the Act. The organisation supporting them was suppressed.</P>
    <P>It is not possible that in the course of a few years the Fianna Fáil Party may suffer in a similar way as a result of this measure?  It is not possible that you may have a Government in power who may regard the Fianna Fáil organisation as a military organisation? They might form that opinion from the very name of the organisation, because Fianna Fáil, translated into English, means soldiers of fortune or <Col N="1301" /> warriors of destiny.  The next Government might say &ldquo;Why do these people call themselves soldiers of fortune or warriors if they are not out to fight somebody?&rdquo; They might consider it desirable to suppress an organisation on such flimsy grounds.  That may seem far-fetched, but it is quite possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Remember that the organisation that was supporting the Opposition Party a few years ago was suppressed on grounds almost as flimsy.  It was suppressed because its members wore a shirt of a certain colour.  I do not think that was a very strong reason for suppressing the organisation.  The Taoiseach has stated here that that particular organisation was suppressed because it was capable of being armed.  There is no organisation that ever was or will be established in this country that is not capable of being armed.  But let me say there was not the slightest possibility of that organisation being armed. There was not the slightest possibility of the Opposition Party arming the organisation supporting them.  If they did intend to do it, they would not make the organisation so conspicuous by providing them with such a coloured uniform.  They would not have done that if they intended using them for unlawful purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You see how such drastic powers as are contained in this measure have been and are being abused, and there is no reason why they may not be abused in the future.  One of the reasons for which an organisation might be suppressed is that it might interfere with the payment of taxes or other moneys to the local authorities or to the central Government.  Under this measure it would be very easy for a Government to attack, say, a local ratepayers' organisation which might be simply protesting against high rates or trying to secure justice or relief from heavy rates.  There are a thousand ways in which a Government could abuse the powers contained in this measure and for that reason it seems to be our duty to ensure that <Col N="1302" /> such drastic powers are not entrusted to the Executive without more justification.</P>
    <P>We are told that some unlawful organisation may try to upset the powers of government in this country. It is very hard to imagine that any organisation or any body with any intelligence would seek by force of arms to secure power here.  We all must realise how easy it is for an organisation with any intelligence to secure power in this country without resorting to arms.  We have seen how easy it was for the present Government to secure office.  I do not want to hurt anyone's feelings, but we have seen that it does not require an enormous amount of ability or intelligence to secure power here.  Having regard to that, I cannot see how anybody with intelligence, any organisation with intelligence, would seek by any other means except by ordinary political means to achieve power here.  For that reason I do not think the danger is as real as the Minister would have us believe.</P>
    <P>The main reason why I am opposing this Bill is that the powers which the Government seek are too drastic and there is not sufficient justification at the present time for entrusting the Government with such drastic powers. There is another aspect of the question and it is this.  We have not been impressed by the sense of justice in our Government, or that they can be relied upon to exercise such powers impartially. This country was once an island of saints and scholars, but at the moment I think the scholars are not saints, and the people who get control here by political means are not the people who can be relied upon when they have very drastic and far-reaching powers.  They can hardly be relied upon not to use these powers for their own political or Party advantage as against the safety of the State.  We know how newspapers in this country have been attacked from time to time, even by Ministers, and bitterly attacked in this House, even as late as yesterday.  There is no reason why it might not be possible for a Government, or a particular Minister who feels that he has a grievance against <Col N="1303" /> a particular newspaper, to use the drastic powers contained in this measure to penalise that newspaper and to interfere with the liberty of any newspaper or any organisation which might be threatening the political future of the Minister's organisation and not the safety of the State.</P>

      <P>There is one thing that I regret as regards the form of introduction of this Bill.  I think it would have been better if we had two Bills&mdash;one purporting to deal with ordinary circumstances and the other dealing with exceptional circumstances. It might, then, have been possible to discuss the measure with more definiteness and reality than is possible in the rather confused position we are in at the present moment owing to the fact that we are legislating at the same time for normal times, times of full peace, and, on the other hand, we are legislating by means of emergency legislation for very extraordinary times, or what we shall hope, at all events, are extraordinary times.  I think many of us should have found our position much easier, and we could make up our minds more definitely one way or another had there been a division in the two aims the Government have in the different portions of the Bill.</P>
      <P>I gathered from the statement of the Minister that the Government are of the opinion, very definitely of the opinion, that a state of affairs has actually arisen which, if they are not put in a position to deal with it by exceptional legislation of this kind may so develop that it will become extremely troublesome and, perhaps, be impossible to deal with afterwards. I think that is a fair representation of the case the Government is making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am borne out in that view when I turn to the debate on the Constitution on the Article which we are implementing at the present moment. One thing I think should be clear&mdash;I say this purely incidentally to what I said on a previous occasion when we were dealing with the Constitution. <Col N="1304" /> The Constitution itself really guards or guarantees nothing.  Having laid down the general principles, we set forth, the House will remember, to recognise that, of course, these general principles are sometimes dangerous, that they cannot always hold and that we had to lay down exceptions.  One of these exceptions we come to now.</P>
    <P>Speaking on Article 38, which allows, by legislation, the setting up of special courts, the Taoiseach made the following statements.  Claiming that it was absolutely necessary to have the power to set up these courts, he referred to Article 2A which, leaving out matters of detail, is re-enacted to a large extent in essentials in Part V of the Bill now before us.  The Taoiseach then said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I hold that that Act gave enormous powers to the Executive... I still think that the existence of an Article such as Article 2A could only be justified in extreme circumstances.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later on he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have tried to bring about conditions that would render such an Act unnecessary any longer. Although power is taken here to pass such legislation, I do still hope that the need for passing legislation to implement that power will not be necessary, but I think it would be a grave mistake also for us, in view of the situation and the conditions we have passed through, to do anything to prevent the passing of that legislation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He later repeated&mdash;I need only refer to it; I need not quote it&mdash;that what he was seeking there was power in exceptional circumstances to pass this emergency legislation, and he points out that without that particular Article of the Constitution it would not be possible to do so.  Therefore, I find it a little hard in view of that very definite statement of the Taoiseach to grasp how a short time afterwards the Government were thinking of implementing that Article, if it were only to be implemented in very extreme circumstances.  I take it, therefore, from that statement of <Col N="1305" /> the Taoiseach, from the very definite statement the Taoiseach made in the Seanad, from the Minister's short statement on First Reading and from his statement here to-day, that such circumstances have now arisen.</P>
    <P>The Government comes before this House and definitely tells us that we are faced, if not with the actual existence of such a situation, with the moral certainty that unless certain things that are happening at the present time are dealt with, or unless the Government have power to deal with these things by way of emergency legislation, a catastrophic situation may arise.  Catastrophe and civil war were the prospects held out to us in the course of his speech by the Minister. On the First Reading I asked the Minister after the division to lay before the House as fully and as completely as possible, the justification for this Bill at the present moment.  I accept the view that in this matter the primary responsibility is the Government's, that when they say they see a situation developing as a result of the existence of certain armed forces in this country that will lead to catastrophe and civil war&mdash; again the words of the Minister&mdash;it is difficult to deny the Government the powers asked for in that particular section.  I am sorry, on the other hand, the Minister was not more expansive in his remarks.  When I made the request to him after the division on the First Reading, he will remember that he nodded his head vigorously in answer to my request.  I took that to mean assent.  I regret that his statement to-day was to an extent an incomplete statement.  There may be certain difficulties.  I have no wish to embarrass the Minister in this respect.  There may be certain difficulties in reference to certain things that interfere with a fuller statement in regard to certain matters, but to-day we had merely an outline.  The importance of this matter is: the leader of the Opposition stressed the importance&mdash;I think the Minister will be the first to agree with him&mdash;of getting behind a measure of this kind as large an amount not merely of Parliamentary support but of popular support as possible.  The Minister is well aware of the importance of that. He must also be aware that many <Col N="1306" /> people in the country are wondering what the necessity for this measure is.</P>
    <P>I do not at all suggest that it is the duty of the Government to wait until an impossible situation has developed. I do not think it is.  If there is convincing evidence to show that there is danger of such a development, that would justify the Government in asking for these powers and would justify this House in granting them.  For that reason, I ask the Minister to be more detailed in his reply than he was in his opening statement. He referred to a number of incidents in this State and to loss of life on the part of some of the people engaged in these occurrences.  He also referred to the arrogation by certain bodies of the right to declare war.  Am I right in interpreting the Minister in that regard as meaning the right to declare war, not on this Government, but on another Government or Governments? Perhaps the Minister would indicate to me now what precisely was meant.</P>

      <P>On other governments.  There have been a number of rumours about, and no harm will be done in giving the Minister an opportunity of denying them.  Has any attempt been made in recent weeks to interfere in any way with the armed forces of the State or with the armed property of the State?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard it and I heard it contradicted.  If it is denied in the case of one barrack, it is asserted in the case of another.  I am glad to gather from the Minister that that is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Still, he could have made a more convincing case for the Bill.  Even though I do not hold that a Government is bound or even entitled to wait until an impossible situation develops, until, for instance, there has been murder and intimidation on a large scale. Deputy Cogan referred&mdash;this is the only reference I shall make to the subject&mdash; to the position in 1931.  I was then a <Col N="1307" /> member of the Government.  My view in August of 1931 was that if the Government of that day did not get exceptional powers this State could not continue in existence for six months. It can, at least, be said that, when we were asking for emergency powers, there was a full and detailed statement given of the reasons why these powers were deemed absolutely necessary.  For that reason.  I ask the Minister once more to develop more fully the case for the Bill, not so far as I am concerned &mdash;I want to make that clear&mdash;but so far as the public are concerned.  There is a view in the country&mdash;it is no harm to state it&mdash;that this Bill is not called for at present.  I am accepting the view of the Government that it is.  I am accepting the view that it is not the business of a Government to wait until an impossible situation develops.  I apply that also to the first portion of this Bill&mdash; Parts II, III and IV.  What is the intention of the Government regarding these?  This is not a Bill to deal with ordinary disorder, such as rows in the street about trivial matters.  It is a Bill which, it is clear from its context, is designed to deal with what I might call dangerous political disorder.  I ask the Minister, seeing that Parts II, III and IV of this Bill contemplate times of peace and a normal situation, if it is worth while re-enacting these provisions? Do not tell me&mdash;because it does not meet the case&mdash;that you are merely repeating what was done in 1925.  What is the necessity for it now in normal, peaceful times?  So much for the general provisions of Parts II, III and IV.  It might have been better if this had been dealt with in a different Bill because we could have discussed the two things separately.</P>
    <P>I am gravely perturbed about some things in these Parts and I take it for granted that the Government will willingly meet us in that respect.  I can hardly believe that the Government are not alive to the advantage to the State of getting as full a measure of support as possible behind legislation of this kind.  The demands we make are most reasonable, and if the Government meet us in this respect we shall not merely be able to support the principle of the Bill but the other stages.  Take <Col N="1308" />  couple of cases in point.  Section 5 deals with the usurpation of the functions of Government and sub-section (1) makes it an offence to set up a court or other tribunal not authorised. Does that not forbid ecclesiastical courts where oaths are taken?  I do not ask whether or not that is meant I assume it is not meant, but many Governments in Europe at the present day would regard the functioning of such courts as a usurpation of governmental functions.  I take it for granted no such thing was meant, but it is no answer to say there is no intention to enforce it.  If it is capable of such an interpretation, such a penal&mdash;in the old sense of the word&mdash;enactment should not appear in the Statute Book of this country once attention is called to it.</P>
    <P>Look at Section 8.  I will leave out the matter to which I do not intend to refer.  It says that</P>
    <P>any person who shall commit any act of violence against...a member of a lawfully established military or police force, whether such member is or is not on duty...is liable to imprisonment for two years.</P>
    <P>Let us take that as it stands.  What the Government means may be one thing; I am taking the thing as it is there.  If in days of perfect political calm a man meets a member of the police force who is not on duty and is in plain clothes, and they have a row, he commits an act of violence against him, and is liable to two years' imprisonment. Mind you, according to this provision, he is guilty.  The court may let him off.  A sensible court would let him off, possibly, but he is guilty.  Those, I may be told, are small matters.  A reference was made by Deputy Cogan to the question of the Press, a complicated matter with which we can deal in Committee, but, if the Government believes in the freedom of the Press, which is supposed within reasonable limits to be guarded by our Constitution, it is a pity that Ministers of the Government by repeated speeches in this House show their desire to injure the Press, and to prevent legitimate criticism on the part of the Press.  It does not increase confidence in the mentality of the Government in these <Col N="1309" /> matters.  It is well that restraint should be exercised on certain Ministers in that regard.</P>
    <P>More serious&mdash;very serious in our view&mdash;is the provision referred to by the Leader of the Opposition, clause 24.  To use a phrase once used in this House, suppose I happen to belong to an unpopular Party; it was bad enough that protection could not be given to us if we were interrupted, but, as I understand it&mdash;and I cannot find any lawyer to disagree with me in this interpretation&mdash;if this Bill becomes law not merely will I get no protection because I am unpopular with certain people, but it will be unlawful for me to hold a meeting at all.  Now, I believe in liberty, and I believe it is necessary to guard liberty against the illegitimate use of force, and that is the purpose of Part V of this Bill.  I do not think there is any good in talking of liberty if you allow a body of men to put an end to liberty so far as citizen A, citizen B, and Citizen C are concerned.  On the other hand, as everybody will recognise, we must also guard liberty reasonably against undue interference on the part of the Government, and I hold that clause 24 as it now stands would make it impossible for anybody who has that view of liberty and that aspect of liberty in his mind to vote for the final passage of an Article of that kind.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the Minister knows and what he does not know, and I do not know that his colleagues know either, judging by their amusement at his interruptions.  I hope we shall have a contribution from the Minister&mdash;and that will certainly facilitate the passage of the Bill.  It is being made the ordinary law of the country that if I get up to hold a meeting in my constituency and a small number of people oppose it, and there is a row after it, that meeting is illegal.  &ldquo;It shall not be lawful to hold a public meeting which disturbs public order or causes or leads to a breach of the peace.&rdquo;  There is no limit there.  It may be said: &ldquo;Well, go into a hall.&rdquo; I could, but the public cannot be allowed into a hall.  That is also provided for.  I do not know what the Government meant.  They may have meant: &ldquo;It shall not be lawful to hold a meeting which advocates a breach of the peace,&rdquo; but that is not what is here.  So far as I am concerned, even on the rather inadequate case put up by the Minister that it is necessary to prevent an extremely dangerous situation developing, I am not prepared to deny the Government those powers. But when in another portion of the Bill, as a portion of the ordinary law in ordinary times, they themselves or any Government&mdash;I am speaking now impersonally&mdash;claim the right under clause 24 to prevent anybody holding a public meeting, I say there is an end to democratic government, a complete end to it, quite as much as if you allowed a free hand to the people against whom Part V is directed. There may be an appeal.  What good is that to me if I want to hold a meeting? I advertise a meeting for <Col N="1311" /> Sunday.  I am told I cannot hold it because it will lead to disorder&mdash; though I am in no way responsible for the disorder.  That is merely because there are a certain number in my constituency opposed to me.  I do not care where this provision came from.  I am dealing with what we are now asked to pass as an amendment to the ordinary law of the land.  It is no answer to me to say that that will never happen.  We should not do this. There may be an appeal even to the Supreme Court.  What is to happen to my campaign in the meantime? How are the people of the country to have views on politics put before them with any confidence whatsoever on the part of the different parties?</P>
      <P>Take the clause dealing with unlawful associations.  I cannot for the moment remember the number but the Minister will know to what I am referring.  We are entrusting great power to the Government even in the ordinary law, but particularly with regard to emergency legislation.  They determine in their wisdom that certain associations are unlawful associations. They then say there is an appeal.  You can go before the court for a declaration that it is not an unlawful association, but there is the peculiar provision that it remains suppressed as an unlawful association so long as the Attorney-General says &ldquo;I am going to appeal.&rdquo;  We do not know when the appeal will be heard or what will be the ultimate result, but, in the meantime, it remains an unlawful association although it has been declared by the judges to be a lawful association.  Surely the position ought to be that it is a lawful association if it is so declared by a judge of the High Court, subject to the fact that if the Court of Appeal reverses the decision, it becomes an unlawful association.  That would seem to be the fair thing.  It is not much to ask remedies of this kind from the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister will correct me if I am wrong but, as far as I can make out, the matter is brought before the High Court which decides that the association in question is a lawful association. <Col N="1312" /> There is an appeal against that to the Supreme Court.  Supposing the decision of the High Court is that the Minister was right, and that it was an unlawful association, is there any appeal to the Supreme Court in that case?  I do not think so.  It is only a small matter but I think there should be parity in dealing with these matters.  The last point is one of detail mentioned by Deputy Cosgrave, whereby this special court may be composed of lawyers, lawyers and officers, or officers alone.  All that is possible.  I am not finding fault with the particular formation of the Tribunal but, on matters of law, just as there is an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal on important matters, there ought also be an appeal from this particular court.</P>
    <P>The various matters we have put before the Government are easily remedied if this measure is intended, as I presume it is, for the purpose the Government has in mind.  There is nothing in anything we have urged the Government to do that is not eminently reasonable.  We are not making any substantial alterations which are not for the better guarding of liberty, and the better guarding of order, and it is for that reason I have avoided every reference to past events.  We are now trying to legislate for the future.  I have avoided referring to past legislation and past attitudes.  The time of this House could be taken up for weeks if we were to go into the past, but the mere fact that Sections 2, 3 and 4 are merely re-enacting the Act of 1925 is in itself unwise.  What does the Government intend to do with them?  In normal times there is no necessity for a lot of powers contained in Sections 2, 3 and 4.  In times of peace there is no necessity for them.  In times of stress there is the remedy under Part 5. Surely it is not the intention of the Government to try their hands at trial by jury in certain offences, until that breaks down, and until a couple of jurymen are shot.  I understood from the Minister's introductory statement that that is what he wanted to avoid, and that by what he rather aptly called a compromise solution was that between the two alternatives before the Government.  I must say that the first alternative is not clear to me, in view <Col N="1313" /> of the declarations made by the Taoiseach in the debate on Article 38. However, it is surely not proposed to try this machinery until it is broken down.  Why then re-enact it?  Is it of any use?  We were told that this was done in every civilised country.  What practical use does the Government intend to make of it?</P>
    <P>Again, I asked the careful attention of the Minister to this point, whether something like this is not likely to happen.  If you operate Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Bill you will be able to get a conviction against the ordinary man, that it would be much better to deal with by ordinary law, under which he would be guilty of some other legal offence, but not a political offence of this kind.  You will never be able to get a conviction against the type of man you profess to be anxious to get at.  It seems to me that that is the danger of this particular section to the ordinary citizen, who may be guilty of an offence, but not guilty of anything that could be interpreted as upsetting the State or leading to the upsetting of the State.  It will be quite ineffective, as the Government must know from our experience, and from their experience, against a person who deliberately sets out to launch a policy or to help a policy or to take part in a policy that has as its ultimate aim the destruction of the State.  I am assuming that that is law in ordinary circumstances, and for that reason I would much prefer if the Minister had been able to bring in two Bills.  These provisions have given cause for grave searchings of heart on the part of many on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>The other points I mentioned are the more important.  I have tried to deal with this matter independent of any Party affiliations whatever.  I have tried to find out what is duty towards the State and towards Parliament so far as this measure is concerned.  I put forward my own particular reasons why I cannot vote against the principle of this Bill after the statement, inadequate though it was, made by the Minister.  At the same time, I feel it my duty to re-emphasise the points made by the Leader of the Opposition, <Col N="1314" /> in pointing out certain dangers, certain grave menaces to individual liberty, which ought to be remedied before the final stages.  By their action on these matters we must judge the good faith of the Government and in connection with the remedying of them our future attitude towards the remaining stages of this Bill must naturally be determined.  I want no interference with liberty on the part of an armed body without authority, and I do not want undue interference or power of interference with liberty on the part of a Government where I am not convinced that that is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The House listened this evening to probably the feeblest effort ever made by a Minister for Justice in commending this Bill to the Legislature. In the course of his remarks the Minister made no effort whatever that was calculated to impress any serious or responsible mind, that there was a situation in the country which must be dealt with by the special legislation provided in this Bill, and by the Treason Bill, which has already received a Second Reading.  If the Minister reads his speech he will see that a very lengthy portion of it consisted of reading two lengthy proclamations. If we take away the proclamations from the speech there is not a shred of justification for the enactment of legislation of this kind.  The most striking thing we were told in connection with the Bill was, that in respect of Parts 1, 2, 3 and 4, it was merely re-enacting, under the patronage of this Government, the Treasonable Offences Act of 1925.  I wish to ask the Minister if that is the purpose of this Bill, or if he has any special hankering that a Public Safety Bill should be introduced in his own name, or what is the purpose of re-enacting in this Bill four sections, which constitute, in effect, the re-enactment under this Government of the Treasonable Offences Act of 1925?  Yet, this Bill has been commended to the House as something which is necessary, something which is urgent, something which cannot wait until such time as a normal situation developed, and, in the same breath, the Minister told us that they were merely re-enacting in this Bill the <Col N="1315" /> Treasonable Offences Act, with their <i>imprimatur.</i></P>
      <P>The Minister did not give us any indication whatever to show that in the situation confronting the country to-day the existing law is inadequate. We have not been told that the existing statute law is inadequate. We have not been shown even that the 1925 Act, which is available for exercise by the Minister, is inadequate.  We have not been shown that there is any situation in the country which necessitates the introduction of special legislation of this kind.  In fact, the Minister made one rather startling revelation when he said that, even in the Cabinet, there were two points of view&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The mind which says, &ldquo;Do this in a period of calm,&rdquo; and the mind which says, &ldquo;Wait until the necessity arises.&rdquo;  Presented with the situation where two minds of that kind were playing in opposition, the Minister said this is a compromise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the correction that there were not two minds in the Cabinet if the Minister says so.  At any rate, the Minister knew of the existence of two points of view. Whether these respective points of view were re-echoed in the Cabinet or not is a matter, of course, upon which I cannot pronounce any judgement. But there were two points of view, one, to do it now, in a period of calm, and the other, to wait until the necessity arises, and this Bill, we are told, is a compromise between those two points of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been asked, therefore, to take a decision to-day, not based on any urgent necessity, but based, apparently, on a desire to effect a <Col N="1316" /> compromise between two points of view, and neither point of view in the matter justifies the introduction of hasty legislation, giving the Executive Council the far-reaching powers enshrined in this Bill in the situation which exists here to-day.  The only effect of this Bill in the public mind &mdash;in fact, the consequences of it are obvious already, even in the Government's own Party&mdash;is to cause considerable public perturbation, considerable indignation, and a considerable amount of agitation as to the consequences which inevitably flow from coercive legislation of this kind.  In the 1937 election and in the 1938 election we used to be told directly and by innuendo from the Fianna Fáil platforms that &ldquo;If you do not want the 1931 Constitution (Amendment) Act re-enacted with vigour and applied with viciousness, the thing to do is to keep the Cumann na nGaedheal Party out of office.&rdquo;  Now the wheel is running its full circle, and to-day we see a Government which told us at one time that it was at once a guarantee against the use of coercive powers actually introduce in this House legislation which is, in many respects, identical with the coercive legislation which was introduced by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party.  In 1931 this House saw the introduction of the Constitution (Amendment) Bill and, introducing the Bill on that occasion, the President of the time, Deputy Cosgrave now, justified the introduction of the Bill on the grounds that there existed then within the State 11 organisations with subversive tendencies which he mentioned specifically by name.  He referred to the widespread, undetected murder of State servants and State witnesses and gave instances in support of his statement.  He referred also to the existence of a widely-organised conspiracy to overthrow by force the Constitution and the Government of the State and, as if these instances were not sufficiently informative, and not sufficient to convince the House that it was necessary to give his Bill a Second Reading, he went on to refer to the cutting of telegraph and telephone wires, the <Col N="1317" /> barricading of roads, the firing on police, the prohibition of public meetings, the intimidation of jurors, open widespread drilling, deportation of people from the country, the blowing up of Gárda Barracks, the intimidation of public bodies by the destruction or theft of their goods and records. No effort whatever was made and no effort, in fact, could be made by the Government to attempt to get over, even on the most credulous fool in this country, the suggestion that a situation akin to the situation described there exists here to-day.</P>
    <P>I would like to inquire from the Minister for Justice why he refrained from making any comparison to-day between the circumstances of 1931 and the circumstances of 1939.  At that time the Constitution (Amendment) Act, of which this Bill is an immediate brother, was bitterly opposed by the Fianna Fáil Party.  The present Taoiseach opposed the Bill at every stage.  He did not deny that the conditions described by Deputy Cosgrave then existed but, in regard to them, he said they were.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;incidents which everybody here in this House regrets, but incidents which do not justify, in my estimation, anyhow, the bringing in of a Bill of this sort.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The shooting of people, the intimidation of witnesses, the various other matters then referred to by Deputy Cosgrave in 1931, were just &ldquo;incidents&rdquo; in the viewpoint of the present Taoiseach and did not justify the introduction of legislation of that kind. The Taoiseach went on to say,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The ordinary law is quite sufficient to deal with anything that has been referred to by the President in the long list which he has given.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Industry and Commerce contributed to the debate on that occasion and said,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is ample power under the ordinary law to deal with conspiracy or violence.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the situation in 1931.  The Taoiseach did not believe this abnormal <Col N="1318" /> legislation was necessary and was quite cold and unconvinced with the long litany of incidents quoted by Deputy Cosgrave in support of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's contribution did not end there.  He described Deputy Cosgrave's Bill as a coercive measure, and indeed went on to allow himself to be prophetic on that occasion, because he said,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I, for one, think and believe that if we were here in five years' time or ten years' time we will still see Bills introduced on lines like these if the present state of affairs is allowed to continued.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was in 1931.  And, eight years afterwards, the Taoiseach's prophesy is realised.  We are seeing and we have lived to see another coercion Bill, of the same variety as 1931, introduced here.  What the Taoiseach then meant by &ldquo;the present state of affairs,&rdquo; he went on to explain when he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is a social and economic situation which calls for immediate attention, and we ought to approach it in the same way as in the case of the political one, and recognise that if men are hungry they will not be too particular about the ultimate principles of the organisation they would join, if that organisation promises to give them bread.... The way to deal with it is to see that people who are anxious to work will get work.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To-day we have 100,000 people registered as unemployed and unable to get work, and over 20,000 of them working for three or four days a week under the notorious rotational schemes.  The present Minister for Justice contributed to the debate on that occasion and he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government has been a hopeless failure in dealing with the economic position, and they look to the one thing in which they have been a success, that is, waging war upon their fellow-countrymen.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy Hugo Flinn felt that he could not be left out of the discussion and he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This law is not respectable.  It <Col N="1319" /> is a law for worms; it is a law for crawling creatures.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Yet this law for worms and crawling creatures, as described by Deputy Flinn in 1931, is precisely the same law as we are being asked to enact to-day by a Government which, on other occasions, told us that the Government which could not govern without coercive legislation should get out.</P>

      <P>The chickens have come home to roost.  The Minister for Finance was then allowed to intervene in debates even on public safety issues and he felt that he had something to contribute to this debate.  He said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;No democratic assembly and no national assembly can afford to give uncontrolled power to the executive.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Yet that is exactly what this Bill is doing in respect of the categories of offences, real and artificial, which are being created under it.</P>
      <P>One is entitled to express considerable surprise at the attitude of the Government in introducing this Bill. The present Taoiseach used to be a disciple of the philosophy that force and coercion were quite unnecessary. Explaining his attitude towards the 1931 measure to the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, and also explaining his repeal by proclamation of the operation of that Act, the Taoiseach in an interview said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I do not anticipate any disorder when the Public Safety Act is repealed.  Under my Government, I believe that extraordinary measures like the Public Safety Act will not be necessary.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was in 1932.  A short time before that, he went to New Ross and made a speech in which he said that he did not believe that &ldquo;in this country there were so vicious minded people that there was a large class of the people who had to be governed by coercion Acts.  That was the British attitude <Col N="1320" /> towards this country.  Was it to be their faith in this country that they were always to have Irish governments like that.&rdquo;  Deputy Kissane also felt that he had something to say on the same subject in 1933, because he made a speech at Listowel, and, according to the <i>Irish Press</i>, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The jails have given up the political prisoners.  Peace has replaced war.  £1,000 of Mr. de Valera's salary and £500 of each of his Ministers' salaries have been voluntarily surrendered to the people and have helped to relieve destitution.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the type of speech and these are the kinds of declarations we have been getting from the Government on this question of coercion and repressive legislation for the past few years. Suddenly departing from all their previous professions&mdash;I do not say &ldquo;their beliefs&rdquo;&mdash;the Government has now determined that it is not satisfied with legislation on the Statute Book, doing in many respects the same as this legislation will do, but it wants to have the honour and glory of introducing a special coercion Bill of its own, and it does not even think it necessary to give the House any adequate reasons as to why it should enact a Bill of this kind.  They apparently feel that all that it is necessary to do is to say to the Fine Gael Party: &ldquo;Look here, you passed a similar Bill in 1931 and in 1925.  We believe you will be consistent on this issue and, therefore, we commend this Bill to you as something with which you are familiar, something of which you used to be fond.  We feel satisfied that you will be able to get sufficient of your people into the division lobby to support this Bill, even though in other days we did not like Bills of this kind.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What is the necessity for the Bill? Not a single reason was given during the Minister's speech as to why the country should be asked to pass a Bill of this kind.  The Minister did not even attempt to suggest that there was an abnormal situation in the country.  He hinted, in a rather cryptic way, that possibly he knew more than other people, but this is a legislative <Col N="1321" /> Assembly which is responsible to the people for its conduct.  This Bill will be passed in the name of the Oireachtas and the Oireachtas is entitled to know in what set of circumstances it is asked to give these abnormal powers to any Government.  The Minister's attempt to suggest that there is in the country to-day anything like the yeastiness, anything like the effervescent feeling that was there in 1931 is not convincing.  Will the Minister say what abnormal situation requires to be dealt with to-day that cannot be dealt with by the ordinary law, and will he tell us in what way he is handicapped in applying the ordinary law to any type of abnormal offence which may be committed here to-day?  Not a single effort has been made by the Minister to give us reasons along those lines.</P>
    <P>We see what is happening in Britain to-day.  Every anti-Irish newspaper in the country is endeavouring to work up an agitation against Irishmen there because of certain bombings and explosions which have taken place there recently; but, notwithstanding all the anti-Irish agitation, the Government have not attempted to introduce any special kind of legislation of the type introduced here.  The ordinary law has been sufficient to deal with that situation there, and, here, although we are completely free from that type of incident and completely peaceful&mdash;in fact, more peaceful than the country has been for the last quarter of a century&mdash;we are asked by the Government to give them these unusual powers, these dictatorial powers, these powers which give the citizen liberty only when the Government does not desire to take it from him.  I want to see liberty preserved in this country.  I want to see the ordinary citizen permitted to exercise the maximum liberty it is possible to allow him and I do not want to see his liberty threatened, nor do I want to see his mind or body regimented.  If I detest anything more than interference with the liberty of the citizen by any organisation or any crowd, it is the placing in the hands of a Government of enormous tyrannical powers such as are placed in the hands of this Government by this legislation, <Col N="1322" /> because, in the case of a Government, not only has it the power conveyed to it in the letter of the law, but it has the machinery and the resources at its disposal to exercise that power in the most despotic way.</P>
    <P>We are told to-day by the Minister of two proclamations, and I am sure that when the Minister was reading them he felt that there was a very familiar ring about them.  I think it was very appropriate that the Miniister was selected to read these two proclamations to-day.  I do not say that they were nearly as startling or nearly as picturesque or as convulsive in language as those to which the Minister appended his own signature in other days, but does he not know, surely, that even the issuings of proclamations do not cause a state of emergency or a state of war, or do not amount in fact to levying war even though the proclamation may have been written or printed in the most purple language? We have seen many proclamations in this country&mdash;in fact, we have had a surfeit of proclamations from 1922 onwards.  The ordinary citizen is quite used to these proclamations here.  The ordinary citizen here almost knows these proclamations by their Christian names, and the ordinary citizen, in reading these proclamations, values them according to the valuation that is generally applied to proclamations in this country.  Surely the Minister knows that you cannot justify the introduction of legislation of this kind merely because of a proclamation, because he himself has signed proclamations, in other days, which would have justified the introduction of dozens of coercion Acts of this kind.  Probably, in those days, the Minister would have even denied hotly that this most picturesque proclamation would have justified the introduction of a Bill of this kind.</P>
    <P>Mind you, if people outside imagine that they constitute a Government and that this House has no power to legislate for the people, it is because they got encouragement from other people who now occupy responsible positions. When this House was sitting in 1929, <Col N="1323" /> we had a statement by the present Taoiseach in which he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I still hold that our right to be regarded as the legitimate Government of the country is faulty, and that this House is faulty.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach may tell us in what set of circumstances and just in what kind of literary environment that kind of phrase was used at the time, but the fact remains that it is highly dangerous for the leader of the main Opposition Party to use language of that kind here in a country where we have such an amazing predisposition to establishing armies and where we have such an amazing fascination for various and numerous Governments.  That was not the only encouragement that was given to the issuing of proclamations of the kind now quoted by the Minister. Speaking in Carrick-on-Shannon in February, 1929, the present Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I here and now declare that the Oireachtas is not the law and the legislature of Ireland, Saorstát Eireann, Republic of Ireland or any part of Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, when statements of that kind were made by persons who now occupy positions on the Government Front Bench, is it any wonder that people write proclamations in the terms and in the tone denounced by the Minister to-day?</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the issue of these proclamations&mdash;and they were the only scrap of evidence put forward by the Minister for Justice to justify this Bill &mdash;I consider that the situation in the country to-day is so peaceful that there is no necessity whatever for the introduction of this abnormal legislation. The ordinary citizen of this country to-day can go about his business and can transact his business in any way he likes.  He is not in danger of molestation to-day from any organisation, nor is he at present in danger of molestion by any Government.  He can go to his work in the morning and he can come home from his work in the evening without any danger of molestation. The real problem here is that there <Col N="1324" /> are over 100,000 of our citizens who cannot get work to which to go, and I hold that that is a much more urgent problem than the problem that we are told is now before us, and that much better work would be done by trying to tackle that problem than by the introduction of legislation of the kind we have here to-day.  When we ought to be concentrating all our efforts on dealing with that vast army of unemployed in the country, another vast vast army of hopelessly under-employed people in the country, and another vast army of people who are dependent on home assistance throughout the country&mdash;apart from the great numbers of our best manhood and womanhood who are fleeing to England to try to get there the employment that they cannot get here&mdash;our answer to all that is to give the people another Public Safety Act.  In ancient Rome, when the people cried for bread, they were offered circuses.  Here, when our people look for work, we offer them Public Safety Acts and Coercion Acts that are indistinguishable from any of those Acts that went before.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputy Cormac Breathnach will feel that he ought to intervene in this debate and tell us, with all the calmness and responsibility of his position, that notwithstanding the dangerous and tyrannical provisions of this Bill&mdash;because Deputy Breathnach must remember that the Minister for Justice says that Parts I, II, III and IV of this Bill are the same as the Treasonable Offences Act of 1925, which was so bitterly denounced by the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash; all you have got to do when this Bill is passed, is to be good and, therefore, it will not affect you.  Be good.  All you have to do is to be good and then the Legislature can pass all the Public Safety Acts it likes, and you will not be affected by them so long as you are good.  It is a wonder that Deputy Breathnach and his Party did not give the same advice in 1931, because if you were good and sufficiently wormish&mdash;to use Deputy Hugo Flinn's expression&mdash;in 1931 there was no chance that you would be interned or brought before the Military Tribunal.  All you had to do <Col N="1325" /> was to be good and sufficiently wormish&mdash;to use Deputy Flinn's expression again&mdash;and make no attempt to claim any of your rights as a citizen or criticise, in any way vigorously, the Executive Council, and do not attend public meetings unless you could be sure that nobody would interrupt you, and then nothing would happen to you and you could be quite satisfied that the Bill was all right. In 1925 the Treasonable Offences Bill was denounced because it was described as tyrannical.  The Bill of 1931 was also denounced because it was described as tyrannical.  Both of these Bills, in my opinion, were tyrannical, but the advice then given by the Cumann na nGaedheal Party was: &ldquo;No law-abiding citizen need fear these Bills.&rdquo;  After 13 or 14 years Deputy Cormac Breathnach has been converted to the same point to view&mdash;no law-abiding citizen need fear the 1939 Offences Against the State Bill.  That is always the justification that is given for the introduction of this kind of legislation. If you read Deputy Cosgrave's speech in 1931 justifying the Constitution (Amendment) Act you will see that his speech is bristling with that kind of paternal advice: &ldquo;Be good; stay quiet, and let me get away with what I want here and I will not harm you.&rdquo; That is the kind of language and philosophy that is always used as a justification of this kind of legislation and that is what is being used to justify this Bill.  You cannot justify a measure such as this on that kind of ground any more than a burglar can justify his invasion of a person's home&mdash;any more than a burglar in a sitting-room can justify his presence there by telling the people in the house that although he is going to take their chattel property, he is going to respect their persons so long as they stay quiet.  You cannot justify a Bill of this kind on specious pleas of that character.</P>
    <P>This, Sir, is a coercion Bill.  It has all the outward and inward qualifications of a coercion Bill.  Nakedly and unashamedly, we have been told by the Government that this Bill is <Col N="1326" /> re-enacting four sections of the Treasonable Offences Act, 1925, and in Parts V and VI it is simply doing what the Constitution (Amendment) Act of 1931 did at a time when that Act was being bitterly opposed by the present Government Party and by the Labour Party.  Our view to-day is the same as it was in 1931 and in 1925. But there is even much more justification to-day for our opposition to this Bill than there was for our opposition to the 1931 Constitution (Amendment) Bill.  A peaceful condition exists to-day, and in the face of it we are being precipitated into all the agitation and public convulsion which will follow the enactment of this legislation.</P>
    <P>We have been told that we have a new Constitution; that it provides all the safeguards any democracy in the world has, that it is Christian in character and conception, and that it is simply saturated with every virtuous principle of democracy.  We were told that one of the qualifications that commended it to the Irish people was that it provided for a referendum. Here is a Bill introduced eight months after a general election, but not a word that it was in contemplation was uttered at that general election.  In fact, one of the statements common on Fianna Fáil platforms was that the enactment of the new Constitution had, in fact, abolished the Public Safety Act and the Military Tribunal. The Military Tribunal is coming back again&mdash;have no doubt about it.  A few lawyers and barristers and people of that kind are put in to make weight in the constitution of the special court, but when it comes to be constituted I have very grave suspicious that it will not differ in vocational complexion from the last Military Tribunal.</P>
    <P>We have provision for a referendum in the Constitution.  This is not emergency legislation.  This is ordinary legislation which we are now asked to enshrine as the statute law of the country.  It is not being introduced to deal with any emergency situation or with any abnormal circumstances. It is to be the permanent statute law of the country, not to be repealed next year or in five or ten <Col N="1327" /> years time, but to obtain as the statute law for all time.  Why should we not consult the people on the matter?  Why did we not tell the people last year of our determination to do this?  Now that we have provision for a referendum and an opportunity of consulting the people, why can we not consult them on such a vital matter which affects the entire statute law of the country?  It even goes wider and deeper and affects the lives and liberties of each and every citizen.</P>
    <P>I think that this is panic legislation, that it is ill-conceived and ill-considered legislation, and that in the peaceful condition of the country to-day there is no justification for it. I think it is only calculated to arrest the tendency towards peaceful development in this country, and that it is inclined to give the world a grotesque misrepresentation of the conditions here to-day, which are more peaceful probably than in any other part of the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill with very considerable hesitation and with a very great degree of reluctance. I do not like the Bill itself.  I am not convinced by the case the Minister made, and my experience of such weapons in the hands of the present Government in the past does not encourage me to place any trust in the fact that the powers asked for will not be misused.  I subscribe to the support of this Bill simply because an Executive Council in this country says that there is danger to the stability of the State or to the lives of the people if they do not procure such powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not care what Executive Council is sitting opposite or what Party it comes from, if a representative of the Government stands up and says &ldquo;There is danger to the State or to the people if we do not have such powers as we ask for,&rdquo; then no matter how much I may distrust that Government, or how much I may dislike the Bill, that Government will get the powers they ask for.  But, I do think, in justice to the House and to <Col N="1328" /> Deputies, that a Minister when asking for such abnormal powers should at least make an effort to make a case. A Minister may or may not have information denied to other Deputies, but before asking for such drastic powers as are asked for here there is an obligation on any member of the Government who stands up, not only to say that there was a proclamation or that this thing happened in the past &mdash;we can all read the papers as well as the Minister&mdash;but to show there is a very real danger and from where that danger is likely to come.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton says that proclamations are as common as Christmas cards in this country.  Every little junta, insignificant and impotent, at some time or other issues a proclamation. What did the mere fact of a proclamation being issued, saying that a body that called itself Dáil Eireann was going out of existence and passing over authority to a body that called itself the Irish Republican Army, mean?  It was evidence of one thing in fact, that one of these insignificant bodies was going out of existence and that, instead of having two, you are going to have one.</P>
    <P>Then there were explosions in England.  I may say, be it popular or unpopular, that if the Minister or any Minister stated that the explosions in England or in any outside country were planned, plotted or directed from here, then, again, without any other case being made, the Government here would get powers so far as I am concerned to nip that conspiracy and trample it out of existence.  But, if the reason for this Bill is because of these explosions in England, the time for the Bill was two months ago, not to-day. If we are to learn anything from newspapers and from the things we see and from the things we hear, it is that the English police forces were quite competent, without any special powers or without any Public Safety Act, absolutely to get a stranglehold on the whole illegal activities over there.</P>
    <P>So far as I know, we had no events of that kind in this country.  We had no evidence of lawlessness, we had no attempts on life, we had no attempts <Col N="1329" /> on property, and we are put in the appalling position of being asked to deny such powers to a Government that says there is real danger ahead if they do not get the powers.  But relying on the fact that there is a decent Opposition Party here with a well-developed sense of civic responsibility, we are treated in that absolutely discourteous manner.</P>
    <P>When the previous Public Safety Bills were introduced in this country, the Dáil was in the position of a coroner's court.  The Minister introducing the Bill could say, &ldquo;Gentlemen, view the bodies.&rdquo;  Murders had been committed, murders were being committed and every second citizen of this country was being asked to choose between death and perjury.  The case was clearly made, fully stated and the knowledge was there at the disposal of everyone.  The now Ministers were over here then; in spite of murder being rampant and in spite of people being driven to choose between perjury and death; in spite of the absolute paralysis of the law courts and in spite of the appalling disgrace of the good name of Ireland in having open perjury in our courts, the Taoiseach and every one of his now Ministers were appalled at the idea of any Government seeking such powers.</P>
    <P>One would expect if the infant minds which they showed at that time have since reached maturity, that there would, at least, be an apology for the slanderous statements which were made about Ministers in those days. Having copied those Ministers in many respects one would imagine that they would copy them in the manner in which Bills of this nature would be introduced.  One would imagine that they would make some attempt to consider the Deputies of this House and make a comprehensive case for the Bill. Definitely a case was not made for this Bill; there was nothing beyond the statement that the Government were afraid of the consequences if they did not get such powers as they are asking for.  That is the only thing that would justify any of us in supporting this Bill. We have got to take that statement in blinkers.  That statement must be considerably <Col N="1330" /> added to if the people outside this House, as well as the people in the House, are to be satisfied that the Government is doing the right thing.</P>
    <P>Some people will always give unlimited powers, extravagant powers to a Government, if the Government says &ldquo;there is danger to the life of the State if we do not get those powers.&rdquo; But remember after you have carried the Dáil with you it is, at least, desirable to carry public opinion with you I have not met one person irrespective of political label or Party affiliation who felt there was any justification for this Bill at the present moment.  Not one.  But a case must be made for the people outside as well as for Deputies here.  There are many people, decent, God-fearing people, who feel that a Bill such as this introduced in times such as these is provocative to the worst elements in the country.  I subscribe to that view.</P>
    <P>Assume that there are illegal organisations in the country with illegal aims and unscrupulous methods in order to attain their aims.  Assume that there are, be they strong or weak, few or numerous, this kind of Bill is to them like a red rag to a bull.  In addition it gives an opportunity to insignificant, obscure people to strut the stage as heroes.  There is always the danger and the very real danger of this kind of Bill precipitating the very state of affairs which this Bill sets out to avoid or prevent.  There is always a very real danger about drastic Bills of this kind provoking disorder and bringing about the position, in a small way, of armed violence, producing assassinations here and there.  There is always &mdash;and the present Government must know it as well as I do&mdash;the very real danger of assassinations, be they few or many, being the result of a Bill such as this.  One blow leads to another. One assassination leads to drastic action, drastic action leads to further assassinations, and further assassinations to further drastic action.</P>
    <P>That being so, I think it cannot be denied that there is a responsibility on the members of the Government of making a far more comprehensive case than was made by the Minister when <Col N="1331" /> introducing the Bill.  Three weeks ago we were promised by the Minister a comprehensive statement before this Bill would be introduced.  Everybody, political opponents and political supporters, expected a full and informative statement.  To what does the statement of the Minister amount? References to a couple of proclamations and the statement that there was danger to the State if such powers were not given the Government.  In other words, a sheer reliance on our sense of responsibility to put the Bill through.  That can always be relied on.  But there are a couple of million people outside this House and immense damage may be done if they are not convinced that there was a reasonable case for introducing a Bill of this type. Every Deputy supporting this Bill, Government Deputy or Opposition Deputy, has his own peculiar difficulties. Even though we are prepared to take certain things on faith, everybody else, the people outside, will say they are not prepared to take these things on faith.</P>
    <P>We have got to recollect this, that there is a far greater responsibility on the present Government to justify measures of this kind than there was imposed on the shoulders of their predecessors. I say that because the present Government are the men who fought ruthlessly and relentlessly with every weapon against powers such as are asked for in this Bill and they did that in dangerous times&mdash;in times which they do not deny were dangerous.  Yet they denied such powers to the then Executive who were in a position of far greater responsibility and who justified the powers they asked for.</P>
    <P>People may say that the present Government introducing a Bill such as this are in the position of a schoolmaster who punishes the pupil for having learned his lessons just too well.  Well, that in itself is an adequate reason for ample, full and frank information to be furnished by the Government on the points I have asked.  It would be distinctly unfair to either Government Deputy or Opposition Deputy to ask him to subscribe <Col N="1332" /> to the support of a Bill such as this if there was no real danger somewhere now or danger in the future. Just as Deputies should justify their action here, Deputies are entitled to be put in the position of justifying their actions outside.  There was no case made for this Bill beyond the request, &ldquo;Give us the powers because we want them.&rdquo;  That request the Government probably knew in advance would be granted, but because of the generosity of the grant that generosity should be met by a much fuller, a much more comprehensive and a much more detailed statement before the Bill is finally voted on.</P>

      <P>The Bill as it stands means that in order to become qualified for a grant a house would not only have to be completed before the 1st April, 1939, but would have to be begun before the 1st June, 1938.  That leaves a period of ten months.  My submission is that a house that is begun in September, and completed in April, is as good as a house begun in May.  In view of the fact that the Minister is stopping grants finally to urban building by the 1st April, 1939, it does seem quite unnecessary to put down this period of ten months before that date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I observe that the Minister is moving an amendment to delete &ldquo;June&rdquo; and make the beginning date the 1st September.  If that amendment is accepted it means that a house completed by the 1st April, 1939, must have been begun more than seven months before that date in order to qualify for the grant.  I submit that is putting in a piece of red tape, or green tape, or at any rate something that is really unnecessary.  It means that if the building of a house is begun on the 28th August and completed by the following 1st of April it is going to get a grant, but that if begun on the 2nd September it is not.  I know a company in the City of Dublin which is doing a very valuable thing at the present time by building a large number of houses for renting.  Anybody who is engaged in that work in the City of Dublin is rendering to the city a very great social service.  The corporation is supplying a certain number of houses, but only a fraction of the houses that there is a demand for.  You have a class of person who is able to <Col N="1334" /> buy a house but will not if he can get one to rent.  You have also a very important section of the community who cannot get a house except they can get one to rent.  The number of houses that can be got to rent is very limited. It is most desirable, if houses can be built in five months, that we would encourage the machinery for building to speed itself up so that houses may be begun and finished inside five months.  The suggestion in the Minister's amendment is that people who are speedy in doing their work have to be penalised in one way or another.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider my amendment favourably even as against his own.  If my amendment is accepted it will take out June and put in no block as to the time the building of a house is begun.  The Minister has complete control over the situation because he can deny a grant to a house, even though it is completed from the builder's point of view by the 1st April, except he is satisfied in every respect that the house is satisfactorily finished and is worthy of a grant.  I submit that if a house is begun by the end of September, or even the beginning of October and is satisfactorily completed by the end of March, and particularly by a company that has been rendering a considerable amount of service in the way of building houses for renting, that all that should weigh very strongly with the Minister, and that no red tape, or green tape, considerations about the beginning or finishing dates should be allowed, especially in view of the fact that the Minister is now winding up the whole question of grants for urban houses.  I plead with the Minister to accept my amendment as against his own.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that I cannot accept the amendment. I have listened to appeals made here in the House if not by Deputy Mulcahy then by a number of his colleagues, and as a result of them I have brought in this amending Bill. The appeals made to me have come principally from the Opposition Benches, and as a result of them I <Col N="1335" /> have extended considerably the period over which grants will be made.  As a result of the appeals made to me on the Second Reading of this Bill I have agreed to still further extend the time, and I want to say now that I do not propose to go beyond the month of September set out in my amendment.</P>
      <P>During the past couple of years it was announced very clearly by me in this House&mdash;I did it more than once or twice&mdash;that these urban grants would cease.  Therefore, good notice was given to everybody concerned.  We have twice extended the period, so that nobody building a house in the last 12 or 18 months can come forward now and say that they had any notion that grants in urban areas would be available, certainly not in Dublin, beyond the period that was originally fixed.  These companies&mdash;the Deputy referred to one, and possibly I know the same company that he has in mind &mdash;and other companies have come to me and asked me to extend the date.  One company said that the amendment I had already brought this Bill in to get implementation for was of no value and, though it did mean a considerable amount of money to that company, money they did not expect, they of course asked for more. Perhaps it is the usual policy.  Other companies that build a great deal more houses said they were thankful for what they got, thankful to get money they did not expect to get, but they would like to get more, of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considering the notice that was given more than two years ago, and considering the extensions that have been granted in this Bill and previously, and the date originally fixed for the cessation of these grants in urban areas, I think we have done well by these companies.  As regards the houses the Deputy says could be built if June were eliminated and no date put in, these people are building the houses.  Some of them have projected the houses, some are building the houses and some of them are almost completed, but none of them had an expectation of getting a shilling grant of this kind.  It is practically throwing money away, and there is no necessity for such <Col N="1336" /> generosity by the Dáil at the taxpayers' expense.  These houses that were contemplated have been built, or are in course of construction, on the understanding that no grant was available. They are getting a lot of money now that they never thought they would get, and they should be well satisfied.</P>

With your permission, perhaps we will be allowed to review them all.  The Minister, in reply to Deputy Mulcahy, would not agree.  I take it that apparently he is not prepared to give the same facilities in the urban areas as he has extended to the rural.  That is what one of Deputy Dockrell's and of my amendments amounts to.  Can the Minister not see his way to concede that?  Deputy Mulcahy then suggested having the 1st June as the commencing date varied to the 1st September.  Is not that the position? <Col N="1337" /> I suggest this to the Minister.  Would he not accept, by way of amendment, a house started before 1st October, or on or before 30th September, and go to the end of September instead of the beginning, and let the limit of the 30th April stand?</P>

I would suggest to the Minister that in the case of any houses started before 1st October, no matter when they are completed, he ought to extend the grant.  I do not see any point at all in fixing the 1st September.  It is better than the 1st June, I admit, but I think the Minister should amend this sub-section to read like this.  Instead of the 1st June he should put in the 1st October, or alternatively, on or before 30th September, and let all the rest in the section stand.  It is only changing it by a month.  Will the Minister accept that?  I think from the attitude the Minister has taken up, which I regret, all the amendments that are here can go by the board if the Minister will accept the 1st October instead of the 1st September.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a certain amount of doubt in the house-building industry as to what exactly the situation is going to be with regard to grants, rates remission, and so on, and the fact that the Minister said, when dealing with the Second Reading of the Bill, that he proposed introducing a Housing Bill in the autumn, seems to have carried over the same type of uncertainty in the building industry in the City of Dublin as to some extent existed previously.  I should like to ask the Minister to be as clear as possible as to what his future intentions are.  This section as it stands means that there will be no grants given in urban towns for houses not completed before the 1st April.  After the 1st April, 1939, we have no expectation, as far as this Bill goes, of any grants for houses built in urban districts with the exception as I understand of grants to certain public utility societies building flats of some kind or another.  If there is any idea in the Minister's mind that he might change that position under the Housing Bill to be introduced in the autumn, I think it would be most desirable if he gave some indication to the building industry as to what his intentions are.  If his intention is not to give grants in future for houses built in urban districts, then I think it would be useful at any rate to the building industry to be told that definitely now, so that builders could look to their future plans with some kind of a clear mind.  In addition to that, I should like the Minister to tell us clearly the circumstances in which grants are going to be continued to persons building flats in urban districts, and whether there is any intention of extending these concessions to persons who will be building houses for renting in urban districts or in large centres like Dublin and Cork.</P>

      <P>To a certain extent, I can clear the Deputy's mind, and the mind of anybody else interested, by saying, as I said the other day, that I expect a Bill will be necessary in the autumn.  If so, it will be a Bill to ask the Dáil to give further financial assistance to carry out the present policy on housing as set out in the 1932 Act, and the other Acts which have been brought in each year since to implement it financially.  There is one change in the policy outlined in the Act of 1932, and that is with respect to grants in urban areas.  These grants have been withdrawn.  They have been withdrawn, as I said earlier, speaking on these amendments, after due notice had been given.  There were so many requests to me to extend the time that the time has been extended now on two occasions, but, so far as I can speak now, without having even the draft heads of a Bill submitted to the Government, as is the usual procedure before a Bill is brought in here, there is no present intention to restore the grants in urban areas.  That is the position.  The other grants, as set out in the Act of 1932 and in the Acts which have been introduced each year since to implement that Principal Act, will continue to be available.</P>

That is my intention, but, as Deputy Mulcahy will appreciate, before any Bill is brought in here, its principles have to be submitted to the Government. It might happen that the Government would decide to make further changes.  I cannot say anything on that, but as the housing policy stands at present, my intention, at any rate, is to continue that housing policy as outlined in the Act of 1932 and the supplementary Acts passed since to implement it financially.  My intention is to continue that policy minus the one item in regard to grants in urban areas. The other grants will be continued.</P>

      <P>I must, at the outset of my remarks, congratulate the Minister for Justice on the magnificent <i>volte-face</i> he has made with regard to this Bill.  I heard from the Minister sentiments with which I entirely agree. As far as his general propositions were concerned, I entirely agreed with them. When he said that it was the duty of the State to preserve order; when he said that, since it was open to persons to vote, and by their votes elect their representatives if they were strong enough, they had no moral right or legal justification in making an appeal to arms, I agreed with him.  I was very glad to hear that.  It is perfectly sound, because what is it but a paraphrase of speeches I myself made again and again from the bench in which the Minister is seated?  I am glad he has been converted.  I am glad he has come completely round to my point of view. I am glad that those principles which <Col N="1343" /> when enunciated by me, he and all the members of his Party thundered against, are now accepted as right, sound political doctrine by our converts.</P>
      <P>It is an interesting thing to cast, even for a moment or two, one's mind back a few years.  It is an interesting thing to consider how, when we introduced it in this House, Article 2A was received.  It is an interesting thing to remember how the Minister for Finance, who is not now in his place, wanted to know who was wearing &ldquo;the mask of Castlereagh.&rdquo;  The Minister for Finance&mdash;Deputy MacEntee, as he then was&mdash;talked of the &ldquo;baying of the bloodhounds.&rdquo;  He was quoting Shelley and I am merely paraphrasing.  If the Minister for Finance was then right, who is now wearing the &ldquo;mask of Castlereagh?&rdquo; Has the Minister for Finance, if he was then right, been driven out of this House by the baying of what he politely called the bloodhounds, his colleagues in the Executive Council?  To-night I heard Deputy Norton read extract after extract from the speeches of an Taoiseach, and from the speeches of the Minister and from the speeches of other members of the Executive Council.  If what they said were then true, it would be true to-day. They say it is not true.  They say to-day that what they said in 1931 is not true, and they have their very words cast in their teeth by Deputy Norton.  Evenhanded justice commends the ingredients of their poisoned chalice to their own lips.  All the vitriol that they then poured upon us, all the bitter attacks that they made against us, were perfectly unjustified, perfectly wrong, but not one single one of them has had the moral courage to get up in this House and state that simple obvious fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is indeed true that this Bill is not quite the same as Article 2A, but in many ways this Bill is more severe than was Article 2A of the Constitution. There is a good deal in this Bill which was taken out of Article 2A of the Constitution and put into the ordinary normal law&mdash;things which never should be there.  I want to make clear to the House again, as I <Col N="1344" /> made clear several times years ago, what our attitude towards Article 2A was.  We never loved Article 2A.  We never thought it was a desirable thing. We always thought that the jury system was the right way to try every prisoner, and we clung on to that jury system as long as ever we could cling on to it.  It was not until we were spurred along by the force of necessity that we deserted the jury system. Indeed it would be more correct to say that it was not we, it was not this House, it was not any legislation in fact that took away the right to trial by jury from a certain class of persons in this country.  Those persons themselves took away the right to trial by jury.  They themselves took away the right to trial by jury when they made the exercise of the right to trial by jury impossible.  They took away the right to trial by jury when they murdered jurymen, and when they intimidated other jurymen. It was they and not we who were the real and true authors of the taking away of the right to trial by jury in certain classes of cases.  We never liked to do it.  We said so again and again, but we had to do it or fail in the duty which was imposed upon us by every principle of civil and moral law when we took up the reins of office and assumed the Government of this State.</P>
    <P>It was rather interesting when the Minister for Defence intervened with an interruption in the course of this debate.  When Deputy O'Sullivan pointed out the great defects in this Bill, the Minister said: &ldquo;Oh, but it is in Article 2A.&rdquo;  What is the view of the Minister for Defence now?  That Article 2A is the consummation of all wisdom, and that nobody can ever criticise any single thing which is in Article 2A.  I will deal with his interruption, because be made a statement which is entirely inaccurate in fact. I will deal with that a little later on. Let us take this Bill as it stands.  Will the Minister inform us what is the reason for putting in abnormal with normal legislation?  I want to know that.  What is the reason and what is the excuse for bringing in things out of Article 2A and putting them into the normal everyday law of this State? <Col N="1345" /> The Minister made a most astonishing statement.  He said something like this, that the first four parts, as in the Treasonable.  Offences Act of 1925, made provision by ordinary legislation for the preservation of the liberty of the people, and that those were precautions taken by every State to preserve itself.  Does the Minister stand over that?  When I consider what is in the first four parts of this Bill, and when I hear the Minister state that they contain nothing except the precautions taken by every civilised State to preserve the liberty of its people, I wonder very much if the Minister has been consulted in the drawing up of this Bill.  I wonder very much if the Minister has even read this Bill, because nobody who has read this Bill could possibly say that there is nothing in the first four parts of it which is not to be found in the ordinary legislation of every civilised State.  I consider that for practical purposes Great Britain is a civilised country.  I consider that they, by their common-sense, have worked out a system of Party Government and set an example of Party Government to every State in the world, but I do think the finest achievement of British common-sense has been the evolving of British common law, altered on occasions by Statute.  I want to know and I ask the Minister to point out, as a parallel for those provisions, any single thing in British law, or any single thing that is in the common law of this country, or anything except Article 2A, now repealed, that is the law to-day in this country.</P>
    <P>I will take a few of those extraordinary provisions in the first part of this Bill.  I will take Section 8, sub-section (1), certainly the most extraordinary provision I have ever seen in any Statute, and certainly a provision which you will find neither in the common law nor in any Statute which was passed by Great Britain, if that is, according to the Minister, a civilised country.  It certainly never was the law here, and I do not believe that there is any country in the world, except Nazi Germany, in which sub-section (1) of Section 8 can find its parallel.  I will read it to the House: <Col N="1346" /></P>
    <P>Every person who shall commit any act of violence&mdash;</P>
    <P>I pause there, Sir, to say it is &ldquo;any act of violence&rdquo;, it is not &rdquo;any act of unlawful violence.&rdquo;  It is any act of violence of any kind&mdash;</P>
    <P>against or of interference with a member of a lawfully established military or police force (whether such member is or is not on duty) or shall take away, injure, or otherwise interfere with the arms or equipment, or any part of the arms or equipment of any such member shall be guilty of a misdemeanour and shall be liable on conviction thereof to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.</P>
    <P>Now, what is the plain meaning of that section?  It allows any policeman who likes, whether in uniform or not in uniform, it allows any soldier who likes, whether in uniform or not in uniform, let me say to strike a civilian, but if the civilian strikes back in self-defence he is liable to two years' imprisonment.</P>
    <P>There is nothing about political motives.  If you interfere with a soldier or with one of the Volunteers, or if a neighbour has a row with them on a farm, and that it has nothing to do with politics, the penalty is two years. There is no answer, no law, no defence. If a person uses violences or interferes in the smallest way with a soldier or a policeman, even if it is not connected with the discharge of their duties, that person is liable to a sentence of two years.  Why is the word &ldquo;lawful&rdquo; left out?  Why has the Minister deliberately left that word out?  It appears in every Statute.  Why is it left out of this particular section?  It is not even a mistake in drafting.  Any interference with a soldier, justifiable or unjustifiable, whether done in pursuance of any right, or not done in pursuance of a right by any person, is liable to punishment by imprisonment for two years.  Will the Minister tell the House in what State a precaution of that nature is taken to preserve itself, except in this State?</P>
    <P>We now come to the powers which are given in Section 27.  Remember this is normal law.  This section allows the stoppage of a person by a Guard on <Col N="1347" /> suspicion.  It allows that person to be removed to a police station, and to be kept there for 48 hours, and then, under certain circumstances, to be remanded for 48 hours, although there is not a scintilla of evidence against him.  Words equivalent to that were in Article 2A and they were abused. The power was abused.  The Minister knows that.  I protested again and again in this House against the abuse of this power by Guards.  It is very nice to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Whenever a person is arrested under this section, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  Such person shall be removed to a convenient station of the Gárda Síochána:</P>
    <P>(b) such person may be detained for a period of 48 hours in the Gárda Síochána station to which he is so removed.</P>
    <P>How did that work out in practice. A man is arrested on suspicion because he was suspected of &ldquo;having committed or being about to commit or being or having been concerned in the commission of an offence under any section or sub-section of this Act or an offence which is for the time being a scheduled offence for the purposes of Part V of this Act...&rdquo; What happened in fact? A man was arrested, was kept in for 48 hours, and then released.  He had not walked five yards from the barrack gate until he was rearrested and kept in for 48 hours.  In one instance which I brought before the House, and which I condemned as strongly as I could, a man was kept a whole month in custody, being released for five minutes, and then a new period of 48 hours started.  That is what happened to the knowledge of the Minister, because I denounced it in the House, and yet exactly the same thing is reproduced here, and not reproduced as a matter of emergency legislation, but as a matter of ordinary every-day legislation. The Minister knew about the abuses.  I drew his attention to them. They are not abuses that, I believe, he would venture to stand over, yet he re-enacts a section of wider application than under Article 2A, knowing <Col N="1348" /> it has been abused in the past, and therefore knowing for a certainty that it will be so abused in the future.  If that is not his wish, why is it not stated that no man shall be arrested more than once a month on suspicion by a Guard? What I think would be much fairer would be to say that a man shall not be arrested more than once a year, and detained for 48 hours or for 8 days, as the case may be, on mere suspicion by a Guard.  Putting in 48 hours has, in fact, proved in practice perfectly nugatory, and yet the Minister is deliberately silent about it.  In what countries in the world does a similar provision exist?  Take Section 24, a very interesting section, which deals with the holding of public meetings.  It says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>It shall not be lawful to hold a public meeting which disturbs public order or causes or leads to a breach of the peace.</P>
    <P>It is not that the object of the holders of the meeting was to create a breach of the peace, it is that the meeting has, in fact, created a breach of the peace. That takes away from the ordinary political parties the right of freedom of speech.  Let me give the House an example of what I mean.  I was present at a meeting in Ballina.  I addressed that meeting and Deputy Dillon and other Deputies also addressed it.  That meeting was one at which there was a very grave breach of the peace.  At that meeting the police drew a cordon and behind the cordon there was collected a very large number of stone-throwers and, under police protection, those stone-throwers proceeded to disturb the peace, injuring several persons in the crowd.  It was only by luck that the speakers or some other persons on the platform were not injured, as some of the stones lighted on the platform.  What do I find under this Bill?  I held a meeting which led to a breach of the peace.  I did so, because I was not to be intimidated, as I think no member of this House could allow himself to be intimidated from holding a meeting.  I held a meeting and it led to a breach of the peace.  Suppose this Act were in force, what position would I create? Under Section 24, sub-section (5), every person who organises or holds or attempts <Col N="1349" /> to organise or hold a public meeting the holding of which is a contravention of this section, or who takes part or is concerned in the organising or the holding of any such meeting shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding £50 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three months or to both such fine and such imprisonment.  I held a meeting which was in contravention of this section because, not ten, but I suppose 200 or 300 fellows were flinging stones at the meeting and most certainly disturbing the peace and, therefore, I, by holding that meeting, was liable, if this Bill were law, to a fine of £50 and three months in jail because I refused to give up my common law right and constitutional right of addressing the people of this country or the people of my own constituency.  Where, might I ask, does the Minister find any section like that in the legislation of any country?</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the Minister for Defence enter the House.  The Minister for Defence made an interruption on this and said this is only Article 2A again, Article 2A being the sum of all wisdom, according to the Minister for Defence, and as soon as something is found in Article 2A the last thing in its favour has been said, according to the Minister for Defence.  But let us see if this is in Article 2A.  Take Article 2A The section dealing with the holding of public meetings provides: &ldquo;Whenever it appears to the Executive Council that the holding of public meetings in or in the vicinity of any particular building or any particular road or street is likely to lead to a breach of the peace or to be prejudicial to the maintenance of law and order, the Executive Council may issue a proclamation prohibiting the holding in or within a specified area (including such building, road, or street and not extending more than one mile therefrom) during a specified period (not exceeding three month).&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is very interesting, because, of course, under Section 24 of this Bill, sub-section (3), it is whenever an officer of the Gárda Síochána, not <Col N="1350" /> below the rank of chief superintendent, wishes to proclaim a meeting, he can proclaim a meeting off his own bat. So, whether the Government or a superintendent of the Gárda Síochána are given the same powers, the Minister for Defence would say it is exactly the same thing.  In other words, the wisdom and the discretion of, let me say, the least able chief superintendent of the Gárda Síochána is, according to the argument put forward by the Minister for Defence, just as good a judgment and just as good an exercise of ability as the exercise of the judgment and ability of the whole Government.  There is no difference, in the mind of the Minister, whether power is given to a chief superintendent or given to the Government or any member of the Government. And, besides, that particular section deals with the preventing of a meeting being held in a specified place and within a mile of a specified place.  It does not prevent the holding of a meeting anywhere, and, above all things, it does not make that meeting subsequently illegal by the holders thereof and by the people who addressed it by the action of persons over whom they have no control, persons who are there deliberately to break them up.</P>
    <P>Where in God's earth, in any State, civilised or uncivilised, or any section of any statute on any Statute Book the world wide over, can one man or body of men make another man a criminal without the knowledge and against the wishes of the man himself? And where on earth can a body of enemies of an individual make that individual liable to a fine of a very large amount and liable to a term of substantial imprisonment though he himself has done nothing wrong?  There are many other things, Sir, in this Bill which satisfy me, at any rate, that the Minister ought to take out every single one of what I will call the &ldquo;executive&rdquo; sections in the earlier part of this measure&mdash;the first four parts.  Let him, if he wishes, put them all into the latter two parts.  Let them not come into force unless there was proclamation.  I do not really care, as far as I personally am concerned, what he makes <Col N="1351" /> offences, but I object to these powers he gives to the Guards.  For instance, a Guard goes into a witness box and says: &ldquo;I believe so and so,&rdquo; and that is evidence, though he knows nothing about it, and a man can be convicted on a statement of that nature, under this statute, unless he gets into the witness box&mdash;which he is not by law bound to do&mdash;and proceeds to deny it.</P>
    <P>Where is that to be found anywhere? The proper and only correct course, I am satisfied, for the Minister to take is to separate the normal legislation from the abnormal legislation.  Do not confuse and do not run in together your normal and your abnormal legislation. It is a wrong thing to do.  Do not run them in together.  Keep your normal legislation by itself.  Put your abnormal legislation, which the disturbed times require, by itself and hope that the day will sometime come when, finally, the supremacy of the law will be established in this country and there will be no need for abnormal legislation.  As long as there is need for abnormal legislation, and certainly, as far as I am concerned, when a Minister in this House states, on behalf of the Government, that he cannot guarantee the supremacy of the law and the security of the lives and property of the people who live within this State, when he states that on his authority as a member of the Government and with the knowledge which he must have from various sources, especially from the Guards and from the Secret Service, I, certainly, will not be one to withhold from him those necessary powers; but let him keep his necessary abnormal powers in a groove by themselves.  What on earth is the reason for running the two together? Why put them in the same Statute? Why make them things of the same nature?  Why hand down to future generations the idea that Article 2A and this Bill, which is the successor of Article 2A, are things to be considered as quite ordinary?  Let the Minister tear out of this Bill everything except what he is satisfied can only be brought in by proclamation when the Government are satisfied that a state of emergency is required.  Why bring in all these things from abnormal <Col N="1352" /> law into normal law?  We are willing to support the Minister.  He knows that we must hate things like this.  Why will be not meet us and take them out? Why did he ever put them in?  He must have known that our objection to things of this nature must be there.</P>
    <P>I have said that I will accept what I understand to be the definite statement from the Minister, that these abnormal laws are required now because there are indications that the present peaceful condition of the country will not continue, unless there are abnormal powers, and I am willing to give him those abnormal powers, in so far as my vote is concerned; but I should like to know from the Minister, who tells us that there are armed bodies who are training, organising and getting funds from outside, how he has dealt with these persons up to the present.  Has there been any effort, when men were found drilling, to prosecute them for drilling?  They need not be brought before a jury. They can be tried before a District Justice, and they have been.</P>
    <P>Has there been any effort made to search for the arms?  Has there been any finding of arms?  I should very much like to know if there has been any genuine search for arms, any genuine endeavour to discover where the dumps are?  I think it is a matter we most certainly should be told.  I should gladly hear from the Minister that reports which have been widely circulated that arms were missing from military barracks are not true, and I should like a further confirmation of that from the Minister for Defence.  I should be glad if he would tell me if the arms in the barracks from which it is said that arms have been stolen, or are missing, have been checked and found right, because it would allay a good deal of uneasy feeling in the country.</P>

      <P>And the Minister for Defence will not?  Well, I am sorry.  I must draw my own conclusion from that refusal to answer.  I am very sorry to have to draw the conclusion which I am driven to draw.  I can draw only one conclusion&mdash;that they have been taken and that the Minister for Justice or the Guards have not been told.  That is a conclusion I do not want to draw, and it is a conclusion which I do not want the country to draw, and I wish the Minister for Defence would definitely deny it.</P>
      <P>I stand completely and entirely behind this Bill, so far as it asserts the principle that abnormal legislation is necessary for abnormal times, so far as it asserts the principle that the State must be supreme, that the State must protect itself and must protect its citizens, and that it would be wanting in its duty if it did not follow that course.  We, on these benches, ever since this State was established, have stood for law, for the supremacy of the law and for the crushing down of lawlessness, no matter what form it took.  The doctrine was announced, and always faithfully adhered to, that we would have no peace with crime, and we never have, and, please God, we never will have.  If the ordinary law is not sufficient to keep down crime, then, I agree that abnormal legislation is required, and, as I said, I am willing to accept the statement of the Minister that the Government cannot carry on without legislation of this kind, but I do press as strongly as I can upon the House that, if abnormal legislation is necessary at present, and I will assume that it is, this is not the time, nor ever could there be a time, when the bringing in of abnormal legislation should be made the excuse to prostitute normal criminal procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is for that reason that, though I approve of the Bill in so far as it gives the State power to deal with crime with which it could not otherwise deal, I am thoroughly opposed to what it contains, in so far as it gives abnormal power in normal times to Guard or to soldier, or gives the right to suppress public meeting to police officers.  Surely the two can be segregated?  Surely you can put in one Bill your abnormal <Col N="1354" /> legislation and let us have it.  If you want it, take it.  You say that you are afraid of what will come, if you do not get it.  So far as I am concerned, take it, but do not mix it up with the normal law.  Do not make the present necessities an excuse for prostituting the normal law and giving powers which should not be given in normal times. It is a simple thing to do.  Why not do it?  I think it would be far wiser&mdash; far, far wiser&mdash;that the Government did so, but if you claim to be allowed to give abnormal powers to Guards&mdash; powers of suppressing meeting, interfering with the Press and with publications of various kinds&mdash;if you give all those powers in normal times, then you have brought in a Bill that ought not to have been brought in, and a Bill that, in my humble opinion, could not be justified, and I would ask you to think it over.</P>
    <P>After all, as our leader said, the liberty of the subject is a great and precious thing.  There are not very many States in the world now in which the ordinary individual has got his complete freedom as he used to have a few years ago.  There are very few States indeed in the world at the present moment in which a man has got the right, without interference, to follow out his own good in his own way, which was the normal definition of liberty. We have that right in this State here, and let us regard it and recognise what a precious thing it is.  Let us keep it in mind.  If, under stress of abnormal circumstances, we have, as we have had to do in the past and as we have to do to-day, to fall away from that great ideal, let us not keep away from it all the time, and let us not, just because there may be a case to-day for falling away from that ideal, make a stalking-horse of it behind which you can filch away the ordinary liberty in ordinary times of the ordinary citizen of this State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to give some of the reasons that I have for opposing this Bill.  I claim to have a good knowledge of the conditions prevailing in Cork City and for a good distance outside the city, and I must admit that I never remember Cork City and its suburbs to have been more peaceful <Col N="1355" /> than has been the case in the last couple of years.  I have been reading the clauses of this Bill, and it appears to me that the powers sought in some of these clauses are very far-reaching. I fear that if this Bill will do anything, when passed, it will enkindle all the old bitternesses that existed in the city and country eight or ten years ago. I am quite satisfied that the Guards and the military to-day are accepted by the people with the best of goodwill. I find people amusing themselves at all hours in the evenings and coming home late in the mornings, and yet we have had hardly a single report of any irregularities taking place in the city.  I have also talked to men who have made sacrifices for this country, and they have expressed themselves as being very definitely opposed to these Bills, and particularly to the one under discussion now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite satisfied that the conditions existing to-day bear no comparison at all to the conditions that prevailed in 1925 or 1931.  I have a certain amount of experience of meeting members of the old I.R.A., and even of knowing some of the few youths who are rather impetuous at the moment, and I want to say to the Minister for Justice that, as far as the people of Cork are concerned&mdash;and I think I am interpreting their minds correctly&mdash; they do not take these proclamations, to which the Minister has referred, seriously, and if there are other reasons, of which we have not been informed, behind the introduction of these Bills, I think we have a right to be told these reasons.  I have good reason to know also that during the period in which those other measures were in operation we found that the presence of the Guard or of the secret service men at meetings was rather more of a disturbing element than otherwise.  Their presence was more of a disturbing element than an influence for good, and, as one who has had some knowledge of dealing with men in groups and at public meetings, I may say that we often had to speak to officers of the Guards and people who were responsible for order, and tell them that we would guarantee that their absence from a meeting <Col N="1356" /> would be much more helpful than their presence at the meeting.  That was due to the fact that a good many of the law-abiding citizens did resent being treated in that manner.</P>
    <P>Another objection that I have to the introduction of this measure is that the Government in Northern Ireland have stated that they see no reason for any change in the law as it is at present administered in the North, and that they consider that the measures they have at present for the preservation of law and order are quite sufficient. Then, across the water, where undoubtedly there is some reason for the authorities to be somewhat alarmed, we find that they are quite satisfied that the law they have there at the moment is quite sufficient to meet the abnormal situation there.  I am quite satisfied&mdash; and I say this as a man with responsibility&mdash;that the present law of this Government is quite sufficient to deal with any disturbing elements in this country.  For that reason, I am very definitely opposed to the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that there is no need at all for this panicky Bill.  From what the Minister has said, I believe he made a very weak case.  If this Bill shows anything, it shows up the policy of the Taoiseach in the past when he was going around this country, from 1928 to 1932, and holding his big rallies in College Green, when his cry was: &ldquo;Give us power and we will remove the Oath and remove the King, and then perfect peace will prevail in this country.&rdquo;  When the Taoiseach got his power he removed the Oath and he put the King under cover, and now to-day he tells us that he has not secured peace or ordered Government and that there is danger from within.  Well, it is like many of his false promises, and we see him to-day in the light in which the people, perhaps, should have seen him ten years ago.  We see him in the light of a false prophet, and perhaps the people will realise that he has been a false prophet all along.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe, myself, that this false and panicky legislation is being brought in because a few bombs were let off in England.  We are all sorry that bombs should be let off in England or in any <Col N="1357" /> other country to disturb the peace, but the British Government are able to deal with any disturbances that take place in their country, without bringing in panicky legislation, and I hold that we should let England alone to look after her own affairs just in the same way as we have called upon her to let us alone to look after our affairs.  Of course, the point will be made that the Cosgrave Government, in their day, brought in a Coercion Bill.</P>
    <P>I quite agree that they did bring in a strong Bill, but I also assert that at the time the Cosgrave Administration brought in their Coercion Bill they had to deal with murder, assassination, gun bullies and armed robbers of all sorts. We were then dealing with a situation in which the present Government&mdash;then called the Opposition&mdash;were out on the hills, and when they would not recognise this Parliament of ours.  That was the kind of situation we had to deal with.  In 1923 or 1924, the Taoiseach, when he was beaten in the civil war, said to his forces: &ldquo;Dump your arms, but keep your powder dry&rdquo;.  There was a great difference between his action then, when he was defeated in the civil war, and the action of Padraig Pearse in 1916, who, when he found he was defeated and that unconditional surrender was the order of the day, surrendered unconditionally.  He did not tell his followers to dump their arms and keep their powder dry.  But the present Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the present Taoiseach had told his followers at that period to hand up their arms&mdash;that they were beaten in the field and that they should try to win from within what they could not win from without&mdash;there would be no need for Coercion Acts at all and the ordinary law would be the law of the day and would be quite sufficient for the carrying on of lawful Government.  When the present Government came into power in 1932, however, they did one of the most foolish acts that any Government ever did.  They shouted aloud that they would open the prison gates to all and sundry, and then, when they got into <Col N="1358" /> power, the present Minister for Defence took his bunch of keys and marched up to all the jails and opened their gates wide to all types of people.  We were told that these people were patriots, but the Government knew that behind these people they had armed bullies, murderers and assassins, and men whose hands were stained with blood, and I say that it was the duty of the Taoiseach to keep these people in until they gave a definite declaration that they would not be a menace to the people of this country and that the lives of the plain people of this country would not be in danger from any of these people.</P>
      <P>But no, they got their unconditional release.  Not alone that, but they were feasted and pampered and boosted all over the City of Dublin and made great patriots.  These are the patriots who to-day are turning on the Taoiseach and his Party, and who are disturbing this country; some of them pink, and some of them pretty red, ripe and ready to do whatever they can, if they can get away with it.  If this Government had enforced law and order in those years we would not have so much trouble to-day.  But, if an unfortunate Civic Guard, or a Superintendent, or any man appointed to maintain the peace did his duty fearlessly, what was the result?  If he was stationed in the Midlands he was removed to Limbo or to Connaught, or to somewhere else. If he happened to have a few stripes on his arm, they were immediately removed.  The Taoiseach must take responsibility for every action of these people to-day.  He, and he alone, is responsible for the position that has been created.  He must take that responsibility, and the country must place that responsibility on him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told, of course, that this Bill must be brought in, that there is immediate danger.  I travel all over the country, as other Deputies do, and I have met no Deputy yet who said there is danger, or even a semblance of danger.  I mix with all types of the old Republican Army, and have attended their conventions week after week, all over the country.  I know every one of these men, and they belong to various Parties.  There is not one of <Col N="1359" /> them who in his heart stands for the overthrow of the State by force of arms.  They are the people from whom we should take a lead.  They are the people who established law and order here, and who gave us this Parliament. They say they are not out for destroying this Parliament by force of arms. They may have a more advanced national outlook than this House has. I do not agree that they should not have that outlook.  I believe that the national outlook they have is the correct one.  If we in this House kept before us more a clean, healthy, Irish national outlook we would not be where we are to-day&mdash;looked down upon by the masses of the people.</P>
    <P>We were sent here to do something worth doing for the people&mdash;to give them peace, prosperity, and national reunion.  Have we given them any of these things?  We have not.  We are told that we have not peace to-day. We know that the people have not prosperity.  We know that the people who sent us here are down in the mud, and this House is putting them down in the mud.  We know that we have not national reunion, and there is not any Party in this House making a genuine attempt to bring us national reunion. We know why it is not taking place.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach was the national leader we are told he is, it would be his duty to look to the three Parties in this House, bring together the Leaders of these Parties, and say to them: &ldquo;If we are going to have national unity in our lifetime, it must come from a united nation&rdquo;.  But he does not want to do that, and he will not do it.  He sends a few of his puppets around this country.  Not alone is he doing that here, but he is sending them over to England during the week-ends for dirty, mean, Party propaganda; propaganda which will keep our country asunder for a hundred years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the things which are causing panic in the country to-day.  The Taoiseach should stop this, because it is an eyesore, especially to the old Republican Army, to find <Col N="1360" /> Party politics being carried on in the Six Counties, the Twenty-Six Counties and in England.  If you want to make a genuine effort to unite the old forces why do you not do it in a clean way by standing up in this House and asking us to co-operate in the one way that will bring about unity, and that is, united action?  Let us put up from this House a clean, healthy programme and stand by the word and letter of it.  If we do, we will make a national advance, appeasing our people, and keep them out of the hands of those who, perhaps, are bullies and low-down traitors&mdash;those who want to seize power by force.  We have handed over to these people the privilege and the right which should have been the privilege and right of this House&mdash;to lead the national advance.  We are stepping into the rear and allowing them to step to the front.  It is time for us to step to the front and shove those people out of the way and give a clean, healthy, national lead.  If you do that, this House will have behind it a united, prosperous people.  At present our people are down, and their spirits are down.  The national outlook is very black.  That is because of the want of a lead.  If a lead is given by the Taoiseach or a strong man in this country the people will harken to that lead and forget all the prejudices and differences of the past, and we will begin to step forward like manly men for the raising up of our people and the reuniting of our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that if this Bill is passed it will not achieve the object which the Taoiseach has in mind.  He told us himself that the Coercion Act passed by Deputy Cosgrave would fling him out of power.  Perhaps it was more or less that which flung him out of power. Of course, if the present Coercion Bill was lucky enough to fling the present Government out of power it would be worth having.  Because I have a more or less advanced national outlook, I feel that I could not vote for this Bill. Although I am one of those who made sacrifices in the past, and who is prepared to make sacrifices in the future, I do not want to be one of the type that is going to create more disunion in the country.  If we had the firm, honest, and fearless Government which <Col N="1361" /> we should have, if our laws were enforced, if our police forces could feel that they had authority to deal with any people whom they thought should be dealt with, the country would be a model for the world.  But to-day it seems to be the seed bed for revolutions, not alone in this country but across the sea.  It is sad to think that an Irish Government allowed these things to go on and that our Army and police force had to stand by while such things were taking place.  A few years ago there was open drilling all over the country.  If you met a superintendent or sergeant in the Civic Guard he would tell you on the quiet that he knew these things were going on, that men were carrying arms all over the country, that there were plots everywhere, but if he did his duty he knew he would lose his job.  Therefore, he thought it better to do nothing.  That is the type of government we had and that we have to-day.</P>
    <P>I believe that the real idea of this Bill is to stop the national re-union which has been taking place during the last six months.  There are strong forces in this country thinking and working for the re-union of the people and who are prepared to make a clean, national advance.  The Taoiseach knows that.  I know he is a proud, vain man who does not want the lead taken out of his hands.  He would rather bring the country down than take second place to another man. Whether he likes it or not, he will take second place, because he has been in power for seven years and he has broken and ruined the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach certainly should.  If there is one speech on the Public Safety Bill in this House to which the Taoiseach should listen, and for which he should wait, it is mine.  But, unlike the Taoiseach, when he was in opposition, I am not going to run away from my responsibilities. I have no love for this Bill.  I had no love for the Public Safety Bill introduced in 1931.  But I am taking the attitude to-day that I took then, and that is that if a responsible Minister of the Government, freely elected by the people of this country, comes in here and tells the national Parliament, and tells me, that he requires those particular powers to preserve law and order and uphold the institutions of the State, then I am going to vote for that Bill.  The difference between the Taoiseach and myself is that I have not changed.  The wheel has not turned. Let me remind the House, and the Front Bench opposite, as they have already been reminded, that there was a much greater cause and a much more urgent necessity for the Bill of 1931 than there is for the Bill now before the House.  I have listened to many speeches here to-day.  I followed very closely every word uttered by the Minister for Justice, speaking on behalf of the Government of the country.  He stated to this House that there were certain forces in this country engaged in work which, if not checked&mdash;and which could not be checked in the absence of the powers for which he now asks&mdash;would lead to chaos and anarchy in the country.  No responsible Deputy of this House should refuse those powers in the face of that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is my position.  I have heard Deputy Norton saying here that there was not a shred of justification for this Bill.  If the responsible Minister tells <Col N="1363" /> us that in the considered opinion of the Government this measure is necessary and essential in order to preserve the institutions of the State, and to preserve law and order, surely that is enough.  Deputy Norton said he wanted to see the citizen in the enjoyment of his full rights and liberties.  So do I. The Deputy said the situation was so peaceful that there was no necessity for the Bill.  Deputy Hickey, the Lord Mayor of Cork, said there was no comparison to-day with the conditions that existed in 1931.  I am very glad that conditions to-day are not as bad as they were in 1931.  But bad and all as the conditions were in 1931, there is no change in the attitude of the Labour Party to-day as compared with their attitude in 1931.</P>
    <P>If there is a difference between the Labour Party and the Government of to-day it is that even after 17 years the Government apparently have learned some sense of responsibility whilst my late colleagues have not learned it even yet.  I want to put this frankly and I put it on a former occasion&mdash;I put this question to Deputy Norton and the Labour Party&mdash;if they were sitting on the Government Benches to-morrow charged with the Government of this country and if they were faced with a situation which called for extraordinary powers to deal with and safeguard the rights of the people, and to safeguard law and order and the institutions of the State, would they not take whatever steps were necessary however drastic those steps may be? That is the position.  The Taoiseach might remember that I would be very glad to spend a good deal of my time in rubbing the noses of the gentlemen opposite for the many things they said in the last ten years.  I could do that if I liked but for many reasons I do not want to do it.  I do not think this is the time for it.  I think this is too serious a matter to be treated from any side of the House in that way.</P>
    <P>Every Deputy should weigh well every word he utters on this Bill.  It is a matter of life or death not only in connection with the people against whom this Bill is aimed but to the ordinary decent citizens of the country. <Col N="1364" /> When we talk about the constitutional rights of the people of this country, when we talk about the people being allowed to enjoy their full liberty we ought to remember that that cuts every way.  We ought to remember that the people who pursue their ordinary avocations, the people summoned as jurors to do national work and to stand up to their responsibilities as citizens are equally entitled to their full rights and liberties.  I have no intention whatever of making a long speech on this Bill.  I regret there is a necessity to introduce it.  If I wanted to I could say a great deal as to what has led up to the state of affairs that has rendered this Bill necessary; how that condition of things could be stopped and why it should never have arisen.  But all that is going to do no good.  I certainly say I could not take the responsibility of voting against this measure in view of the statement of the Minister for Justice that these powers are necessary to prevent a state of chaos and anarchy being brought about in this country.  That is a statement coming from a responsible Minister who is in a position to have information that is not at my disposal or at the disposal of the ordinary member of this House or of the public.  It is on his statement that my decision was made and it is because of that statement that I am going to vote for this Bill.</P>

Anything said by Deputy Morrissey has not the least effect in changing the attitude of the Labour Party.  I rather admire his childlike simplicity in accepting without any hesitation from the Ministerial Benches their arguments and their justification for introducing this Bill.  He told us that that statement coming from the Minister for Justice was reason enough why the House and country must accept it.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, of course, the right of the Government to have the evidence which actuated them in introducing this measure.  They are the Government, but we as Deputies who are living in the country can claim to be completely conversant with the condition of affairs obtaining.  We fail to see any evidence.  At all events, no evidence has been placed before the House that would warrant or justify the introduction of this measure at this time.  We feel that its introduction at this juncture cannot be expected to act, so to speak, as oil on troubled waters.  On the contrary, we think the effect of it will be to act as an irritant on peaceful waters. The peaceful conditions that prevail in the country at this time cannot be challenged.  They are such that every citizen can go about his business and transact it without let or hindrance.</P>
      <P>We have had experience here in the recent and, indeed, in the distant past that the introduction of legislation of this type has tended to be irksome, and to create the very troubles that its authors thought it would tend to suppress.  Members of the House outside the Government Party and the ordinary citizen can see no justification whatever for the introduction of this Bill, especially in view of the present peaceful state of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we look across the water we see that there have been some disturbances there in recent times.  These did <Col N="1367" /> not cause the Government of that country to get into a state of fright, or stampede it into the introduction of legislation such as this.  The offences committed there did not cause it to depart from the usual constitutional practice.  Instead, the offences were treated under the ordinary law.  In this country, where no such offences have been committed, the Government rush off in a fright to get this legislation passed into law.  As I have already said, the effect of it, in my opinion, will be irksome and troublesome and will tend to create disaffection.</P>
    <P>What is this legislation going to lead to?  The passing of it through this House is one thing, but when it comes to be operated we may find that it will be utilised for much greater and deeper purposes than now appear on the surface.  We on these benches are concerned to know how it will be operated in the case of those who devote themselves to the work of the upliftment of the worker, the raising of his standard of living.  It is specifically mentioned in the Bill that anyone who incites or encourages any person employed in any capacity by the State to refuse, neglect or omit to perform his duty, or to be negligent or insubordinate in the performance of his duty, or who aids or abets or conspires with another person to do any such thing shall be guilty of an offence under the Act.  That definitely covers people engaged in Civil Service avocations. I wonder does it cover a servant of the State working on a relief grant without any contribution from the local rates?  Are people working on those schemes servants of the State?  We from these benches have been advocating for the people working on such schemes a higher and a more reasonable standard of living than that which they now enjoy.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact we have a motion on the Order Paper asking the Government to give them better conditions. Suppose that we go out to the country districts and engage in advocacy of their claims and ask them to refrain from performing the relief work they are engaged on, is this section going <Col N="1368" /> to be invoked against people in the trade union movement who try to uplift the worker and secure for him better conditions than he enjoys at present?  I wonder how is that section dealing with State employees to be operated?  I imagine that it is a section that can be given a very wide interpretation.  I do not propose to say more on it to-night because I think that it can be more usefully dealt with on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I remember away back in 1927 when a similar measure to this was being put through the Dáil that the Labour Party asked for certain guarantees and exemptions for certain societies and trade unions.  Deputy Cosgrave, who was then President, told us not to worry: that while very wide powers were being taken they would not dream of using them against the societies and trades unions referred to.  He refused to give the guarantees and exemptions asked.  As regards this measure, why should this Government, if it does not intend to utilise this measure for any purpose other than the suppression of actual revolt and disturbance, take such wide powers as would make it impossible for those in the trade union movement to do their work of uplifting the worker, of raising the standard of living amongst the workers&mdash;those employed by the State as well as those in private employment.</P>
    <P>Processions and public meetings are all capable of being banned under this Bill.  For instance, a meeting convened in the Mansion House to talk about anti-vivisection or for any other purpose equally remote from rebellion and revolt may be banned under the section.  If an officer of the Gárdaí is of opinion that such a meeting will disturb public order or lead to a breach of the peace, then <i>ipso facto</i> that anti-vivisection or other harmless meeting is caught by the section, and if the promoters persist in going on with it, they render themselves liable to the penalties laid down in the section.  You can have that sort of thing so far as the suppression of public meetings is concerned.</P>
    <P>We do not think that the present peaceful condition of the country warrants or justifies the Government in going ahead with this measure.  We <Col N="1369" /> all remember how the members of the present Government denounced a measure of this kind when it was introduced by their predecessors.  They said that it would only cause disturbance and lead to turmoil amongst the citizens.  We have not been taken by the Government into its confidence as to what really is at the back of this measure.  I agree that we are not entitled to be told all their secrets, but surely we ought to be given some indication, some intimation that it is not going to be used for oppressive purposes.  We on these benches opposed measures of this kind in 1925, 1927, and in 1931, and we have not changed our minds in the meantime. We are opposing this Bill as we opposed the others.  We are not as guileless as Deputy Morrissey is&mdash;that because a Minister says that he wants a coercion measure of this kind that you must hand it out to him on a plate. The Minister has given no reasons for the introduction of this Bill, and, therefore, in our opinion he should not get it.  We are living in the country amongst the people.  We know what the conditions there are.  We are not going around with our heads buried in the sand.  As no evidence has been put forward to justify its introduction, we on these benches have decided to vote against this Bill as we have voted against every coercion measure that has been introduced in this House.</P>

      <P>Some of the previous speakers made the remark that there were no speakers on this Bill from the back benches on this side.  I propose to be one, but for a rather peculiar reason.  I am not a fighting man by any means.  I never had anything to do with it.  Any fights that I have been in I got the worst of them.  That does not encourage one to get into more of them.  Very probably I should be the one man on these benches to hold his tongue, because I am surrounded by a good many fighting men who gave proof of their love of their country years ago.  I gave no such proof.  My way was a different way.  On a Sabbath Day a few weeks ago I was going along the streets and read a proclamation.  I read it six times.  I did so because I had to read it under <Col N="1370" /> difficulties, since the proclamation was torn.  It was knocked about a bit, and I did not like to take out a piece of paper in the street to write down what it contained.  That would cause too much public attention, and I am a man who shrinks from public attention.  I do not like to be speaking here to-night.  I read that proclamation. The proclamation is signed by six or seven men.  These are honest men. They mean what they have written, and what they have printed.  That is my opinion of them.  But the worst feature in that type of honest man is this: that he will not give other honest men the right to disagree with him.  That right I claim.  I am going to give my reasons here in connection with that.  I protest that their proclamation should not be accepted by the people.  They use the name of Almighty God in it.  That is an example of their seriousness.  I say they have no right to use the Almighty's name in it.  There are certain moral reasons given, I think, by Canon Law.  I do not presume to have very much knowledge of it.</P>

Please leave me alone now, because I am on a very serious subject &mdash;to me it is a very serious subject. Canon Law lays down certain reasons whereby revolutionary methods are moral and right, and one of the reasons is that the government in power is a tyrannical government.  That is one of the reasons, and without that reason there can be no moral claim for any revolutionary object.  Would anybody outside a lunatic asylum say that that body of men sitting there is composed of tyrants?  No one would.  Almost every speech to-night was a political speech directed against the Taoiseach, and all he said and did ten or 12 years ago.  All speeches were of that type with the exception of that made by Deputy Morrissey.  He was the only decent man who spoke to-night.</P>

      <P>I think sometimes just as the feeling comes over me.  Sitting here you have to think very desperately indeed.  I heard the Lord Mayor of Cork a few moments ago speaking about the loyalty and good behaviour of the law-abiding citizens of his native city.  He is very proud of them.  Why should he not be?  But I wonder was he merely expressing what the Cork men always were?  I wonder did he ever hear of a writer named Max O'Rell?  Max O'Rell was a Frenchman who wrote travel books and he visited Ireland, and he visited Cork.  On his visit to Cork he got on an outside car and drove around the heights of Cork and the jarvey said to him, pointing away in the distance: &ldquo;Do you see that city&rdquo; or &ldquo;that town&rdquo;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Max O'Neill.  Then the jarvey said to him: &ldquo;There are ten thousand men in that town ready to die for Ireland.&rdquo; And Max O'Rell said: &ldquo;Why do they not do it?&rdquo; The jarvey answered: &ldquo;The police would not let them.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I expect they are law abiding still.  Having made one claim, at any rate, in connection with this proclamation, there is another portion of it with which I have to deal.  It said that they stood by the Republic of 1916, ratified by the First Dáil, which met, I think, on 29th January, 1919.  That just put me in another vein of thinking. I was present at the ratification which the proclamation alludes to.  I do not know whether any Deputy present to-night is in the same position&mdash; I cannot recall.  But I did discharge a duty which was given to me that day of reading the Democratic Programme of Dáil Eireann.  I have it in my pocket.  I did not come here to-night to make a speech, but I always come prepared to do so if the necessity arises. The Democratic Programme of Dáil Eireann was given to me to read in English; it had already been read in Irish and, I think, in French.  It is this:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We declare in the words of the Irish Republican Proclamation the <Col N="1372" /> right of the people of Ireland to the ownership of Ireland, and to the unfettered control of Irish destinies to be indefeasible, and in the language of our first President, Pádraig Mac Phiarais, we declare that the Nation's sovereignty extends not only to all men and women of the Nation, but to all its material possessions, the Nation's soil and all its resources, all the wealth and all the wealth-producing process within the Nation, and with him we reaffirm that all right to private property must be subordinated to the public right and welfare.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We declare that we desire our country to be ruled in accordance with the principles of Liberty, Equality, and Justice, for all, which alone can secure permanence of Government in the willing adhesion of the people.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Very well, I will not proceed with the reading of it.  We will leave it out, but I will speak about it.  I read that and I meant every word of it.  There is no lipreading with me.  We have it stated there that there shall be no child suffering from hunger or cold, that there shall be work for everybody, a decent means of livelihood, and that there should be no slums.  I read that; that is a long time ago.  Some men over there to-day were honest about that and some were not, and those that were not prevailed.  The democratic programme got no fair do for years, but I never let it out of my head because I always believed I was morally bound to do everything possible to try to bring it about and it was not until this Government got into power that any effort was made to bring that document to fruition.  These men have tried their best&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They have not failed. They have tried their best with the means and possibilities at their disposal. They have helped the poor and the infirm.  They have tried by every means in their power to carry out that great democratic programme.  I assert that without fear of contradiction and I decline to help in any way men or women who are now trying to upset and drive that Government out of power.  That is my reason for speaking.  I read that programme many years ago and I bow in honour to it.  I am glad to be able to assert that to-night to let everybody know the reason why I am taking part in the not very pleasant job of supporting a Bill which imposes force on some of our citizens.  I hope that God Almighty will give these men wisdom and that they will not try to bring <Col N="1374" /> about a state of affairs here something akin to that which we have witnessed for the last two or three years in a great old kingdom in Europe.  The horrors of it are terrible to contemplate. Surely, they will cease their activities.  I have given them credit for the honesty of their convictions.  I believe they are good Irishmen but why should they go against the majority of Irishmen who believe in the leadership of the Taoiseach and his Ministers?  For what reason should they?  If these Ministers make mistakes they are only human; these mistakes will not interfere with life or property.  If they do not carry out their work as these people think they should, well they are doing their best. If other people think that they can do better, there are ways and means of getting into power other than by the gun.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to say much more. I do not suppose there is any necessity for it.  I have given the reasons why I am supporting this Bill.  I do not think that any other member of the Party behind me should speak.  Most of the time of the House is taken up by the people opposite and if we started to get the itch for talking, we would never finish our work.  I humbly suggest that one speaker from these benches is enough for the people to-night.</P>

Unfortunately, the vitriol did not go outside; the vitriol remained here. I have taken up probably more than ten or 15 minutes of the time of the House, quite long enough, but I feel that I have discharged my duty.  I shall be ready to say to the people outside: &ldquo;Stick to the man at the wheel; do not renage him now.&rdquo;  I shall tell the people that, in my opinion, <Col N="1375" /> undoubtedly within the next few years this democratic programme of Dáil Eireann which was read out in January, 1919, will be put into practice in every way possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not convinced of the necessity for this Bill at present. In fact, I do not see sufficient evidence in the statement of the Minister that there is really any reason for the Bill. If there was any necessity for such a Bill, certainly I believe the Party on this side of the House would give every help, but for the past three weeks, during which it has been before the people, I think it has been proved that there is really no necessity for it.  It is about three weeks ago since we heard overnight from the Press that this Bill was to be introduced.  There has been no crime committed in the country during that period, not one.  As one Deputy who has been in this House for a number of years, I can say that I supported a similar Bill wholeheartedly in 1931, and I would be prepared to do the same thing to-day if I were convinced that the same kind of terror, or anything even approaching it, existed to-day as existed in 1931.  Why did I support the Bill in 1931?  Because there was really a campaign of murder in this country.  The Government in 1931 had to deal with that campaign, but when the new Government came in, in 1932, the first thing they did was to open the prison gates and let every murderer out of it.  Now, they are getting their thanks for that.  If there is anyone responsible for such a Bill, or if there is anybody responsible for such trouble as exists at the present day, it is the Ministers opposite who released the murderers, and I would say the murderers in 1939 are the murderers of 1931.  The Government have got to face up to that; it is just as good for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1931 you thought you could buy them over but you did not buy them over.  Now, you see the fruits of your policy.  If you had followed in the steps of the Government before you, certainly I believe there would be no need for this Bill at the present day. If you intended to put down these crimes, you would have introduced <Col N="1376" /> such a Bill when Mr. Somerville was murdered in Cork and when Mr. More O'Ferrall was murdered in Longford. You had a right then to deal with the situation, but you brought cases of regular murder in this country before jurors who were afraid of their lives. The very same men for whom you opened the prison gates, and whom the Minister for Defence took in his arms, are the men who murdered Mr. Somerville and Mr. More O'Ferrall.</P>

      <P>The Deputy must know that those who were liberated on the occasion referred to can be identified.  It is unfair to accuse identifiable persons of having committed murder.  Persons were tried for that murder and acquitted. It is unjust, under the protection of this House, to accuse defenceless people of committing murder.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>What I want to bring out is that there was some necessity for a Bill such as this at that time or that there was a necessity for the continuation of the Act previously in force.  The murder campaign in this country was not finished.  There was then a necessity for continuation of the Act and if that Act were continued, instead of liberating these prisoners, those men in the ordinary way would be tried before a military tribunal instead of before a jury.  If that Act were continued, there would be no uproar at the present time in the country about this Bill.  If people in this country are supposed to be connected with the crimes committed in England, I know that, as far as I am concerned, I see none of these I.R.A. activities in the West of Ireland.  I do not think the few individuals who are going from this country to England at the present time have the ability to carry out such crimes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should like to hear more from the Minister as regards this country being connected with these crimes.  If we look back to the years before 1920, when we had a good deal of trouble in this country, it would have been to our benefit if we could at that time carry the war to English ground instead of <Col N="1377" /> having it fought out on Irish ground. We must admit that we were not able to do that.  We had the members of the I.R.A. at that time fighting England in this country.  We should like to have information from the Government which is piloting this Bill through the House as to those who left this country to carry out the war in England.  If there is any proof that men of I.R.A. associations have left this country to carry out the war in another country, the Minister should be prepared to give us some information about it.</P>

      <P>The point I am trying to bring out is: We had a war to fight from 1916 to 1921.  We made every effort&mdash;members of the House will agree with me&mdash;to bring the war to the enemy's territory.  We failed to do so. It has been carried there now, when we have no disagreement whatever with that country.  That is the point I want to bring out&mdash;how we are in this particular war with England when we have no disagreement with them.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Bill itself, I am concerned with the liberty of the ordinary citizen.  I am a citizen of this State and I remember very well when the last Act was put into operation by the present Government.  I happened to be a director of the Blueshirt organisation in the West.  I am not a bit ashamed of it, in fact I am very proud of it, for the reason that we beat the hooligans for whom Fianna Fáil were responsible without any guns at all.</P>

      <P>Under that Act, I was followed high up and low down through the west of Ireland.  I was searched on a few occasions and my house was searched.  I got permission to carry a revolver about 12 months previously. That gun was taken from me and I was deprived of every means to defend myself as a public representative.  To my own knowledge, supporters of the Party opposite were left with guns.  Is that how this Bill is going to be worked?  Is it proposed to deprive one section of the people of their liberty and give licence to another section that support the Government, as Fianna Fáil supported the hooliganism that went on in 1932 and 1933 when the Gárda Síochána were afraid to carry out their duties.  Let the Minister tell us the trouble that is before the country.  I do not know to whom the credit should be given&mdash;I suppose it is to the people themselves and not to the Government&mdash;but all the members of the Fianna Fáil Party will admit that we never had a more peaceful country than during the past two years.  Jurors have not been interfered with for one and a half or two years in the exercise of their duties.  The law has been carried out.  Every person in the country has been able to go about his business in the ordinary way.  In County Galway we had a by-election in 1935 and another in 1936, a general election in 1937 and a general election in 1938.  A number of Fianna Fáil Deputies were down there and I ask them to say if they ever experienced quieter elections.  I believe there is no necessity for the Bill in this country and the Government should have regard to this country and to this country alone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

      <P>The objection taken to this Bill is that there is no necessity for it; that we are living in a time of <Col N="1379" /> peace, and that the introduction of a Bill of this sort causes uneasiness and may lead to disturbance.  References have been made during the course of the evening to what we said on other occasions, and to the conditions that obtained then.  I am going simply to say this, that I held, when I was on the opposite benches, that there were barriers and obstacles to people who wanted&mdash;and rightly wanted&mdash;to see the Irish people supreme in their own land. I said: The way to get peace is to remove these obstacles; take away any barriers and any tests and make it possible for any group with political ideals to go freely before the people, put their policy to them and try to win the majority of the people to their side; when you provide that freedom, you will remove the necessity for the giving of extraordinary powers to the Executive.</P>
      <P>I was told by people who were on these benches that I was wrong.  Since we came into office, step by step we did certain things to remove certain obstacles.  We were taunted and told we were wrong, and that we would find we were wrong.  I did not believe it. I believed that there was in this country a proper spirit of democracy which, when given free opportunity, would be satisfied, and that it was because of the particular circumstances in which we were that people were driven to the use of force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have never been more satisfied or happier about the situation than I have been for the last couple of years. I felt that what I had said and what I had prophesied had come true; that the moment we had got a Constitution freely accepted by the Irish people themselves in a free plebiscite, and the moment we had got a Government elected or selected by representatives of the people who were freely chosen, all the difficulties which we had here in the past would disappear.  When I come before the House and ask that the powers asked for in this Bill be given, I am sure everybody will realise that I come here with regret, with genuine regret.  I have held that we could make no progress in this country <Col N="1380" /> without some unity of direction, that there must be some unified authority here, and that that authority must have powers to enable it to be exercised for the good of the people as a whole.  I hope that the discussion which has taken place here in this House will be continued throughout the country, and that our people will set themselves to think, and ask themselves do they want to see a continuation of the situation we are in, or do they want to see that situation deteriorate.  If there is discussion throughout the country as to the duties and the rights of an Assembly like this, it will be all to the good, because unfortunately at the present moment there appears to be a great deal of confused thinking.</P>
    <P>When the Constitution was passing through this House, and being discussed here, certain powers were taken in it.  When those powers were being taken, we adverted to the possibility that the hopes which I had expressed would prove vain, that they would not be realised, and that the Executive might need to have some of the powers which even this Executive, this Government, found it had to exercise during its period of office.  We have been reminded here this evening that when we came into office one of our first acts was to put out of force Article 2A, that we released a number of people who had been imprisoned or detained under that Article.  Just as it is with regret that we have to introduce a Bill of this kind here at the present time, so it was with regret that we, who had opposed that measure, who had believed that it was unnecessary, had ourselves, in order to maintain order, actually to use that measure.  I believe, and I have said it in connection with the other Bill, that, as certainly as I am standing here, if we did not have those powers there would have been chaos in the country after a very short time, because we had all the elements here of a fierce civil conflict which, if the Government was not able to control it, was going to get out of hand, and the Government was going to be pushed aside.  One thing was inevitable then, and that was that either of those two sides would establish its supremacy by force, and would have been compelled to maintain it by force, <Col N="1381" /> and the liberties that we desire to have here would have been affected for many a long day.  We have come through a civil war.  It has taken hard work to try and get out of the atmosphere of that war.  We have, thank God, largely got out of it, and we are asking here for the powers which we think may be necessary&mdash;I hope they will not&mdash;in order to preserve that condition.</P>
    <P>I want you to look at the Bill.  Just as I said in the case of the Treason Bill, that was necessary in a new set of circumstances.  We want completely to dissociate treason as it was known in this country in the past from what treason will be in the future.  We want to associate any idea of treason in the future in this country not with acts against a foreign government or a foreign power, but with acts against the people of this country, because it is the people of this part&mdash;I must be accurate&mdash;of the country at the present time who are sovereign here, and none other.  We have functioned here by the power which we have been nominated by them to exercise.  Now, we had to bring in that Bill at the same time. It was on the stocks, so to speak, from the time at which the Constitution was passed.  It was under consideration. It was brought in as a separate measure here, separated from the other, to be made as simple as possible, and to deal only with treason as defined in the Constitution.  So much for the Treason Bill.</P>
    <P>Now, on the passage of the Constitution, the powers of defending the State depended on other Acts which also had their roots in a past situation.  There is a difference of opinion about that situation.  We, on both sides of the House, have fought bitterly about the situation.  It is well that in future we should not use those Acts as they stood with their roots in a past situation, and therefore, again from the time that the Constitution was put into operation, it became necessary to reconsider the whole position of the law by which the forces that preserve the State and order could operate.  There had, therefore, to be a consideration of those past Acts.  What were the powers that were necessary?</P>
    <P>What were the powers that were <Col N="1382" /> necessary, not merely in the past but at any time?  What powers were necessary for the future?  The present Bill was intended, in a certain sense, to be a consolidation of any powers which were available for the forces that maintained the State, and to be available for them in the future.  If you look at the Bill you will see that it is composed, I might say, of two main parts. One part is a consolidation of what might be called ordinary legislation, such as would be available in any country under normal and peaceful conditions for the protection of the State.  It has been urged by the Opposition that a number of provisions in that part of the Bill are dangerous to the liberty of the individual.  We have an open mind.  There is no hurry. We can debate this Bill quietly, with a view to having the best possible set of laws which, on the one hand, will give the greatest amount of rightful liberty to the individual and, on the other hand, will not deprive the responsible authority of the power of dealing with abuses of liberty.  That is our problem. We can discuss every line of it on the Committee Stage, and I would hope, in the discussion of this Bill, for the same sort of attitude which I had hoped for when discussing the Constitution. I suggested at that time that if those who are on the Government Benches would only imagine themselves in Opposition, and if those on the Opposition Benches would, for the time being, imagine themselves a Government, we would, probably, have the best sort of attitude with regard to the Constitution.  I say now, in regard to this Bill, that those who are in office naturally feel their responsibilities. Perhaps they feel them too much.  They may be more anxious about them than the situation warrants, but those in office, who have responsibilities, are inclined to try to get powers to preserve the authority which they feel is necessary for peaceful conditions.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, those who are in Opposition are thinking of those who are in office for the time being, as people likely to abuse the powers which they get, and as people who must be checked.  I am not saying that it is not right that that point of <Col N="1383" /> view should be taken by the Opposition, but I ask the Opposition, and Deputies on our benches too, to look at the problem as calmly and as coldly as they can, so that when we are finished with that part of the Bill we can say: &ldquo;Now we have a measure which is the result of our combined work, and represents the maximum amount of liberty that can safely be given without danger of abuse, and if there is abuse there are powers to deal with it.&rdquo;  I say that that part of the Bill would have been necessary in any case, if we wanted to uproot our law from the past, and to set its roots in what, I think, the House will agree is likely to prove the foundation on which we can get the greatest amount of agreement in this House and in the country.  I agree with the Opposition that, in regard to a Bill of this kind, it is of tremendous importance that the people of the country should be convinced that it is right, and that the Executive are in no way acting in a panicky or foolish fashion, but are acting calmly and deliberately, with a full knowledge of the whole situation, and that the measures they are taking are measures which commend themselves to the ordinary person who loves his country, and who also claims that he has the right to live his life in his own way, if he is a good citizen.  That is the attitude I ask the House to adopt towards this part of the Bill.  I say in advance that any amendments put down by the Opposition, from the point of view of trying to secure greater liberty for the individual, or to prevent any attacks on that liberty by forces of the State, provided they do not deprive the Executive of powers which may be necessary to it in order that peace may be maintained, will be considered.</P>
    <P>With regard to the other part of the Bill, I think I should deal with some suggestion that there has been a difference of opinion in the Government with regard to it.  There has been no such difference.  There seems to have been some misunderstanding of a phrase used by the Minister when introducing the Bill.  What the Minister clearly conveyed to me was this, that when the Constitution was being passed we adverted to the possibility of special <Col N="1384" /> courts being required to meet conditions in which the ordinary courts could not properly function.  There was a suggestion here as to whether it was fair to jurors to put them on cases when, perhaps, if they acted in accordance with their conscience and the evidence, their lives might be in danger, or they would otherwise suffer severely. Shortly after the Constitution was enacted it became obvious that we might, at short notice, at any time, have to bring in a measure of this kind, giving powers to the Executive, and just as the Departments were told to consider the question of the law with regard to treason; and the law with regard to treasonable offences, and their relation to the new situation created by the Constitution, so also were they asked to consider, if an emergency should arise that would need special courts, what sort of legislation should be introduced to the Dáil to deal with it.  That also was, so to speak, on the stocks, and under consideration.</P>
    <P>Obviously, as the Minister stated, if you think that there might be need for such a measure you have to ask yourself this question: &ldquo;When should you introduce it?  Should you introduce it and leave it there as a power to be availed of whenever the need should arise, and have it calmly dealt with as a provisional power, or should you wait until the public was fully and completely convinced that a measure of that sort was necessary?&rdquo; In other words, are you to act in advance of a situation, or are you to wait until the people, by having crimes committed, are convinced that such legislation is necessary?  Is the dog to have his first bite?  That was the situation, and in it you have to decide when exactly will you introduce a measure of this sort.</P>
    <P>If you had hope that you would not have to introduce it at all, of course, you would be in a happy position and it could go on the long finger.  The natural tendency is to put off and postpone bringing in a measure of this sort. But, it is a very serious responsibility for a Government to find that all the powers which it needs to preserve order are not available for it, and we, because of these proclamations and the situation that everybody knows is <Col N="1385" /> being developed, came to the conclusion that we could not afford to wait and that it was our duty to get the powers now for the Government so that, if swift action was necessary, the Government could act swiftly.  What you are asked in this Bill is to give power to the Government, on proclamation, to bring these special courts into operation.  They do not come into operation automatically by the passing of this Bill.  The responsibility for bringing the special court into operation rests with the Government, and the Government, of course, is responsible to this House.  If the Government should bring the courts into operation when the majority of the members of this House think that they should not be brought into operation, they can deal with the Government. So that, the question that the Dáil is asked to decide is this: Are you going to give the Government this power to be able to bring in these special courts when they who, more than any other members of the House, are responsible for the country and for the preservation of order, think they are necessary? Are you going to give them the power of bringing in these courts when, in their opinion, they are necessary, and when they give due notice of it by proclamation, and when it is possible for the Dáil to sit in judgment upon them and to reserve their action if a majority think it is desirable or that that action has been unjustly or unwisely taken?</P>
    <P>Members of the Dáil will have to ask themselves whether the Government, sitting here, elected by the people, responsible to the people, under the control of the majority of the elected representative here, as we are, are to be depended upon in this matter or whether some group or other, who take different views of things from those which we take, are to be depended upon.  That is what it comes to&mdash; whether you are going to depend upon us, who are anxious to keep the peace, or whether you are to depend upon people who admit no responsibility to the majority of the Irish people, who have not been recently elected by them, and who have no responsibility to them at all.</P>
    <P>In other words, are you going to <Col N="1386" /> depend, in a matter of this sort, on a responsible authority, or are you not? To me, at any rate, that is the point you will have to decide, with regard to the second part of the Bill, the part dealing with the special courts.  Dealing with that part, you will naturally criticise it from the point of view of the powers which it gives.  If you can think of any amendments which would check the possibility of abuse of these powers by the Government, by all means, put them down.  As far as we are concerned, our attitude must be the attitude I have already indicated. Our attitude must be this: If we are to have the responsibility of preserving order here, and of trying to make progress by the principle that national policy has to be decided by the majority here, and if you are denying us the powers which will enable us to fulfil that responsibility, we will have to say to you, quite definitely, that we will not accept the position.  In other words, you will have to give us, and we will have to demand&mdash;and we will have to ask every member of this House to support us in that demand&mdash; the powers which we think are necessary.</P>
    <P>The next portion deals with a power which is not in the ordinary law, and which is, therefore, an extraordinary power, the power of internment.  The Minister has explained why that power is necessary.  There may be a moral certainty, for example, that certain people are doing certain things, and it may be quite impossible to get evidence of this which would satisfy a court.  What have you to do?  Is the Government, knowing, believing, satisfied, that these things are being done by certain people, and that they are being done to the detriment of the community as a whole, simply to sit back and say: &ldquo;Oh, well, we cannot get evidence.  They will have to be allowed to continue to do these things, although they are to the detriment of the community,&rdquo; or under circumstances of that kind, is the Government, in order to maintain peace and to prevent damage to the community, to be given the powers to enable them to detain the individuals who, they are satisfied, are responsible for these <Col N="1387" /> activities?  Again, you have to choose. You know the facts.  You know that what we say is true, that it can happen, and that it does happen, and you have to ask yourselves are you going to trust the Government that you have here, that you can call to account for their actions, or are you going to allow the damage to be done?</P>
    <P>It seems to me that those are the questions every Deputy will have to decide for himself.  As I say, this is not a bad time at all for us to discuss this Bill.  There is a sufficient reality of threat for everybody to understand that we are not making provision against an altogether unthinkable contingency; that we are making provision against a contingency which may very well arise, and we believe that the chances of its arising will be very much less if we have the powers, in case they are needed, than they would be if they did not have these powers at all.</P>
    <P>You can discuss this Bill in Committee; take whatever is the reasonable time that you require to discuss it for amendments.  You can discuss it calmly.  If we had to come in here when crimes had been committed which demanded immediate action, you would have to give us these powers or else we would have to get out of office, or we would have to allow some other body to rule the State or to control the community.  We would have to come in here and ask you at very short notice to give us these powers.  It is better&mdash;is it not clearly better&mdash;that you should now consider this matter, under circumstances like the present, which, as I say, indicate the threat, sufficiently closely anyhow, to enable us to take a realistic view of the situation we have to deal with?  I hold, therefore, that it is far better, from the point of view of democracy, from the point of view of the rights of the individual members here in the House, to come in here at a time like this and get this matter fully discussed than to come in here in a hurry and have to ask you to pass it through all its Stages in a few hours, and to have to go to the Seanad House and ask them to do the same.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1388" /> As I have said at the start, I regret that it is necessary to come with the second part of this Bill.  The first part, I believe, is necessary.  You may find fault with certain clauses of it, but the first part of this Bill, as well as the Treason Bill, would be necessary as part of the ordinary law.  It corresponds to the law that every organised State has to protect itself and, particularly, democratic States require it.  It is, therefore, as I say, with great regret that I had to come here to ask you to pass the second part of this Bill.  We have here in this part of the country secured a position in which the Government, elected by the Irish people here in this part of Ireland, are, in every single aspect of their activities, sovereign.</P>
    <P>The Legislature here is a sovereign representative assembly and can do anything that any such assembly in the world can do.  You can have any form of Government you want from the legal point of view, from the constitutional point of view, that is, if it is desired to change the Constitution to another form, that can be done.  If there are any Acts, dealing with internal or external matters, that you want to repeal, you can repeal them.  You are truly sovereign in every respect and the Irish people have full, complete and absolute liberty in regard to their affairs.  Every square inch of the territory of this part of Ireland is under the control of the Irish people. There are no commitments, notwithstanding all the suggestions to the contrary, that bind this Government, or would prevent any other Government that might come in here to replace us from having any policy they choose to have, either from the point of view of internal or external affairs.  There is no justification for the use of force in this part of the country.</P>
    <P>With regard to the completion of the national objective, perhaps I may say a word or two, as it has a bearing on the situation in which we find ourselves here.  There can be no progress unless there is some way of determining national policy.  If we try to work half a dozen different schemes or policies at one time, we will be only in each other's way and the result will be national frustration.  If there is to <Col N="1389" /> be force used in future, that force can only be used effectively by the Government which is responsible to this Parliament.  No other body can use force effectively, or can be allowed to use it, in the name of the Government, so long as a Government here exists. The two things are incompatible, impossible and cannot remain together. That is not a new doctrine for me to enunciate.  On an occasion on which what I tried to say was misrepresented, or misunderstood, on 17th March, 1922, I tried to speak to people who were being advised to accept the Treaty, as it was at that time.  It had come to my notice that they had been told that the State which it was then proposed to establish&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will put it in quite a different way.  There was a time in <Col N="1390" /> this country, when there was no government here, when it was possible to work side by side&mdash;with a certain amount of interference one with the other, it is true&mdash;two types of policy. One was what was called the constitutional method and the other the physical force method.  They were both aimed at the one Government, and that Government was affected by both.  The moment that a Government was set up here in this country by the Irish people, responsible to the Irish people and having duties to the Irish people, that double line could not be continued, and if force, after that, had to be used, it had to be used by the Government elected by the Irish people, and by none other.  That is a fact and a truth that nobody can gainsay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>But it was continued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said that I will not go back.  There was, if we want to go into it, a conflict between two groups here with regard to the State, but that is not the type of conflict I am talking about.  It is the prosecution of the further effort that must be made in order to get the whole of the national territory under the control of the Irish people.  We cannot have it two ways.  There is a lot of strange thinking, I know, amongst the people of the country at present, and I want them to try to think of the problem as it is to-day.  The problem to-day is this, that if there is to be a further advance by the Irish people in getting possession of their own, and I hope there will be, that advance must be led by whatever Government is here, and any section of the people who think that other methods than the methods we use should be employed will have to get here by the method of the ballot.  There is no other way out of it, and those who think that there can be merely a puppet Government here are living in a fool's paradise. There cannot.  Whatever Government is elected here will have to maintain the authority which it possesses, and will have to live up to the responsibilities which it assumes when it takes office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We want the people of the country <Col N="1391" /> to realise that and we want the members of the Labour Party to realise it. As they were told, if they were put on these benches and were responsible for the maintenance of the conditions which we have to-day, the ordinary individual having the right to live his own life in his own way, according to the law, and if they wanted to maintain this position, they would, if there was a threat such as the threat which is abroad and the challenge contained in these documents that were read out by the Minister, have to act exactly as we are acting, and they know that they would have to act as we are acting. When we brought down Article 2A, I think the Labour Party supported us.</P>

      <P>I think they did support us.  My recollection is that we were supported, and, I think, rightly supported, by the Labour Party at that time, but what I want to point out to the Labour Party is that they ought not, in dealing with these matters, keep the Party aspect, the political aspect of this question in mind.  They ought to consider the wider aspect of it, and, as members of this House, they ought to try to support its authority.  Whatever might have been said on former occasions, everybody knows now that the Constitution was a Constitution freely adopted by the Irish people, that it is the Irish peoples' Constitution that it is a free and open Constitution and that if they, or any other Party, get a majority, they can come into these benches.  I have said that the Labour Party ought very carefully to consider their attitude on this matter.</P>

      <P>The only reason the Labour Party have given to us, that I have heard, as to why they will not support the Bill is that the country is peaceful.  So it is.  It has been peaceful, in my opinion, because of the pursuit of a certain policy, in taking away obstacles; and at a certain time we had to use these extraordinary powers or else, in my opinion, we would not have had these peaceful conditions. <Col N="1392" /> Are we to come now to face a possible situation in which we would be deprived of all the powers which enabled us to keep order on that occasion?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It repealed Article 2A&mdash;the powers which we had to use here at one time in order to deal with a situation of grave disorder, and in the use of which we were supported at that time by the Labour Party.  Suppose that to-morrow some other such situation should develop, unless these Bills are passed we would not have those powers to deal with such a condition of disorder.  We would not be in the position in which we were then, of being able to sit down as a Government and think over the general situation and come to the conclusion that the way to deal with that situation would be to use the powers that we had.  We have no such powers to-day, and what we are trying to get here is, in view of the threat and the challenge that exist, to have powers which will be available if, unfortunately, the situation should go from one of mere verbal challenge to something else, and it has already gone beyond mere verbal challenge because, as you have been told, citizens of this State were blown up, and you were told also by the Minister that cases containing time-fuse bombs were handed in form our territory into another territory. <Col N="1393" /> If this situation is going to develop, are we going to be here on sufferance, simply dependent on the good will of the people who ignore authority and who attack in every way the institutions here?  Are we to be here merely on the sufferance of such people and dependent absolutely on whether they think it well to attack us or not?  I think that it would be altogether wrong and that it would be an impossible situation, and I believe that a Government that would come here and not seek for the powers that would enable it to deal with a situation like that would be wanting in its duty to the Irish people, and would be worse than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have got here at the present moment a situation which, I think I can say, was beyond the hopes of many of us a few years ago.  We have got to that situation and we believe that the rest of the road can be travelled and that, in our generation, we will be able to see the completion of that work, provided that there is proper direction, and that the people as a whole have an opportunity of deciding what is to be the policy to be adopted.  If the Government here, in face of a threat and a challenge of that sort, were not to come in here and ask for the necessary powers to deal with that position, I think that Government would be faithless to the things that a number of us here have been working for over at least a decade or two.  That is why we have come in here and asked you for these powers.  We are in no hurry. We believe that, if anything should suddenly develop, we could come here to you and ask you to give us the necessary powers swiftly, but we prefer by far that this situation should be dealt with calmly.  We prefer that the people of the country, no matter to what Parties they may belong, should calmly consider this situation and ask themselves whether the time has now come when everybody should stand for the principle that, as there is free, open access to the national Parliament, and free open access to the council which decides national policy, the question of force should be abandoned and that, if force is to be used for the prosecution of the national purpose at any time in the future, it must be directed by those <Col N="1394" /> who have been elected to control by the Irish people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, that is how I understood it, and that is what it comes to at any rate.  So far as Parts V and VI of this measure are concerned, they have been decided long ago so far as this House is concerned. The Minister for Justice has the police records in his hands, and once he comes into this House here, with a sense of responsibility, and says that this country is going towards a condition where there may be a catastrophe, and that the situation is rapidly deteriorating, and that he wants exceptional powers, under those circumstances we can only say: &ldquo;Well, take your exceptional circumstances and the exceptional powers you want, and operate them as swiftly and as ruthlessly as you can.&rdquo; All we can say now, however, is that you appear to have run the full cycle of revolutionary movements as we know of them in history.  Long ago, the various stages of revolutions were described, as when, in the time of the French Revolution, it was pointed out that after passing through one or two stages of a revolution, a third stage is reached when certain people who had used the guillotine were being brought to the guillotine themselves because others had become successful in the meantime, and the revolution was then described as having reached the stage where the crocodile was swallowing its <Col N="1395" /> young.  Well, the Party opposite have reached the stage of revolutionary progress where the crocodile is swallowing its young.  Very well; make a good meal of it&mdash;make a grill of it&mdash;but remember that we, in our time, helped to grill these people for you.  We grilled a lot of these people, and we would have grilled some of you also if you had not changed your tune in the meantime.</P>
      <P>That is the situation, and that is the stage that you have reached, and are you going to be bold about it?  It may be that you will temper justice with a little mercy when you remember that some of these people have been misled by yourselves.  I think that the phrase that was used about these people in 1931 was that they were brave people, but misguided.  If they were misguided, who was it that led them wrong?  Was the situation as clear to the Taoiseach then as it is to-day&mdash;that a physical force movement might be right for certain things, but not for other things? If the situation has deteriorated, we have not been told how it has been allowed to go to that stage, nor have we been told of the seriousness of the situation.  We were told by the Minister for Justice that three people had succeeded in blowing themselves up, but now the Taoiseach, in his speech, puts a different construction on that, and says that some people blew up others.  At any rate, so far as we can gather, three people lost their lives and two proclamations were issued, and for that reason Sections 5 and 6 of the Bill are required.  Very well, if they are required, take them and operate them, and come back here afterwards and say that you have done your duty, and even if we temper our regard for you by saying that it is time you did your duty, you will have done it anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But also remember to be bold and face up to what you are doing.  You are now trying to direct by forceful means into the paths of rectitude people whom you assisted to stray from these paths.  It is meet and proper that you should do it; but we will not go bad on you the way you would have gone bad on us.  From <Col N="1396" /> our experience of government we know what these things mean.  We had our experience of the way it would be discussed if those people there were here &mdash;talking about meeting murder on the way, have a face like Castlereagh&mdash; does the Minister for Finance remember the quotation&mdash;and the bloodhounds of the Executive Council.  We knew that men were going to be put up to do an ugly task; we relied upon them to do it correctly and they did it; and they will do the same for you.</P>
    <P>Let there be no quarrelling about Parts V and VI of this Bill.  So far as they are concerned, if the Taoiseach came here to-morrow and said that he required these Parts, separated from the rest, and made a case for urgency, we would assist the passage of these Parts through the House and you could have them.  We know what attempts to undermine the State mean.  We know what they can go to.  We know the lengths people can go to when not held up and what length they can go to when they are favoured.  We will help you to stop it.  But I do think the House deserves a little bit more in the way of information than the Minister gave this morning.  Proclamations alone do not matter.  There were many proclamations in our time that we took no notice of.  Proclamations themselves might have been let go.  I assume that there is in the background some information which either the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Defence has with regard to arms, what arms there are in the country not under proper authority, whether they are reported to be numerous, whether people are on the move and against whom, whether there are any schemes or plans and against whom?  I am sure all that information must be in somebody's possession and I think the House deserves a little bit more consideration and should get a little bit more information.</P>
    <P>As regards Parts I to IV, including the first thirty sections, this Bill has been discussed as if it was divided rigidly into two compartments.  It is not.  There are a number of phrases in Part IV that relate to offences that do not become offences until Parts V and VI are put into operation.  Parts I to IV are amazing.  Will the Taoiseach <Col N="1397" /> take either of these two tests? Parts I to IV, according to him, are the sort of legislation that any ordinary country should have in the most peaceful times.  It is a pity the Minister for Finance did not delay the visit that he made to Belfast in the autumn of last year.  I should like to see him colloguing with Sir Dawson Bates over Part IV of this legislation, in order to find out whether Sir Dawson Bates would recognise this as legislation which he and his Ministers should introduce in the North as ordinary legislation for peaceful times.  Would the Minister tell us the fruits of that conversation with that Minister on that matter?  That is a test which I think the Government should face up to.  Is that the sort of legislation that we, having certain feelings for certain people in the Six Counties, would like to see operated by the present Government there in peaceful, ordinary times? If so, it will pass with full marks here. Does anybody think it would stand that test?  I will give one other.  This is a filling out of the reservation in the Constitution on the ordinary fundamental rights.  During the last couple of days we have struck a new postage stamp commemorating the 150th anniversary of the institution of the American Constitution.  Will we put one of these stamps on this Bill and send it over to the Americans and say that that is our idea of how fundamental rights and liberties ought to be preserved in peaceful conditions?  I suggest that no comparison with the American Constitution would lead anybody to that course of conduct.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that amendments may be moved.  Do not the whole of the four first sections pivot on the point of unlawful association?  I suggest they do.  I take one quotation from Section 15.  An organisation is declared to be unlawful in paragraph (2) if it &ldquo;engages in, promotes, encourages, or advocates the attainment of any particular object, lawful or unlawful, by violent, criminal, or other unlawful means&rdquo;.  Let me strip that of certain words.  An association is thereby declared to be unlawful if it promotes the attainment of a lawful object by unlawful means other than violence or force of arms.  The moment an organisation <Col N="1398" /> is so declared unlawful, every right guaranteed in the Constitution, with the exception of freedom of conscience, goes.</P>
    <P>You can have arrest and detention, you can have the visits of people, you can have the questioning of folk by members of the Gárda Síochána, you can have their property seized and confiscated. There is a certain county where a certain policy was once favoured by a man who is now a member of the Government.  It is a matter of law at the moment that children should be vaccinated and the County Wexford is notoriously strong against that.  There is an organisation which decides to oppose vaccination, possibly an unlawful organisation&mdash;it certainly is under this measure.  Is there to be the impact of this immense machinery upon any organisation of that sort, and is that for the most peaceful ordinary times under the Constitution?</P>
    <P>There is one further point.  A document is described as an incriminating document, whether it bears a date or not, if it is issued by, or emanates from, or appears to be so issued or emanating from an unlawful association.  If you are caught with such a document there is the whole question of domiciliary visits, arrest, cross-examination, detention, and the possible forfeiture of property.  Is that intended?  It may be that the phrase with regard to an incriminating document has gone too far, but the pivot on which the first four parts of the Bill turn is an unlawful association, and an unlawful association is an organisation which seeks the attainment of any object, whether lawful or unlawful, as long as it is by any type of unlawful means.</P>
    <P>We are told that the Government have not the powers at their command which they require.  They have certainly at this moment the Treasonable Offences Act of 1925 and the Public Safety (Emergency Powers) Act, 1926.  They are obviously law.  They are obviously not against the constitution, because they are being repealed by the Bill. They are law at the moment.  What more is required than is in the Act of 1926 and the Treasonable Offences Act, 1925?  I do not understand what necessity there is for anything further than these Acts.  The Taoiseach told us <Col N="1399" /> that Article 2A was replaced by the Constitution?  Why?  Is it because it was repugnant to the Constitution?  It was not declared by the Constitution to be unconstitutional.  Is it because it was repugnant?</P>

      <P>Article 2A was nothing more than an enlargement of the Act of 1926&mdash;and that Act is still law&mdash;and the Treasonable Offences Act.  I can understand an emergency which requires Parts V and VI of this Bill.  We admit that; we will take that for granted, and grant these parts. Why do we throw in all these other sections which deal with the fundamental liberties and so definitely limit them in circumstances, as described, of most ordinary peaceful conditions? I have referred to the American Constitution. It has stood the test for 150 years.  One of their Articles is this:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech, of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That has stood for 150 years.  A great people, a mixture of people gathered in from all Europe, have that as their Constitution and for 150 years they have retained it.  The Taoiseach never compared that with what he has put into this Bill here.  We have a series of Articles in our Constitution which state fundamental principles and rights.  It has stated them with so many reservations that the rights and liberties have almost disappeared.  The law may change, and if it does change the fundamental rights under the Constitution <Col N="1400" /> are gone.  I ask the President to make a comparison.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the President has not been guilty yet but he may have to sign the Bill.  Now would the Taoiseach compare these documents? I take it for granted that there is acceptance in this House of certain fundamental rights that the people ought to have guaranteed to them, liberty under certain heads.  Matters affecting conscience are not dealt with at all. There are four others.  That one ought to be secured against arrest; that the house one occupies ought not be broken into; that one should have freedom of association and that there should be freedom of the Press, and freedom to speak one's thoughts.  Does the Taoiseach recognise that these four rights are definitely broken by this Bill?  Has he not powers under this Constitution without further law?  Let him read the Articles in the Constitution and let him still consider that the Public Safety Act of 1926 is still law. The Treasonable Offences Act of 1925 is a matter for adjudication by the courts.  The Act of 1926 could only act if brought into operation by proclamation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach think that this Bill dealing with the ordinary law should be brought in without any case being made for it?  Does he think it proper to bring it in here and forget that he has two other pieces of legislation ready to his hand?  I recognise one difficulty.  He has almost indicated the reason why this Bill is brought in here.  He said it is possible to have a situation in which you may not have evidence which would satisfy a court.  What does that mean?  The desire is to remove all this infraction of public rights from the courts and to put it into the hands of the Executive. Is that proper?  I can imagine that it would be proper under certain circumstances. I do not suppose there is a constitution of any length which has in it so many terms and phrases repeated through its pages, such phrases as &ldquo;time of war&rdquo; or &ldquo;of armed rebellion&rdquo;, <Col N="1401" /> as ours has.  There is abundant power in the Constitution itself with regard to those matters.  There is, further, Article 28 in the Constitution, which permits the abrogation of the entire Constitution in certain periods.  And in between those the attempt is now made to sandwich this legislation by practically abolishing the Articles from No. 40 onwards.  There are to be domiciliary visits hereafter. These are to take place when certain members of the Gárdaí &ldquo;are of opinion and suspect&rdquo; that there will be documents belonging to an unlawful association in such premises.  If a member of the Gárda of the rank of Chief Superintendent certifies that, then that house may be visited with everything obnoxious that can follow from that.  If there are people found in that house they may be questioned, and if they do not answer in certain ways they may be arrested and detained or even may be already detained; this is definitely in conflict with the ordinary <i>habeas corpus</i> code. All that can be done on the certificate of a Gárda not below the rank of Chief Superintendent.  Is the right to have one's dwelling preserved from entry, a right which is regarded as being of any substance?  Is that a right that should be lightly taken away?  Is it one that we should in ordinary peaceful times establish?  Is it one that should be broken because the Chief Superintendent of the Gárdaí believes that a document, say of an anti-vaccination type, is to be found in the house?  That is what we are asked here to accept as ordinary law.  Amongst the rights that have been fought for in every country is the right of political association and freedom of speech, and opinion, and especially opinion contrary to the Government of the day.</P>
    <P>Section 24 deals with the prohibition of public meetings.  Section 24 says: &ldquo;It shall not be lawful to hold a public meeting which disturbs public order or causes or leads to a breach of the peace.&rdquo;  There is an amount of case law with regard to a breach of the peace.  What is the meaning of these words &ldquo;disturbance of public order&rdquo;? Is it meant to be something less than a breach of the peace?  Is there some <Col N="1402" /> point which would not come within the ambit of the ordinary case of a breach of the peace?  If so, this is an innovation. It will not be lawful to hold a meeting, if a breach of the peace may be brought about by disturbers.</P>
    <P>If that occurs the meeting will be unlawful and people can be dealt with under the criminal law for holding it. Further, sub-section (3) of this Section 24 lays it down that</P>
    <P>Whenever an officer of the Gárdai Síochána not below the rank of chief superintendent is of opinion that the holding of a particular public meeting about to be or supposed to be held would disturb public order or cause or lead to a breach of the peace...it shall be lawful for such officer by notice given to a person concerned in the holding or organisation of such meeting...to prohibit the holding of such meeting and ... such meeting shall become and be unlawful.</P>
    <P>Let us be distinct on one matter in that connection.  There was a tragic occurrence in Cork which was the subject of a hearing in the courts; the judge of the High Court having found against certain members of the Gárdaí, asked to have the papers sent to the Attorney-General to have these people prosecuted for manslaughter.  That case was brought to the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court upheld the High Court judge but in the course of that case it emerged that one, if not two, of the men in that fracas had been promoted after that shooting and I understand they are still in the Gárda.</P>

      <P>Is not the case of a man of that type so notorious that the Minister would know all about it?  If a member of that force, rapidly promoted for his activities in that direction, is still in the Gárdai he may climb to the rank of chief superintendent. <Col N="1403" /> If a type of Guard like that is going to have it in his power to prohibit the holding of a public meeting, where are the rights and liberties of the citizens?</P>
      <P>In any event, that is what we are faced with with regard to the prohibition of public meetings.  Has it not been clear throughout this country from about 1932, and for about four years afterwards, that most of the meetings held by members of the Party that I belong to were, in fact, accompanied by breaches of the peace, not promoted by ourselves?  Are these meetings to be prohibited?  If a man attends and speaks at any of these meetings does he commit an offence? Is it to be in the power of some person, like those to whom I have referred, to say that a meeting is likely to lead to a breach of the peace or to disturb public order?  Are they to be given power to control the activities of one political Party in a State, and is the sort of legislation that we have introduced here required in the most orderly and peaceful times?  These members of the Guards also have the power to get search warrants.  If there is an offence committed under this Act, it may be that search warrants will be procured in the peculiar ways it is possible under this, and if they are visits may be made by night to people's houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cannot the Taoiseach accept the invitation that I put to him, to put himself in the shoes of some of the people who were about Marsh's yard, and belonged to a certain political organisation?  Would he like to have his house entered with a search warrant that was procured by some of the people who were around Marsh's yard on that day?  Remember, the Government of the time showed their attitude towards those men by retaining them in the Force.  If one man has gone since I would like the Minister to tell us whether he went for anything connected with that episode, or simply in the ordinary way.  But at any rate the Government retained those men in the Force.  That was their attitude towards a certain political Party at that time. That was how they indicated it.  The Guards generally can be trusted, but the records of certain special people <Col N="1404" /> brought into the Guards for a special purpose, and retained after they had, in fact, been criticised as being guilty of manslaughter cannot lead to confidence in any suppression of a public meeting, or in any entry of persons to private residences by members of such a force.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Government, when they are replying on this Bill, to state whether the course that is outlined in Sections 16, 17 and 18 is intentional. As far as I understand the run of the measure, an organisation becomes illegal if it falls within the definition in Section 15.  Thereafter, the Government may, or may not, take a certain step to declare an organisation to be unlawful.  Apparently, if they do declare an organisation to be unlawful, the declaration must be accompanied by what is called a suppression order. If a suppression order is made there is the right of appeal, with regard to the other illegality, to the courts.  Supposing a suppression order is not made, what happens?  Is there any recourse to the judges, or must the matter wait until the Guards have made up their minds that documents belonging to certain organisations, described in the definitions as being unlawful, are in a certain house, and have raided it?  Is there any way of appeal to the courts by an organisation so threatened, although not declared to be unlawful, so that it may get the courts to prevent any of these visits by night by members of the Civic Guards?</P>
    <P>Section 17 of the Bill has to be adverted to.  As far as the ordinary criminal law in this country goes, the scales are weighted in favour of the alleged criminal to the extent if he gets the court to declare he is not guilty the prosecution by the State closes.  In the case of an organisation declared to be unlawful and in respect of which a suppression order is made, if it goes to the court you may have this: the High Court finds that the organisation is not illegal and gives a declaration of legality, but that can be stopped on application to the same High Court until the Supreme Court has decided in the matter.  Why break the ordinary run of the criminal law in that respect? Why not stop at the point where the organisation has gone before one of the <Col N="1405" /> independent judges of the country and got from him a declaration of legality? Why is it decided, contrary to all the run of the criminal law, to keep the thing in reserve&mdash;the organisation has got a declaration of legality from a judge though it has a previous declaration of illegality hanging over its head &mdash;until the Supreme Court has given a final decision?  That procedure is quite contrary to the ordinary run of the criminal law in this country, and no reason is shown why it should be in this position.  These, however, are details.</P>
    <P>The general situation here is that the Taoiseach prides himself on having passed through this country a Constitution. I feel that I can suggest at this moment that if this debate had occurred before the Constitution had been put to the people it would not have secured so many votes.  I doubt if the Taoiseach made it known to the people at that time what, inside the framework of the Constitution, he could do by way of ordinary legislation. Most people, I think, had the impression that the ordinary rights had been reserved.  They were written down, and people do not look to see about reservations.  That has to be said by way of contrast to the older situation, as far back as 1922, that legislation of this type was definitely legislation to amend the Constitution.  This legislation is not.  This legislation is inside the Constitution.  It can be held out as a bait possibly to those in the Six Counties: that this piece of legislation in any event will have no contrary effect upon them.  If they were to come inside the swing of this Constitution they could still retain power in the Six Counties for the preservation of peace and order.  Inside this Constitution, which they would adopt, they could bring in exactly this piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>Now, let us consider the impact of this upon the ordinary lives of the people, because we are being asked to discuss this from the angle of peaceful and orderly times.  That is a matter that we can deal with in greater detail on the Committee Stage.  At this moment this has to be said, that of the five ordinary rights supposed to be <Col N="1406" /> guaranteed in any written Constitution to the people, there is only one here preserved without any great reservation. As far as freedom from arrest is concerned this makes considerable gaps in the ordinary right.  As far as the right of peaceful association is concerned, this is a considerable breach of what has been regarded as the ordinary constitutional privilege in this matter.  As far as the freedom of one's dwelling-house is concerned, that is completely in the dust because one is at the mercy of a superintendent of the Civic Guard with regard to documents which he believes to belong to an organisation which he thinks unlawful. That is so far as the ordinary rights that have been guaranteed to peoples in other countries and which the people in this country thought they had got in the fullest.  With regard to those four rights that I had mentioned, they are definitely and entirely dissipated by the appearance of this measure. To say that does not condemn the Constitution which allows it and does not necessarily condemn the legislation that brings about that strange situation.  It ought, however, to be realised that, apparently we are at this stage in this country that because of the previous old-time education which some had thought finished in 1921, or it may be because of the continuance of that education in a distorted fashion up to 1931, but at any rate, because of something, the Government of this country find themselves in this position, that they cannot grant, freely and simply as the Americans did 150 years ago, the right of freedom of speech, freedom of free expression of opinion, and freedom from arrest.  But they feel that this represents the normal circumstances of the country.  Read the two together, the Constitution, with all its reservations, and this, which is the filling up of all the exceptions that are made to the rights, and you get, I suggest, the picture that is in An Taoiseach's mind of the education of this country as a constitutional body, that the members of it cannot be allowed freely to associate, that men cannot be allowed freely to speak their opinions, that they cannot be allowed to hold public meetings and will not be protected, if they hold public meetings, against breaches of the <Col N="1407" /> peace; and men are not preserved, either, from visits to their households or from arrest and detention; and all that will depend upon this, that the ordinary law, apparently, is not competent to deal with people who are attempting to do unlawful things, to achieve unlawful ends, or to do something unlawful or lawful by unlawful means.</P>
    <P>There is law in this country, and there are cases founded upon that law dealing with conspiracy, with incitement, and with attempts to do unlawful things.  There are laws which the British are themselves operating at this moment with regard to people found with explosives.  There are all sorts and conditions of law to deal with ordinary conditions where people are going to break the law, but apparently that is not satisfactory for An Taoiseach at this hour of the day; he must have this measure with its first 30 clauses to meet the ordinary circumstances.  If that is the situation we are in, it reveals, with regard to this country that we used to rate in our own estimation so highly, that we have sunk to a particular depth, as far as people likely to live in constitutional relations one with the other are concerned.  But if we are at that depth, and if we have to recognise it and to take on a fitting sense of humility after the revelation is made, if we are at the bottom of the ladder and are climbing steadily upwards, let the case be made, let someone say, why the Treason Act of 1925 is not sufficient; why the Emergency Act of 1926, still on the Statue Book, is not sufficient; why the ordinary law with regard to conspiracy, incitement and attempt&mdash;all that aimed at unlawful objectives&mdash;is not sufficient; why even the Explosives Substances Act and such Acts are not sufficient to control the people of this country.  Why is it not that all that machinery, which in any other country would be regarded as an unconstitutional type, but which is allowed in here because the Constitution is so much a pro-State document, is not sufficient to control existing conditions?  There should at least be some explanation in that connection when making a case for the introduction of this measure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McGilligan has stated that the Government Party have completed one cycle&mdash;I think that is what he said&mdash;of revolutionary movement. They have yet to complete another cycle before we can be assured that respect for the law in this State will be based on a proper and firm foundation.  We find ourselves, in this Party to-night, in the position of being asked to make up our minds as to whether we would vote for a Bill which is, practically verbatim, copied from the Treasonable Offences Act and Public Safety Acts that found their way into the Statute Book from 1922 to 1932, and Article 2A of the original Constitution of this State.  Faced with that responsibility, as a responsible Opposition in this State, disliking this Bill more than the Prime Minister himself can possibly dislike it, we, through the mouthpiece of the Leader of our Party, through the Leader of the Opposition here, have announced that, subject to certain very well-defined conditions, we propose to support the Bill.</P>
      <P>The Government, in the year 1931, when Article 2A was introduced, denounced the Bill in terms to which it is not necessary now to advert.  The temptation is very strong to go back and quote the words of the present Ministers and their followers at that time, but so far as we are concerned here, at least so far as I am concerned, I do not propose to revert to one single sentence uttered at that time.  I have not even read the debates since the time of the discussion on Article 2A, but I am sure the character of those debates is still fresh in the public mind. The cycle has moved on and we find that the people who, at the time of the introduction of Article 2A. denounced the people who introduced it and the provisions of the Bill in such unmeasured terms, are themselves introducing into the same Parliament a Bill in almost identical terms.  We who, as the Government at that time, introduced Article 2A, are now in opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cycle that the present Government Party have yet to complete is to find themselves once again in opposition here, facing a Government <Col N="1409" /> formed from any other Party in the House, whether it is this or the Labour Party or any other Party, and, in circumstances similar to the circumstances existing at the present moment, giving their consent, as an Opposition, to a Bill introduced in the terms in which this Bill is introduced and in circumstances similar to those in which this is introduced to-day.  When that cycle is completed and the Government Party have gone through that particular phase, if they fulfil that test, then we will have some hope for stable government in this country.  The Prime Minister said he introduced this Bill with tears in his eyes and sorrow in his heart.  I wonder was this Bill so framed for the sole purpose of putting this Party into a difficulty? When I read it my first instincts were of violent objection to the Bill from start to finish.  I still have the most violent objection to Parts II, III, and IV.</P>
    <P>I am prepared, as the Leader of this Party was prepared to-day, to say that when the responsible Minister for Justice of the Government gets up and says, as he said to-day, that this country has reached a position which, if it is allowed to develop, would deteriorate to such a point that the country would be heading for a catastrophe&mdash;when a responsible Minister of the Government of this country makes such a statement, and when the Government of the country, with their political past, are forced to introduce a Bill of this character, then we on this side of the House are forced to the conclusion that there must be very grave reason indeed for the introduction of such a Bill and very grave necessity for the provisions contained in the Bill.  Consequently, we are forced to give a measure of conditional support to the Bill.  But that support is conditional, so far as I am personally concerned, on practically the entire of Parts II, III and IV being eradicated from the Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGilligan has made our position perfectly clear, that if the Government say there is a necessity for <Col N="1410" /> Parts V and VI of the Bill, with the information before them, and stating that they cannot govern this country without the provisions of Parts V and VI, then they can have them, however reluctant we are to give them these powers, and however much we might fear that these powers may be abused, as they were abused in the past.  The Prime Minister stated that he was open to a generous measure of amendment of Parts II, III and IV of the Bill.  I recalled, when the Prime Minister was making that statement, an appeal that he made to the Deputies here on the occasion of the consideration of the Draft Constitution in the months of May and June of 1938.  He stated that he wished that Draft Constitution to be amended in every possible way that would improve it, and that he would like the Deputies, on this side of the House particularly, to give him every possible assistance.  I cannot recall one single amendment that was put down on this side of the House that was accepted by the Prime Minister when the Constitution was going through, and it is no satisfaction to me, and I take no pride in it, when I say that many of the things that we pointed out were inherent in the Constitution and that are now in the fundamental law of this State&mdash;many of the evils inherent in that have been proved to be evils, and our words at that time have been proved to be absolutely correct by subsequent experience.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;The best qualified candidate with a competent knowledge of Irish will, if otherwise suitable, be recommended by the commissioners to the Minister for appointment.  If no qualified and suitable candidate with a competent knowledge of Irish is available, the candidate otherwise best qualified and suitable will be recommended for appointment, a preference being given to qualified and suitable candidates with a good knowledge of Irish.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Ní foillsítear de ghnáth i bhfógra i dtaobh puist áirithe sa Stát-Sheirbhís ach, mar a déarfá, enámha na gcáilíochtaí atá riachtanach, ach tugtar le tuiscint d'iarrthóirí go bhfuil lántuairisc ar an gcomórtas le fáil ach san d'iarraidh ó Choimisineírí na Stát-Sheirbhíse. Éinne a dhéineann amhlaidh tuigfidh sé maidir le cáilíochtaí go bhfuil an lámh-uachtar ag an iarrathóir go bhfuil an Ghaedhilg aige.  Dá ndéintí na rialacháin i gcomhair gach chomórtais d'fhoillsiú i n-iomlán cosnóchadh sé roinnt mhaith airgid thar mar ba chuibhe.</P>
