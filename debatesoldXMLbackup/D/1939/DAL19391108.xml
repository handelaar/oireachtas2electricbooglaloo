      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Persons residing in Britain and desiring to travel to this country must, in the first place, provide themselves with a passport or travel permit.  Passports and travel permits are issued to Irish citizens at the High Commissioner's office in London and at the Irish passport offices in Glasgow and Liverpool.  In addition, all persons desiring to leave Great Britain are required, under British regulations, to obtain an exit permit from the appropriate British authorities before departure. Exit permits are issued at the British passport and permit offices in London.  Liverpool, Cardiff and Glasgow, and I understand that persons intending to apply for exit permits are officially advised to make application it least ten days before the proposed date of departure.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will understand that the principal point in this matter is the expense and inconvenience that persons are likely to be put to in getting these permits.  Will the Taoiseach have the matter gone into from that point of view, and see whether the Information Bureau will issue a statement that can become generally known, because really a very large number of people are distressed at the difficulty and expense that their relatives in Great Britain are likely to be caused in coming here?</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Taoiseach's reply, docs the Taoiseach intend to convey that what is called the Irish visa which has to be sought in England, is obtainable as a result of application through the post?  I ask this because I was informed by somebody that he was obliged to go personally to the office to get the visa.  Has the Taoiseach any information on that matter that he could now give the House?</P>

In regard to the last part of the question the Deputy will appreciate that the amount of foreign exchange which it is possible to acquire is limited and consequently that such exchange must be conserved for the purchase of essential imports.  Even if it were possible to purchase these securities with Irish currency the export of such currency for any but essential purposes could not be allowed since it would tend to depreciate its value abroad and consequently to increase the cost of imports of necessary commodities.</P>

The Deputy will, of course, realise that the banks in the exercise of their discretion must have regard to the fact that the granting of credit is one of their main sources of income.  As regards private firms, the extent to which they can reduce credit facilities to their customers is, of course, conditioned by considerations of competition with their trade rivals, and I do not feel called upon to interfere unless evidence of widespread restriction were forthcoming.</P>

      <P>There has been no avoidable delay in dealing with this case. The claim was rejected on the 19th June, 1939.  Mrs. Prendergast appealed against this decision on the 14th July, 1939, and her case was submitted to a referee, at whose request further inquiries are being made.  Until these inquiries are completed the referee cannot give a decision.</P>

      <P>The official cost of living index figure showing the relative cost of maintaining a working class standard of living compared with July, 1914-100 is based on family budgets relating to June, 1922, the values of the various items of which are altered at quarterly intervals by means of national average retail prices of the different commodities and rents.  No separate family budget particulars are available for the towns named.  Furthermore, while the returns from which national average prices are derived for the quarterly cost of living inquiries are sufficiently numerous for the compilation of figures which will indicate the trend of retail prices (and rents) in Éire, as a whole, they are too few for the compilation of reasonably accurate figures for individual cities and towns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the figures quoted by the Deputy indicate, the exports of heifers vary a good deal from year to year.

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the annual export of heifers from this country in the last ten years has nearly doubled and that a further review of the total heifer population and births in the country would suggest that if the present rate of export continues our foundation herd of cows will consist at the end of five years of nothing but culls?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy took the years 1932 and 1937, but if he goes back to 1930 the numbers would not vary so much at all between 1930 and 1938.  In any case, the number of cows in the country has remained constant&mdash;cows and heifers.</P>

If we are to assume that the exporters are picking their beasts in the fairs and exporting nothing but good animals&mdash;which I think we may assume&mdash;it suggests that the balance, which are really culls, the second class, are being left to us.</P>

That is the price the farmer has to pay, not the price quoted f.o.b. or in waggon loads to the Minister. The price he has to pay is the price which the shopkeeper charges and he cannot charge less than he has paid. That is the price at present and anyone telling the Minister anything else is making a fool of him.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first two parts of the Deputy's question is in the negative; the last part, therefore, does not arise. I wish to point out to the Deputy, however, that all newspapers have been somewhat delayed by the operation of censorship, but apart from this the mails, including those containing newspapers and periodicals, have been irregular since the outbreak of war. They were particularly so during the month of September.</P>

The motion deals with an order made by the Minister for Supplies under the Emergency Powers Act, and I claim that we should get an assurance from the Tánaiste that, if we desire to discuss a matter which was the subject of an order made under the Emergency Powers Act, facilities would be given to do so.  Now we are in this position that, although the Minister used the Emergency Powers Act, we are denied the opportunity to discuss it because of a Private Deputy's motion that was on the Order Paper previously. If the Government wants to take Private Deputies' time the House cannot deal with an order which has produced a nation wide protest or with the attitude of the Minister.</P>

      <P>The order has attracted such an amount of attention and protest that while the Tánaiste may laugh at the extra 1½d. on sugar, the people in the country are not laughing. Independent of any ambiguous statement, the Government should be anxious to give an opportunity to the House once a month to discuss Government policy in the fullest manner possible on that precise issue alone.  It is one thing to discuss a matter of that kind and to discuss a Budget which the Government says is necessary to carry on the business of the country.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of a Supplementary Budget would, in any circumstances, be an unpleasant duty for a Minister for Finance.  It is particularly distasteful when it is made necessary by conditions of the kind which oblige me to-day to present my first Budget statement to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The members of the Dáil who were present on May 10th last when the annual Budget statement was presented may remember the words of warning then spoken by my friend and colleague, the former Minister for Finance.  In the course of his Budget statement that day, Mr. MacEntee said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Stringent and straitened as our position is, I believe that we can endure it so long as peace is maintained. If a widespread war comes, however, our difficulties will be intensified beyond measure.  I speak now only of the reaction of such a disaster upon our finances.  But there I know that with a much diminished real income, we shall be called upon to shoulder vastly increased public burdens.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="958" /> Those who heard or read these words at that time cannot have been surprised by the announcement that a Supplementary Budget would be introduced to-day.</P>
    <P>Already, in regard to some important sources of revenue, the diminution thus forecast has been only too fully realised.  Both in regard to tax and non-tax revenue a fall has to be acknowledged.  The total estimated in the Budget of May last to be received under the heading of tax revenue was £26,485,000.  The total under the heading of non-tax revenue estimated for was £5,969,000.  As a result of the disturbance caused to our trade and commerce by the outbreak of war, these estimates have to be reduced to £24,935,000 and £5,899,000 respectively, or an aggregate decline of £1,620,000. These items show how seriously our estimates of May last have been upset on the revenue side.  In addition to this I am obliged to take notice of the fact that in some Departments of Government heavy additional and unprovided for expenditure has become necessary, which is fortunately offset to a large extent by savings in other directions.  The position would be quite serious enough even if it could be assumed that these disturbing conditions would be of short duration. Unfortunately, no such assumption can be made.  It is generally accepted that the war which began two months ago threatens to be long and calamitous. This prospect must cause us all the gravest concern.</P>
    <P>I think I do not exaggerate when I say that if the war continues for any considerable time no nation in Europe can feel assured that before peace returns it will not be involved in the conflict. The small nations, in particular, are in grave danger, not merely of being forced into the war, but of completely losing their independence.  The independence of some in Northern Europe, as we know, has already been seriously interfered with and other small nations have actually disappeared as national entities.</P>
    <P>Ireland, though neutral, is not and cannot be immune from the effects of the conflict.  The inevitable curtailment <Col N="959" /> of our imports and the increase in our dependence on a single market for surplus products create serious problems for our people.  Situated as we are in the midst of one of the main theatres of the war, we have had to adopt various safeguards against the dangers to our neutrality, our independence, and the lives of our citizens which such a situation implies.  Thus we have been obliged to place under arms a much stronger and better equipped force than the country would need in normal times; we have established a censorship for overseas correspondence; we have set up a coastwatching service, and we have entered into considerable commitments in respect of A.R.P.</P>
    <P>The total cost of these and other measures necessitated by the war will be very heavy and, unhappily, the expenditure will be productive of no economic benefit.  In facing these heavy expenses it is small comfort to us to know that other neutral States, great and small, have been obliged to face similar, but usually vastly greater, additional expenditure on defence services. During the last few days I read in the public Press that the additional cost to Switzerland for defence services in the protection of its neutrality was estimated to be at the rate of £277,000 per day.  Also it was stated that Finland had been obliged in recent weeks to spend a sum of almost £300,000 per day on defensive measures.  Even if these figures be not accurate&mdash;and, of course, I do not say they are authoritative&mdash;they give some indication of the vast sums which such nations feel compelled to expend for the national welfare.</P>
    <P>In comparison with such enormous expenditure on national defence by small neutral nations the sum we are expending to protect our neutrality is small.  We are restricting all such expenditure to the barest minimum. Every pound proposed to be spent is subjected to the most severe scrutiny in my Department.  We have no intention to enter into a competition in armaments with even the least of the nations.  We have no wish to do so, but even if we had our financial resources would not permit it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="960" /> The cost of the services which the war emergency has obliged us to undertake and which, as I have said, is being kept within the strictest limits cannot, I regret to say, be met to a very great extent by economies in normal expenditure.  To meet the cost entirely by such economies would entail a reduction of services on a scale which the Government, having regard to the additional unemployment and hardship which it would cause, is not prepared to recommend and which, in my opinion, no considerable number of Deputies in this House would be willing to support.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the way of a neutral is hard; so it is, and we shall be fortunate indeed if the conditions created by the war do not result in greater burdens on the Irish people than those I am now about to propose. It is well for us to remember, however, that if the neutral must suffer, the belligerent must suffer immeasurably more, and that even among neutrals in this hemisphere we are so far escaping better than most.</P>
    <P>At all events, we have deliberately chosen to be neutral.  We have done so, I think I can say, with the full approval of every member of this House and so far as I am aware, no voice has been raised in Ireland in opposition to this decision.  That we have been able to declare our nation's neutrality and that our declaration has been accepted and our neutrality recognised internationally is a final and convincing proof of our sovereignty.</P>
    <P>Various opinions on the policies that have led to the war and the aims of the belligerent powers are held by different sections of our citizens, but no influential voice has yet been raised to suggest that Ireland should be a participant.  The independence of the greater part of our country, won after centuries of struggle and sacrifice, has been too dearly bought to be imperilled in a conflict which no moral obligation requires us to enter.  We have for centuries spent our substance and poured out the blood of our best in fighting the battles of the world. <Col N="961" /> This time our intention is to guard and protect the interests of our own nation.</P>
    <P>Even if we were all unanimous in believing that the right was all on one side in this awful conflict, the national interest demands in circumstances as they exist to-day in Ireland, that we be neutral.  Our duty to ourselves, the duty of preserving our freedom and internal peace, of working steadfastly for the restoration of our national unity and of conserving, as well as we may in such times, the resources so sorely needed for the rebuilding of a population diminished to a dangerous degree by ages of misgovernment, can best be fulfilled by maintaining our position of neutrality.  In doing so, we shall also be making at least a negative contribution to the cause of international peace and keeping intact our right, when the appropriate time arrives, to exert such influence as we possess to promote the establishment of a world order, more just and stable than that which is now threatened with dissolution.</P>
    <P>The Government fully realises that a State with our small population and limited resources could not successfully maintain the inviolability of its soil against attack by a great Power armed with all the weapons of modern warfare. But we can make, and we are bound to make, such preparations as will convince a potential aggressor that the military and political cost of overcoming our resistance would be greater than it would be wise to incur.</P>
    <P>We are, in my belief, not likely to be attacked.  The belligerents of both sides recognise our neutrality and we have no reason to think that they will not continue to respect it.  In the course of a long war, however, circumstances may well arise in which our immunity from attack will depend on the knowledge that we are ready and resolved to defend our country to the limits of our power.</P>
    <P>What I have just said, as you may well have imagined, is the prelude to a Supplementary Budget of a serious character.  I have to make very heavy additional demands on all classes of our citizens.  I am convinced all I am about <Col N="962" /> to ask is necessary for our national security.</P>
    <P>Before I proceed to state in detail my financial proposals, perhaps I may be permitted to refer briefly to the work of the Economy Committee.</P>
    <P>When I was last speaking to the Dáil, on the occasion of the debate on the policy of the Government during the emergency, I explained that, as part of its inquiry into the financial position, the Government had set up an Economy Committee with comprehensive terms of reference which I read to the House. The committee had at that time already made one interim report.  They have since continued their examination and have presented a lengthy second report which is at present under consideration. I understand that the end of the committee's labours is within sight and that it is probable that the Government should have their final report within a couple of weeks.</P>
    <P>I should like to tell the House that the committee have been extremely painstaking in their inquiries.  They have taken evidence from the officers charged with the administration of the various services reviewed, and have sought, as far as is practicable, to secure agreement with Departments as regards possible economies whether by way of a slight lowering of standards during the emergency or by deferring projects involving expenditure until better times.  The committee appear, however, to have come to the conclusion, with which I am afraid I must agree, that so large a proportion of the State's outlay is spent on social services that no large-scale economies of the kind that are required to meet the present emergency can be secured without reducing the standard of these services to some extent.</P>
    <P>The committee, however, are bearing in mind the desirability of restricting the displacement of labour in urban areas to the narrowest possible limits consistent with their objects while, so far as rural areas are concerned, they have in view the probable effects of the Compulsory Tillage Order on the agricultural labour market.</P>
    <P>These are the factors forming the <Col N="963" /> background of the interim reports already submitted.  They deal with Land Commission expenditure, unemployment assistance, employment schemes, housing expenditure and draws on the Local Loans Fund for a variety of services.</P>
    <P>Now I wish to put before you details of the position in which we find ourselves and our financial propositions for tiding us over the present difficult period.</P>
    <P>In the original White Paper estimate £24,146,000 was included in respect of customs, excise, and inland revenue. Under the provision made in this year's Budget that figure was increased to £25,320,000.  It will be remembered that Mr. MacEntee, when introducing the Budget, pointed out that it had been prepared at a time when our revenues were declining owing to the unsatisfactory commercial conditions brought about by the tension then so much in evidence.  Despite this, the experience of the first five months of the present financial year gave every hope that the Budget Estimate would be realised if peace were maintained.</P>
    <P>With the coming of the war it became necessary to consider the position afresh, and a review of the revenue prospects in the altered conditions has, accordingly, been made.  In the light of all the available data, it is estimated that, if the existing rates of duties be left unaltered, the total yield of tax revenue, apart from motor vehicle duties, will be £1,550,000 less than the Budget Estimate of £25,320,000.  This decrease is distributed over customs, excise, and inland revenue.  In the case of customs, which is principally affected, we expect declines in the receipts from hydrocarbon oils, intoxicating liquors, motor cars, clothing and apparel, sugar and various other heads of duty.  Excise, which is less affected, will show reduced receipts from hydrocarbon oils, betting, entertainments, tyres, and tubes, and beer, offset by gains expected in the receipts from spirits, sugar, etc.</P>
    <P>As regards inland revenue duties, a decrease is probable in income-tax and <Col N="964" /> surtax, stamps, death duties, and corporation profits tax:</P>
    <P>In the case of income-tax and sur-tax, as these estimates are based in the main on past profits, there may not be any appreciable reduction in the amount of liability to tax, but delay may be experienced in collecting money from taxpayers generally in the present situation.</P>
    <P>In the case of Stamp Duties, the Budget Estimate included a large sum from the duty on sweepstakes.  The disturbed international situation has, however, already produced a heavy adverse effect on the yield from this source.  It is probable, moreover, that there will be an appreciable drop in respect of some of the other Stamp Duties.</P>
    <P>As regards Death Duties, the bulk of this revenue is derived from duty payable in respect of investments, the value of which has fallen owing to the present international conflict.</P>
    <P>In the case of Corporation Profits Tax, the duty to be collected during the current year is based almost wholly on accounting periods which have already ended, but as it is expected there will be some delay in certain cases in collecting the tax the receipts in the current financial year are expected to be down.</P>
    <P>It is feared that all the factors that have been referred to will adversely affect the revenue at least while the war lasts, but it would be futile to attempt to assess accurately the loss of revenue likely to result over a long period.  The position will be kept constantly under review.</P>
    <P>In view of the situation which I have outlined, the Government gave consideration in the first place to an increase in income-tax.  We have already had an increase in income-tax for the current year from 4/6 to 5/6 in the £. Taxpayers were informed of this increase in May of this year.  Notices of assessment have recently been issued to taxpayers all over the country intimating to them the amounts payable on the 1st January next by reference to the 5/6 rate.  It is obvious that any further increase in the standard rate notified at this date, involving a substantial <Col N="965" /> increase in the amounts which taxpayers will be called on to pay at the beginning of January, would give rise to serious confusion and in many cases to grave hardship.  It would also cause somewhat serious administrative difficulties.</P>
    <P>After mature consideration, accordingly, the Government have decided that another increase in the income-tax for the current year is not feasible, but that the standard rate of income-tax for next year, i.e., for the year beginning on the 6th April, 1940, should be increased by 1/-, i.e., from 5/6 to 6/6 in the £.  Effect will be given to this decision in the usual manner by means of a Financial Resolution when next year's Budget is introduced, and by the usual clause in next year's Finance Bill; but in the meantime it is necessary, in order to avoid confusion, that we should have legislation governing deductions of income-tax made by bankers and other persons during the period from the 6th April, 1940, to the date of the introduction of next year's Budget Resolutions.  The Finance (No. 2) Bill for this year, which will be in the hands of Deputies in the course of some days, will contain a clause dealing with this matter, and the necessary Financial Resolution will be introduced to-day.  The effect will be that bankers and other persons deducting income-tax from dividends, interest, etc., payable within the period from the 6th April, 1940, to the date of the passing of the income-tax resolution on Budget day next year will proceed as if a Financial Resolution having statutory effect under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, imposing income-tax for the year 1940-41, were passed on the morning of the 6th April, 1940.</P>
    <P>Whilst it is obvious that any estimate now made of the yield of income-tax in the year 1940/41 may be affected by circumstances which cannot at the moment be foreseen, it may be stated that the extra 1/- which it is proposed to charge should, under normal conditions, produce an increased yield of about £780,000 in the year 1940/41 and, if it remains in force, £1,040,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>The sur-tax collectible on the 1st <Col N="966" /> January next is the sur-tax for the year 1938/39 (ending 5th April, 1939) and for reasons similar to those operating in the case of income-tax it is not considered feasible at this date to increase the 1938/39 sur-tax rates.  There will be a revision of the scale upwards for the current year (1939-40) and tax on the new scale will be payable on the 1st January, 1941.  The revision of the scale is a somewhat complicated business. Particulars of it will be given at the normal time when the necessary Financial Resolution is introduced on Budget day next year.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to increase forthwith the rates of estate duty chargeable on estates of a value exceeding £10,000. The existing rates will be increased by one-tenth in the case of estates exceeding £10,000 and not exceeding £50,000, and by one-fifth in the case of estates exceeding £50,000.  The Resolution will provide for charging the increased rates on the estates of persons dying after to-day.  It is estimated that these increases will yield an additional £13,000 in the current financial year and about £80,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>In looking for further additional revenue, I propose to avail of the sources which have served us so well up to the present rather than embark on new types of customs and excise taxation.  The advantages of this course are obvious.  The machinery for collecting customs and excise duties on the existing basis is in good working order and no additional public expense is involved in increasing existing rates of duty.</P>
    <P>New systems of indirect taxation, on the other hand, require expert examination over a period of time in order to ascertain their practicability with the minimum disturbance to trade and to the official machine, and almost of necessity they involve an addition to the burden of public expenditure.  It may be contended that some of the existing rates of customs and excise duty have reached the point beyond which they may cease to be satisfactorily productive, according to the theoretical principles of taxation, but our experience of the effect of the addition to the tobacco duties in May last does not support that contention.  In <Col N="967" /> that particular case we based our estimate of the yield from tobacco, following the increase in duty, on the assumption that there would be a contraction in consumption.  So far, there are no indications that such has been the case.</P>
    <P>The changes in duties which I now wish to place before the Dáil are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The rate of customs duty on imported sugar will, if the Resolution be adopted, be increased by 7/- per cwt. from 16/4 to 23/4, which is an increase per lb. of ¾d. from 1¾d. to 2½d.  The present rates for articles cognate to sugar and included for customs purposes in the sugar group, that is, glucose, molasses, saccharin and articles containing sugar, will be correspondingly increased.  The rate of excise duty on sugar made from home-grown beet will be increased by the same amount, from 1/2 per cwt. to 8/2, or from ?d. per lb. to ?d.  These changes are expected to yield £243,000 this year, but they will not affect the retail price of sugar operating from the 1st of this month, which will remain at 4½d. per lb., that is the price ruling in neighbouring countries.</P>
    <P>Tobacco, I am afraid, cannot escape, and under the Resolution which will be submitted to you, it is proposed to increase the main rate of tobacco duty, that is the rate chargeable on the unmanufactured leaf, in the case of both customs and excise by 2/8 per lb., the customs duty thus becoming 13/4 per lb. and the excise 12/6. This increase is expected to bring in an additional revenue of £227,000 in the present financial year.  The receipts would be larger but for the heavy clearances from bond of leaf tobacco which have been taking place for some time and which, no doubt, have resulted in manufacturers and traders being well supplied with stocks.</P>
    <P>I propose to raise the beer duty by 12/- per standard barrel of 36 gallons, bringing the excise duty to £5 12s. 0d. and the customs duty to £5 12s. 6d. This increase will mean an addition of £50,000 this year.</P>
    <P>Beer duty is assessed by reference to a standard strength related to the <Col N="968" /> specific gravity of the worts before fermentation and this strength is higher than the beer on sale in the course of ordinary business.  Twelve shillings per 36 gallons is the equivalent of ½d. per pint at the standard specific gravity.</P>
    <P>My last proposal under the heads of customs and excise is to increase the rate, both for customs and excise, of spirits by 10/- per gallon at strength of proof.  This will bring the rate of duty chargeable on home-made spirits to £4 2s. 6d. per proof gallon, the rates of customs duty on imported spirits being slightly more, as hitherto. The gain to revenue in the present year from the increase is expected to be about £20,000.</P>
    <P>An addition of 10/- per proof gallon represents approximately 2d. per glass at proof but, of course, represents less on spirits as ordinarily sold, which are considerably under proof.</P>
    <P>The estimates of customs and excise yield for the current financial year are based on the assumption that the changes in taxation which I have indicated will take effect from to-morrow, the 9th November.</P>
    <P>It has been very difficult to estimate the effect of the changes in regard to tobacco and spirits as receipts to date are above expectations and indicate that stocks have been acquired in anticipation of increases in price, of difficulties in renewing supplies or of increased taxation.  These factors may help to make the revenue position appear healthy for the moment, but they have the effect of depriving the revenue of the future of some of the yield which would ordinarily be expected.</P>
    <P>The various increases in taxation which I have proposed will, if accepted by the Dáil, bring us from now until the end of the financial year a total estimated revenue of £603,000 against the deficiency of £1,620,000 in tax and non-tax revenue to which I referred in the opening part of my statement. There still remains a gap of £1,017,000 to be filled and it is proposed to bridge this gap, in part at any rate, by adopting recommendations of the Economy Committee presented to the Government. These recommendations affect a number of services and the combined <Col N="969" /> effect of the recommendations and of other measures will result in an estimated saving in expenditure this year of £400,000, thus reducing the deficit still further to £617,000.  In so far as this sum cannot be met by expansion in revenue beyond the estimates or by further saving in expenditure, any balance outstanding will be carried over into the following financial year, 1940/41, and liquidated by means of the additional revenue derived from the taxes which I have submitted for acceptance to the House to-day.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I must refer.  The war has resulted in increases in the prices of many essential commodities and, before it ends, further increases are, unfortunately, probable.  These increases will bear heavily on every class and there will be a strong temptation to demand corresponding increases in wages, salaries and profits.  If such demands were successful, the effect would be to increase prices still more, and to give occasion for new demands.  In that way an artificial price structure would be built up which would inevitably collapse at the end of the war, if not before, leaving behind widespread unemployment and depression.  The Government feels that it has a duty to do everything in its power to avert such a development, and it is determined to set its face against the efforts of any class to obtain compensation for the rise in prices at the expense of the community.  Action to the same end is in contemplation with regard to all classes of public servants, and if the war continues for a long time, the Government may be forced to adopt more drastic measures.  I trust that all classes of the people will realise that the course we have in mind, though it may call for immediate sacrifices, is necessary to avert still graver hardships in the future.</P>
    <P>It is, I submit, no mean achievement, in the difficult circumstances of the time, to have attained by these various means a practical equilibrium in the Budget.</P>
    <P>There is one word more I wish to say here and that is to pay a tribute to my colleague, Mr. MacEntee, whom <Col N="970" /> I have succeeded as Minister for Finance.  I have had an opportunity since I took over the Department of Finance of seeing from the inside, so to speak, how efficiently my predecessor performed his work.  May I be permitted to say that, in my opinion, no Government could have had a more careful, conscientious or capable guardian or administrator of its finances than he.  For whatever time I may have the honour to be Minister for Finance I hope I will be able to continue the high standard of financial probity he ever maintained in our national affairs.</P>
    <P>From what I have said earlier, Deputies will appreciate that further borrowing will be required to meet the extraordinary demands made upon the Exchequer by recent events.  I propose that this borrowing should take the form of a public issue.  I cannot say yet what precisely the amount of this loan will be, but it will be sufficient to cover the objects for which the Minister for Finance announced in May last that he would borrow, viz., for portion of the expenditure on defence, employment schemes, airports and afforestation. The defence programme has naturally had to be speeded up in view of recent developments.  The price for equipment has also tended to move against us, and, in the circumstances, a substantial borrowing operation is inevitable.  I appeal with confidence to all Parties in the House to ensure the success of this undertaking, and with no less confidence do I appeal to outside interests, the banks and the investing public, whether they have much or little to invest, to help in this important task.  The co-operation of all elements in the State is necessary if this crisis is to be surmounted.  It is not a time for the nicely-calculated less or more, or for the weighing of alternative courses of action in political scales.  In this matter the interests of all sections of the community are identical, and with the assurance of your support I am certain that our contemplated loan operation will succeed.</P>
    <P>The additional burdens which, in the name of the Government, I am asking you to place upon the shoulders of the people are, I am fully aware, very <Col N="971" /> heavy.  I hope I have convinced you that real necessity exists for them.  In the past, the Irish people have willingly made great sacrifices to win independence for their country.  Now that it has been won for most of Ireland, they will no less willingly accept the burden of defending it.</P>
    <P>Let us hope and pray that peace may soon be restored in Europe, and that the days of trial will be shortened for us and for the whole world; that they will be followed by a peace inspired by justice where the rights of individual nations and the bonds which exist between all mankind will be recognised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The country generally will be rather surprised at the introduction of this Supplementary Budget. The surprise will probably grow according as the Minister's statement, which he has just read, is perused throughout the country.  The Budget of this year proposed to raise more money than had ever been collected in revenue in this country since the State was established. The Minister's case in respect of the introduction of this Budget is that of a contraction in revenue under various heads, and he proceeds then to make up for the shortage by imposing various additional taxes upon the country. Bearing in mind the Budget of this year and its general framework, and the statement that the Minister has made here this evening, it does not appear to me possible to take any other attitude in connection with this measure than to vote against it from beginning to end.  Parts of the Minister's speech would appear to contradict other parts.  On the occasion of the introduction of the Budget this year in May last, I pointed out on more than one occasion some 20 or 25 separate services of the State the estimates for which in the current year exceeded by over £1,000,000 what they were in 1931-32, starting with the office of the Prime Minister himself; and not one of the services that I mentioned had anything to do with the social services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no other view to take than that the Government &ldquo;squandermania&rdquo; of May last has been still further enhanced <Col N="973" /> during the succeeding six or seven months.  The difficulties of the period through which we are passing&mdash; which should in the normal course have brought them down to earth&mdash;have, instead of that, made them still more extravagant. Perhaps the most unsatisfactory feature of this Budget statement&mdash;which has been read by the Minister&mdash;is that portion of it in which he refers to the Economy Committee. One would have imagined that, in a case of this sort, a very much more exhaustive examination would have been made of the whole of the State services and a really constructive effort would have been made to decrease in some way or other the charges which fall to be met by taxation or other means.</P>
    <P>On page 10 he says: &ldquo;These are the factors&rdquo;&mdash;mentioning projects involving expenditure, being deferred until better times, and so on&mdash;&ldquo;forming the background of the interim reports already submitted.  They deal with Land Commission expenditure, unemployment assistance, employment schemes, housing expenditure and draws on the Local Loans Fund for a variety of services.&rdquo;  Apparently, having advised everybody in the country to continue employment as far as they possibly could, to disemploy no one unless it were impossible to do otherwise, here are the various sources which are examined in order to make economies in services in which employment is afforded.  The 20 separate services that I have mentioned, the estimated cost of which is £1,000,000 over what they were ten years ago, are the services which should have been examined with minute care.  If we take just one other: quite recently here there has been an addition to the ranks of the Gárda Síochána; there has been no outbreak of disorder in any part of the country, no special circumstance necessitating the employment of extra men, yet that particular service is going to cost us £60,000 this year and £120,000 in a full year, over and above the normal expenditure under this head.</P>
    <P>This economic examination does not bear on its face evidence of good faith, and these are not times when the public should be served except in the <Col N="974" /> very best way possible.  One is rather inclined&mdash;and it may be due to the disappointment and the disgust which arises from the presentation of such a statement as this, and the miserable efforts which have been made to deal with a situation which ought to be tackled in a much more statesmanlike manner&mdash;to look back and examine how was it that a change of Government took place in this country.  Were there not years and years spent by Deputies opposite in telling the people that the country could be run much more cheaply than it was being run, that we were living on an imperial scale and that the costs of government were far beyond the resources of the people?  What do we find?  Either those statements were made through absolute ignorance&mdash;and I hope they were&mdash;or they were made by people standing upon political dishonesty.  I would much prefer that they were made through ignorance, but whether they were made through ignorance or through dishonesty, the fact is that the statements made had not a shred of evidence to support them.  In every year that they have been charged with government, the expenses and cost of government have increased.  What is the situation with regard to the ability of people to bear these increased costs? In Appendix No. 10, I think, of the Banking Commission Report, furnished by Professor Duncan, he estimates the income of this country over a series of years and, in 1929, he estimated the income at £160,000,000.  It has not reached that figure since in any year, and the costs of government in 1929 were very different from what they are in 1939, or in any of the years since 1932.</P>
    <P>In the course of this statement the Minister says that they are going to take drastic steps to deal with those who, by reason of additional charges such as are imposed in this Budget, will be looking for either extra profits or extra wages.  What exactly is meant by that?  If a man has a salary of £100 a year, and, by reason of the imposition of such a Budget as we have here, it is going to cost him £2 or £3 a year more, is he not entitled to say: &ldquo;The salary or the wages I have are unequal to the cost of living&rdquo;?  If the business <Col N="975" /> man who just barely manages to get enough to live on, to pay all his expenses and to keep employed those persons who are engaged in the business, finds, by reason of this Budget, that he is short at the end of the year, in balancing his accounts, is the Minister's advice to him to follow the Government's policy, to go into debt and to borrow, or is that man going to raise the price of goods in order to meet the costs incidental to the overhead charges of his business?  If a man has a very considerable income, as some people have in this country, and if he finds that, by reason of the Budget, he is not able to maintain on his establishment those who are at present employed, is the Minister going to tell him: &ldquo;Do what the Government does, and borrow&rdquo;?  What would be the end of all that?  If we go further into it, and see what has been the policy adopted here for the last three years, at any rate, of unbalanced Budgets, what would be the answer of any lender to a borrower who has not paid his way when he comes to look for money, no matter how rich he is?  Is not the only answer that his credit is not good?</P>
    <P>No serious attempt has been made here to ease the burden falling upon industry and agriculture, and upon every section of the community. There is one thing about this Budget, and it is that it is a satisfactory Budget for the teetotallers, for the non-smokers, for those who have no income-tax to pay and for those who do not use sugar, and I presume we have specimens of such ascetics in this country.  They will not have to pay. If, by reason of the addition to the beer tax, consumption is going to dry up, if, by reason of the addition to the whiskey tax, consumption is going to dry up, is there not a danger that you are going to destroy a potential tax? Looking over the events of the last 15 years, one is rather surprised at the reduction which has taken place in the revenue derived from taxation from beer and spirits&mdash;if my recollection is correct it is down by £3,000,000 or £4,000,000&mdash;and in that case the day upon which the teetotaller may expect <Col N="976" /> to bear some of the burden of the extravagance of this Government is probably at hand.</P>
    <P>This is a time of national emergency, and, looking through this statement, one would imagine that the States which are neutral have a much more difficult role to play than belligerent States, that nothing is more difficult than neutrality and that belligerency is a sort of amusement compared with it. The stability of the State is just as important to this country as, if not more than, its neutrality, and if we are not able to carry on our business, to give employment to our people, to secure for them that employment which is their due, and to which they are entitled, we may talk as we wish about nationality, patriotism, neutrality, or any other of those things.  We have increased, to an unusual extent, the cost of our defence proposals.  One is rather surprised on reading this statement to note the Minister's statement, qualified, as nearly every statement made by a Minister is qualified, by another statement, as to the cost of the Army being very considerable.  The Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Thus we have been obliged to place under arms a much stronger and better equipped force than the country would need in normal times; we have established a censorship for overseas correspondence; we have set up a coast watching service, and we have entered into considerable commitments in respect of air raid precautions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I wonder in connection with, say one of the four services mentioned whether the costs of censorship are so large as to warrant their inclusion in a statement of this kind, or are they far beyond what anyone of us ever contemplated. Do they not amount to £100,000?  The Minister went on:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government fully realises that a State with our small population and limited resources could not successfully maintain the inviolability of its soil against attack by a great power armed with all the weapons of modern warfare.  But we can make, and we are bound to make, such preparations as would convince a potential <Col N="977" /> aggressor that the military and political cost of overcoming our resistance would be greater than it would be wise to incur.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That means that our propaganda must be of a much higher power than our gunnery.  I should like to know what set of belligerents anyone could convince by arguments in this business of a war.</P>
    <P>Later in this statement, we find that we are now paying more for our equipment than if it had been bought earlier. In what respect do we find any evidence of the competency of the Government in the present crisis?  In the first place, there appears to be a policy of &ldquo;hush-hush&rdquo; with regard to matters generally. Secondly, the people are being led to believe that there is nothing more difficult than to observe neutrality and that we should be prepared to spend every penny we have to maintain it.  Thirdly, we are told that we must increase our armed forces while the Government have not taken the steps necessary to equip them.  We are told that they are buying now at the highest prices instead of at the lowest.  Are we so wealthy that we can afford that? That is on the general question.</P>
    <P>Let me come down now to the details in regard to the sugar question.  Sugar is to be taxed at the rate of 7/- per cwt., or ¾d. per lb.  In the whole list of matters which have occasioned public discussion, nothing possibly has given greater dissatisfaction to the people than this question of sugar.  We were told that there was plenty of sugar in the country.  Was there?  If there was, there is more than 7/- per cwt. being placed in the way of taxation on the people.  What did the sugar that the Sugar Company have got cost? Did they pay 8/- per cwt.?  Did they pay 15/-?  They did not, or anything like it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps more than 15/-?  If the Minister would make a statement on that matter, it might perhaps ease the public mind to some extent.  I cannot accept the statement <Col N="978" /> than 15/- per cwt. was paid before the 1st September.  I would not accept it. The price now, including the duty that the public is going to be charged, is 42/- per cwt., or £42 per ton.  The total excise duty is 23/4.  That is very near 20/- duty free.  Leaving out the odd coppers, 15/- would be the average price, 15/- per cwt. or £15 per ton, as the case may be.  In my opinion that is far in excess of the import price paid for sugar here, on the average, since the 1st April last or before that, assuming that sugar was imported prior to the 1st April and placed in bond.</P>
      <P>The excise duty has been raised from 1/2 to 8/2, and the Minister says that the price is the price ruling in neighbouring countries.  I should like to get some further information on that, because the information we have is that sugar is sold at 3d. or 3½d. per lb. in England.  This is a tax that falls very heavily on the working-class population, and if there is any extravagance in the cost of Government services, it is a tax that is not justified.  It is an unjust tax.  We may call ourselves a Christian country, a well-disposed country, and claim that this is a predominantly Catholic country, but it is unjust and unfair to the working class of this country and to those whose incomes are small, to place such an enormous burden upon them it a time like this.  I regret that I can see no other course than to object to each one of these Resolutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister for Industry and Commerce was speaking on the last occasion on which the House sat, I felt that his statement was such as to disclose that he did not appreciate the very serious unemployment problem now confronting the country.  A still greater unemployment problem will, I fear, face this country in the immediate months ahead, and while we have had that view expressed by the Minister, who endeavoured to make light of the increase in unemployment, we have now, after the Government have had time to consider the question, in the light of recent developments, another point of view expressed by the Minister for Finance, who looks at the matter from a financial <Col N="979" /> standpoint.  This Budget seems to be the Budget of a Government who do not appreciate the seriousness of the unemployment problem and the heavy responsibility that falls upon them to make provision for the serious dislocation in our employment position. Right throughout the Budget, there has been no intimation whatever that the Government proposes to take any substantial steps to deal with what is, in my view, the most serious problem of all.  An examination of Government statistics will show that in the past two months there has been a very substantial increase in the number of persons registered at the employment exchanges.  Now that some of the Employment Period Orders have expired, and that others are due to expire shortly, we may find registered at the employment exchanges, within the next month probably, not less than 120,000 or 130,000 persons, satisfying the hard test which our unemployment legislation imposes upon them before they are classified as unemployed persons.  Yet, in face of the fact, that we have 120,000 or 130,000 persons unemployed in this small State of ours, we scarcely get the question of unemployment mentioned in this Budget at all.  There is no intimation whatever that the Government appreciate the heavy responsibility that they have in that connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Budget is passed, the unemployment problem will apparently be tinkered with in the same unsatisfactory way as we have been tinkering with it for the past 12 months, aye, for the past two decades.  We are going to have a still more serious problem to deal with, a problem such as we have not been called on to face for the last 20 years because we are now going to find ourselves face to face with the position that where you had endemic unemployment in the past, you will now find a large number of other persons thrown on the employment market, persons who formerly followed occupations in which there was regular employment at decent rates of pay.  The crisis through which we are passing now is one which will throw on the employment market large numbers of persons who never experienced <Col N="980" /> anything but regular employment in their vocational activities. Yet, in a Budget of this kind, which hits the highlights of internationalism at one point, we find no reference whatever to the necessity of finding some solution for the serious problem, the problem of utilising the brains and brawn of the man power of the country. No hope is held out in this Budget that the amount provided for unemployment assistance will be raised to meet the higher cost of living.</P>
    <P>There is no intimation that anything will be done to meet the present intolerably low unemployment insurance benefits: no intimation at all that even the non-contributory sections of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act will be amended to provide better scales of benefit.  The old age pensioners, living on a miserable State pittance, will see that pittance being constantly reduced by a shrinkage in its purchasing power.</P>
    <P>All these classes will get no solace whatever from a Budget of this kind. Instead, so far as the social services of the country are concerned, we are threatened with a curtailment of these services by reason of the activities of the Economy Committee.  Although the Minister for Finance told us that he has had two reports from this Committee, the second a lengthy one, we have not had from him any intimation as to what economies it is proposed to effect under the report of that Committee, or what social services are likely to be curtailed as a result of the Government's decision on the report of the Committee.  Instead we are being asked, presumably, to support a Budget of this kind, and later on will be told that part of the Budget involves a curtailment of the activities of certain departments, and perhaps a restriction of the social services which was provided for, in our efforts to balance the Budget.  I, for one, want to know what recommendations the Economy Committee have made: what proposals made by the Committee have been accepted by the Government, and who is going to suffer and bear the hardship as a result of the implementation of any portion of the report of that Committee.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="981" /> The Budget, in any case, makes one thing clear.  It tells us definitely that the people are now being asked to pay 1½d per lb. more for their sugar.  I suggest that the Budget in that respect is not keeping faith with the House: that it is not honouring the promise which the Minister for Supplies made to the Dáil at its meeting on the 18th October.  Speaking on that occasion the Minister for Supplies&mdash;the quotation is from the Dáil Debates, 18th October, 1939, column 742&mdash;said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Some Deputy asked whether the stand-still order for sugar still operates.  It still operates for the sale of sugar.  We do not anticipate any immediate change in the price of sugar.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And yet, approximately a fortnight after that statement was made, the public were horrified to read in an announcement by the Government Information Bureau that even in respect of the stocks of sugar then in the country: even in respect of stocks of sugar produced by our own beet factories, and even in respect of stocks of sugar in wholesalers' and retailers' premises, the public were going to be compelled to pay an extra 1½d. per lb. They were told that, after having an assurance from the Minister for Supplies that we had plenty of sugar in the country and that the problems in connection with its distribution would disappear almost immediately.  Side by side with the statement as to an abundant or adequate supply, we had the assurance that the Government did not contemplate, or anticipate, an immediate change in the price of sugar, but we now find ourselves in the position where, overnight almost, people are being compelled to pay an extra 1½d. per lb. for it.  We see here in this Budget the reason why they are being compelled to pay that.  The reason why they are being compelled to pay this additional 1½d. per lb. for sugar is so that the Government can levy a new tax, an additional tax, of three farthings per lb. on sugar, in addition to the 1¾d. which is at present imposed on it.  Under this Budget, therefore, we are clapping on a tax of 2½d. per lb. on every lb. of sugar bought by <Col N="982" /> every man, woman, and child in this country.</P>
    <P>My memory carries me back to the day when we had the viewpoint expressed by the previous Minister for Finance in which he told us that a tax on sugar was a hard tax: that he preferred to take it off sugar and put it on tea, so convinced was he that a hard tax on sugar was one which ought not to be borne by the people.  I think that the then Minister for Finance was right when he expressed that view.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would advise the Minister for Supplies to look up the speech that he made in the Dáil on the 18th October, in which he promised that there would be no immediate change in the price of sugar.  Now, in this Budget the Government are clapping on a tax of 2½d. on every pound of sugar consumed here.  I want to tell the present Minister for Finance that I agree with the viewpoint of his predecessor: that a tax on sugar is a hard tax.  If the Minister looks up a speech by his predecessor, who is quoted in this Budget speech&mdash;the speech in which his predecessor took the tax off sugar&mdash;he will find there very convincing reasons why he should not proceed to increase the tax on sugar, as he proposes to do, in this Budget.  I think it is an outrageous <Col N="983" /> tax on poor people.  In respect of a working-class household with a large number of children, the tax on sugar is probably the heaviest tax which that family has to bear, because it is on a commodity which is used very extensively in the household.  But, apparently, the idea in this Budget is to grab all you can.</P>
      <P>The most interesting part of the Budget speech is, in my opinion, set out on page 22.  Here the Minister for Finance tells us, although the price of sugar has gone up by 1½d. per lb., as well as the price of coal, bread, flour, milk, and various other commodities, that &ldquo;The Government... is determined to set its face against the efforts of any class to obtain compensation for the rise in prices at the expense of the community,&rdquo; so that so far as the ordinary working man is concerned, the man who lives by his ability to earn a week's wages, and whose ability to earn that week's wages is the only thing which separates him from the workhouse, he is being told that although the Government will tax his sugar and such beer as he can afford to buy, that it will tax his tobacco still further, and will do nothing to prevent an increase in the price of his coal, flour, bread, milk, and the various other commodities which he requires, the one thing the Government will do is to stand in and set its face against any attempt by him to obtain compensation for a rise in prices at the expense of the community.</P>
      <P>That is a definite intimation to the workers and farmers of the country that, so far as the Government are concerned, they will stand by powerless and helpless, where they are not the actual swag gatherers themselves, and permit prices to increase apparently without any systematic restriction. The only time they will act is when they set their faces against the effort of any class to obtain compensation for the rise in prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish the Government good luck in that policy.  I am quite satisfied that the organised workers of this country will take no notice of whether the Government set their face one way or the other in that connection.  The <Col N="984" /> workers of this country have a standard of living to maintain.  It does not enhance the reputation of the country, or strengthen the economic position or promote industrial peace in the country to have the Government issuing an edict of that kind&mdash;that it is determined to set its face against any attempt by the workers to maintain their standard of living.  Are they to be expected to stand idly by and see their wages reduced: to see their purchasing power reduced by a rise in prices, while the Government, instead of bringing in a proposal to maintain their standard and, if possible, improve it, merely act by introducing something to drag the workers down to the intolerably low standard that they were compelled to endure heretofore.  The organised workers will answer that challenge by the Minister.  Where it is not an incentive to cut wages, it is an intimation that in future the Department of Industry and Commerce, which ought to hold the scales evenly between workers and employers, will on this occasion, as we have been told in this Budget speech, be on the side of those who either want to reduce the workers' wages or keep the workers from obtaining better wages to improve their standard of living.</P>
    <P>This is particularly good advice especially given in the same Parliament in which Deputies' salaries were increased and in which pensions were provided for ex-Ministers.  We were told by the Taoiseach on one occasion that Ministers' salaries had been reduced and that it was not in the public interest to let them remain so low as they were, though he had the assurance to assert previously that they were too high.  A new scale was fixed. It was discovered that the existing scale had been too low and the Taoiseach's explanation was that it was not in the public interest that Ministers' salaries should be continued at the low scale at which they stood.  Apparently the Executive Council recognised that the public interest was justification enough for going back to the scale of salaries which had been condemned at every cross-roads in the country.  In the same year as that in which we have provided pensions for ex-Ministers on <Col N="985" /> a scale that prevails in no other country in the world, we are told that the Government has set its face against the efforts of any class to obtain compensation for a rise in prices at the expense of the community.  The Minister told us that that would be sternly resisted by the Government.  There ought to be some little consistency in a matter of this kind.</P>

      <P>We were told there is to be a new loan.  But the bankers are not being told that the Government has set its face against any effort on their part to get advantage out of the present financial position and that they are not going to be allowed to get any ransom they demand for the use of the money they lend to the State.  We are going to pay a ransom for the money the bankers will lend to the State.  For that money they will get 4 per cent. or 5 per cent. and there will be no advice given to the bankers such as is being given to the ordinary workers of the country.  I take it the present occasion is one in which the Minister for Finance feels he can give this sort of reactionary advice to the workers of the country.  But in that case should not this be the time when the Government should tell the bankers of the country that this is not the occasion for paying a ransom for the money which they are to lend to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there are to be sacrifices, then those who live on rent, interest and profit should make their contribution just as well as the ordinary working class people of the country.  The State, without which there can be no credit and no profit, is to pay a high ransom to the bankers for the money that is needed for housing and other social services.  We need houses, but they cannot be built because we are unable to pay the high ransom the bankers are demanding.  There are men and women unemployed throughout the country because we cannot get money from the bankers without a high ransom.  We require money to develop the resources of the nation in various respects, but we are prevented from undertaking <Col N="986" /> that development, because it is not economic to pay the price for loans which is demanded by the banks. These banks are using the nation's credit, but the nation has to pay dearly for the moneys to develop and finance these activities.  It is necessary for the life of the people, and especially for the life of the workers that these amenities should be developed.  I do not like this Budget.  It is a half-hearted Budget. Its worst feature is the intimation conveyed by the Minister that the Government is going to permit prices to increase while setting its face against the workers having any increase in wages.  That is the sort of thing which the workers will never accept, and the Minister who embarks on that course is going to cause more industrial strife in this country than any other Minister.</P>

      <P>Would I be in order in asking one question?  I am not going to make a speech, but just to ask a question.  In the course of his Budget speech the Minister indicated under five heads the savings proposed to be made.  Later on he states that he expects to get about £400,000. Would the Minister be able to segregate or divide that between the five different heads?  I presume that before the general debate the Minister will amplify how, under each of these heads, he expects to get that £400,000.</P>

      <P>There is one point on which, perhaps, the Minister could give an answer now.  He has made a statement of his intention to borrow for the purpose of making good the fall in revenue, of a sum of £1,620,000.  In so far as he has spoken of additional taxation and borrowing, he has confined himself to covering that amount&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In his Budget statement the Minister has confined himself to the fall in revenue of £1,620,000, but his <Col N="987" /> speech conveys to the House that a large increase in expenditure over the expenditure already decided upon is to be undertaken.  Are we to get a statement as to how that expenditure is going to be met?  I put that question to the Minister for Finance.  That is a matter on which the House would require information.</P>

      <P>Financial Resolution No. 1 relates to the proposal to increase the standard rate of income-tax for the reasons set out.  It has been moved and is now available for debate.  For the reasons set out in the speech of the Leader of the Opposition we propose to divide on each Financial Resolution imposing extra taxation.  The procedure adopted has always been to facilitate the Minister on his Financial Resolutions, and to forbear from speaking at any length on the several Resolutions, the general debate being taken upon the last Resolution.  In regard to most of the Financial Resolutions to-day, we propose to follow the usual procedure.  It may, however, be necessary to depart from it in regard to one or two others.  We do not propose to go into the merits of this income-tax proposal now, but for the general <Col N="988" /> reasons laid down in the speech by the Leader of the Opposition we propose to challenge a division upon it, and to vote against it.</P>

It is assumed on this side of the House, though we have not had the courtesy of any information, that the Minister for Supplies intends to make that statement on the Financial Resolution dealing with the sugar duty, in which event members from this side of the House will reply. It is not intended to withhold from the Minister his Financial Resolutions.  It is the intention of the Opposition to give him the resolutions in the usual way after the usual procedure, and to take the main debate on the final Resolution, but we reserve our right, in the special circumstances created by the Minister for Supplies, to spend some time over the Resolution which affects sugar taxation.</P>

      <P>Let us not get into a hopeless tangle through a misunderstanding. It has always been the practice that, on this day, specific inquiries solely for the purpose of eliciting information are addressed to the Minister, and no general debate is initiated. If the position is taken up that every inquiry of a purely objective kind is to be treated as a challenge to-day, it means that we will end up in a hopeless tangle of misunderstanding, which may embarrass the conduct of business very considerably.  There is nothing unusual in asking the Ministers questions, but there is something very unusual indeed in all the Ministers of the Cabinet taking example from the Minister for Supplies and, if I may lapse into the vernacular, telling members of this House to go to hell, because that is what it amounts to.  Remember, if Parliament is to carry on, the rights of the Opposition must be recognised, and it is their right to force the Minister to disclose information by the process of question and answer.  I know that Ministers can kick over the traces, and simply say they will not play; but, if they do, parliamentary procedure becomes impossible, and the Opposition is forced back on the method it has of attracting public attention to the Ministers' refusal to conform to normal parliamentary procedure. Surely, Ministers are not going to take up the position that they will answer no questions at all?  We know that the Ministers have in reserve the guillotine and so forth, but we also know that we have certain constitutional rights, and will use them if we have got to, although we do not want to do so.</P>

      <P>On Resolution No. 1. So far as we are concerned we see this Budget as a whole, not merely as a series of proposals for the increase of taxation.  A view has been expressed on behalf of the Party in connection with the Budget.  It seems to us that in this Budget the Government not only fails to appreciate the problems confronting the country, and fails to offer any solution to those who are going to suffer most severely in the crisis through which the country is now passing, but definitely commits itself to a policy of trying to prevent the workers from securing any increase whatever in their standards of remuneration to compensate them for increases in prices which the Government will not prevent occurring, and we have taken the view that we will vote against all those proposals for increased taxation in view of that statement in the Budget.</P>

      <P>Might I make a suggestion?  There is some likelihood of discussions on Resolution No. 2 and Resolution No. 3, dealing with sugar, and if we could leave these over, with the permission of the House, until we deal with the other Resolutions, before the General Resolution, it might be more satisfactory.</P>

      <P>In certain circumstances we regard all these Resolutions as equally objectionable and unjustifiable, but in view of the fact that it may <Col N="995" /> facilitate the Minister in disposing of the Resolution, which must be disposed of one way or another before the House adjourns to-day, we are prepared to fall in with the suggestion.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister outline now, for the information of the House, approximately what price this Resolution will cause to be charged hereafter for a package of ten cigarettes which is at present selling for 6½d. and for half a quarter of twist tobacco which is at present selling at 1/5?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is expected that the increase in the tax will lead to a penny increase on the package of 20 cigarettes and to 2d. an ounce on the plug tobacco.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>So it means 4d. on the half-quarter of tobacco.  For the ordinary countryman who buys twist tobacco that is an appalling charge.  I do not mind about the cigarettes but for the poor fellow who buys half a quarter of tobacco for his pipe, 4d. is terrible.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say what examination of the situation has been made that assures him that this increased tax will actually bring in the revenue that he estimates?  He intimated in his speech that from an examination of the situation he did not think that this tax would cut down the consumption of tobacco.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>All the usual sources have been tapped for information and I have consulted with all the officials who have been dealing with matters of this kind for a considerable period and I am satisfied with the estimates they have given me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated in reply to Deputy Dillon that he anticipated that the extra cost on 20 cigarettes would be 1d.  One penny was the figure he gave.  An extra duty of 8d. a lb. was placed on tobacco in May last and as a result of that extra 8d. there was an additional penny placed upon 20 cigarettes.  I do not want now to push the Minister beyond his inquiries but surely the two things do not seem to fit in to one another. By reason of an addition of 8d. in the lb. on tobacco, cigarettes went up by a 1d. on 20.  Now that we are placing 2/8 on it, surely more than an extra 1d. will be charged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, it naturally follows that once a tax is put on you have to take into account the extra amount that will go on for the various services.  I thought it would go up at least 1d.  Perhaps I am understating. Perhaps it would be more than that.  I would not like to discuss the Resolution now.  If the Deputy might ask me the question again I will have more precise information</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as the 2/8 is concerned, that is 32 pence and as there are 16 ounces of tobacco in a lb. <Col N="999" /> it follows, according to Cocker, that there will be 2d. an ounce extra on the <Col N="1000" /> ordinary tobacco.  I suppose we are not disturbing Cocker's calculations.</P>

      <P>I want to repeat, Sir, the question which I put to the Minister for Finance in connection with the previous Resolution: whether the full force of this new tax is going to be passed on to the small breweries?  The Minister's predecessor gave preference, and preference was also given by the Minister for Finance in the late Government, to the small breweries.  I am aware that some of the small breweries in this State have, for a number of years, had to fight fairly hard for their existence.  They give a considerable amount of employment.  I believe that the Minister for Supplies is fairly well acquainted with the position from the employment point of view, and that he is aware of the danger of the good employment now given in the small breweries being wiped out.  This is one of the things calculated to bring them over the border.  Would the Minister for Finance give further consideration to the question of passing on this very heavy tax to the small breweries, as I believe that, under existing circumstances, they are hardly able to bear it.</P>

      <P>I support what Deputy Davin has said.  I have in mind a small brewery of the kind mentioned by Deputy Davin, which has been in business in West Cork for 200 years. I am told that the effect of any further increase in taxation, or the absence of special consideration, will mean that that business will be completely closed down.  In view of what I know about the position in that part of the country, the possibility of a considerable <Col N="1007" /> number of men being added to the unemployment list is very serious, having regard to the dislocation which has already taken place.  I support the plea made by Deputy Davin, and I ask the Minister to make an exception in favour of the smaller breweries, because there is very good reason for doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot make any exception in favour of the small breweries.  A concession has, however, been in operation since the Finance Act of 1932.  That has worked out in favour of the small brewery.  There is a rebate of 5/- per standard barrel on the first 5,000 barrels brewed, and I understand that concession is appreciated by the small breweries.  It is not proposed to interfere with that in any way.  I assume that, as in the case of every other tax, the breweries will not pay this tax.  It will be passed on to the consumer.</P>

The licensed trader sometimes gets a certain amount of abuse because of the difference in price between the two areas.  It would be well that the consumer should know the prices so that he would have an opportunity of making comparisons with those in Northern Ireland and in England.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter raised by Deputy Davin and Deputy Murphy deserves a little more consideration than the Minister has given it.  It is true that the small brewers have the concession to which the Minister has referred, but the situation now created gives rise to new circumstances.  It is right, also, to remember that although it is natural to plead the case of the small man, Guinness' brewery &mdash; the biggest brewery in the world&mdash;is encountering great difficulties owing to circumstances over which we have no control.  It is true that one of the best employers in this country is Guinness' Brewery.  It is true that the men working there are as well treated as, or better treated than, industrial workers in Great Britain or any other part of the world.  Guinness' Brewery have difficulties confronting them in the magnificent export trade which they built up for the benefit of this country as well as for their own benefit.  Let nobody imagine that the taxation we are imposing here is not going to hurt them.  It is.  I am not at all sure that by putting on this taxation the Government is not crippling a great industry which is struggling with exceptional difficulties which we are not in a position to relieve.  It seems a strange contribution on the part of the Government of our own country that when one of our greatest industries is so embarrassed by international affairs we should strike it another blow.  The House ought to bear in mind that in enacting any legislation which affects the legitimate interests of a great industry of that kind we are hurting not only the industry but the country as a whole, as well as the men who are <Col N="1009" /> working in that industry, with their wives and families.</P>
      <P>Now, I come to the case of the small brewery.  It is true that the small breweries have a concession.  It is true, as the Minister says, that the normal practice of the brewery is to pass on any additional tax but I think the Minister will agree with me that when that tax is passed on, together with all the other taxes in this Budget and the Budget introduced last April, the consumption of beer is bound to fall.  Any of us with experience of industry and trade knows that, when one's overhead expenses have been reduced to a minimum, every drop in output makes the burden of overhead expenses more unbearable still.  We all know that in the last few years these breweries were constrained to reduce their overhead expenses to the lowest possible penny. They cannot get them any lower and keep their doors open.  If, as a result of taxation imposed here, the consumption of stout or beer is further reduced, it may mean that they will have to close their doors.  For a great industry like Guinness', it may mean substantially reduced profits, even substantial financial losses, but, possibly, they could carry on, on accumulated reserves, through a period of emergency. But we are dealing with small industries whose reserves have been eaten up by past adversity and whose overhead costs have been brought down to the lowest possible point consistent with their keeping the door open.  Reduce their output or the consumption of their product and you may close the door.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am perfectly certain that the Minister for Finance had no more desire to close up these small men than I have, or than Deputy Murphy has.  Would he not be well advised to invite these small brewers to come forward and put their case before him; and, if they can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Department of Finance&mdash;which is by no means a foolish body, and which is well accustomed to reviewing and checking figures lying before them&mdash;that, literally, a reduction in output will close the door, would he not then reconsider their position and say: &ldquo;While we hope to relieve all brewers of this <Col N="1010" /> tax as soon as the emergency passes, even while it endures we will take steps to prevent any brewer being forced to close down and to disemploy the men who are working for him.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon is partly correct in what he says in reference to Messrs.  Guinness and Company.  It is quite true that they are very good employers, but he knows as well as every other Deputy that Guinness and Company have been gradually transferring a considerable amount of what is known as British production to another brewery in London.  I am aware that the withdrawal of a large portion of the British production has caused considerable unemployment in Messrs.  Guinness' and that it has caused heavy losses to shipping and transport companies which have hitherto carried the whole British production to Britain.</P>
      <P>That is a deliberate policy of the biggest brewers in the country, and, apparently, the Minister for Finance &mdash;even the new Minister for Finance&mdash; will not possibly be able to influence them to change their policy in that direction.  If, in addition to the withdrawal by Messrs.  Guinness of what is known as the British production, we are going to have&mdash;on top of that&mdash;as a result of the imposition of further taxation, the closing down of small breweries, it is going to add to the amount of unemployment.  I put it seriously to the Minister that he should adopt the suggestion which has been made by Deputy Dillon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure that he can get at very short notice, full particulars of the financial position of some of these small brewers.  I am informed by some of them in my own constituency that the position was put fully before the Ministry a very short time ago.  The Ministry have their own methods of checking up on figures of that kind.  It seems to me that it is worth very serious consideration.  If we cannot stop Messrs.  Guinness &amp; Company from developing their present policy, we can keep our own small breweries in existence and can only do that by not penalising them unduly at a time when they <Col N="1011" /> are unable to bear taxation of this kind.</P>
    <P>Finally, if the Minister cannot see his way to exempt them from this additional taxation, could he not see his way to consider increasing the number of standard barrels which would be entitled to exemption under the existing law.  In that way he would encourage small breweries to develop business better and make room for the trade which must be in this country if Messrs.  Guinness are going to reduce their production.  If the Minister cannot see his way to accept the suggestion to exempt them from this particular duty, he should consider the advisability of doubling the number of standard barrels under which they would be entitled to the old exemption of 5/- per standard barrel.  Something must be done if these people are going to continue in existence.  Their disappearance from some of the towns where they are working to-day would mean the closing down, for employment purposes, of the few small towns where the existence of the local population is ensured by the good employment provided in these small breweries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to appeal to the Minister in regard to the small breweries.  It is quite true&mdash;as the Minister has said&mdash;that a rebate of 5/- per standard barrel was given some few years ago.  That is sufficient to indicate that the Minister was convinced of the necessity of safeguarding the interests of the small brewer.  There are three breweries in the constituency which I represent and all of them have passed through most difficult times during the course of the past few years.  They managed, however, to give the same amount of employment as they gave formerly when things were not so bad, during the previous six or seven years.  I should like also to remind the Minister that breweries and distilleries while in themselves they give much needed employment, afford also a good deal of employment in other trades ancillary to that of brewing and distilling.  I refer, for instance, to the farmers, large numbers of whom grow barley.  County Wexford is one of the best barley growing districts to <Col N="1012" /> be found in the Twenty-Six Counties; they are sure of a local market as far as barley is concerned.  If, by the extra taxation which it is proposed to impose on the brewing industry, they are compelled to reduce their output, it will have a very adverse affect on the community, and in view of the fact that the Minister for Agriculture has sent out an S.O.S. to grow as much food-stuffs as possible, I think the Minister would be well advised to reconsider this whole question in the light of what has been stated here and try to do something which would not put an impossible burden on these small breweries, thus endangering their future and consequently producing more unemployment.</P>

      <P>I would like if the Minister for Supplies would have a word with the Minister for Finance in regard to the tax on beer.  As the Minister for Supplies surely knows&mdash;he represents South Dublin City in this House, and is surely aware of it&mdash;the number of economic casualties in this war is already very heavy in his constituency, and I think he would be very well advised to inform the Minister for Finance of the disastrous effect that this tax will have, and the resultant unemployment therefrom.  I would seriously request the Minister to exercise his good offices and discuss this matter with the Minister for Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>It would; that would be asking something about private trading.  If there is a general reduction in the consumption of beer&mdash; and I am rather doubtful that there will be any reduction&mdash;I think it will be very small.  The tax that we are proposing to put on this year, at any rate, amounts to £50,000, for the rest of this year, out of well over £3,000,000. <Col N="1013" /> In the case of Guinness &amp; Company their export, of course, does not pay us anything, but what is consumed here will bear the tax.  I do not anticipate that there will be a very considerable falling off in consumption.  From the point of view strictly of the Minister for Finance, I hope there will not be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Ceallaigh Mr. Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it is good for the Minister for Finance.  Regarding what Deputies say about Guinness', as far as the Minister for Finance and the Exchequer are concerned, it applies to all these brewers and breweries.  I cannot promise that we will grant any extension of the rebate, or any further special facilities to the smaller brewers. I think, as a matter of fact, that if we adopted Deputy Davin's suggestion, and doubled the number of barrels, it probably would not be any help to the smaller men, because those who realise that they have benefited from this concession do not produce even 5,000 <Col N="1014" /> barrels per year, so that we would only be helping their larger competitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose a man who is not producing 5,000 barrels puts before the Minister the position: &ldquo;I am down to rock-bottom; reduce my output any more, and my plant becomes uneconomic and I simply cannot carry on; I must close&rdquo;&mdash;as we know happened to a great many of the old distilleries, they simply closed down and went out &mdash;if that situation is presented to him, is it sane for a short emergency to allow those plants to go out of production? It may be that there are none such, and then the business goes on, but suppose a man comes to him and says: &ldquo;If you put us out, you know that you cannot reopen places like these,&rdquo; and if he proves that case, will the Minister consider it?</P>

I know he referred to-day to the fact that this means an increase of 2d. per glass of proof spirit, and that whiskey, as sold to the public, is so much under proof, but taking all things into consideration, and the profits that people will look to get, does it not mean that whiskey is likely to advance by 2d. per glass?</P>

      <P>Might I ask the Minister does he not fear that this tax will almost kill the distilling industry altogether?  Has not the consumption gone down considerably within the past ten years, due to the price charged, and is it not possible that this tax on an industry which gave very considerable employment in this country, will be the final blow to the industry, and that as a result of the imposition of the extra 2d. per glass, because it probably will be 2d., consumption will entirely cease?  At the present moment, on account of the price, whiskey is a real luxury, and people are not buying it.  All Irish distillers say that their trade, owing to the decrease in consumption, is disappearing. Is this another effort, by increasing the price, to kill the industry altogether?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of questions were on the Order Paper to-day relating to sugar supplies and sugar prices, and I informed the Deputies who asked those questions that I proposed to reply to them by means of a general statement. I am very glad to have the opportunity of making a general statement concerning them, and to give the House all the information that it is possible to give it concerning sugar, the reason for the increase in the price of sugar, the circumstances that affected the distribution of sugar in the past, and that we think will affect the distribution of sugar in the future.</P>
      <P>On the 1st November the Irish Sugar Company announced an increase in its price for sugar, equivalent to an advance of 1½d. per lb. in the retail price.  That increase in the retail price of sugar here brought it up to, and only up to, the prevailing retail price in N. Ireland and in Great Britain. In fact, the retail price of sugar in Northern Ireland and in Great Britain has been fixed at 4½d. per lb. since the 27th September.</P>
      <P>It is, perhaps, desirable to divide the explanation of the reason for that increase in price into two parts.  One part of that explanation was given to the House to-day by the Minister for Finance in his statement.  The increase in the duty upon sugar, both the customs duty and the excise duty, represents ¾d. of the 1½d. increase in the price of sugar.  It is true that, since 1st November to date, the Irish Sugar Company has been receiving 1½d. more for the sugar sold by it during that period than it had been receiving previously.  From this date forward it will be receiving only ¾d. more.  The reason for that arrangement I will explain later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1038" /> I do not know if Deputies require me to give them the reasons which, in the opinion of the Government, justify a higher tax on sugar as distinct from some other tax.  It is, of course, always easy, as was in fact demonstrated here to-day, to make a case against any particular tax.  No matter what particular taxes the Government proposed to deal with the present Exchequer situation, it would be possible for Deputies to make, in relation to each separate proposal, a case which might or might not be convincing.  It is much easier to oppose the imposition of new taxes, or additions to existing taxes, than to formulate counter proposals.  In fact, the only justification for an increase on sugar, tobacco, beer, tea or any other commodity, is the necessity for supplementing the revenue of the State.</P>
    <P>Everybody recognises that a higher tax upon sugar, or any other commodity, is going to cause an increase in its price, and, consequently, a certain amount of hardship.  These proposals are not made lightly.  They are not made without due consideration of their possible consequences.  They are made only because of the absolute necessities of the situation.  When the Government was faced with the fact that the war had so interfered with the normal revenues upon which it was depending to meet the cost of Government services this year that a deficiency of a substantial size at the end of the year was to be anticipated, it had one or two possible courses to take, or perhaps a combination of both courses.  It could, for instance, endeavour to offset that diminishing revenue by cutting down expenditure.  From many points of view that would be a preferable course, but clearly there were difficulties to be encountered.</P>
    <P>I am sure all Parties in this House will agree that, in present circumstances, with prices rising, as everybody must have expected them to rise, any serious cutting down of the social services would be an undesirable step to take.  Such reductions in expenditure, therefore, as we might seek, such economies as we might effect to offset diminishing revenues, would have to be on the limited range of services which are not combined under that general <Col N="1039" /> heading, social services.  We had, therefore, to face the difficulty that many of these services were expanding, and the very circumstances of the war were necessitating additional expenditures in one direction or another, and, whatever economies were being sought or made, they were likely to be offset by higher charges arising out of other services, and, consequently, there was, in fact, no alternative to supplementing the diminishing revenue from existing taxes other than by the imposition of new taxes.</P>
    <P>Once that decision was made, it was merely a question of picking the tax that would give the best return with the least difficulty.  We decided on a tax on sugar.  That tax will bring in, during the course of next year and in the present year, a substantial additional revenue to the State.  If the circumstances change, if the war ends, if the diminution in the national revenues, which the war causes, ceases, then a new condition of affairs will be created; but, in the circumstances that we are likely to be faced with, I am sure all Deputies will at least subscribe to the theory that the State must continue to pay its way; that we must endeavour to balance our Budget and see that the services properly chargeable against income are met by income.</P>
    <P>All Deputies give lip-service to that, even though they vote against the particular proposals brought in here from time to time to implement it.  This is one of the proposals.  I am sure there is no Deputy on the opposite benches who will attempt to deny the soundness of that principle, who will attempt to contest my contention that the diminishing revenues of the State resulting from war conditions must be supplemented by new revenues, secured on new taxes. As is the normal function of Opposition Parties, all those Deputies will, of course, vote against every proposal brought in here.  It is their privilege.</P>
    <P>The tax on sugar accounts for only half of the increase in the price of sugar.  I am sure every Deputy who gave any consideration to the matter expected there would be an increase in the price of sugar before the war ended, just as they must have realised that other commodities would also increase <Col N="1040" /> in price.  It is inevitable that over a great range of commodities war conditions are going to mean higher costs and, therefore, higher prices.  We can control, and are controlling, the element of profit in these prices.  We can ensure that at no stage in the process of manufacture or importation or distribution or sale are excess profits secured, but we cannot prevent an increase in costs.  Where imported commodities are concerned the reasons for these increased costs, or at least some of the reasons, are obvious&mdash;higher transport costs, higher insurance costs, as well as the conditions which would lead those selling the commodities to seek a higher price in any event.  We may be able in some cases to check these higher costs.  I mean we may be able to keep down prices, apart altogether from the limitation of profits, by the regulation of the methods of manufacture or importation or distribution, and we will try to do so.  But, we must face the fact that in this war, as in the last war, prices will tend to rise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton spoke strongly here to-day about the reference in the Minister for Finance's statement relating to salaries and wages.  It is, of course, possible to contemplate that everybody whose livelihood depends on his profits or upon his salary or his wages will endeavour to offset the rising cost of commodities by getting higher profits, higher salary, or higher wages.  That happened before, and, as a result of that upward movement of salaries, wages and profits after prices, prices moved still higher.  A general inflationary effect was produced, and prices spired until we got, in the last war, a price for sugar, not 4½d. per lb., but a price which persisted up to the middle of 1920, of 112/- per cwt., or 1/- per lb. In the middle of 1920 that price came down to 56/- per cwt., or 6d. per lb.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon spoke here to-day about the fact that maize-meal is costing, I think, 12/- a cwt.</P>

      <P>I was informed by people who were engaged in the bacon business and maize-meal business during the last war, that at the end of that war it was £32 a ton.  These figures <Col N="1041" /> appear astronomical in relation to the figures we are dealing with at the moment, but if we are to allow a general inflation of prices to proceed unchecked we will inevitably reach figures corresponding to them, perhaps not in relation to sugar or some other commodities, because circumstances have changed, but in relation to commodities as a whole.  Higher prices should mean a slight reduction in the standard of living all round.  If we take steps to ensure that the effect upon the standard of living is an all-round effect the reduction will be very slight indeed, but if individual sections here and there, those who are depending for their livelihood on the profits of businesses of one kind or another, those who get salaries, or sections of those who are paid by wages, are able to protect themselves, to see that their incomes are extended to correspond with the increase in prices, then the diminution in the standard of living of those who cannot so protect themselves will be much more pronounced and we will get, not merely a very uneven distribution of the burden which the war will involve, but a tendency for prices to rise much higher than they need, if we can keep a proper system of control. These matters, perhaps, do not directly relate to sugar, but I was led to refer to them by the references made here in the discussions to-day.</P>
      <P>So far as sugar is concerned, I think I can say with some confidence that the price for sugar which has now been fixed will be maintained for a very long period, if not for the whole of the war.</P>

      <P>I say now that we hope to be able to maintain that price.  Circumstances <Col N="1042" /> may make it impossible for us to do so; circumstances may make a reduction in that price possible, but it will be our aim, if we can do it, to keep that price unchanged as long as possible, and, if possible, to the termination of hostilities.  I could say that the whole of the increase in price, other than the increase due to this higher taxation, is attributable to this higher price of imported sugar.  As Deputies are aware, we are not producing in this country in this year all our requirements of sugar.  We will only produce from 56 to 60 per cent. of our requirement and the balance of our needs must be met by imported sugar, the price of which has gone up very considerably and the importation of which is going to involve a considerable increase in its cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the question of supplies in a moment.  We could, if we thought it good policy, keep the price of sugar unchanged, apart from this increase in taxation, until the last of the sugar to be produced by the Irish sugar factories had been sold and then increase the price of sugar by the full amount of the increased cost of imported sugar.  That would involve at that time a much larger increase than ¾d. per lb. and we thought it better policy to spread the higher cost of imported sugar over the whole of the sugar sold by the Sugar Company, whether home produced or imported.  In that way we can even out the price over the whole year and, I think, make it easier for the citizens as a whole to meet that price.  That is what in fact we have done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps it is desirable to give some indication of how the cost of imported sugar has risen.  It is, I think, necessary to bear in mind in that regard that the rise in the price of foreign sugar commenced long before the war. In fact, as between March and May of the present year the export price of British sugar rose from 7/7½d. to 10/6 per cwt.  The price of Dutch sugar rose from 7/9 to 10/3.  The price of Belgian sugar rose from 7/6 to 10/- and there <Col N="1043" /> were similar increases in the price of Continental sugar.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will allow me, I will develop the history of sugar prices for him.  That increase in the price of sugar had taken place some time previously.  Deputy Dillon said here to-day that the Sugar Company was making a profit upon the importation of foreign sugar which profit was transferred to the Exchequer.  The Sugar Company has not been making a profit upon the importation of foreign sugar for some considerable time past. Quite the reverse.  That arrangement was made some time ago, when the device of allowing all our requirements of imported sugar to be brought in by the Irish Sugar Company was first adopted.  At that time it was possible to import sugar at a slight profit as against the prevailing price for Irish sugar.  We arranged with the Sugar Company that any profit they so obtained would be transferred by means of licence fee to the Exchequer but for some time past there has been, in fast, no profit.  As I have said, the position was quite the reverse and, of course, under present circumstances, if the price of sugar had not been increased as from Monday last, the importation of foreign sugar would have resulted in very heavy loss indeed.  With the outbreak of the war, the export of sugar from all countries was cancelled or prohibited, except perhaps in the United States of America but in the United States of America the price went up very considerably.  It went up by 50 per cent. to which have to be added the increased costs of transport and insurance which represent almost another 40 per cent. increase.  We had here at the outbreak of hostilities a sufficiency of sugar to keep all our <Col N="1044" /> normal needs supplied until our own sugar factories came into production, and, as I mentioned, our own sugar factories will produce some sixty per cent. of our requirements.  So, on the 1st September, it looked as if our full requirements of sugar were available up to June or July of next year.</P>
      <P>We had, however, to take account of two factors which tended to interfere with the distribution of those supplies in the normal way.  Shortly before the war a well-known firm in Dublin published a series of advertisements urging people to lay in stocks of sugar and other commodities and, partly as a result of these advertisements, and partly arising out of a recollection of the circumstances of the last war, there was a considerable amount of panic buying of sugar.  The people who purchased that sugar stored it in their homes, and then tried to get their ordinary weekly requirements met by their grocers.  That panic buying in the first weeks of September created the possibility of the stocks of sugar available being unnecessarily exhausted before Irish sugar became available.</P>
      <P>We also had to take into account the possibility that Irish sugar would not become available upon the scheduled date by reason of the danger that the workers employed in the sugar factories, or their unions, would take advantage of the critical situation in which the company found itself, to press demands for higher wages or better conditions, and, in fact, they did so.  As Deputies well know, there were at least four strikes, or threatened strikes, in those factories right up to a few weeks before the campaign was due to commence.  On account of the abnormal buying in the first weeks of September, and the fear that home sugar production would not commence to schedule, we had to ration the distribution of sugar.  I use the term &ldquo;ration&rdquo; because it is the most convenient one to use.  What, in fact, we did was to distribute to wholesalers only the same quantity of sugar as they would normally require to meet the full demands of their customers.</P>

One cannot make a general statement in reference to a numerous class of persons, but whatever hoarding of sugar was done was done mainly by consumers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us proceed by way of speech rather than argument.  The quantity of sugar that went out from 1st January to the end of October was the same as last year and the previous year.  The quantity that went out from the 1st August to the end of October was practically the same as in 1937 and slightly less than in 1938.  In any event, so far as we could ensure it, the full normal supplies of sugar went out. At the same time, I realised that there was a likelihood of sugar released for consumption not reaching the consumers by reason of the fact that people expected a rise in price and that, consequently, it was desirable as soon as possible to get the price fixed over a long period and all those restrictions upon the distribution of sugar removed.  We got that.  On the 1st November the new price was fixed and announced and came into operation on that date, and, simultaneously, on that date all restrictions upon the distribution of sugar were removed.  Any person who wanted to buy sugar, even 100 tons, all he had to do was to put in his order and he would get it.  That is the position at the moment.  That was by reason of the fact that the sugar factories had at that date come into production and were producing <Col N="1047" /> here about 7,000 tons per week against a normal weekly consumption of 2,000 tons.</P>
      <P>We have now made an arrangement to supplement that production of our sugar factories by imported sugar, sufficient in quantity not merely to meet our requirements up to the commencing of the 1940-41 campaign, but to give us a substantial reserve in stock at that date, so that if difficulties should arise at the factories, either by reason of mechanical trouble, or organisational trouble, or labour trouble, the country will not be in the position of being left without sugar.  The present export price of sugar from Great Britain, as compared with 7/7½ per cwt. last March, is 19/4.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The price of sugar here was not changed.  The price of sugar, which was based on the assumption that imported sugar would be purchased for 7/- or 7/7 per cwt., was not increased when the price of imported sugar went up in May, and no alteration was made until 1st November, even though the price of imported sugar had gone up substantially.  That represents more than 100 per cent. increase in the price of sugar.  If we adopted the alternative device of keeping the price unchanged until we were consuming only imported sugar, a much bigger increase than three-farthings would be necessitated.  We decided against that.</P>
      <P>This increase in the price of sugar is sufficient merely to cover the cost of manufacturing sugar here and of buying sugar from abroad.  There is no element of profit in it.  I want Deputies to get that point clearly.  The Irish Sugar Company is not a profit-making institution in the ordinary way.  All its ordinary shares are owned by the Government and if it makes a profit that pays any dividend on the ordinary shares it goes to the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1048" /> In fact, during this year it paid no such dividend.  There is no element of unusual profit in that price for sugar. Not merely is that the position concerning the Irish Sugar Company, but it is also true to say that the price now fixed for sugar gives to the Irish sugar wholesalers and retailers a smaller margin of profit than the price fixed under British and Northern Ireland control gives wholesalers and retailers in these areas.  It is clear, therefore, that the price of the sugar we are dealing with is one created by facts.  You cannot argue against facts.  You cannot alter facts.  You can, of course, object to the imposition of a new tax upon sugar.  You can propose, instead of having a tax on sugar, that we should have a tax on tea, or a tax on some other commodity; but, on the assumption that we must tax something to get revenue to meet the cost of State services, a tax on sugar is justified. Over and above that increased tax, the increase in the price of sugar is due entirely to the higher cost of imported sugar, and that we cannot alter.</P>

We have to purchase that at the prevailing price, and, in order to offset that price, we have to effect a small all-round increase in the price of sugar to keep the price level until June within reasonable limits.</P>

All restrictions on the distribution of sugar have been removed, and consequently the various complaints, voiced in this House from time to time, need not arise again, nor is there any question as to the need for imposing a rationing system.  People speak lightly of a rationing system for sugar, without contemplating the very grave problem involved.  Perhaps, if they <Col N="1050" /> read the newspapers carefully, they will know some of the difficulties being experienced in another country in the introduction of a rationing system for foodstuffs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A system that would operate fairly would take a long time to prepare, would involve a large staff, and cost a considerable amount of money.  We have one rationing system in operation.  It applies to petrol.  The consumers of petrol are about 3 per cent. of the population.  We have some experience of the difficulties involved, the organisation required, and the cost that arises in the operation of a rationing system in relation to that commodity. When one considers a commodity like sugar, consumed by practically 100 per cent. of the population, and the problem of introducing a rationing system in relation to it, one is appalled.  No need for a rationing system will arise.  In the last war there was a very serious scarcity of sugar, and apart from the rise in price, it was altogether out of proportion to anything that has happened or that is expected in this war.  There was a very serious cut in supplies then, with the result that large numbers of people had to go without sugar or had to resort to other means of sweetening their food.  That need not arise here. It certainly will not arise until 1941, if at all, unless there is a very violent and fundamental change in the whole world system in the interval.  I think that has been guarded against.</P>

      <P>I should like to mention, as a matter of interest, that we have arranged to supplement the output of our own sugar factories by purchasing raw sugar from abroad.  Heretofore, we supplemented our own production by the importation of refined sugar, but we have succeeded in making arrangements for the purchase of a substantial quantity of raw sugar which will be refined here.  It is the first time that process will be carried on here.  It will involve the employment of a number of extra men in the sugar factories for a substantially longer period, and will give sugar, I think, at a somewhat lower price than we would have obtained if we had purchased it at the time.</P>

      <P>I could not say.  I will be very glad to answer any questions that Deputies may care to put to me. I ask them to understand that the price of sugar was not increased out of any desire to make profits, or to improve the position of the sugar company, or to annoy the country, as has been suggested.  The price was increased by reason of the altered facts of the situation, and it does not contain within it any element of profit whatever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand, Sir, that we are now discussing Resolutions Nos. 2 and 3.  A book has recently been published by a man called Seán O Faoláin, called <i>De Valera</i>, and in the course of that book the writer says that one of the most exasperating things about Mr. de Valera is that, when he is doing wrong and knows that he is doing wrong, he is quite prepared to spend hours explaining to Dáil Éireann, or to anybody who is listening to him, that <Col N="1056" /> he is doing right.  Now, that disease, apparently, is catching, because that is what the Minister for Supplies has occupied himself in doing for the past three-quarters of an hour, and he knows that the circumstances surrounding sugar supplies in this country are sufficiently complicated to permit him substantially to bewilder the public mind in regard to this matter.  The plain fact is that the people of this country are being plundered by the Government to the tune of 14/- per cwt. on all the sugar consumed here; and the chopping and changing and price references of the Minister, in this connection, are all so much eye-wash, and the Minister knows that.  If it be true that the Minister arrived at the 1st November without a single bag of sugar, then, in the name of goodness, for what were we paying him during lowest past two years?  Sugar fell to the lowest price for that commodity in 1939.  The Minister was warned, as far back as September of last year, that world affairs were boiling up to a crisis.  He knew that the British Government were accumulating supplies of sugar for the past two or three years, and yet he sat quiet&mdash;although he had a committee to deal with this matter&mdash;and never bought a bag of sugar.  That was his own story.  He tells us that, two months after the war was declared, he found that he had not a bag of sugar.  Is not that what he tells us?  It was under those circumstances, he says, that he had to increase the price of sugar.  Well, if that were true, what were we paying him for? There was no conceivable difficulty about that Government putting two years' supply of sugar into store in this country at 7/9 per cwt.  Does the Minister deny it?</P>

      <P>We were asked to give the Government emergency powers to deal with circumstances which they described as &ldquo;unprecedented.&rdquo;  In the course of the debate that took place, several amendments were put up by the Opposition.  It is right that the country should know that the Government and the Opposition had several consultations in the progress of that debate for the purpose of removing anomalies and objections to the Bill and facilitating its passage, so that the Government would have the powers they sought.  One of the subjects on which negotiations took place was that concerned with ensuring that the powers to be given would never be used for the purpose of imposing taxation without reference to the Oireachtas. I believe a provision to that effect was put into the Bill by Dáil Eireann by consent.  It was a mean, cheap, and dishonest thing to use those powers to permit the Sugar Company, in collaboration with the Government, to raise the price of sugar by 14/- per cwt. in order to collect revenue for the Government.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that you can express opposition to any taxation, that, whether it is necessary or not, you can pick holes in any tax. The Government has come before this House to-day and called for immense additional taxation.  They say it is to meet an emergency.  I think it right in connection with this tax to say that if a Government in this country came before the House and said that the sovereignty and independence of this State were imperilled and that to defend it the property and exertions of every citizen must be availed of, I believe this Party and every other Party would say &ldquo;Take our incomes, our property and our persons, if need be, to protect the sovereignty and independence of this State.&rdquo;  But we also say that if you impose burdens which are going to weigh most heavily on the poorest sections of the community, you should tell us, before we consent to that imposition, what the emergency is.  You should tell us what you are going to spend the money on.  You should tell us why you must have immense additional revenue.  The Government have not done that.  When they do, the next question we shall put to them is &ldquo;What contribution are the existing services to make by way of economies before we start piling burdens on the poor?&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When we talk in terms of 14/- per cwt., it means very little but when you think of it in terms of the individual who is buying sugar in the small shops, it means a great deal. I am thinking of the individual who is earning 27/- a week and who has four children and a wife.  I am thinking of one such individual.  When he buys a 1/4-st. of sugar, he pays on that 1/4-st. in additional taxation 6d. out of his wages every week.  Combined with that, there are other items of taxation imposed by the Budget which confront us here at present.  When that individual finds himself called upon to make that additional weekly contribution of 6d., out of a total revenue of 27/- spread over six persons, he is informed <Col N="1060" /> by the Minister for Finance that there will be a strong temptation to demand corresponding increases in wages, salaries and profits and that it will be the purpose of the Government to deter any such request from being put forward.</P>
      <P>Suppose a man is working for me and drawing from me a weekly wage of 27/-, and he is now required to pay 6d. per week more for his sugar, does the Minister think it right that he should not ask me to bear part of the burden? How can any person drawing £1,700 a year or, as we are, drawing £480 a year, turn with lofty paternalism to a man who is raising a family on 27/- a week and tell him he must make his contribution to the safety of the State to the tune of 6d. on every 1/4-st. of sugar he buys?  Let us not stoop to the meanness of stirring up persons who are less fortunate against those who happen to have more.  The urgent thing is to face calmly the problems this Budget is going to create.  You cannot impose taxation of this kind on persons living on the very border line and tell them they are not to ask for increase of wages.  They have got to get increased wages or starve and they would be fools if they starved.  They are being asked to make these contributions, to endure this acute suffering and, so far as I can find out, for no reason at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Finance, when he comes to reply to this discussion, to tell me what his advice is to the 27/- a week agricultural labourer with four children and a wife.  I know such a man.  Would the Minister tell me what he is to do?  I do not suggest for a moment that the Minister is indifferent to this problem, but the man has reached the point when his children are hungry, he has literally reached the point when the health of his children is menaced by malnutrition.  Is it seriously contended that any situation exists in this State or threatens this State which demands that he go to his children and tell them to starve a little faster?  I say there is not; and I believe that the bulk of the Deputies sitting on the Fianna Fáil Benches believe there is not.  But they are scared to say so.  They have got an immensely heavy responsibility and if <Col N="1061" /> they had the courage to discharge it they could protect the people from this great wrong.</P>
    <P>The expenditure which is called for to justify taxation of this character is foolish, improvident and reckless, as I hope to show, Sir, in the debate on the General Resolution.  The Fianna Fáil Party can prevent this cruel imposition on those least able to defend themselves. The Government can prevent the starting of a vicious circle of rising costs all through the State, which such a proposal must start, by forbearing from doing this thing.  I do not believe this money is needed; if it were, I believe economy could provide it.  I am certain of that.  Again, if this money were wanted, in the name of common prudence why not take it out of tea?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Sixpence, if you like; but the result of it would be that the people could adjust their lives to a lower grade of tea and do with it for the duration of the emergency.  No person can escape the impact of this tax, and the poor can escape it least, except by reducing their consumption of sugar. The veriest tyro in this House knows that this will tell heaviest on the children of the poor.  The Minister talks glibly of not allowing prices to be raised.  The prices of jam, of confectionery, of everything in which sugar is used, must rise, and all these rises in cost must be met out of the wages of the people, they must be financed out of wages already quite low.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From several points of view the tax is bad, and the Minister, before it is too late, should withdraw it and try to take common council with people who are willing to help him.  He should tell us, firstly, what the emergency is for which money is required over and <Col N="1062" /> above the normal.  Tell us what it is and we are quite prepared to do our utmost to help to surmount it.  If there is an emergency which you can describe to us&mdash;and we are entitled to know it to-day, if it exists&mdash;we will gladly help you to ascertain the cost and to meet that cost by prudent and reasonable economies such as you might have expected your economy committee to produce. If an emergency of that character threatens the sovereignty and independence of the State, we will help you to get money to meet it, but not by imposing on the backs of those least able to bear it an absolutely unbearable burden, not by proposals initiating in this country a course of inflation which may land us all in perdition.</P>
    <P>That is a fair offer.  It is meant; it can be taken up.  What is the emergency? Let us measure the cost of it together, deduct the economies and find the balance.  If that challenge is not taken up, it is because the Government is so incompetent to face the duties which lie before it, and because it is so lazy that it would sooner hit the weakest than think out means of protecting those whom they are bound to protect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two questions regarding which I am anxious to get some information from the Minister.  When did the importation of sugar to which he refers take place?  Did any importations take place during the months of September or October?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Some sugar came in then, but I have no idea of the quantity. All contracts for the delivery of sugar in the period were cancelled on the outbreak of war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say if any sugar was imported in the first two months of the war?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There were only some small quantities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister pointed out that there were various ways of dealing with the problem that the Government had to face.  One was by attacking the question of economies. <Col N="1063" /> That was not done.  The Minister gave reasons which were most unconvincing, as he avoided mentioning places where the economies could have taken place and where the Opposition, again and again in the last 12 months, has pointed out that economies could have been made.  Because the Government refused to take that particular line, we are now faced with the proposition of putting ¾d. of a tax on sugar, plus the extra ¾d. to cover the cost of some sugar that is to come in after next June.  That is the position, is it not? Does he not agree that, at a time when unemployment is rife in this country, any system would be preferable to the one he has adopted?</P>
      <P>He says he could not ration it, but in practice this is what he is doing.  He is rationing the supply for people who need it most.  It is they who cannot get other articles of food.  Poor children&mdash;particularly the young&mdash;must have sugar and foods containing sugar. Is it not they who are going to be hit by this?  The rich man can bear this tax of ¾d. a lb. quite easily, he can find substitutes by using other articles of food that are not taxed.  Surely the Minister is not so far removed from the actualities of household keeping in this country as not to know that sugar is one of the main staple food articles, especially for the young.</P>
      <P>What has he done?  Either he has put before them an impossible situation by this increased price, including the tax, or else he is asking them&mdash;at a time when other things are dearer, when wages are lower and more uncertain&mdash; to go without sugar or with a lesser quantity.  Surely, of all the different methods of dealing with this problem that faces the Government, they have deliberately opted for the one that would cause, not merely the most trouble and most discontent&mdash;I think even the Minister is aware of that discontent already&mdash;but also that would cause the most damage to the general health of the community.  Why was it done?  The answer to that possibly deals more with the General Resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No real argument has been put forward <Col N="1064" /> for any increase in taxation, and certainly none for this particular increase in taxation on sugar.  The Minister told us quite glibly that he did not think an increase would have to be faced for a reasonable time, possibly not until the end of the war.  Is not that so?  Three weeks ago the same Minister told us that he saw no immediate reason to anticipate any immediate rise in the price of sugar. Did the Minister make that statement in this House?  What is the value of the statement he makes now?  What value can we attach to any statement coming from the Minister on any of these matters?  Anybody listening to the various statements the Minister made in this connection here on 27th September and 18th October would be convinced that there was no reason to expect any shortage of sugar and no reason to expect an increase in the price of sugar, due either to Government action or any other action.  What comfort is it to the poor people to know that at least half of this price is due to Government taxation?  Did the Minister not foresee the possibility of that when he made his statement on 18th October?  When Deputy McMenamin interrupted the Minister's speech and asked for an explanation of that statement, the Minister said he would give it.  I waited, but I am not aware that the Minister tried to explain away that statement.</P>
    <P>Does he deny he made it?  Was his vision of the future so short that he could not say three weeks ahead what the position would be in respect of one of the principal commodities for which he was responsible, and that is the Ministry on which we have to rely to guide us through this crisis?  No wonder the finances of the State are in the state they are in and no wonder that the people are now faced with this increased price of sugar, even though they had it on the pledged word of the Minister three weeks ago, speaking absolutely coldly and deliberately in this Assembly, that he saw no reason for anticipating an increase in the price of sugar.  Had we ever any reason to believe statements made by the Minister, and how can anybody in the country pay the slightest attention to <Col N="1065" /> any assurance he gives after that? There has been no attempt at explanation, although he promised 20 minutes ago to give an explanation.</P>
    <P>The Minister boasted&mdash;and if there had been a sufficient supply of sugar in, the question of taxation would have to be faced in a different manner, or else the complaint of profiteering would have come out more clearly&mdash; that for 12 months past they had been giving all their attention to the building up of a proper supply of essential commodities.  I have pointed out already that, so far as one of these commodities, bran, is concerned, the result was a complete shortage when the crisis came, and I asked did that apply to the other commodities for which the Minister was responsible.  We now find that that applies to sugar.  Had he enough to go on to face a crisis?  No, nor up to the end of October, and we are promised by this Minister, whose promises three weeks can falsify, that there will be no further increase or that the Government will make every effort to see that there is no further increase.  Will the efforts be as effective as those he made in the last three weeks?  On what is he now making his promise?  On what the price of sugar, plus transport, plus the possibility of getting it in, will be next June and July?  The Minister, who could not see three weeks ahead in the comparatively normal times, so far as transport is concerned, of the last three weeks, now prophesies to us on the price he is going to pay for sugar next June and July, and he asks the House to take his statement seriously.  There were some Deputies of his own Party listening to that speech.  I wonder was one of them convinced?  I wonder was the Minister himself convinced that he had a case?</P>
    <P>Of the various articles which could be taxed&mdash;and I do not believe there was an excuse for any of the taxes put on to-day&mdash;why pick on sugar?  The Minister's colleague, on a well-known occasion, stressed here that sugar ought not to be one of the commodities taxed, and he convincingly explained the reason; but that is the commodity chosen by the Government in respect <Col N="1066" /> of which the poor man should be asked to do his bit.  His bit for what?  For this expensive ringside seat which we are having.  We are looking on at the struggle, but apparently we would feel out of it unless we spent money on it, even though we are not in it, and to do his bit in that respect the poor man is asked to pay.  Where is the money to go?  Not to the producer, but to the Government in the way of taxation, or to the Sugar Company to meet the losses they are going to incur next June and July.  We must tax sugar now in order to meet that contingency when, as the Minister well knows, he has not the slightest idea of what is going to occur then.  That is the defence we get. We got a statement from the Minister which was most unconvincing, but which is more than we are ever likely to get from his colleague on the subject of finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. A. Byrne Mr. A. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>What I should like the Minister to explain is how it is that, in the last week of October, the small shopkeepers and family grocers in Dublin could not get a bag of sugar, with the result that the purchasing public were inclined to blame the shopkeepers and to accuse them of holding and profiteering, although ever body knows that on a bag of sugar, when made up and sold in pound and half-pound lots, the small shopkeeper has in or about 3/- to help to pay wages, rent and paper costs.  Yet that small shopkeeper could not get sugar in the last week of October, but a couple of hours after the announcement appeared in the newspapers on 1st November, the men who could not get sugar on the last day of October were rung up and told that they could get all the bags of sugar they wanted from the wholesaler. That is proof that it was not the small retailer who was holding back for a big price, but that it was either the Sugar Company or the wholesaler.  The Minister ought to make that clear and announce to the public who was, and is, getting the difference, and why they waited.  Why did they refuse on the last day of October a bag of sugar to the small grocer and the day after, when the higher price was on, offered as many bags as he wished?  That was profiteering.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>What was their purpose in refusing, on the last couple of days of October, when people were lined up in queues in the tenement areas and new working-class areas in Kimmage, waiting for their small grocer to give them the smallest quantity of sugar and the grocer had to tell them that he had not got it, with the result that, in some cases, the purchasing public would not believe him.  Yet the day after, when the high price was announced, they were offered all the sugar they wanted.  It was a scandal, and some explanation to the public is required.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon made reference to the man with 27/- a week who buys a quarter stone of sugar and has to pay sixpence a week extra, and who is not allowed to apply for an increase of wages to meet it, but what about the thousands of unemployed at the moment who are on a limited allowance of unemployment assistance&mdash;men with a wife and four children on £1 a week who can get no further than that pound?  What about the unfortunate tenement dweller and unemployed man in the city who has a pound a week and who is supporting a father and mother as well as six, seven and eight children, and who has nothing more than the pound, except what the Dublin Board of Assistance will give him, which is about 3/- or 4/-?  Where is he going to get the additional money to buy the sugar?  In his case, it is definitely a question of &ldquo;go without&rdquo; unless the unemployment allowances are increased and he gets a few shillings extra to meet the increased cost of living, or the board of assistance increases the little subsidy they give him.  These are the people in whom we all have an interest, and I am sure that the two Ministers who represent Dublin City have an interest in them and know as much about the conditions in tenement Dublin as I do.  It is on behalf of those people that I appeal to him, and I join in the request that he should withdraw the tax and look somewhere else for the money.</P>

      <P>What I am troubled about is this.  If those people in the Sugar Company did not know what the ordinary schoolboys of the country knew, namely, that we were going to have a European war, and did not shape their policy accordingly, then in my opinion they are not fit to be entrusted with the control of sugar supplies in this country.  If the Sugar Company, who were handed over a monopoly of the supply of sugar for this country, did not provide for the danger of war, in my opinion, at any rate, they are not fit to be entrusted with or to be in charge of any such essential supply.  Secondly, if they did provide for that emergency, whatever justification there is for the ¾d. per lb. taxation, there is no justification for the other ¾d. per lb. which is to be handed over to the Sugar Company. That is putting the thing in a nutshell, <Col N="1069" /> in my opinion, and I make no bones about it.  The question in regard to the other ¾d. per lb. will arise on motions 27 and 28 to-morrow.  In my opinion, if they did not make provision for an adequate supply of sugar, then they are not fit to be entrusted with the control of sugar supplies in this country; and if they did make provision, there is no occasion for the ¾d. per lb. increase.  At any rate, the farmer was skinned.  We hear a lot of sympathy expressed for the farmers to-day but, unfortunately, it does not go beyond lip service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGilligan" hpid="Mr. McGilligan Mr. McGilligan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is possible to answer a couple of the questions that Deputy Corry has put.  It is possible to answer them by reference to some of the replies which the Minister gave here on former occasions even if, on some occasions, the answers which the Minister gave might very well have occupied a place in Grimm's Fairy Tales.  Sometimes he has indulged in flights of fancy which might very well be published within the covers of that very remarkable book.  At this moment it is necessary that we should have a greater accuracy in speech from the Minister than he has manifested up to this, because at the moment Parliamentary institutions have been almost abandoned in this country.  The country was asked in a moment of crisis to hand over full control to Ministers under an Emergency Resolution; to hand over the general conduct of life in this country, and in particular, the control of supplies of essential commodities for the people of the country.  I was anxious when that legislation was being enacted to find out how far the upset to the policy of self-sufficiency had got in certain respects, and the Minister has shown how insincere were his beliefs in the policy of self-sufficiency by what has happened in connection with the supply of sugar.  We were told, when he talked about our sugar supply, that we were self-sufficient or that we were likely to be so in that commodity more than in anything else.  We have the situation at the moment that the Minister refuses to give information at the proper time.  He did not give it by <Col N="1070" /> way of a detailed reply to a Parliamentary question, which is the recognised system of getting information for the people.  He has supplied it by way of a statement, but he has avoided explaining matters on which we required some information.  At this moment, when the Parliamentary institution is almost definitely dissolved, one is entitled to ask for more definite respect for truth and accuracy than we have so far got.  Let us see what has happened. As Deputy Norton repeated several times in his speech to-day, the Minister on the 18th October stated: &ldquo;We do not anticipate any immediate change in the price of sugar.&rdquo;  Again, on the 27th September, the Minister stated: &ldquo;There is no difficulty to be anticipated at all concerning sugar.&rdquo; That was more specifically dealing with the question of supplies, but on the 18th October we were told that there was no question of an immediate change in price.  Yet on the 31st October, we get an order stating that the stand-still order operative up to the 1st November would then cease.  The stand-still order had stabilised the price of sugar as it had been in the last week of August of this year.  The Minister gave reasons why that stand-still order was enforced, and these are set out in his statements in column 700 of the Debates of the 18th October.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation as set out then by the Minister was this: &ldquo;We look upon our situation in this country as being better than ever we expected it to be.  We have factories which produce at this moment two-thirds of our requirements. Next year, after the production season of 1940, we hope to have sufficient beet to enable them to produce 100 per cent. of our requirements.&rdquo; Until then, the Minister said, all we had to do was to bridge the gap between the two-thirds forthcoming from beet produced at home this year and next year's production period when we hope to have full annual supplies from the Irish factories.  To see how far he had got towards bridging the gap, I put down a question on the 19th October and this was his reply: Our annual consumption is about 100,000 tons.  The factories produce about 66,000 tons.  I could not find that that was absolutely accurate, <Col N="1071" /> but I shall take it that they produce 60,000 tons.  I asked for the importations from January to August of this year and thereafter for a couple of weeks up to the 14th October.  Up to the 1st September we had imported 783,261 cwts., or nearly the 40,000 tons required to make good the deficiency in home production.  That added to the 60,000 tons produced at home gave us our year's supply.</P>

      <P>About an eight months' supply.  Well, we have got to that point.  That could be said quietly. We are talking of sugar.  The position was that we were going to be carried on for about eight months, and that when the campaign started we hoped to produce the supply for the whole 12 months thereafter, so that all that had to be made good was the gap of four months, or about four months.  In order to meet that, we had the importations at that period.  We are charging ¾d. a lb. on what?  On the sugar that is being manufactured at home at this moment, the price for which has been paid on any remnant of this 783,000 cwts. brought in and not yet given out for consumption, and on whatever else we have got to import. What is the case for putting this ¾d. a lb. on all sugar consumed between this and next year's production period, when the most that we will have to import is whatever we are short of a full year's supply?  That is the case the Minister has got to meet.  The Minister certainly did not give anybody in this House on the 18th October any indication that there would be any such change in price on importations, or any likelihood of it, as would necessitate this increase.  In these circumstances we have ¾d. a lb. stuck on to the price of sugar, notwithstanding these importations, the ones already in and the ones the Minister said he would have no difficulty in getting.  He indicated no difficulty at all with regard to a shortage of supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second item in regard to this is much more amazing.  The Minister devotes quite a lot of his time to lecturing traders and consumers.  He said there should be no question, in the <Col N="1073" /> interests of the people themselves, of hoarding.  There should be nobody holding back in anticipation of a rise in prices, so that they could get the benefit of any increased prices, but within the last couple of days, when sugar has been increased in price, a statement has been issued to the public to the effect that if they were charged more for jam, they ought to see that they were not charged it on such jam as was manufactured with sugar already in hands.  What does the Minister's Department, or the Sugar Beet Company, a creature of his&mdash;what do they do?  A question was asked to-day and figures given comparing the two months, September and October, with regard to the amount of sugar distributed by the Sugar Company. The figure for September and October this year is 100,000 cwts. short of what they distributed in the same two months last year.  If we take the three months, August, July and September, they have 60,000 cwts. less to distribute. What price are they going to charge on the 60,000 cwts. they have held up?  Is the extra ¾d. going on to that?  I presume it is.  Who is profiteering then?  Has the Minister one standard of conduct for the traders of the country and another standard of conduct for his own company?</P>
    <P>The Minister knows well that there have been repercussions in this matter &mdash;that one jam factory, not being able to get supplies of sugar, said it would have to close down.  They went to the Department and pointed out what the position was.  They said that they were about to close down, and that so many people were going to be put out of work.  The answer they got was that they would be given some part of their November sugar: that it would be given to them in the month of October in anticipation of what they might legitimately expect to draw in November.  They were asked to bind themselves, so far as they could bind themselves to an illegal compact, in this way: that for whatever they did get they would pay at the next November price.  They got portion of the November supply in October, and are now going to be charged the extra price prevailing at the moment.  Is that <Col N="1074" /> fair play, particularly to a firm that decided they would abide by the Minister's instructions not casually to disemploy people?  I suggest to the Minister that he knows that case.  It has been brought definitely and frequently under his notice, and he knows that these are the facts.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister consider it right to mislead people by statements such as he made on the 18th October, that he saw no immediate change in the price of sugar?  Does he think it fair, on the few occasions on which we get an opportunity of debating matters here, to leave the House under the impression, as he certainly left me under the impression, that there was going to be no difficulty either with regard to supplies or price?  Does he think it fair, without any kind of explanation, to reply to me in such a way as to lead me or anybody to believe that the gap between production at home and consumption had been met by importations already achieved?  Does he think it proper or that he is justified in putting the ¾d. on all the sugar to be consumed as from to-morrow onwards in order to meet whatever be the increased price he anticipates will have to be paid for a four months' supply?  Does he think it right to allow his Irish Sugar Company to hoard sugar in order that they may get an extra bit into their pockets on the sugar that they could have given out, and should have given out, according to the ordinary run of business?  In particular, does he think it fair play, having asked and beseeched people&mdash; bringing in nationality, the cause of the country, the maintenance of order, and the keeping up of a good public spirit&mdash;not to disemploy people, that when they go to him in their emergency and get from him, in anticipation, a draw on their November supply, to tie them, knowing that there was going to be an increase in price, to sell as if they had got the sugar at the October price, when, in fact, they have got to pay the November price?  All that, I say, is unbecoming of any Government Department or of any Minister of State.</P>

      <P>Reference has been made to the statement of the Minister <Col N="1075" /> for Supplies some weeks ago on this sugar question.  If there was any truth whatever in the statement he made some weeks ago&mdash;it has been referred to at some length by Deputy McGilligan&mdash;then I say there can be no justification whatever for this new tax on sugar.  Sugar is not a luxury.  Neither is bacon nor butter, but due to the machinations of this Government, the price of these necessities has reached luxury level.  As I have said, sugar is not a luxury.  Any increase in its price weighs most heavily on the shoulders of those least able to bear the burden, namely, the working classes, the unemployed, and all decent upright citizens who have large hungry families to support and maintain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Far be it from me to minimise the difficulties besetting the Government at the present time, and far be it from me to criticise unduly the steps taken by a Government treading a thorny path in these days of stress and uncertainty, with God knows what is around the corner.  But I warn the Government, though the two Ministers on the Front Bench may regard it as the case of the <i>Skibbereen Eagle</i> warning the Czar of Russia, to start on no further ill-judged, ill-advised action like their action in the case of the sugar tax and, if they do so, such action will cost them the co-operation not only of this House but of the people of this country.  That co-operation is more vital to them to-day than ever before.  My desire is to make only constructive criticism; I would rather like to know why on earth the Minister for Supplies and the Minister for Agriculture have not gone across to England and consulted Sir Reginald Dorman Smith, the British Minister of Agriculture.  I have no wish whatever to cast any reflection on the civil servants who have been negotiating this economic question in London, but again I want to know why the Minister for Supplies and the Minister for Agriculture do not go over there themselves and endeavour to make arrangements to secure an economic price for our surplus agricultural produce and to secure a supply of raw materials for our languishing industries?  If these <Col N="1076" /> things had been done there would have been no earthly need for this long list of new taxes that are being imposed to-day.  Why have not the Ministers gone across?  Is it because the Taoiseach is afraid of the German Minister or is it that the Minister for Supplies is afraid of air-raids?</P>

      <P>This tax was described by the last Minister for Finance as a hard tax.  If there was no other reason for opposing it except this definition of the last Minister for Finance that it was a hard tax, and that it falls on the people who are least able to bear it, there would be opposition to it, but there is further opposition to it because of the fact that this tax on sugar seems to have been imposed by the Minister for Supplies.  Whatever statement the Minister makes now he will not convince the people that there is not some group benefiting by the imposition of this recently-imposed addition to the cost of living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that in September and October the poor people in many parts of Éire could not get one pound of sugar.  There were retailers who were unable to get one cwt. of sugar.  I myself know retailers who from the beginning of September until the beginning of November did not get one cwt. of sugar.  It was impossible for them to get even one pound of it, but when the new rise of 1½d. a lb. was put on, some days ago, these people found it possible to get as much sugar as they needed.  Is it then any wonder that the entire people of the country are mystified about this business?  We are told now that in addition to 1½d. per lb. on sugar that we have a further tax of ¾d.  We all know, as the Minister said, what ¾d. amounts to, and that <Col N="1077" /> it is easily calculated, but in reality nobody can calculate how it has come to be imposed, and the Minister himself is unable to calculate what it will mean.  We have not been told what proportion of our sugar needs for 12 months is covered.  When or where or in what quantities that particular amount of sugar is to be purchased and at what price we are not told.  The House is asked to take it as a foregone conclusion that this ¾d. is going to be sufficient or insufficient to cover the operations of our sugar trade for four months period.</P>
    <P>In this particular instance there cannot possibly be a want of suspicion amongst the people that there has been profiteering and hoarding by a particular industry concerned in this particular matter.  There is a suspicion that there has been profiteering by the sugar companies themselves.  We had it that there was 100,000 tons of sugar less doled out after the war started than in the three previous months. Then we had the statement that in the three months before the war there were 60,000 tons, and the interjection that it was a small quantity, but 60,000 tons represents 7,000,000 lbs. of sugar, and 7,000,000 lbs. of sugar would have been a lot to the women of this country during the last couple of months.  That would have meant 2 or 3 lbs. per head to the ordinary house purchaser.  Yet there were people in this State who were unable to get one ounce of sugar during September and October.  I know myself shopkeepers who could not get as much as one stone of sugar from their wholesalers.  These were people who were wont to purchase sugar by the ton and two ton lots.  We had an interesting speech the other day by the last Minister for Finance.  In that speech he showed sympathy with everybody, particularly with the agricultural community.  He was overflowing with sympathy.  It was an excellent speech, with every word of which I could agree. He appealed to all sections of the community for sympathy for the farmers, but he offered no remedy except this appeal to the parasites who had bled the farmers and farm labourers not to bleed them beyond what they could <Col N="1078" /> stand.  He appealed to them, for God's sake, to leave something of the carcase with them, for otherwise they could not carry on.</P>
    <P>That was the Minister's only remedy. He appealed to the industrialists and others in God's name to mind their steps, for otherwise the poor people they were mulcting would disappear, and with them would disappear the livelihood of the industrialists themselves. This is a matter of the same kind.  The farmers of this country met and came to an agreement to supply beet to the factories on the basis of that beet being sold in the shape of sugar at 3d. per lb.  The factories got the beet on that basis, knowing that at the price which they were paying the farmers, the sugar could be sold at 3d. per lb.  In September and October they issued 100,000 tons.  By the 1st November we were told there was an ample supply for everybody, but at an increased price of 1½d. per lb.  Now the Minister can speak as long as he wishes, but he will not convince the ordinary people that the labourer, the small farmer and everybody else have not been mulcted in this matter.  But on top of this 1½d. per lb. there is going to be inflicted a further unnecessary tax of ¾d. in the lb. by way of taxation, in order to raise money which might have been got otherwise.  That is an infliction of another ¾d. a lb. for a problematical expenditure over a period of four months, which the Minister himself cannot explain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The present situation regarding sugar is a complete argument against this House having given to the Government the plenary powers that it did give them, because one of the reasons which impelled this House to give those plenary powers to the Government was that such commodities as sugar and other things of that nature so necessary to the well-being of the people here, would be controlled, and reasonably controlled, as regards price and supply.  The House anticipated, as practically one of the first measures that the Government would adopt under the Emergency Powers Bill, a standstill order with regard to the price of commodities, and that was one <Col N="1079" /> of the reasons why this House so freely gave those powers to the Government. But what has been the result?  This is the first breach in the list of commodities included in the standstill order.  What guarantee has this House that, one by one, those commodities in respect of which the prices have been fixed will not be eliminated to such an extent that the standstill order will become worthless, because that is what it will amount to?  It seems to me that a very sensible speech, and I dwell on the word &ldquo;sensible,&rdquo; was made by Deputy Corry this evening, when he said that the persons in charge of the beet sugar factory in this country&mdash;I do not know who they are; I have no fixed idea as to what are their names &mdash;should not remain in charge of that concern if they were not able to look far enough ahead to anticipate a situation such as is supposed to have arisen at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The energies of the Government during the past few months have been directed towards air raid precautions, aeroplanes, flag-waving, drums and so forth, all in anticipation of some great war that is not going to touch us at all.  Why did they not direct their attention to having proper supplies in this country at proper prices?  I warn the Government that the question of sugar is going to loom as largely in the political life of this country as salt did in India when Gandhi led a revolution there.  It is touching the heart and mind of every individual in this country.  We all hoped, and I hoped as an individual member of this House, that we would have been able to be unanimous in our support of the endeavours and activities of the Government to keep things going during the period of emergency through which we are passing, but I for one cannot see how any individual can have the slightest reliance on either the good judgment or the wisdom of the Government seeing that they have fallen down in regard to such an important matter as the sugar supply.  It seems to me that some statement will have to be made by the Government, some reasoned statement, to restore confidence in the minds of the people. <Col N="1080" /> They have only to ask any person they meet outside this House, and they will find that everyone has the same view&mdash;that some body of persons in this country deliberately held up vast quantities of sugar in anticipation of the time, which the people believe they knew was going to come, when the price of sugar would be increased.</P>
    <P>The poor people of this country&mdash; and I defy contradiction on this&mdash;were told in the month of September last that there was no necessity to go out and spend, if you like, a week's wages on the purchase of supplies of sugar to last them for a few months.  They were told there would be plenty for them all.  The poor people, in a public minded spirit&mdash;it was the better off people who bought large quantities&mdash; relying on what they were told by the Government, refrained from laying in any supplies.  Now, when we are told there is going to be plenty of sugar, they find that the price has been raised.  They are going to be the sufferers.  They are going to be the casualties in this war.  I suggest to the Government that if, instead of considering schemes of black-out, they had tried to look after the well-being of the poor people of this country, their energies would have been better directed and this country would have been better served.  I think it is a shame and a disgrace that, so early in the emergency period, we should have to debate a matter of this kind.  Sugar is a very important item indeed.  It is more important in the political life of this country at the present time than the Government realises, or, perhaps, than they care to realise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There are only two points which I propose to advert to in connection with this proposed tax, because of the fact that the two motions which appear on the Order Paper in the names of Deputy Mulcahy, Deputy McGilligan, Deputy Davin and Deputy Murphy will, when they are reached, give full opportunity and scope for the discussion of the happenings of the last few weeks in connection with the distribution of sugar, the raising of the price of sugar, and the deeds and misdeeds of the sugar company.  Therefore, in the few remarks <Col N="1081" /> I have to make here to-night, I propose to confine myself to two points. The first point deals with the actual effect of the imposition of this duty, merely as a duty imposed by the Budget, on the price of sugar to consumers in the country.  We are all thoroughly familiar with the fact that, at any time when a duty is imposed by a Budget Resolution or taxation proposals, the immediate effect is to increase the price of the commodity taxed almost always by more than the actual amount of the tax justifies.  I want to know either from the Minister for Supplies or the Minister for Finance whether he can assure the Dáil and the people generally that the imposition of this new duty of ¾d. in the lb. will not result in a further increase in the price of sugar to the consumer.  I must say that I find myself somewhat in a difficulty as to what precisely the position is in regard to that matter, and I raise that point for the purpose of enabling both or either of the Ministers concerned to issue a statement or if possible a guarantee that the imposition of this new tax of ¾d. a lb. on sugar will not result in an increased price of sugar to the consumer.  We had the effect of a similar proposal in this year's Budget when a particular proposal was brought in and given effect to here to increase the price of tobacco, and the price to the consumer was undoubtedly raised to a greater extent than was justified by the particular tax which was imposed by the Government.  Now, I want a guarantee from either or both of the Ministers concerned that no such thing will take place as a result of this ¾d. increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position appears to me to be this, looking at it strictly from the legal point of view, that in the first order, the Emergency Powers (Control of Prices) (No. 1) Order, 1939, a number of commodities were scheduled, and it was ordered by the Minister for Supplies that the price which was current in the week ending 26th August, 1939, would rule the price for the commodities mentioned in that schedule, amongst others sugar and sugar products; so that, from 26th August, 1939, until the order made on 31st October, 1939, repealing so far <Col N="1082" /> as sugar is concerned the provisions of the No.1 Order, the position was that nobody was legally entitled to charge more for sugar than the price chargeable or ruling on 26th August, 1939.</P>
    <P>On 31st October, 1939, the provisions of the No.1 Order as regards sugar were repealed.  In other words, theoretically at least, any price can be charged for sugar by anybody in this country.  The Sugar Company, when they are selling their sugar, can charge anything they like.  The wholesaler, when he is distributing it to the retailer, can do the same, and so can the retailer.  So far as we have been able to learn&mdash;and I have asked Deputy Mulcahy whether his question was answered here to-day&mdash;neither the Sugar Company nor the Minister approached or consulted or got the sanction of the Prices Commission when they increased the price of sugar by 1½d., as was announced in the last few days.  There is, therefore, no sanction, so far as I have been able to ascertain, for the price of sugar existing with the increase of 1½d. that has been announced.</P>
    <P>There was sanction for the price under the No.1 Order.  Any legal shackles that were available were placed upon traders and the sugar company by this No.1 Order.  They have been all taken away, so far as I can ascertain, and there is nothing to replace them.  So far as I can learn, the position is this&mdash;and I want to be corrected by both or either of the Ministers if I am wrong&mdash;that there is now nothing except the mere word of the Minister telling the sugar company and the traders not to charge more than the 4½d. per lb. mentioned in the public Press in the last few days; there is nothing to prevent the price of sugar from being increased to any level the trader or the sugar company can extract from the consuming public.</P>
    <P>If that is the position, it is inevitable that people will be charged more than 4½d. for their sugar.  It was conveyed to me from a source that I have no reason to doubt that in certain country towns 5d. per lb. is charged for sugar, not 4½d.  That was done before to-day, <Col N="1083" /> before the ¾d. was put on by way of duty.  There is nothing to prevent any trader, provided he can extract it from his customer, from charging anything he likes.</P>
    <P>My recollection is that it was announced that the price was increased with the consent and approval of the Minister.  What authority has the Minister to agree to the increase of 1½d.?  All the Minister is able to do is to fix prices under the Emergency Powers Act and all he has done is, by No. 1 Order, to fix the price of sugar as the price ruling in August, 1939.  He has now taken that away and there is nothing to prevent any trader charging any price he likes for sugar, and there is nothing to prevent the sugar company from charging any price it likes, and, by intimidation of their customers, as I have reason to believe from information that has come to me, they can charge anything they like.  Is that position going to be allowed to continue and can the Ministers give any guarantee that that will be stopped?</P>
    <P>That leads me to the second point. It leads me by a natural transition to the next point I want to make.  I am not raising this merely for the purpose of pin-pricking the Minister or the Government.  There is nothing in the public affairs of this country for the last ten years that has caused such public disquiet as the manner in which the sugar position has been handled since the war began.  I think it is the duty of the Government, as far as they can, to allay that public disquiet.  I rather think the situation has gone too far, but I do think it is essential, in the interests of public life in this country, that the Ministers should do something to allay the damage done within the last few weeks by the manner in which the sugar has been allowed to be distributed, or not distributed, and to be increased in price. There is no doubt that great public alarm and uneasiness have been occasioned.</P>
    <P>I listened to the speech of the Minister for Finance this afternoon to see <Col N="1084" /> if he could give any reason why he selected sugar in contra-distinction to anything else he might have selected for his proposals to raise additional revenue.  He gave only one reason. The only reason he gave was that he had looked through the schedule of existing customs and excise duties and he found it would cause the least expense and dislocation in the revenue machine if he put additional taxes on those commodities at present subject to taxation.  He instanced tobacco, and said the experience of the additional tax put on in this year's Budget was that it did not result in decreased consumption. He did not say the same about sugar, and it is significant that he did not.  He has not, in the speech he made to-day, given any other reason for the imposition of this tax on sugar rather than on any other commodity &mdash;any other reason than the one to which I have adverted; that is to say, administrative convenience.  That is not going to satisfy public opinion.</P>
    <P>In an ordinary atmosphere, if we could have an ordinary atmosphere when taxation was being increased in the way it is being increased in this Emergency Budget, public disquiet and annoyance would inevitably be caused, and it would be regarded as a natural result.  What is going to be the result of taxing sugar in the atmosphere of the last few days?  It is going to be far worse.  I say quite sincerely that unless Ministers give some justification, which will be accepted by the public, in the very disturbed atmosphere of irritation and annoyance that has been stirred up in the last week by the increase in the price of sugar, and by the withholding of the supplies of sugar and the sudden release of supplies at the time of the increased price, there is going to be very grave disquiet and it is going to do the cause of good government in this country irreparable damage.  That will be the position unless some greater justification is given for the selection of sugar in the existing circumstances, in the stormy conditions of the moment, than has been given by the casual references to administrative convenience in the statement of the Minister for Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to protest against this increase in taxation to the amount of £243,000 this year, money which the Government and the sugar company will derive from the increase in the price of sugar.  I maintain that more than £200,000 of that will be taken from the pockets of the poor people.  There are very few rich people in this country now.  The great majority of the people are poor people, and from the information contained in the Supplementary Budget of what the Minister and the Government intend to do in economies in different Departments to the amount of £400,000 this year, we are going to have many more very, very poor people, many more unemployed.  At the present time we have over 90,000 persons unemployed, and if this £400,000 is to be taken from housing and public works we are going to have many more on the dole.  Those are the people who will have to bear the greater portion of this £243,000 of taxation and those are the people who want to know from this Government what is the emergency that is causing all the increase in taxation.  Where is the emergency?  What is it?  Why are not the people told?  It has been stated by the previous speaker, and I see here that the retail price of sugar operating from the 1st of this month will remain at 4½d. per lb., and that that is the price ruling in neighbouring countries. I would like to inform the Minister for Supplies and the Government that the price ruling down the country, in the country villages and towns, is 5d. per lb., and it has been that price for the past fortnight or three weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to inform the Minister that as I happen to be a provision merchant, selling a limited quantity of sugar, I was informed by my wholesaler by circular about three weeks ago that I could not expect to receive any further supplies of sugar until February. I called in to that house the first days of this month to try to get some small supply of sugar and I was informed that I could get all I wanted. The week before I could not get any, but as soon as the price was up and when, instead of paying a little over £5 for two bags of sugar, I found it was £8 0s. 10d., I could get all I wanted.  It <Col N="1086" /> is the poor people of this country who will have to meet that increased price, and I think it is the duty of the Government to see to it that the Prices Commission will protect the poor people of this country from that extra ½d. per lb. on sugar.  I think it is also the duty of the Prices Commission and of the Government not to ask the retailers of this country to stand inside their shops and weigh out sugar and find paper bags for it at a profit of something like 1/1 per cwt.  Many things have to be looked into, but I wish to protest against this increase. I see no reason for it.  I see no reason for any of the increases.  We heard much talk about this emergency.  We are not at war with any nation, and it is the duty of the Government to state plainly to the people of this country what this emergency is all about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say very definitely that our Party are in opposition to this increase and that, as far as we can see, there has been no justification whatsoever for the amount that has been put on.  It is a 50 per cent increase on a commodity that is very widely used and a commodity that is used especially by the working-class people.  It is a very big impost in the family budget of the working-class people of this country and it particularly hits the people who have to exist on unemployment assistance, home assistance, old age pensions and widows' and orphans' pensions.  It is rather mysterious why this increase was put on at this particular time.  I remember that we were told by the Minister for Supplies in September and again in October that there was no scarcity of sugar in this country.  We conveyed that to our constituents, but it was found that a scarcity did exist. We were told that a certain amount of hoarding went on.  That is probably true.  If hoarding has been going on, I would like to ask the Minister how he intends to get at the people who have hoarded sugar.  I have been informed that certain retailers have got in very large supplies, that they were wise enough to anticipate an increase in the price of sugar, and, of course, they will now have the sugar <Col N="1087" /> to sell at an enhanced price.  Will there be any way of getting at those people?</P>
      <P>It is, as I have said, the poorer people have to suffer the greater burden of this sugar increase.  Why it is that sugar has been singled out I am at a loss to understand.  The fact remains that it is one of the commodities which is used to a great extent in the manufacture of other commodities and there again you are going to have the whole gamut affected through this increase.  We were told by the Minister that there is ¾d. tax in this Budget Resolution and an explanation was given of the other ¾d., but this increase has been put on since the 1st November and Deputy Costello has raised the legal position with regard to that increase.  I hope that when the Minister is replying he will take into account the points that have been raised and that he will give some justification for this increase.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt about it that this increase in the price of sugar has caused greater disturbance in the public mind than anything I can remember for some time, and I think the reason is the manner in which this increase was put on.  A short time before the increase we were told that there was plenty of sugar.  We were told that there was no scarcity of sugar in the country and we were assured by the Minister for Supplies that there was no necessity for an increase in the price of sugar.  If the facts then were as stated surely there should not be any justification for an increase within a week or ten days afterwards.  The public have been very much alarmed. I have noticed that various public bodies, irrespective of their political groupings, have passed resolutions condemning this increase and, if public opinion is worth anything, I think it is safe to say that public opinion has definitely condemned this increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We in the Labour Party have also voiced our opinions on this matter and we have a motion down for rescinding the order.  I understand that it will be taken on to-morrow and we will then see how the different Parties will vote. <Col N="1088" /> We are definitely opposing this tax and I shall reserve anything further I have to say until the order is being discussed to-morrow.</P>

      <P>It has been asked by Deputy Hurley in the form: Why has sugar been singled out, and Deputy Costello, I think, stated that the public would want to know some reasons why sugar rather than some other commodity had been chosen for additional taxation now.  I would like, in the first place, to point out to Deputy Hurley that it is not correct to say that sugar has been singled out for taxation.

The total amount which the increase in taxation which has had to be imposed to-day is expected to bring in is £603,000 and sugar is not even 50 per cent. of that.</P>

      <P>I heard Deputy Hurley, and the impression I got from his speech was that we had taxed sugar only and I was merely wishing to correct that impression, in order, if it has been a misunderstanding of what <Col N="1089" /> he said, that I should correct it in my own mind and in the minds of other members of the House.  However, I suppose we can take it that it is admitted now that it is not correct to imply that, for some occult reason or other, the Government has decided to single out sugar for taxation.  But we have to consider, in endeavouring to deal with the question which Deputy Costello has put, why it is that we have had to tax sugar rather than some other commodity, we have to consider in connection with that question the fact that&mdash;as the Minister for Finance has pointed out to the House &mdash;owing to circumstances arising out of, and arising only out of, the present warlike situation in Europe, he anticipates that the Estimates for revenue which were submitted to the House in May last in connection with the Budget for the year are not going to be realised to the extent of £1,600,000.</P>
      <P>Let me point out simply what that means.  Owing to the manner in which the taxation system was framed in respect of the ordinary normal Budget of the year, and owing to change in circumstances which have taken place since certain taxes are not going to be so fruitful as was expected, and they are not going to be so fruitful because, to some extent, the commodities upon which those taxes were imposed are not going to be available. It means that because of the breaches which the war has created in what has been the normal tax system of the country for a considerable number of years the revenue is going to collect during this year £1,600,000 less than will be required to defray the cost of the services upon which the ordinary normal Budget of this year was based. That means of course, naturally, that since the revenue cannot collect that £1,600,000 by means of the usual taxes it is going to remain in the pockets of the taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem then which we have to face is this: that either public expenditure in this country upon all the services which the community requires will have to be restricted in order to wipe out that deficiency, or else alternative taxes will have to be devised in order to make good that <Col N="1090" /> deficiency.  We have the choice of cutting down our expenditure upon the social services, upon education, upon public services of all kinds, and upon defence, or else, as I have said, we have got to make good the shortfall in some of the previous taxes by either increasing the rates of existing taxes upon certain commodities or by, in certain cases, perhaps, imposing taxes upon commodities which were hitherto free of any impost.  The latter course has not been adopted in connection with the present Supplementary Budget.</P>
    <P>Now, the point we have to bear in mind is this: that there is no use increasing existing rates of tax upon certain commodities unless you have some assurance that the new rates of tax are going to be fruitful.  Accordingly you are much more limited in dealing with this problem of raising the resources which are necessary to maintain the State in times of emergency and crisis such as this than in May of this year, because in May of this year customed goods and other commodities were flowing freely into this country. Moreover, due to the fact that in July and August there was certain intelligent anticipation on the part of some people that the war might break out this autumn, the ordinary rate of import for some of these commodities was accelerated and they were imported in greater quantities immediately prior to the outbreak of the war than they normally would be at that season of the year.  Accordingly, they have paid their toll to the revenue, and this fact&mdash;that customs have been collected at a more rapid rate than was normal in the earlier part of the year&mdash;has helped to obscure what is the real situation which is facing the revenue for the balance of the year.</P>
    <P>We are, therefore, in this position, that while, apparently, on the returns to date, the customs would seem to be doing very well, nevertheless, there has been collected in the first seven months of the year a large part of the duty which would be normally paid in the last five months of the year.  We may take it for granted, therefore, that there is going to be a heavy fall in the <Col N="1091" /> ordinary returns from customs for the remainder of the period.  But if there is going to be a heavy fall during the remainder of the year in the ordinary returns from customs arising out of the fact that you can no longer import freely into this country, there is no use putting taxes upon commodities which very largely have to come from overseas.  Therefore, as I have said, the problem of the Minister for Finance is much more difficult because the number of commodities which are available to him for the purposes of the revenue have been very considerably reduced. Accordingly, he is faced with this situation, that if he is going to increase the rates of taxation upon commodities he must be reasonably certain that he is going to be able to collect the full amount of revenue at the new rates. The position in which that leaves the Minister, in fact, is the excise element in the tax system must be increased proportionately in order to make good the deficiency which is likely to arise in his revenue from customs.</P>
    <P>When we come then to consider what commodities are available for taxation we find that these commodities must be articles of which there are already very large stocks in this country, such as tobacco, where stocks are brought in and stored in bond for a considerable period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance was very limited, if he wanted to make certain of getting the money, in the range of taxation he might impose. I have shown that he was virtually confined to those commodities of which there were already very large stocks in the country, or which were produced in the country.  That was what I meant in my Budget statement of May last when I pointed out that if war came, the Minister for Finance of the day, whoever he might be, could no longer rely upon customs to provide a very large part of the revenue, and that he would have to tax articles made here, or articles of which large stocks were under our physical control.  That is the position.  For instance, that is why tobacco has been called on, that is why we have had to increase the duties upon beer and spirits, and that is why the Minister for Finance has had to increase the duty on sugar, because he is much more likely to get the money which he requires by a tax upon sugar than by a tax on tea.  As the Minister for Supplies told the House, our requirements in regard to sugar are reasonably well secured until the beginning of the autumn of 1941.  Therefore, if the Minister for Finance has to get a certain sum of money by taxing some one commodity or another, I think the wise and prudent thing to do is to come to the House and impose <Col N="1093" /> a tax on a commodity which he is certain he is going to be able to collect over a reasonable period of time, over such a period as the exigencies which have coerced him to increase taxation continue.</P>
      <P>There is another reason why the Minister for Finance is compelled to tax sugar rather than tea.  That is plain to be seen from the figures which the Minister put before the House in his Budget speech.  He pointed out that there was a deficiency of £1,600,000 anticipated and that that £1,600,000 was going to remain in the pockets of the tax-payers, unless the Minister for Finance took steps to correct a situation in which the Exchequer was going to lose.  Of course, it is easy for Deputy Mulcahy to laugh and particularly easy for Deputy Davin to laugh.</P>

The fact that the Government has done that is proof that the Government is prepared to shoulder the responsibility in this matter, and to face up to the very grave problems arising from the war in a courageous and straightforward way.

      <P>The position is that we are £1,600,000 short.  There are economies visualised which will go towards making up the deficit in the revenue by £400,000.  There are other taxes which can be imposed immediately to bring in £603,000 and towards that £603,000, the increased duty on sugar is going to contribute £240,000.  There are no other taxes that could have been imposed at this period of the year which would have brought in £240,000 with less hardship to the community as a whole.  In the course of his speech to-day Deputy Norton referred to a speech of mine on my first Budget about the sugar tax being a hard tax and the tax on tea a soft tax.  I should like any Deputies who propose to use that argument in the present debate to go and read Deputy Norton's speech in regard to that matter.  They will learn then how bitterly the people of this country might resent a tax upon tea. It was the only alternative that could <Col N="1095" /> be availed of and supplies of tea are not nearly so well assured because they are not nearly so well under our control, and would not, in my view, in the special circumstances of this time, be anything like an adequate substitute for a tax on sugar.  If we wanted to collect £240,000 from tea at this period of the year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I told the House already that we required this tax to make up an anticipated short fall in revenue.  I understand the Deputy is one who feels that we ought not to curtail services unduly.  I do not see any other way to reduce expenditure except to reduce the services. Accordingly, if the services are not to be curtailed, then the revenue has to be maintained, and the purpose of the taxes is to maintain the revenue and to enable the Exchequer to bear the cost of the public services as a whole. With regard to the tax on tea, what additional taxation would the Minister for Finance have to impose at this period of the year in order to collect £240,000 from tea?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy will tell us to-morrow where the revenue is being squandered.  We had the Deputy getting up here and making speeches recently in which, not merely did he demand that the present expenditure should be maintained, but that it should be considerably increased. He made a speech on those lines, I think, even at the outset of this emergency.  He made it earlier, I know, during the course of the Budget <Col N="1096" /> debates last year, and the Deputy, who was then demanding that there should be increased public expenditure, says now that such expenditure should be cut down.  Unfortunately, the position now is that we are trying to cut it down.  One of the features of this Budget is that some economies must be made in expenditure on some of the public services.  Whether or not those economies when made will be acceptable to people here, I do not know, but the point is that this taxation and these economies will not go the whole way to close the gap because, even after we have made these economies, there will still remain the substantial sum of £617,000 by which it is anticipated this Budget will not balance and which will have to be carried into next year's Budget, will have to be wiped out, in my view, by the proceeds of next year's taxation.  The fact remains, therefore&mdash;and this is the point that we have got to grasp very firmly&mdash;that even with the additional taxation and the economies which it is proposed to make in the public services, there will still remain a gap which will have to be closed by short-term borrowing in the coming year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the circumstances, what else could the Minister for Finance do but to tax sugar, because that was one of the commodities from which a tax would give the most assured result and because it was a commodity which would give him the greatest yield at this particular period of the year?  That is a sufficient justification, I think, for taxing sugar rather than tea, or some other commodity, because whatever else happens we do not want to have to come to the House&mdash;and the House would resent it if the Minister for Finance were to do so&mdash;and ask for additional taxation in two or three months' time simply because, as a result of some interruption of our supplies from overseas, the tax on tea was unproductive.  I am not asking the House to believe that a tax on tea is not possible.  If this emergency lasts long enough there are going to be very drastic and severe responsibilities and burdens borne by our people, and they are responsibilities and burdens which neither this Administration nor any other Administration in this country, <Col N="1097" /> for that matter, can possibly save our people from so long as our position in world affairs continues as it is to-day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <P>We are left in the position that, since the Votes have to be taken to-night, there is not much time to speak on this matter, and there is not much use in doing anything except to point out, as has been pointed out by a number of Deputies who have spoken, the peculiar concern that has been struck into the hearts of the people by the increase in the price of sugar.  Now, the public reaction to that has been intelligent, because the situation disclosed by the increase in the price of sugar is not so much in connection with the serious increase in taxation.  There is a much more serious thing behind it.  The performance of the Minister for Supplies and of the Irish Sugar Company since the beginning of September, in connection with the sugar business, shows a position in regard to the Government that is much more serious for the people who have to bear an increase in taxation that they are not able to bear.  There is not sufficient time to go into this matter now, but the motions that will be before the House in the next few days will give an opportunity to do so.  I take it that the general debate will take place to-morrow, and if the general debate on the Budget is finished by to-morrow then we may hope to get on to the other motions either to-morrow or Friday, but I doubt that the seriousness of the present situation is sufficiently light&mdash;in view of the imposition of present taxation and the outline of the situation that the Minister for Finance has given&mdash;to enable us to dispose of the general debate <Col N="1098" /> to-morrow.  At any rate either at the end of this week or next week, we will have an opportunity of discussing the motions on the sugar business, and I think the significance of the situation will come out much more seriously and that it will be shown, from the remarks of Deputies, that the serious reaction taken by the country as to the price of sugar is a very intelligent and very natural reaction, and that we are dealing with a situation here which is much more serious than merely an increase in the price of sugar or of an essential commodity.</P>

      <P>There is a resolution on the Order Paper, <Col N="1103" /> dealing with lighting restrictions, which we thought would be dealt with to-day.  The lighting restrictions under the order that has been made were to come into operation on the 18th November. It has been decided to postpone the operation of the order except in regard to public lighting.  I desire to make that announcement now, so that if people were making preparations in regard to private houses, they would not feel obliged to do it before that date.  It is hoped, however, that everybody who can will make any preparations possible to secure that, if it ever should become necessary to apply lighting restrictions in their full rigour, they will be able to co-operate in doing so.</P>

The Deputy, however, is probably concerned as to the acreage in this locality which has been inspected during recent years and in respect of which acquisition proceedings for all or part have not so far been instituted. There are some 1,000 acres in which the Land Commission have had reports by their inspectors which can be regarded as of current interest.  At present it is not possible to state with regard to any of these lands whether or when they will be acquired and divided, and the Land Commission are not aware of the area thereof under tillage this year.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he is aware that acute congestion exists on the Symes estate, in the townland of Knockatinnywell, Newport, County Mayo; that Mr. James Dick, of Mullawn, Newport, has requested the Land Commission to take over his farm of 100 acres for the relief of the existing congestion; and if he will state what steps, if any, are being taken by the Land Commission to acquire Mr. Dick's farm.</P>

      <P>There are no proceedings pending in the Land Commission for the acquisition of the lands of Mr. James Dick for the relief of local congestion.

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state (a) the area of the lands in South Mayo, acquired by the Congested Districts Board, now held by the Land Commission and still <Col N="948" /> undivided; (b) the poor law valuation of such lands; (c) the price paid or agreed to be paid by the Congested Districts Board or Land Commission for such land and the amount of purchase price still outstanding; and (d) the amount received per annum by the Land Commission for the parts of such lands let in grazing or conacre.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The records of the Congested Districts Board estates have not been kept in such a form as to provide the information desired by the Deputy. A large part of the untenanted land acquired by the board was not acquired separately but as part of estates purchased as units including tenanted and untenanted land, and it has not been practicable to keep precise statistics of the disposal of untenanted land as distinct from tenanted land.  To ascertain the particulars desired by the Deputy would entail an amount of laborious research by the indoor and outdoor staff of the Land Commission which would be out of all proportion to the value of the result.  The untenanted land on the board's estates in County Mayo remaining for division consists mainly of mountain and turbary of little value and difficult to dispose of finally.</P>
