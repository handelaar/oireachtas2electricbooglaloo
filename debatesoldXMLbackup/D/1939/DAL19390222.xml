      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he refused to sanction the proposal of the Dun Laoghaire Borough Council to acquire 37 acres of land at Dunardagh, Blackrock, County Dublin, for the purpose of erecting working-class dwellings; and, if so, on what grounds; whether he is aware that no alternative site is available convenient to the town of Blackrock or tolerably accessible to the workers in the vicinity in need of housing accommodation; whether he has suggested that the borough council proceed with the erection of alternative accommodation at <Col N="779" /> Monkstown Farm, and, if so, if he will state on what evidence he based the view that the latter site is either suitable or acceptable to the workers concerned; whether he is aware that of the applicants for accommodation on the Dunardagh site, 221 are persons residing in overcrowded, insanitary or condemned houses in the town of Blackrock or in the district situated between Blackrock and Booterstown, and that it would be impossible for these applicants to avail of accommodation offered at Monkstown, as it is too far from their places of employment, inaccessible either to church or schools, and without convenient transport facilities; and whether he will reconsider the proposal of the local authority with a view to its approval.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 13th December last, I informed the Dun Laoghaire Borough Council that I was unable to approve of the proposal to acquire land at Dunardagh, Blackrock, for the purpose of erecting houses under the Housing of the Working Classes Acts. I pointed out that the scheme was designed to meet the entire needs of the borough, which extends for ten miles along the coast, and that, obviously, the concentration of all the houses on one particular site in a comparatively remote part of the borough was far from meeting actual requirements. Furthermore, the scheme was to consist almost entirely of three-roomed houses and I could not approve of a scheme for the provision of houses of such limited accommodation.</P>
      <P>The evidence at the inquiry does not support the view that there is no alternative site available at Blackrock.  I informed the council that they should consider a scheme for the erection of houses on land acquired by them some time ago at Monkstown Farm.  The site is adjacent to a site on which the council have already erected a large number of houses.  I further suggested to the corporation to explore the possibility of acquiring sites in other areas that would be located reasonably convenient for families in need of houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The evidence submitted at the <Col N="780" /> inquiry does not corroborate the statement that 221 of the applicants for houses are living in the conditions described in the question.</P>
    <P>The proposal was to acquire the land compulsorily and the decision is not one which can be reviewed.</P>

      <P>As regards the third and fourth parts of the question, the Prices Commission has already submitted reports to me in five cases.  The reports in two of these cases have been published and effect has been given to the commission's recommendations.</P>
      <P>The commission's reports in the other three cases will be published at an early date.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that <Col N="783" /> the minor relief schemes and the employment schemes (roads rural) operated in each county by the survey staff of the county council are both governed by the same conditions of unemployed labour, and as a result the works carried out under both headings are confined to the same districts, without due regard to the needs or convenience of the ratepaying community who are obliged to make a substantial contribution towards the latter schemes; and, if he will consider some alteration in the conditions which will permit of uniformity of expenditure over each county.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Flinn) Hugo Victor Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Flinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware of the conditions which govern the allocation and distribution of relief funds.  The moneys provided in the Employment Schemes Vote are voted by the Dáil specifically for schemes for the provision of employment and the relief of distress. Accordingly, grants for minor employment schemes and roads (rural) schemes are approved only for those areas in which recipients of unemployment assistance are available in sufficient numbers to form gangs of economic size.</P>
      <P>For the purpose of providing work in rural areas, minor employment schemes and roads (rural) schemes are used as a joint programme.  Each separate work must be situated within reach of the homes of the workers for whom it is intended, and each eligible unit of area is catered for by either a minor employment scheme or a roads (rural) scheme, and in such a way there is no overlapping between the two types of schemes.</P>
      <P>The incidence of unemployment is not uniform over the whole of each county, and it is not possible to establish uniformity of expenditure consistently with the purpose of the Vote.  It is not, therefore, proposed to make any alteration in the regulations.</P>

      <P>Is the Parliamentary Secretary aware that the net result of the working of the scheme is that all the roads in one portion of a county <Col N="784" /> are being done in that way while the roads in the other part are not being touched at all although the ratepayers have to make a contribution?</P>

      <P>I quite recognise that there is that difficulty, but the money is provided specifically for the relief of distress due to unemployment.  It is not provided for the purpose of building roads <i>per se.</i>  My difficulty is that I must put the money in the places where employment for the purpose of relieving distress is required.  Subject to that overriding necessity, I should consider anything.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he received from Mr. Joseph Reynolds, 47 Donnellan Avenue, Dublin (a) an application for a military service pension on January 21st, 1935; (b) an application for a disability pension on November 30th, 1937; whether, in respect of the first-mentioned application, Mr. Reynolds was summoned to attend before the board on November 1st, 1937, and in respect of the second application he was requested on January 3rd, 1938, to furnish particulars; and, whether, having regard to the fact that no decision has been communicated to Mr. Reynolds up to the present, he will state the reason for the long delay in dealing with the applications and the approximate date on which a decision will be communicated to him.</P>

      <P>I have received an application for a <Col N="789" /> military service pension from Mr. Joseph Reynolds, 47 Donnellan Avenue, Dublin.  Mr. Reynolds was examined by the advisory committee on the 1st November, 1937, but I have not yet received the referee's report on the claim.  I have also received a claim from Mr. Reynolds under the Army Pensions Act, 1937, and I have referred it to the Military Service Registration Board.  The board are still considering the claim and they have not yet reported to me the result of their investigations.  I am not yet in a position to state the approximate dates when decisions will be communicated to Mr. Reynolds on the respective claims.  Owing to the nature and extent of the investigations necessary to satisfy the requirements of the Acts, delay is unavoidable in dealing with the claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that this applicant was examined by both boards as long ago as 13 and 15 months respectively, does the Minister consider it impossible to satisfy the requirements of the Act within so long a period as that?  Is it not possible to expedite a decision in a case where a man has been definitely examined and interviewed by the board as long ago as 15 months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>It all depends on the case.  In some cases the applicants are interviewed and the cases can be dealt with at once.  Those are clear cases.  In other cases it is not possible to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This case is not likely to change in the future.  Whatever facts are available are there; there is no likelihood of any change of circumstances. Can the Minister come to a decision, and arrange that the decision be communicated to Mr. Reynolds, on the information which is at present available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, even though the facts do not change the existence of the facts is sometimes apparent, and at other times it is not. If the referee gets evidence that the facts of the case warrant the granting of a pension, there is no undue delay. <Col N="790" /> If evidence is not brought forward in that way, what can we do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I remind the Minister that this application was in four years on the 31st of last month. In that period surely there was a reasonable time in which to ascertain whether the facts were available or whether they could be confirmed.  In view of the fact that Mr. Reynolds was examined so long ago by both boards, would the Minister endeavour to expedite a decision in the case?</P>

      <P>I understand so.  There were some tenders that were not accepted because I believe the people who tendered did not go on the site to see how much had to be done. Recently, more satisfactory tenders were submitted.  That was one of the causes of the delay; two sets of tenders were rejected because all were too high and the people did not go on the site to see what job had to be done.  The recent tenders were more satisfactory, and I think they will now be in a position to proceed.</P>

      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil hereby approves of the Gárda Síochána Pensions (No. 2) Order, 1938, made on the 25th day of July, 1938, by the Minister for Justice, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, under Section 13 of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, and laid before the Dáil on the 9th day of February, 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Order is to ensure that the widows and orphans of members of the Gárda Síochána shall not, on the whole, be in a less favourable position than they would be if the Gárda Síochána were not exempted from the scope of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, 1935.  As Deputies are aware, the Department of Local Government and Public Health are satisfied that the benefits conferred by the Order bring, as far as widows' pensions and children's allowances are concerned, the Gárda Síochána scheme of pensions into line with the provisions of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act.  As a result this Order has to be made.  There are two or three main provisions in the Order which alter the position that obtained in previous years relating to pensions of widows and orphans of the Gárdaí. (1) At present a member of the force who has completed five years' but less than ten years' service is not entitled to a pension on retiring for ill-health. If he subsequently dies his widow receives a pension only if his death is in consequence of the disease or injury on account of which he retired.  The new Order removes this restriction and the widow will receive a pension irrespective of the cause of death; (2) where a member of the force is disabled <Col N="796" /> as a result of an injury received in the execution of his duty; for example, a man on protection duty is shot at and seriously wounded, a &ldquo;special&rdquo; pension is payable.  If the member in question subsequently dies, having had less than five years' service, a pension is paid to the widow only if the member died as a result of the injury for which he received the pension. If, for example, he was killed in a motor accident the widow would get nothing.  This Order provides for a pension for a widow in all cases.  (3) At present, apart from cases of injury received in the execution of duty, children's allowances are payable only if the member dies while serving or within 12 months from the granting of a pension.  The Order removes the 12 months' limitation and children's allowances will be payable in any case in which a widow's pension is payable or would have been payable but for the fact that she predeceased her husband. This matter has been discussed with the Department of Local Government, and that Department is satisfied about this Order.</P>

      <P>This Bill provides for the repeal of the Act relating to the Tariff Commission mentioned in the text of the measure and as the immediate consequence of its passing into law it would bring to an end the work of the Tariff Commission.  The House is aware that in the Control of Prices Act, 1937, provision has been made for the reconstitution of the Prices Commission on a basis which provides for dealing with the question of tariffs in relation to prices and which, in effect, will constitute it both a tariff and prices commission.  Accordingly, it is felt that there is no need for the commission which was set up under the earlier Act, now proposed to be repealed, and that commission will be brought to an end.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel absolutely astonished at the inadequate comment of the Minister on the Bill now before the House.  The work previously done by the Tariff Commission is now to be handed over to <Col N="798" /> the Prices Commission, and everything in relation to these matters is now supposed to be related to prices of one kind or another.  I would not mind if the Minister for Finance had shown that he thought the new machinery was something that would replace the old, and if he had not documentary evidence before him since the Anglo-Irish Agreement was made that the Prices Tribunal cannot satisfactorily deal with matters it was asked to deal with.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce told us recently that he had applications for something like 100 reviews of prices that had been submitted either by the Government of Great Britain or by manufacturers in Great Britain to the Government here, and that the Prices Commission was going to deal with them.  It is obvious to anyone looking at the way in which the Department of Industry and Commerce has faced the question of industrial development that it has done so in a most haphazard way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance could purr over the matter, because he saw his revenue swelling year after year, as a result of customs duties imposed at the behest of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in order, allegedly, to develop Irish industry.  The Minister for Finance did not particularly mind, because that solved some of his difficulties, and brought money his way that he would not care to have to come and claim in a more outspoken way.  On the side of the Department of Industry and Commerce the industrial expansion that has taken place has been most haphazard, and even to-day we are liable to see increased industrial expansion, not as a result of any kind of carefully thought-out plan, but of political pressure brought to bear on the Minister by some persons, who think if they get an industry started that some kind of propaganda can be made out of the idea that they were starting another Irish industry here.  Industrial development is to be influenced either by pressure of that particular kind, internally, or by the chance landing on our shores of some refugee from some disturbed part of the Continent of Europe, saying that he has experience in a particular <Col N="799" /> line and that he has a certain amount of money and, perhaps, a certain amount of machinery.</P>
    <P>As far as we can see, superficially at any rate, we are dependent on chances like that to develop our Irish industry here.  On the other hand, such review of Irish industry as there is going to be is now going to be a piecemeal review by the Prices Commission at the request, perhaps, of some outside manufacturer, more likely at the request of some outside manufacturer, who wants to argue that he can supply better stuff here than the Irish manufacturers are supplying.</P>
    <P>As I say, I would understand the Minister dealing so inadequately with the present matter if he had not documentary evidence that what the Prices Commission are engaged on at the moment and what the Department of Industry and Commerce, as a Department, are supposed to be engaged on at the moment is not a practicable thing.  The agreement was signed in the early part of last year.  In the middle of the year, July, 1938, representatives of Australia and of Great Britain sat down to discuss why, over a period of six years, no success had been achieved as between Great Britain and Australia in dealing with the matters that the Minister for Finance now suggests are going to be dealt with satisfactorily here as between Great Britain and ourselves by the Prices Commission and by his Department. The document that arose out of these discussions, which was signed by representatives of the British Government and of the Australian Government, shows that it was quite impracticable to arrange satisfactory agreement on the trading relations between the two countries on the basis of the ideas enshrined in paragraphs, I think it was, 9 to 13 of the agreement signed in Ottawa in 1932 between Great Britain and Australia.  What has been enshrined as governing the Prices Commission's work in the agreement signed with Great Britain by ourselves, in the early part of last year, are practically the things that were signed in the 1932 agreement between Australia and <Col N="800" /> Great Britain.  In paragraph 7 of the agreement signed on the 20th July last, it was indicated that the articles in the 1932 agreement between Australia and Great Britain had not been satisfactorily worked and that the British and the Australians could not agree about them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister to direct his attention to the conditions that were existing in Australia, to the things that the Australian Government and the British Government tried mutually to do, and to the fact that representatives of Great Britain and Australia wrote down in an official document, on the 20th July, 1938, that they could not do them.  They signed an agreement in 1932 that they would do it or try to do it and, as a result of six years' attempting to carry out the agreement, representatives of the two Governments had to sign a statement which, paraphrased, runs like this: that the articles could not be worked; that two ways presented themselves to the Ministers of trying to get some other way to govern trading agreements between the two Governments.  One was to endeavour to revise the articles so as to satisfy the requirements of both countries.  They decided that this has so far proved impracticable.  After trying to work agreements somewhat like our own, which were signed in 1932, they had to admit, six years afterwards, that to revise them in such a way as would satisfy the requirements of both countries had so far proved impracticable.  They left it at that, and they decided that they were going to make no further attempt to revise these articles so as to provide a satisfactory means of carrying on their mutual trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other plan that was considered was to abolish the articles altogether <Col N="801" /> and to substitute for them a schedule of maximum rates of duty which would operate during the currency of a new agreement.  It was suggested that that was a way of doing things that had become rather common in a certain number of modern international agreements, but it was pointed out that, because of the fact that Australia was a young and developing country and that it had wage-fixing tribunals and consequent fluctuations in industrial costs, it was not likely that an agreement based on fixed rates of duties would serve any useful purpose.</P>
    <P>If Australia is a young and developing country surely, as far as the normal developing of our industrial life here is concerned, we are fairly young too and all the hurry and all the bustle that there has been for the last six years is because of the fact that, due to past historical causes, our industrial development lagged behind what it ought to be in a country with our possibilities and with our population. Therefore, we can claim that, in respect of the necessity for further industrial development here, we are a young country and that we require further development.</P>
    <P>Again, we can also claim that, to some extent, we are a country that has a machinery for wage-fixing but we certainly can claim that, in recent years at any rate, we are a country in which there have been very considerable fluctuations in industrial costs.  So that we can claim everything here that would make it impossible to work satisfactorily a trade agreement with Great Britain either on the principles that have been enshrined in the agreement made in the early part of last year or in any attempt to review or to remodel these in any way or under a scheme of fixed rates of duties.</P>
    <P>The Australians agreed that they attempted to investigate the possibility of adopting a system of fixed rates of duties but that, as everybody signed in the document, they realise that it cannot be adopted without determining what lines of development of secondary industry will be followed by Australia during the next few years.  Both parties to the document that was signed in July last indicated that they believed <Col N="802" /> that, if inquiries were put in hand for the purpose of determining the lines of general plans of industrial development in Australia, much good would result; that, as far as the position of United Kingdom exporters was concerned, they would be protected to that extent and the necessity for the articles which at present invoke criticism would disappear.</P>
    <P>We could claim that, if there is to be any stability or any satisfactory outlook on the part of people who are putting either capital or energy into the development of Irish industry here, or if there is to be any kind of stable outlook on the part of workers who are going to find employment in future in industry, nothing is more necessary for them, that is, nothing is more necessary or more important internally here at the present time, and particularly because of some of the disturbing effects of what is said, implied, or feared about the Anglo-Irish Agreement, than that there would be some kind of stable outlook established on the lines upon which we would definitely direct our energies in the developing of Irish industry during, say, the next five years.</P>
    <P>The Department of Industry and Commerce is not going to do it.  The Prices Commission, bombarded from all directions by something like 100 odd demands, in view of the offer which the Minister for Industry and Commerce has already received from Great Britain for the review of tariffs, cannot see the thing as a whole.  The Department of Industry and Commerce, with all the detailed work that it has to do at the present time, all the pressure that has been brought to bear on it, such as the pressure and protests that have been in such great volume brought on it during the last six years, which have been responsible for some of the type of industrial development we had, is not either organised or, as a result of its experience for the last six years, the proper kind of body to review things as a whole.  The Prices Commission, in these new circumstances, is the last body in the world to which we could look to inspire us with confidence that it was going to review the matters which came before <Col N="803" /> it as if it were a body whose members had a clear outlook on the lines upon which more stable industrial development should be continued and carried on here during the next five years.  The whole approach to the question of tariffs, as directed to the development of Irish industry, which the Tariff Commission was set up to have, and had, while it was working, is the type of approach that we want to have made to the general review of the main lines of a possible industrial expansion here during the next five years.  It not only involves looking at new developments, but looking at the whole of our present industrial situation, and seeing what are the main foundations of our present industry which have to be sedulously and carefully guarded and developed from any chance injury as a result of some of the work done before the establishment of the Prices Commission.</P>
    <P>I think that, instead of abolishing the Tariff Commission, it should be retained, and should be given increased functions, or a different function, for the purpose of doing what was definitely recognised by representatives of Great Britain and Australia when they held their discussions before July last as being necessary for a sound appreciation of the industrial requirements of Australia in the future, and, in the light of that clear appreciation, for the possibility of carrying on satisfactory trading relations between the two countries in a way which would be devoid of friction of any kind.  For that reason I oppose the abolition of the Tariff Commission.  I oppose it for the reason that I consider it should be retained, and should be put in the position of doing what is clearly stated here after a full examination of a situation comparable with our own, of doing what is absolutely necessary, even if it were only to stabilise us and make business like and practical sound trading relations between ourselves and Great Britain.  In my opinion, it is required for an even more important reason&mdash;the stabilising of our own outlook as to our industrial foundations here, the protection of such of our industrial foundations as may be injured, or are likely to be injured, by <Col N="804" /> the piecemeal discussions that are going on and, generally, to put us in the position, now that we are getting a certain amount of sanity in the conduct of our general economic activities, of knowing where our industrial foundation is going to be.</P>
    <P>An examination of the discussions which went on between Australia and Great Britain would show that they were carried on in the light of the fact that an increased population was necessary in Australia.  Here we are in a country whose population is declining, and declining unnecessarily, and as a result of some of our economic and political operations of the last five years.  It was definitely set down in those discussions that, on national grounds and on economic grounds, primary production in Australia is to be maintained and improved, that its secondary industries have to have a continued development, that its defence needs have to be looked after and that they may have to treat with other countries.  Everything that should enter into a consideration of how we are going to do our internal economic business here, or carry on our relations with other people, came up for discussion and review as between people circumstanced as ourselves and Great Britain a couple of months ago, and three months after we had signed our agreement with Great Britain.</P>
    <P>Everything arising out of these discussions drives home to us the fact that the Department of Industry and Commerce is not dealing with the really essential thing which requires to be dealt with at the moment, and that the Prices Commission cannot. The Tariff Commission, remodelled and given other powers related to the very important situation here, could do a very necessary work.  The Tariff Commission was set up to help in the getting of a sound, secure and developing Irish industry firmly established here, and not to get increased revenue.  Every matter to which the Minister for Finance addresses himself emphasises more and more that what he is concerned about is to have his Treasury full.  On these grounds, I oppose the Bill and I urge the Minister to turn his thoughts, and <Col N="805" /> the thoughts of his colleagues, to the matters I have emphasised.  I should also like to know, now that a proposal has come from the Government to abolish the Tariff Commission, when they will do the Tariff Commission the honour of publishing their last report on fish barrels?  Why is that report withheld and are there any other reports which have been withheld?  If there are, I should like to know why, and when it is intended to publish them, so that we may have a complete record of the work of the Tariff Commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made no attempt whatever to make a case for the repeal of the original Act.  If he wanted to make a case, the Minister is the one man who could stand up and talk for two minutes, or two hours, as the case might be, and make a case in favour of anything he was asking the House to pass.  Is it to be taken for granted that, because the Minister has a machine-like majority behind him, although he had only seven or eight Deputies to listen to his speech, he does not feel obliged to make a case to the House for a measure of this kind, and consequently does not give a curse about what other sections of the House may think of a proposal of this or any other kind? I had hoped that he would give justifiable reasons as to why he was burying the Tariff Commission in the memory of the past, and, what is much more important from my point of view, that he would be able to make a convincing case that the Prices Commission, which is going to do the work of the Tariff Commission in future, would be able to do that work expeditiously and efficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not concerned about the individuals who constituted the Tariff Commission, nor am I concerned about the personnel of the Prices Commission, so long as the Prices Commission, which, from my point of view is a very important body, does the work which the Minister, the House and the country expects them to do.  Answering a question of mine last week, and in a further reply to-day, the Minister for Industry and Commerce indicated that <Col N="806" /> there were over 100 applications awaiting hearing before the Prices Commission, arising out of the settlement made last year with Great Britain.  I want to know from the Minister whether it is to be understood, as was stated in the House some time ago by a back-bencher, that the Prices Commission must give the whole of their time to this work until it is completed, and that, while there is a case, or cases, awaiting hearing as a result of the settlement of the economic war, they cannot deal with cases that have a particular interest for the population of this State as a whole.  In other words, am I to understand from the Minister for Finance, that, if the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or his Department, is asked to deal with a case of alleged profiteering in connection with some particular internal industry, the hearing of that application must wait over until all the cases from British or other outside people are heard?  I want to know about that matter particularly, because I am not sure as to what is the procedure of the Prices Commission in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce&mdash;to the surprise, I am sure, of those who were listening to him last week&mdash;said that he would be quite satisfied if all the applications submitted by British industrialists which are now awaiting hearing were concluded within the three-year period. Is not that a convincing case for the establishment of a full-time body to deal with this matter if the work of the Prices Commission is to be properly done in as short a time as possible?  This whole matter must be regarded from the point of view of the people who are affected by the activities of this commission.  I submit to the Minister for Finance that, in the case of any Irish industry, the future of such an industry, from the point of view of those who have invested their money in the industry and of the employees of that industry, will be in very grave doubt while this sort of thing continues, and that, to that extent, the future progress of the industry will be affected.  From time to time, for instance, I have come into touch with people who have <Col N="807" /> invested their money in Irish industries, and they have repeatedly said, whether they believed in it or not&mdash; and I am sure that other Deputies in the House have had the same experience, and perhaps the Minister himself has had the experience&mdash;that while the hearing of their cases are pending, the Irish industries in which they have invested their money are in jeopardy.  My contention is that the Prices Commission should be constituted as a permanent body with full-time officials.</P>

The question here concerned is whether a certain commission set up formerly&mdash; that is, the Tariff Commission&mdash;should be abolished.  In referring to the matter of the Prices Commission, Deputy Davin is going into the bailiwick of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is not here and who is not responsible for the matter now before the House.

      <P>Well, probably, the Deputy knows more about that body and its personnel than I do, and if his knowledge of the powers of these individuals has any bearing in comparison with the time the Deputy himself takes up in this House, he certainly knows more than I do.  All I want is to get information from the Minister with regard to this matter&mdash;information, which, I suspect, Deputy Dillon already has in his possession.  I hold that the Minister should not be allowed to dismiss this matter of the abolition of the former Tariff Commission with just a few words.  The House should be afforded some information as to the work of the Prices Commission.  After all, the Minister for Finance is responsible for the payment of the salaries of these people, and there is the question of the time that might be necessary for these people to do their work.  As I have said already, we have had the statement from the Minister for Industry and Commerce that it would take three years for these people to do their work in connection with matters concerned with the international agreement, which is apart from the ordinary work of the commission.  The Chairman of the Prices Commission, who is a civil servant, is employed full-time in connection with that work, but the other two members, as, I am sure, is known to Deputy Dillon, are only part-time members and are also members of other commissions set up by this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce, when speaking on this matter <Col N="810" /> in, I think, the early part of last year, gave expression to the suspicion that the then Prices Commission would not be able to do its work within a reasonable time and suggested that it might be necessary to increase the personnel of that commission and to duplicate the commission in other ways, if that were necessary.  That was before the Trade Agreement, but now the Minister for Industry and Commerce says that he will be quite satisfied if the commission is able to do the work, which has now been delegated to that commission as a result of the international agreement, within three years &mdash;apart altogether from their ordinary functions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit, Sir, that Deputy Davin should not ask why the House should be required to abolish the Tariff Commission, as the reason is quite simple and apparent.  The Tariff Commission, in the past, when any particularly outrageous fraud was sought to be put over on any of the people in this country by one of the potential plunderers whom we are now sheltering, tried to expose these frauds. In the face of the revelations of that <Col N="811" /> body from time to time, with regard to some of these would-be plunderers, the Government found itself in the position of having to refuse some of these applications, and the result has been that the activities of that &ldquo;officious&rdquo; body have been suspended for the last three or four years, and the boys have had a royal time.  I am now going to describe in small detail to the House the activities of three or four of them, because I have taken the trouble to find them out. But they are not content with getting the body suspended. They do not like to have their night's sleep disturbed by the thought that it may be revived.  They want to dispose of it finally, to bury it fathoms deep, so that it can never be revived.  The only way they can do that is to get an Act passed by this House, which is supposed to represent the consumers in the country, burying fathoms deep the Tariff Commission, and we are going to do it.  You will see the Fianna Fáil Party waving their banners and marching into the lobby to finish the Tariff Commission.</P>

But they are not going to represent them to-day.  They have got orders from the tariff-mongers that their sleep is being disturbed by the thoughts of the Tariff Commission, and the only way that royal rest can be restored is to abolish the Tariff Commission altogether.  Then they can lie back on their feather beds without this pea to irritate them. What has happened during the period of the suspended activity of the Tariff Commission?  We have had a cement industry set up in this country.  If the Tariff Commission had been functioning the cement ring would have to go before that commission and explain the circumstances under which they wanted to establish the industry here. <Col N="812" /> What, in fact, happened?  The cement ring entered into some kind of negotiations with the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is an amendment of the original Act.  Under the first Act, the Minister competent to <Col N="815" /> refer an application to the Tariff Commission for investigation was the Minister for Finance.  Under the Tariff Commission (Amendment) Act, 1930, that was altered, so that the Executive Council might refer such an application. The question as to whether the Tariff Commission has ceased functioning or not is a question of administration which ought to be discussed, I submit, on the Vote for the Minister for Industry and Commerce or on the Vote for the Taoiseach's Department. The fact that an application for a tariff upon cement was not referred to the Tariff Commission is a matter, again I say, purely of administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>May I submit that this is a Bill to carry suspension to the point of abolition?  Having lulled the country into a sense of security by suspension for four years they want to get away with the abolition.  I submit that I can argue against that and, with your leave, Sir, I propose to do so.  In the circumstances surrounding this House some years ago, you had a Tariff Commission functioning and it was open to any interested party to say to the Minister: &ldquo;This is a complex matter; this is a matter which we want technical experts to examine: there is only one body can do it and that is the Tariff Commission.&rdquo;  If we had done it we would have had the Minister making the case before the Tariff Commission that he made to us.  He would have to go forward and state then as he said to us:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I want to protect the people of this country from exploitation.  There is a big international cartel who are just waiting for the chance to raise the price of cement here, and my case is if you let me put a tariff on cement I can protect the people of Ireland from exploitation by that international cartel, for we will make cement in Ireland in a factory over which the international cartel will not have control and our people will not have to pay the international cartel a big tax on the cement produced by this cartel.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what the Minister would have <Col N="816" /> told us.  It was upon that that the House created a monopoly.  When that monopoly had been created, when the price of cement was raised, when the factories were built and when the board was constituted, whom do we find as chairman of the board?  A nominee of the international cartel.  We discovered that it was too late then, that we had raised a tariff not to protect our people against the cartel, but actually to provide a safe place of refuge for the international cartel inside our own tariff and that we had raised the tariff to enable the Danish cartel to come into Ireland, exploit the Irish people, and deny them the right of benefiting by competition on the cement which is available from Poland and Spain at this moment.</P>
    <P>That thing was done with the knowledge, as any of us could have told the Tariff Commission, that time and again the cartel had approached the Spanish and Polish manufacturers and asked them to withdraw their competition from Ireland so that the cartel could raise their prices.  But the Spanish and Polish manufacturers said: &ldquo;No, we are going on to compete in the Irish cement market.&rdquo;  As a result of that all the associated units of the Danish cartel, including the British units, had to sell to us in Ireland cement at the same price as the Spanish or Polish cement manufacturers sold their cement; because if they did not the Polish and Spanish cement manufacturers would come in and the international cartel would lose the Irish market.  In that set of circumstances they persuaded our Government to provide a safe place of refuge for the Dane to come in here and rob our people as they are robbing them at the present moment.  And anyone who dares to comment or dares to object to putting the responsibility and burden on the tenant or occupier of a labourer's cottage being made to pay a heavy tax for cement to the Danish combine is called a traitor and a saboteur.</P>
    <P>Does any Deputy in the House doubt that if the Tariff Commission had been functioning they would have found out that plan and they would have warned the Oireachtas of the dangers of what <Col N="817" /> the Oireachtas had been invited to do in this matter of the Tariff Commission? Does anyone imagine that if we had been asked to build a tariff wall to protect the Dane while exploiting the Irish people, that we would have been so foolish as to do it?  Is it any wonder that I for one am exposing that here and that I am deploring the passing of the Tariff Commission?  Had the Tariff Commission been given an opportunity of exposing that before it was too late we would not now be in the position of looking on at this actually in operation and unable to prevent it. Let me now for a moment touch on the question of the linen trade and the question of the firm set up to manufacture linen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is now going into questions of administration, some even of four or five years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, Sir, I am going into this matter of the linen trade purely for the purpose of showing the House what will result from the absence of an opportunity of having the merits of the tariff examined.  I am stating facts in order to warn the House that heretofore these warriors were always faced with the danger of having the Tariff Commission revived.  But if it is abolished there is no machinery, no one can call them up and ask them what are their projects and no one could say to the people: &ldquo;Let us examine your representations; we want somebody to cross-examine you before the people and tell the people of the country then what three reasonable men think of your proposition.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now I want the House to take the case of the linen thread.  A firm was set up to establish the linen thread business here.  I ask Deputies to note closely what happened in this case. These people went to the Government and represented that they had a patent from the North of Ireland thread manufacturers, especially from the Glasgow Thread Company.  Their representations to the Government were: &ldquo;We can face with a tariff of 60 per cent., the competition from Northern Ireland, <Col N="818" /> but the Linen Thread Company of Glasgow is too powerful, and the only way in which you can protect us against them is to give us a 100 per cent. tariff.&rdquo;  And they got that 100 per cent. tariff.  This House was asked to give them that protection in order to protect them against the Linen Thread Company of Glasgow, which was the villain of the piece.  We gave them the 100 per cent. tariff behind which they would have been able to raise the price of linen thread to the people.</P>
    <P>Within 12 months of the getting of that 100 per cent. tariff, the Linen Thread Company of Glasgow had a circular sent out.  That circular runs:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Irish Thread Manufacturers, Co., Ltd., Dublin, and ourselves have come to an agreement whereby we will be the sole selling agent for their threads, shoe threads and twines in Éire, and this arrangement will take place as from the 1st February, 1939.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have already had the 100 per cent. tariff wall behind which the Linen Thread Company of Glasgow is to be invited to plunder our people.  Is it conceivable that any such plot could have been hatched if the Tariff Commission were there to examine that plot before we plunged into it?  Is there any Deputy in this House who knew that that was afoot?  Did Deputies know that it was to provide a harbour of refuge for the Linen Thread Company of Glasgow to come in here and to rob our people?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, when I have finished.  We are only beginning to find a necessity for the gas masks now.  I invite Deputies to note the position. We provided not only a tariff but a monopoly to an industry for bootlaces in the town of Ennis.  There was no Tariff Commission.  An agent arrived here to establish a firm in Ennis to manufacture bootlaces and elastics behind a prohibitive wall.  The manufacturing process in the preliminary stages consisted of importing the braid <Col N="819" /> for the laces, cutting this into lengths and putting on the eyelets at the end. The elastic was brought in and bleached and the price was substantially raised.  This firm carried on for three years during which they made exorbitant profits in each of the three years after having paid themselves immense salaries.  At the end of that period having, I think, taken a bonus they floated a company.  Mark well the asset for which they asked that there should be a monopoly conferred on them by the Government! They sold the monopoly back to the Government and put the proceeds of the sale into their own pockets.  They floated a company and they let the Industrial Credit Corporation take up the entire issue.  The Government have now bought back from Jordan's of Ennis at an immense sum the monopoly they themselves gave them three years before.  Is that believable?  The only way we had of finding that out was the Tariff Commission machinery &mdash;of finding it out, whether it was any good to know it.  Now we can only find it out when the scandal becomes so noxious that its stench penetrates into every cranny and nook in the country. But these things ought to be controlled and stopped before they stink. That has never been done.  Take the case of the thread company.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all.  We are now finding why the gas masks are necessary. There was a tariff put on cotton thread coming into this country, a prohibitive tariff, and a monopoly was granted.  Mark well what happened here.  Two applicants put in for the making of cotton thread in this country, one, the firm of J. &amp; P. Coats of Paisley, and the other a firm from the Midlands of England.  Now it is terribly hard to get facts of this kind when there is no tariff machinery working. We have simply got to try to pick up the facts wherever we can put our fingers on them.  To the best of my knowledge the facts in this case are: A firm in the Midlands of <Col N="820" /> England had been to Coats three or four times asking Coats to buy them out.  Coats's reply was: &ldquo;We would not take you if you were given away with a pound of tea; you have nothing; we are not afraid of your competition; your product is rotten and we are quite satisfied that you will go to the wall in God's good time.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>None of these tariffs was referred to the Tariff Commission.  It <Col N="821" /> is now proposed to abolish the commission altogether.  I am arguing that so long as the Tariff Commission was there there was some control on them because they always felt that they might be referred to the Tariff Commission. We are now proposing to go a step further and to remove even the threat of the Tariff Commission.  I say if you do that, that whatever control there was on them, whatever apprehension they had that they might be shown up, they can now feel there is no danger at all, once the commission is gone.  They can say that there is nobody to ask them any questions, no matter what extravagances they indulge in.  Surely that is legitimate argument.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order. I wish to direct the attention of the Chair to what the Tariff Commission Act of 1926 provides.  It says in subsection (1) of Section 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whenever an application is made to the Minister for Finance by any persons substantially representative of the persons engaged or proposing to engage in the production in Saorstát Eireann of goods of any particular class or description for the imposition, modification, abolition, or renewal of a customs duty on the importation of goods of that class or description, the said Minister may, if he so thinks fit, refer such application to the commission.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The point I wish to make is this that, in fact, in so far as existing industries are concerned, unless the Minister for Finance under the Act of 1926, or the Government under the Act of 1930, wishes to refer an application to the Tariff Commission, the Tariff Commission acts on its own initiative.</P>

That is the whole purpose of my argument.  I have one more case to demonstrate what did happen when there was nothing more than the threat of the Tariff Commission in the offing. I have told the House of this company that went to J. and P. Coats and begged Coats to buy them out. Coats's reply, as I have already told the House, was:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We would not take you if you were given away with a pound of tea.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The argument that I am making is that if the machinery of the Tariff Commission were available to us we could have called it together.

      <P>There could be some recommendation to the Minister. Therefore, these applicants would have been debarred from establishing themselves if they had to cross the fence of the Tariff Commission.  What happened was that this Midland English firm got the monopoly, and, having raised the price of thread to the consumers here substantially, they went <Col N="823" /> back to Coats's and said: &ldquo;The last time we came to you you insulted us; you said you would not take us if we were given away with a pound of tea; that we had nothing that you wanted to buy.  Have we anything that you want to buy now?&rdquo; Coats's said: &ldquo;Yes.  You have the Irish monopoly.&rdquo; The firm said: &ldquo;We are prepared to sell it for so much.&rdquo;&ldquo;There is your money,&rdquo; said J. and P. Coats, and J. and P. Coats came in.  The net result of the transaction was that we created a monopoly which J. and P. Coats were prepared to work for nothing, and we would not let them, but we let in this firm from the Midlands of England who went with our monopoly and sold it to J. and P. Coats.  Coats were glad to pay for it, and they are now manufacturing thread in this country and charging our people 15 per cent. more than they were prepared to supply them with it if they were let come in without any monopoly at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what is happening.  Those are the kind of things that you cannot find out if there is no body with statutory power to examine tariff applicants, to check up on their statements and find out these things.  A Deputy can only find them out after years of inquiry, by going to this one and to that one to get a bit of information here and a bit of information there, and then to weave a pattern as best he can, to ascertain the truth and expose it.  Before you have got the truth the damage is frequently done. Furthermore, if you dare to tell the truth the whole power of the vested interests of this country is turned on the person who has the effrontery to do it.  They have their spies everywhere and their agents everywhere. Their power is extraordinary.  They are wealthy men; they are wealthy combines and they are no fools.  They do not threaten you directly, but you suddenly discover that it would have been materially advantageous if you had not taken a certain line.  You suddenly discover that there are difficulties arising in your business that never arose before, and when the average man finds that out he begins <Col N="824" /> to ask himself: &ldquo;Why should I bother about this?  I am not very interested in cotton thread, and why should I get my neck broken by the vested interests in order to reveal the truth?&rdquo; The result is that a gradually accumulating pressure induces a considerable number of people to maintain silence and the game goes cheerfully on, and our people, for whom we are supposed to be trustees, are robbed in silence.</P>
    <P>Is it right, in these circumstances, that we should abolish a body to which these powerful vested interests can be sent to make their case, a body of independent men whose position is secured, who operate under the protection of the full power of the Government, who have no reason to be afraid of the vested interests, men whom, by their situation, the vested interests cannot touch?  Is this the moment when we should abolish them altogether and leave our people open to be torn to pieces by those who want to exploit them?  Is it not time that somebody raised his voice against the invasion that is going on of fly-by-nights from the four corners of Europe, who are coming in here to be licensed on their say-so, without any adequate examination, to rob and plunder the poor of this country?</P>
    <P>That is happening now.  There is not one per cent of these fellows who would get past the Tariff Commission. If these gentlemen, with names that no man west of the Danube could pronounce, had to go before the Tariff Commission, do you imagine they would be let get away with the murder that they have been allowed to get away with for the last four or five years?  Do you imagine they would ever dream of attempting the plunder they are hatching at the moment for the next five years?  They would flee back to where they belong, if they would be let.</P>
    <P>There is no use in closing our eyes to facts.  I want to be clear on this. Any citizen of the Commonwealth of Nations, any citizen of the United States of America, who wants to come to this country and, seeking no favour but an equal opportunity with every <Col N="825" /> citizen of Éire, wants to earn his living here, is heartily welcome.  It is the least we could do to extend to such people a hearty welcome in acknowledgment of the welcome they gave our people in the past and are giving them at the present time.</P>
    <P>But it is an entirely different proposition when a gentleman with a name that is almost impossible to spell and quite impossible to pronounce arrives here and announces that if we give him a 60 per cent. tariff, behind which he is to be permitted to pluck our people, he will graciously consent to employ 35 or 40 little girls at the cheapest rate he can get them for and he will eat his meals in Jammet's Restaurant.  I, for one, am sick watching it, and I say openly to those fellows that we do not want them, that they are no good, that they are a pest and that if we ever get the chance we will chase them out.  It is time somebody said that.</P>

      <P>I am sorry, Sir, if you so rule.  I am not conscious of having done so.  I had hoped to envisage what I had reason to expect would happen if this Bill passed.  However, I withdraw from that position.  I will refer only to the state of affairs existing to-day and what we here propose to do. If you abolish this Tariff Commission you are going to injure our people. The consequences that will flow from it are a matter for another day, but they are of a character which I have reason to apprehend.  I have outlined some of them and on these grounds I ask the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party to end their servitude to the vested interests in this country and remember their duty to the people who sent them here.  I ask the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party who are supposed to represent the small farmers and the rural workers to bear in mind that those small farmers and rural workers are being robbed at the counters of every country shop in Ireland at the request of the people who want this Bill passed.  I say the only effective way of getting back for the small farmers and rural workers an opportunity to get fair value for their money in the shop is to refuse to pass this Bill, to maintain the Tariff Commission, and to prevent the rising of prices by the imposition of exorbitant tariffs.  I say if you do not do that you are sharing in the work of robbing our people for the benefit of the foreigner.  It is nearly time the Fianna Fáil Party woke up to that.  If Fianna Fáil Deputies go amongst their own neighbours they will learn that without learning it from me.  It is their duty, their solemn duty to the people whom they are supposed to represent here, to protect them against exploitation and robbery.  If they vote for this Bill they are helping the robbers; if they vote against it they are doing their duty to protect the people.  It is up to them to make the choice.  We shall give them the opportunity of protecting their people by voting with us in one Lobby or by voting for the exploiters in the other one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>After we have heard for the last half-hour the most extraordinary <Col N="828" /> and exaggerated vituperation from Deputy Dillon in regard to the new industries, I think it well that we should recall some of the earlier history of the Tariff Commission.  It is granted that the Tariff Commission has certain limited powers whereby the Minister could actually obviate complaints of the kind the Deputy referred to if he so desired, but as a result of the position which allowed the making of complaints against five or six industries which might or might not be desirable, I would remind Deputies that during the earlier period of the Tariff Commission's history, over 117 factories in this country closed their doors.  During the period from 1926 to 1931 the actual wages paid in industry in this country decreased, not by a small amount and not by a large amount, but by a certain amount.  If there had not been a very large increase in the production of electricity under the Shannon scheme, in the production of soap, candles, furniture and one or two other commodities, there would have been an actual serious decline in industrial production in this country. I would ask the House to measure against the actual cases that might arise&mdash;not the cases referred to by the Deputy, but other cases of which he is not aware&mdash;where one or two undesirable industries may have been created, the 117 factories owned by Irish industrialists which were closed during that period.  The answer is conclusive. During that period we were dependent completely on one market.  We had no alternative financial resources. Over 250,000 of our people left our shores, not during an economic war, not during a world depression, not during a condition of adjustment of our economy, but when we had what was supposed to be an ideal economic policy.  Yet the Deputy suggests that we should preserve this ancient monument, of what I might describe as, exaggerated free trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as foreign interests are concerned, perhaps the Deputy is not aware that the vast majority of what foreign interests there are in this country, are what he has already described as being Commonwealth or <Col N="829" /> English interests.  I believe a number of companies have entered into industry in this country under the provisions of the Control of Manufactures Act.  They are allowed to operate on the basis that they own one-third of the capital while Irish interests own two-thirds of the capital.  The vast majority of the new factories to which the Deputy refers as being controlled by foreign interests are actually British rather than foreign.  To go further in connection with the Deputy's argument, it is a simple fact that the very few non-British interests that have taken part in our industrial development, either as industrial experts or as people who brought their capital and machinery here, have been unusually successful.  While the gentleman whose name begins with a Z and ends with C employs some proportion of young people and females, industries in England which are supposed to set the standard for the Deputy, also employ both.  I am not going further into the question of foreign interests except to say that foreign interests which are non-British are definitely in a minority and interests which are definitely British or Commonwealth interests are actually the majority of the foreign interests in this country.</P>
    <P>In regard to the question of these exploiters who, according to the Deputy have robbed our people, I have had an intimate experience of industrial development in the past five years and I find the new industries have behaved, as one would imagine they would behave.  There are a number who have succeeded admirably. There are others who have struggled painfully along and there are a few who have made excessive profits, but, on the whole, taking them small and large, I think that Deputies can be assured that excessive profits are not being made by Irish manufacturers.</P>
    <P>With regard to the cement company, I should prefer to allow the Minister to answer the Deputy's allegations, but I would remind the House that that very same company was invited by Deputy McGilligan to come into this country.  Deputy Dillon ought to consult the members of his own Party <Col N="830" /> before he makes these allegations against the Danish promoter of the cement company.  The cement company make a very excellent cement which they sell at a very reasonable price.  It is under the effective control of the Irish people at present and the majority of the shareholders are in a position to dispose of the company in any way they wish.  Further, there is nothing to prevent the Prices Commission which has now really replaced the Tariff Commission, at the request of a builder, an importer or a consumer, making an exhaustive and minute examination of the whole standing and status of the cement company, as far as its prices are concerned and whether these prices can be considered reasonable when compared with the price of foreign manufactured cement or British cement.  There is nothing to prevent anybody demanding and obtaining an investigation of that kind by the Prices Commission.  I am perfectly certain that, if such an investigation were held, it would be found that the cement company are acting honourably, fairly and squarely. So far as the general exploitation of the community is concerned the Prices Commission are effectively dealing with all these cases.</P>
    <P>We are speaking here to a Bill to abolish the Tariff Commission.  The Tariff Commission had, or could have two functions.  It could have the function, which Deputy Mulcahy suggested, of formulating a general plan for industry and also the function of removing or preventing certain definite abuses.  As far as abuses are concerned, it is the belief of those on this side of the House that the Prices Commission should be able to deal effectively with them.  As far as the general planning of industry is concerned, we are told that the Government have no plan.  Once again I may say that I have been in intimate touch with the Government on questions of industrial development, and I am aware that under the Anglo-Irish Agreement there was a certain free list of commodities on which duties could not be imposed for three years.  I am also aware of the fact that when an industry asks for a tariff, so far <Col N="831" /> from being impressed by purely political consideration, the Minister responsible or his Department put the promoters of that industry through the most searching investigation.  At present, when a tariff is requested certain conditions are imposed.  First of all, it is understood that the prices of the goods manufactured in this country should bear some relation to the price of the goods ex-factory in England.  Secondly, they have to warn the promoters of these new industries that under the Anglo-Irish Agreement, as far as English imports are concerned, they cannot exceed certain duties after a certain period during which the new industry has been going through its initial stages.  Thirdly, they call for the encouragement of industries of a special type which can possibly develop exports and this last category includes industries with which foreign, definitely non-Commonwealth interests, are concerned.  A company has been allowed to operate here because it is going to resume an export trade which it formerly enjoyed in another country.  These people are of the very highest standing.  They operated their factory under good conditions in the country which they have left and this is an industry which the Opposition should be glad to see established because it will increase industrial exports.</P>
    <P>Speaking quite impartially for the moment, I do feel that one aspect of this question of the abolition of the Tariff Commission would strike anybody who is concerned with industrial development.  I am quite aware that the Government have a general plan; I am aware that at the present time the rules by which an industry can obtain a tariff are extremely strict, but I do feel the officials of the Department are so overwhelmed with work that the general picture of industry in the future here is very often not examined as well as it should be. Now that the economic war is over, now that the pressure to establish industry and give employment no longer exisits to the same extent, I suggest to the Government that they should endeavour to reorganise the Department so that there would be, <Col N="832" /> shall I say, a more studious planning of industry for the next five years.  It is, however, not true that industry of an undesirable kind can start here without full consideration of the facts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy referred to the Tariff Commission and the Prices Commission in relation to the recent Australian agreement.  He suggested that the whole machinery of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in relation to the Prices Commission, now replacing the Tariff Commission, was faulty and would have to be overhauled.  This country would have one serious difficulty if it adopted the Australian system.  The Australian system provides for the operation of a series of maximum duties and, under the tariff-assessment method which was adopted and carried on by the first Administration in this country, the tariffs are assessed on the price at which the goods can be bought on the quay at Dublin.  Under that method, it is very easy for goods to be dumped here at low prices, because the sole duty of the customs officers is to ensure that the goods were actually invoiced in the books of the exporter at the prices at which they can be bought on the quay at Dublin.  The Australians have a different system, which effectively excludes dumping, and I do not see how the Prices Commission or the Tariff Commission could adopt the Australian system without drastic overhaul of our entire method of customs assessment.</P>
    <P>I should like to close my few remarks with a reminder to Deputies on the opposite side that for ten years we were in a wilderness of inferiority complex and did nothing in relation to the home market.  Industry after industry was being closed down because of the failure of the Tariff Commission to give them practical assistance.  It was not that they were planning badly, but rather that they were not planning at all.  We have no regrets if, out of the many hundreds of industries established in this country during the last five years, there may be, here and there, a few black sheep, because we have altered the economy of the country in a more balanced direction.  We have seen that there <Col N="833" /> will be an opportunity of a livelihood of a more varied kind for the people and we have secured that, in time of war, certain commodities, such as cement, can be produced and normal conditions maintained as far as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing this proposal to abolish the Tariff Commission. It is rather interesting to hear occasionally about the many ills from which this country suffered from 1922 to 1932.  We have heard that about 117 factories were closed during that period and that about 250,000 left the country during the same period.  That is all very interesting.  I wonder if it occurred to anybody who made these statements to examine what was happening in the year 1922&mdash;whether there was any inducement to an industrialist to embark his money in this country or to invest a single penny in it.  It is instructive to observe that while we get a single figure for emigration&mdash;250,000 during that period of ten years&mdash;no advertence whatever is made to the fact that the largest numbers left in the earlier years and that in the last year of our administration there was no exodus at all.</P>
      <P>What has happened during the last six or seven years&mdash;the period in which we have got an industrial Utopia, when we have large and expansive industrial activity and what is called a &ldquo;balanced&rdquo; economy.  From having practically no emigration in our last year, it is now swelling up and we have as many leaving the country as left in the heyday of the disorder created by the architects of the industrial expansion of the last five years.</P>

      <P>It is extraordinary that, notwithstanding the opportunity the Minister has had of growing up in the last 15 years, he is as childish to-day as he was 15 years or 17 years ago, when he was against the Treaty.  He wants to forget that. The fact is that the Minister must stand on his record and it is a horrible one.  How has this better-balanced economy, of which we hear so much, been effected?  By beggaring the rural districts.  That is how it has been effected.  We are told that 117 factories were closed during that period.  Is there any country in the world in which factories were not closed during those ten years?  What country showed such expansion of industry during those years as ours did or what country had so many factories started during that period?  Take a single example.  A tobacco manufacturing industry was started in 1922.  What did the industrialists do when they came into power?  In their very first year, they closed a tobacco factory giving employment <Col N="835" /> to 300 persons.  If the Tariff Commission had been operating at that time and the action of the Minister in that connection were put before them, I wonder what would have been their answer?  This &ldquo;better-balanced economy&rdquo; has been introduced to the detriment of this country.  It has led to the sapping of the rural population and to a reduction in the number of people engaged in agriculture and, now, we are told that we have an extraordinary expansion of industry, effected, mind you, at the expense of the agricultural population of the country.  Not a single pound has been sunk in industry in this country that the farmers and the agricultural population of the country has not paid five times over every year since the start.</P>
      <P>What is the objection to the Tariff Commission?  The real objection to the Tariff Commission is that by reason of the agreement which has been made with Great Britain, this Parliament has, in respect of certain fiscal powers, lost its sovereignty, pawned its sovereignty, and that was to improve or help to improve to some extent the condition to which the agricultural industry has been reduced by reason of the policy which is blazoned as a better balanced economy.  There was a dispute at one time between two cats, and a monkey was called in to settle the matter.  The &ldquo;balanced economy&rdquo; of one cat happened to be bigger than that of the other, so the monkey consumed the surplus.  That is the manner of our balancing of our national economy.  A falling emigration is what this Ministry was presented with in 1932; it was down to zero, with a rising population inevitable, and they have sent the people flying out of the country during their extraordinary industrial expansion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that possibly some industries are not as desirable as others.  Is it not likely that the Tariff Commission would consider all the phases of any proposal for a tariff on industry?  Is it not likely, if such a question as an increase in the boot tariff had been put before the Tariff Commission, that we would not now <Col N="836" /> be presented with the danger of boot factories closing down, or of their working short time, or something of that sort?  Is it not more than likely that the Tariff Commission, if it had been allowed to operate and function, which it has not during those last few years, would have paid due and proper attention to the consumer, to the operatives, and to the person who is putting his money into any industrial concern?  While we are told that two-thirds of the money invested in those new industries is Irish money, it is quite possible that the aliens who have come over will get a sufficient salary to compensate them for any loss of capital they may have to sustain, and that they will get out while the going is good.</P>
    <P>A new term has been introduced into our discussions&mdash;&ldquo;British but not foreign.&rdquo;  There is one thing, anyway, about that Party over there, and that is, that they can contradict one another from morning till night, but all the time they have a plan, a planned economy.  Where is it?  What has happened to it?  There never was one.  There was never a plan for anything except muddling, and it has been one long succession of muddling from beginning to end.  The Minister can make his speeches at banquets at which he draws attention to the necessity for expansion in our production to compensate us for lack of interest on the capital that has been taken in from abroad, and that had to come in by reason of the events of the last few years&mdash;not a good sign.  If there had been a sound national economy, and a properly balanced national economy, in which the agricultural output of this country had been increasing in value as well as in volume, then everybody could welcome the expansion of the secondary industrial arm of this country, even at a cost, but if by reason of the method which has been employed we have an increase and, perhaps, only a temporary increase in our secondary industrial position at the cost of our agricultural position, then we have thrown away the substance for the shadow, and eventually we will have to get back to a sound national economy which can do away with or not pay any attention to such <Col N="837" /> well-sounding terms as &ldquo;a better-balanced national economy.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I am opposed to the repeal of the Tariff Commission.  The Minister made no case for his Repeal Bill, and certainly I did not extract anything from Deputy Childers's speech that would persuade me to change my views in the slightest degree.  The gem of Deputy Childers's speech came towards the end, when he said that the general plan was not examined as well as it should have been.  In those words, I think our case is made better than some of us could make it.  What is the case for the Minister's Bill?  Evidently, it is that things have gone on so well in the last six or seven years, that they have gone on better than they would have gone if the Tariff Commission had been functioning, which it had not.  I wonder if the House remembers that four or five or six years ago the Government brought in a Bill and rushed it through this House and eventually passed it under the closure giving them powers under which they have operated ever since.  Surely it is time we got away from that situation? Surely it is time we took out of the Minister's hands the power to pass tariffs and other similar legislation by regulation, possibly without examination or with only tentative examination, with the result that we have had certain people fostered in industry in this country growing rich at the expense of the vast majority of the consuming public of this country? If there are wealthy men, and if there have been, as Deputy Childers said, numerous men amongst the manufacturers of this country who have been unusually successful, there are tens of thousands of the people of this country&mdash;the people that matter in this country&mdash;who have been unusually misfortunate.  In this Oireachtas, within the last five or six weeks, when a certain prominent member of the Government Party was making a case for the Bill dealing with the increase of Ministers' salaries, he was taunted with a previous statement of his&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that £1,000 was too much for any man.  Like an honest man, he did not get up and deny that he ever said it; his case was that when he made that remark £1,000 was a good salary for any man, but that things had so improved under the beneficent Fianna Fáil Government that neither £1,000 nor £2,000 nor £3,000 was a good salary for any man; that if there was one man receiving £1,000 at that particular period, there are ten men receiving £2,000 at the present period.  There are plutocrats now receiving up to £5,000, who are waxing rich on fostered industries at the expense of the rural community. If there was any case at all made for meddling with the Tariff Commission, it should not be in the way of abolishing it, but rather towards getting back to the position when applications for tariffs on industries were referred to it.</P>

      <P>The tariffs they gave were given after consideration.  They were successful and did not impose undue burdens on other sections of the people.  Under this planned economy, and under this system of government by regulation, the powers given under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act, and similar Acts were rushed through this House without proper discussion, and under the closure.  The Government has been operating under these measures for the past five or six years, and these have brought men from various parts of Europe to set up industries under the protection of impossible tariffs, and, as Deputy Dillon said, to plunder the people of this country.  Deputy Dillon did not use words that were too strong.  It is time that we got back to sanity.  There are successful industries here.  Why <Col N="839" /> should there not be?  Why should not any man start an industry if he saw that there was a possible demand for the product, and make it a success under protection varying from 80 to 100 per cent.  The rural people have been footing the bill.  They can do so no longer.  It is time we got back to the position when applications for tariffs on industries were carefully examined.  If that was done we would not have the results to which Deputy Dillon pointed, regarding five or six of the largest industries that had been established.  No case has been made for the abolition of the Tariff Commission. On the other hand, every case has been made for its retention, and for its having the duties which first devolved upon it, that of carefully examining the possibility of any new industry.  If that had been done, possibly we would have been spared much of what has resulted under what has been described as the carefully thought out plans of the Government, plans, as Deputy Cosgrave pointed out, that have resulted in depopulating some of the rural areas and pauperising the remnants of them.</P>

      <P>I was handed a pamphlet last night which was written by ex-Republican Judge Crowley, the heading of which was entitled, &ldquo;Step by step back from the Republic.&rdquo;  Now we are going step by step back from economic and political independence, and this Bill is the most important and overt step taken in that direction.  I had great sympathy with the Ceann Comhairle when he made certain rulings, and I wish he had insisted upon them, because it would rid the issue that is before the House and the country of all the padding and <i>camouflage</i> that is obscuring the real issue.  Of all the speakers I think Deputy Cosgrave was the only one who mentioned the real issue, and it is more or less incidental.  Every old Sinn Feiner knows that that policy sprang from the fertile brain of the late Arthur Griffith, and that the central feature of it was economic independence.  Now it has been given away.  It was bartered away last year by the Agreement <Col N="840" /> in London, and this Bill is an accurate corollary of that Agreement.</P>

      <P>The Tariff Commission was set up by the Irish Parliament to try to do Ireland's work in Ireland's way, and now it must be abolished, and supplanted by what is called the Prices Commission, which was set up at the dictation of England.  That was the price that the Taoiseach and his Party had to pay for their folly and in order to settle the economic war.  They had to forfeit their economic independence that had been won after years of struggle.  As a tariff reformer and a supporter of tariffs, I was never enamoured with the Tariff Commission. I always considered that the Party to govern this country was the Party that thought out schemes of tariffs and that was able to stand over them.  That was the policy I heard the Minister for Finance advocating on public platforms time after time.  As a matter of fact we advocated it together.  Now the Minister has gone away from that.  Of course, he was told to go away from it by England, and the Tariff Commission must be abolished.  I was never greatly in agreement with it, as I considered that a Government elected on such a policy should have thought it out and put it into force without calling together a few civil servants to advise them.  That was the view of the Fianna <Col N="841" /> Fáil Party when they got into power. The effects of the policy of Fianna Fáil have been the product, mainly, of the economic war.  Young Deputy Childers rather gave the game away.  He said his Party would promote new industries now and establish those that were likely to produce an export trade.  That was the secret of the precipitate settlement of the economic war.  That is the secret that prompted the setting up of the Prices Commission.  England had given notice that she would no longer exchange her £ sterling for our £, because the balance of trade and the balance of payments had gone against us.  The Banking Commission was set up to investigate that position, and as soon as the Banking Commission Report was in draft, An Taoiseach&mdash;I do not know whether he was called An Taoiseach or President then, or what he was called&mdash;made a bee-line for London and capitulated and accepted England's terms, and England's terms are the surrender of our economic and fiscal independence, enshrined in this negative Bill that is before us now.  The issue before us now is to scrap the Tariff Commission, a body set up by the Irish Parliament to do Ireland's work, and put in its place a Prices Commission, and that Prices Commission, according to Agreement, must give English manufacturers or their agents the right of audience and, if they make a good case, their case must be implemented. So that this Prices Commission and not this House becomes the body that will make or unmake tariffs in this country.  I put it to the Minister to contradict the statement that, if the English witness before the Prices Commission puts up a good case, his case will not only have to be listened to but granted, and that this House will not be able to supersede that decision and give a tariff or a higher tariff against the case made by the Englishman.  That is the undertaking. Where is our freedom gone?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is a small Bill, a short one. It is simply to repeal a previous Act and the repeal of that Act has been ordered by the British, just as the nonrecognition of General Franco was ordered by the British; just as sanctions against Italy were ordered by the <Col N="842" /> British; and just as the &ldquo;Right-about-turn&rdquo; was ordered by the British, and we did it, and just as the Treason Bill, which we will be discussing in a few hours, was ordered by the British.</P>

We had Deputies Cosgrave and Bennett complaining here very bitterly that all those new industries that were started in this country for the past five or six years were throwing too heavy a burden on the agricultural community.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing that I do agree with.  Let us examine what Deputies have put up here during the past three or four years.  Number one, <Col N="843" /> Deputy Belton complained about the settlement of the economic war and, lo and behold, from the day on which the first annuity was withheld from Britain up to the day of the settlement, Deputies over there, not alone here in the House but down in the country, were howling and moaning and shouting for the settlement of it at any cost, not for any kind of settlement or agreement, but the handing over of the whole money to Britain rather than have the economic war continue.  Then, when it is settled, they are not satisfied either.  Deputy Cosgrave went back as far as 1922 with his argument.  The less Deputy Cosgrave and Deputies opposite have to say about 1922 the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the less they have to say about 1922 the better.  Deputy Cosgrave had a fairly ordered time from 1922 to 1927 and from 1927 on to 1932 in which to start industries here and in which he had a Tariff Commission working.  I say here frankly I have the utmost contempt for all commissions, the utmost contempt for them.  My opinion of these commissions is that they are brought together and their findings are agreed before they sit; they sign their names to them or bring in a minority report. Most of them are too lazy to prepare a minority report and, therefore, they always get a majority in favour of what is agreed and they sign on the dotted line.</P>

      <P>Yes, everyone of them. I make no bones about it.  I never have and I never will.  I always call a spade a spade.  There was a report last week by the Beet Tribunal.  That is my opinion of commissions as a whole.  There is no doubt about it.  I <Col N="844" /> saw Deputies clapping their hands over the Agricultural Commission and saying they had won something, whereas they had walked into it like a pack of geese.  They got an Agricultural Commission and I wish them joy of it.</P>

      <P>We were told the Tariff Commission was doing Ireland's work in Ireland.  We saw the result of it. We saw the result of it down in my constituency, where the flour mills were either closed down altogether or working one or two days in the week. That was the position there.  Those flour mills are now working full time and overtime.</P>

      <P>And so they are, thank God, and no thanks to Deputy Morrissey's Party, who thought it was good enough for the Irish people to walk the streets idle and have the English people milling flour for them. They thought it good enough for them and it was good enough for those who put them over there and kept them in office at least ten years too long.  I gave an example here of one finding of this famous Tariff Commission which was implemented by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy McGilligan, who put a 25 per cent. tariff on waterproofs coming into this country and 50 per cent. on the materials for making them, with the result that two waterproof factories in my area had to close down altogether. To-day you have three of them there giving employment to over 300.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to say that everything that has been done in the way of starting industries is right.  It is not. There are too many foreigners getting <Col N="845" /> a stranglehold on our industries here and too little appreciation of Irish efforts and Irish capital and Irish people who are prepared to start industries.  There is an opinion in this country that if you are going to take charge of an industry at all you must be from Czechoslovakia or from Germany or some other part of the world, but you must not be an Irishman.  I have examined a few of these industries from time to time, and that has been, unfortunately, my experience as regards the Department of Industry and Commerce also.  There is too much anxiety for the foreigner.  But, the idea of Deputies, opposite, like Deputy Cosgrave, getting up here and complaining that the agricultural population were being wiped out of existence on account of the industries that were started! Then Deputy Belton got up, following him, and complained because the Tariff Commission is to go.  The only way in which they could have been affected was by profiteering, and the one industry that has been put on its feet here has been attacked right, left and centre, both by the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party, on the grounds of profiteering, and that is the flour-milling industry.  There is an objection now because a Prices Commission is being set up that can, and will, examine any cases of profiteering that are there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can then see how it will work out.  We have it suggested that the Tariff Commission was doing Ireland's work in Ireland.  One need only look at the results.  One need only go down to Clondulane and speak to the workers there, whose flour-mill is working at full speed, a flour-mill <Col N="846" /> which was completely closed down in 1929 on the Tariff Commission's report, with Deputy McGilligan, who was then Minister for Industry and Commerce, implementing it.  Let the Deputy look at that mill to-day and let him ask the 75 men working there how much employment they got from 1929, when their mill was closed down, until the end of 1933, when it re-opened.  Let him ask the 75 families how they lived while Deputy Cosgrave was in office, and how they expect to live if Deputy Cosgrave and the Deputies opposite who feel as he feels came back again?</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly, the manner in which industries had, so to speak, to be plunged into this country, partly on account of the economic war, put us in the position in which every industry was not capable of being put on a paying basis, but that is a matter that can be rectified by degrees.  We have statements from Deputies opposite of the type which Deputy Belton made&mdash; and Deputy Cosgrave apparently agrees with him&mdash;that our whole economic freedom and independence has been handed over to Britain because there is a Prices Commission set up to inquire into profiteering that Deputies opposite have howled about for the past four years.  We have heard nothing but howls about profiteering.  If there is profiteering, let them prove it before that commission.  We have references to the number of people who are leaving the country at present.  We are quite willing to have that examined, too, and we will very quickly come to the root of it.  Deputy Cosgrave told us on one occasion that they were only going to see their friends in America. We had a very definite organisation working in this country from 1933 to 1937, an organisation which endeavoured, where there were three men working on a holding, to reduce the number to one, because the agricultural labourer did not support Cumann na nGaedheal in 1932, and an organisation that went further and insisted on men being dismissed from their employment because they would not travel in certain cars to the polling booths.</P>

Let us have some definite policy.  I am afraid that there is really no hope for the Deputies opposite unless they can actually gag Deputy Dillon or remove him altogether, because you will never get agreement between the farmers over there who claim to speak for the tillage farmers and Deputy Dillon.  You will never get Deputies like Deputy Belton, who&mdash;and I give him credit for it&mdash;has some appreciation of Irish industry and some anxiety to see Irish industries here&mdash; and Deputy Dillon, with his policy of nothing being any good unless it is imported, to agree.

He cannot understand any member of this House being allowed to think for himself, because, in the Fianna Fáil Party, there is only one mind, or at least only one mind is allowed to become vocal, and that is the mind of the leader.  Everybody sitting behind has to say &ldquo;ditto to that,&rdquo; whether he agrees with it or not.  The Deputy will have to realise that there is some independence of thought in this Party.  It is well known, of course, that there is no independence of thought in the Fianna Fáil Party.  Only one person in that Party is allowed to think, and he thinks for the whole Party.  Let Deputy Corry turn that over in his mind, if he is allowed to turn it over in his mind.  He talked a lot about the 75 families in his constituency who are employed in the flour mill and who were unemployed under the previous Government.  We are all very glad to hear that, but is there any reason why every flour mill in this country should not be working to full capacity?  Does Deputy Corry advert to what the community as a whole is paying to have those 75 families employed in the mill in Cork?  Will he ask himself what is the difference to any labourer or farmer, whether large or small, who goes in to buy a sack or a half sack of the flour produced there?</P>

      <P>The Deputy has to ask himself that question, and the Deputy cannot get away from the fact that the mills are producing because they have a virtual monopoly, and because they are making very fine profits out of it, and the ordinary consumers, <Col N="849" /> the ordinary people of the country, are paying through the nose for it.  The Deputy talked about the people who are being put into employment and about the people who were walking the streets idle because of the work of the Tariff Commission under the previous Government, or, if you like, because the Tariff Commission was not working in the direction the Deputy thinks they should have worked.  Now, that brings us back to the principal point in connection with all this.  Every tariff, whether considered, well-considered, ill-considered, or not considered at all, that has been imposed in this country was imposed on the people here because they were told that it was necessary to make sacrifices in order to put our people into employment; and every tariff that was imposed was justified by the Ministers opposite on the ground that it was going to put so many more of our people into employment: not on the ground&mdash;that ground was never put forward&mdash;that it was going to provide big dividends and fat profits for individuals, but that it would put more people into employment.  What is the position?  Notwithstanding the sacrifices the people have made, notwithstanding the enormously increased cost of living, and notwithstanding Deputy Corry's humbug about the numbers of people that have been put into employment, there is to-day a greater number of unemployed registered in this country than practically ever in its history, with the exception of one black year when the figure went to over 140,000.  Deputy Corry talks about putting 75 men into work in a factory in Cork.  Would he look up the figures for the County Cork generally and see what reduction there has been in the number of male agricultural labourers there during the last four years?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I have denied that before and will deny it now with regard to any such campaign.  Of course, the Minister for Industry and Commerce claims, in regard to this matter of the unemployment figures&mdash;<Col N="850" /> and up to a point I agree with him, although I do not wish to be taken as agreeing that the present figures represent the full volume of unemployment, in this country because they do not represent it&mdash;that prior to 1932, before he took office as Minister for Industry and Commerce, the figures published did not give any real indication of the actual numbers of unemployed in this country.  We are in agreement there, but I say that at least we did get some indication of the actual numbers of unemployed at that time and, I think, it was the best indication that under the circumstances could have been got, and perhaps a truer indication than we can get under the present machinery.  Under the 1926 Census&mdash;I am speaking from recollection here&mdash;it was shown that the total number of unemployed, of all classes returned in this country, was either 75,000 or 76,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, when we look for information, the Minister will say nothing.  Last week we were accused of not having read a report three months before, although it had only been issued that morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently, the Minister himself, whose job, for which he is paid, is to know these things, did not know it.  In any case this fact emerges: that, notwithstanding the huge volume of emigration that has been going on for the last seven years, and notwithstanding the tariffs, quota orders, prohibitions and so on, as well as the increasing cost of living, which <Col N="851" /> the people of this country have to pay in order to put people into employment in these industries, we are now in the position that there are 105,000 registered unemployed.  In that connection, let me tell Deputy Corry that there are 3,117 fewer male workers employed on the land in the County Tipperary than there were four years ago, and I venture to say that Tipperary has been fairly generously treated with regard to factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And also fairly generously treated by the Land Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but does the Minister suggest that the 3,117 unemployed agricultural workers there have been accommodated by the Land Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but I suggest that when large estates have been divided into small holdings there may be fewer people employed as agricultural labourers, but that does not mean that fewer people are employed on the land. The trouble is that the Deputy does not understand the figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, every time the Minister is faced by facts such as these, his answer is &ldquo;the Deputy does not understand the figures.&rdquo;  That does not carry much weight here in this House, however, because the Minister has been saying that kind of thing for the last seven years, but the fact remains that in this State there are 43,000 fewer people employed on the land than were employed four or five years ago.  I suggest that these are facts that ought to receive the serious consideration of this House, and there is not a member of this House, either on this side of the House or the other side, who does not know quite well that the consumers of this country have been fleeced for the past four or five, or six or seven, years, or any period you like.  There is no question about that.  The Minister himself knows it.  Within the last 12 months, the Minister himself has issued warnings to industrialists and others in this country.  Deputy Corry says, of course that a lot of those industries were <Col N="852" /> plunged into because of the policy of the Government, and he is going to vote for the abolition of the only Tribunal we had in the country that was set up to examine such proposals.</P>

      <P>What commission is that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, Deputy Corry has no respect for any commission, although he told us that if we had any doubts we could go to the Prices Commission and that they would settle all our difficulties.  However, I should like him to apply himself to that point of view.  This commission was set up to examine applications for tariffs and so on.  What is the position going to be, or what has the position been for the last few years?  What has this House had to say to the imposition of tariffs, quota orders, and so on? Nothing whatever.  Everybody knows that.  It was just a case that, morning after morning, the postman arrived with an envelope and when you opened the envelope you pulled out a sheet of white paper in which there was Order No. So-and-so.  Orders were imposed in the Minister's office, and very few Deputies of this House knew anything about them.  Those are the facts.  Now, the position is that we are going to have the Government, plus this Prices Commission&mdash;this overloaded Prices Commission that is not able to deal with the problems that they have to deal with already.  The Minister told us here last week, when he was asked how many questions arising out of the Trade Agreement had been referred to the Prices Commission by the British Government, that he could not tell us exactly, but that there were more than sufficient to keep the Prices Commission going for the duration of that Agreement&mdash;in other words, for the three years.  Yet this is the sort of nonsense that is trotted out here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people of this country would be prepared to make sacrifices and to pay substantially higher prices in order to encourage Irish industry here and to absorb our unemployed, but notwithstanding all the sacrifices that have been made, and all the emigration that has taken place, we find ourselves faced with an increased <Col N="853" /> number of unemployed in this country.  There is no getting away from that fact.  The figures are there and the facts are there, and there is no use in Deputy Corry speaking of campaigns amongst the farmers to increase the number of unemployed. The Deputy, if he spoke honestly, because he is a practical farmer and living amongst farmers, knows that conditions during the period of the economic war were responsible for farmers having to let men go because they were not able to pay them.</P>

      <P>I make the statement, and any man living in rural Ireland knows it to be true, that there are hundreds of farmers, perhaps thousands, who were forced, through no fault of their own, simply because their income had diminished so much, to let men go because they could not pay them.  Does not the Deputy also know that as a result of the disastrous harvest of last year and the bad winter farmers are in such a bad way at present that, I am afraid, they will have to let still more men go?  What is the use in trying to fool ourselves here by putting up what the Deputy alleges to be facts, but which he knows are not facts?  There might be some excuse for some Deputies living in Dublin, and who have not the same opportunities of meeting farmers and experiencing conditions on their own farms as Deputy Corry has.  But when the Deputy knows the facts, he is not doing any service to himself or his constituency or his Government by hiding these facts and making a speech which he knows is not accurate.</P>

      <P>This debate might have been a great deal shorter if Deputies opposite really knew what exactly were the powers of the Tariff Commission which it is proposed to abolish and what was the extent of its labours over the past six or seven years.  Perhaps some of them did know.  I should not be surprised if Deputy Mulcahy did, for instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy Mulcahy knew, because he was a member of the Government which submitted the Act of 1930, amending the original Act of 1926, to the Dáil.  But the Deputy chose to mislead the House and to ascribe to this Tariff Commission powers of investigation which it never had, and which the Government responsible for setting it up took very good care not to confer upon it.  This body was a body of extremely limited utility from the point of view of the economic development of the country, and of great use to a Government which did not want to develop this country industrially.  It was the body that used to fight the delaying actions for a Government which had tied itself up with foreign milling interests and had associations whose one object was to prevent the establishment of new industries in this country.  When, <Col N="855" /> therefore, our flour mills were closing, when our other industries were decaying, and the pressure of public opinion compelled the Government in 1926 and 1930 to take note of that fact, they set up this body and they referred to it, in the words of Section 2 of the Act of 1926, &ldquo;any application, made by persons substantially representative of the persons engaged in or proposing to engage in the production in Saorstát Eireann of goods of any particular class or description, for the imposition, modification, abolition, or renewal of a customs duty on the importation of goods of that class or description&rdquo;. That was the sole power, that was the sole use, which that tariff commission had&mdash;to inquire into an application when it was referred to it, under the Act of 1926 by the Minister for Finance, and under the Act of 1930 by the Government of the day.  It had no powers, as Deputy Mulcahy implied, to investigate the whole industrial situation here.</P>

      <P>That was the line which Deputy Dillon took, in so far as there was any part of his speech relevant to this Bill.  That was the line that Deputy Belton took, who said that in abolishing the Tariff Commission we were depriving this country, if you please, of its fiscal freedom and destroying the keystone of the arch which Griffith built.  I do not think he put it quite so coherently as that but, at any rate, that was what he was trying to say.  I have pointed out to the House what the powers of the Commission were.  Deputy Childers pointed out to the House, to the annoyance of the leader of the Opposition, who, in order to cover his own confusion, had to harp back to 1922, a subject which I thought, to the benefit and advantage of this nation, might perhaps be left undiscussed henceforward in the Dáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, as Deputy Childers pointed out, during the period the commission was supposed to have the wide powers, which both Deputy Belton and Deputy Dillon ascribed to it, there had been no industrial development in this country&mdash; practically none; over 100 factories and industrial workshops had closed down; there had been an ever-increasing disemployment of people engaged in manufacturing pursuits in this country during the period this Tariff Commission was in fact in operation; but since it had fallen into desuetude, since the present Government had put it upon the shelf, there has been widespread industrial development, industrial development to which the Party in Opposition was concerned to devote a great deal of attention during the general elections of 1937 and 1938, when they were playing up the canard, to which Deputy Belton gave fresh currency to-day, when he wanted to imply that, as a result of the Trade Agreement of April last, industrial development in this country was going to be curbed or restricted or handicapped in one way or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Party for which Deputy Dillon <Col N="857" /> is spokesman in this debate to-day, the Party that permits its Deputy leader to refer to those who are engaged in industry in Ireland as &ldquo;tariff hounds&rdquo; and &ldquo;plunderers&rdquo;, was the Party which&mdash;if there is any truth in what Deputy Dillon has been saying&mdash;in its General Election manifesto in 1937 and in the pledges which it repeated again in 1938, undertook, if they were returned to power, that these &ldquo;tariff hounds&rdquo; and &ldquo;plunderers&rdquo;, as Deputy Dillon calls them, would be free to prey upon the people.  But what does it show?  It shows this, at any rate, that without the assistance of the Tariff Commission, without having to have any recourse to this cumbersome machinery which was set up to fight a delaying action, the Government of to-day was able to undertake the industrial development in this country.  That industrial development could not have taken place without full fiscal freedom.</P>
    <P>What is the new machinery through which the development took place? There are Orders under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act.  Under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act we have had duties imposed upon cotton thread, elastic and laces, three of the four industrial developments which Deputy Dillon criticised in this House to-day.  If protection is being given to these industries by means of the Imposition of Duties Act, that means that if the Government has made up its mind that there is an opportunity to establish a new industry here and that there is a case for protecting the initial products of that industry during its development stages, it can at once impose a tariff to prevent the establishment of the industry being forestalled by dumping and other means.  But it does not mean, as Deputy Dillon knows, that the case for the establishment of that industry goes on undiscussed or unexamined.  It is examined first in the Department of Industry and Commerce.  Before the tariff granted for that Emergency Order becomes a permanent feature of the fiscal system, the Emergency Order must come here for examination, and if it is not confirmed by the Vote of the Dáil it collapses and the tariff falls.</P>
    <P>These tariffs upon cotton thread, <Col N="858" /> linen thread, elastic and shoe laces were discussed here in the House, were approved of by the Dáil, and were embodied in our statutes.  It is these tariffs that the Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the Party opposite, guaranteed to the people of this country would remain in force, even if the improbable happened&mdash;or with more speeches like those of Deputies Dillon and Belton, say the impossible happened&mdash;and we were to be turned out and the Administration was to be taken over by the Fine Gael Party.  Therefore, it is not true to say, as Deputy Dillon has alleged, that these tariffs were granted without due and proper inquiry.</P>
    <P>I think it will be conceded, bearing in mind the developments that have taken place in this country during the last six or seven years, that our method of fostering industrial development here has been very much more successful than that which we have superseded. It is not true, either, to say that the incidence of these tariffs and their effects upon the people can go without due and proper inquiry.  One feature of the Tariff Commission which we are now asking the House to abolish is this&mdash;that unless a member of the Government wished to have an investigation into the effects of any tariff that Tariff Commission could not move on its own initiative or upon the initiative of a private citizen.  One of the reasons which I gave for the introduction of this measure was the wide powers which had been given to the Prices Commission, and the fact that to some extent the Prices Commission was superseding to the full extent the activities which the Tariff Commission was formerly discharging.</P>
    <P>Under the Prices Commission, as it is now constituted, a private individual, a private citizen, can move to have the price of an article investigated. The Minister for Industry and Commerce can move to have the whole question, if he so desires, of its effects and the incidence of the tariff investigated, too.  So, in fact, we have combined the functions of the old Tariff Commission with the other and more independent functions of the Prices Commission, and we have put it in the <Col N="859" /> power of any individual who feels aggrieved by the price of an article, to go and ask the Prices Commission to say whether the price charged for any article is fair or not, and therefore, by implication, if the article is a tariffed article, to investigate whether the tariff is fair or not.  That is the machinery which is to-day in existence for the fostering of Irish industrial development, and also for the protection of the consumer about whom Deputy Dillon was so plaintive here to-day.</P>
    <P>A great deal of this discussion would have been avoided if only Deputies opposite did inform themselves before embarking on a discussion, what the discussion is about.  That obligation is upon them before taking up the time of the House.  It is clear from the speeches of Deputies Dillon, Belton and the other Deputies opposite, to which we have listened, that they did not know what they were taking about.  They may have been misled by Deputy Mulcahy's speech.  They may, perhaps, have misunderstood him as I misunderstood him.  They may have thought that the Tariff Commission which we propose to abolish had indeed wide powers of inquiry and investigation which they have not, but which the Deputies said they had.</P>

      <P>The longer I listened to this debate the more I wondered at the outlook of the Deputies, and the more I was surprised at the inconsistency of their arguments.  When another measure, the Valuation Bill, was before the House one of the stock arguments which the Leader of the Opposition used against it was that it was going to give employment to more civil servants and that the farmers of this country should not bear any heavier impositions than they were bearing.  But here is a body which has been in existence since 1926.  I am not going to deal with the very limited range and the very limited number of subjects which the Tariff Commission investigated during the period 1926 to <Col N="860" /> 1932.  But from 1932 to 1938 they only investigated one subject&mdash;the question of a tariff on casks and barrels.  They made a report on it in 1934.  The report was completely out of date, and it was not necessary to waste public money in printing and publishing it.</P>

They want us, in fact, to continue to spend public money upon a commission which they know themselves cannot do anything, and which, in view of the altered attitude of the general body of the people of this country towards industrial development, serves no useful purpose whatsoever in the public administration. If it were only on the ground of the economy which will follow from the abolition of this commission, then I say if there was any consistency left in the Opposition they would have seen that this Bill passed through all its stages to-day without discussion.</P>

      <P>On the Money Resolution, I understand that the amendments standing in my name are out of order.  I cannot understand how, in one of the sections, the Minister takes power to grant money by way of loan for the erection and equipment of dwelling houses, including the acquisition and development of land for that purpose.  Perhaps the Minister can tell us if he has some plan and why he proposes to divorce the money; that is, lend on a house, a dwelling house, or land.  I would like to know how he proposes to deal with advancing money to a building society.  Surely they ought to be under the one Act? All my amendments are along the lines of making it easier for a building society or a friendly or a co-operative <Col N="864" /> society to deal with the Minister as a go-between in the promotion of house building.  Perhaps the Minister would let us know what the objections are and how he proposes to deal with a building society that wished to obtain a loan in order to facilitate the building of houses.</P>

That is what struck me. The amendments were ruled out on the main principle that there was a contingent liability involving an increased cost on the Exchequer.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies seem to have a complete misconception of the Bill. There is nothing in the Bill which has any relation to the financing of building societies.  In so far as its general scheme is concerned, the Bill is merely a re-enactment of the Trade Loans Acts.  We have had Trade Loans Acts in operation for a long time.  They <Col N="865" /> have expired now because they were enacted for a limited period and a decision had to be made whether they were to be allowed to expire or whether we should renew them.  We decided to renew them and, in so far as this part of the Bill is concerned, they are being renewed without change.  Deputy Dockrell used the term building society as being synonymous with friendly society.  It is not.  Building societies were established by the Building Societies Act and they get money by way of subscriptions from their members and this is used for the purpose of making advances to members. Public utility societies can engage in the business of bulding houses just as an ordinary contractor would engage, except that the societies will build houses for their members, whereas the ordinary contractor will build houses for sale to the public.  There is nothing in the Bill which prevents a public utility society of that kind taking advantage of its terms to the same extent that a private individual or a firm of building contractors might take advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We certainly do not intend, and I cannot see how it could be urged that it would be suitable, to utilise the provisions of the Trade Loans Act for the purpose of financing house purchase.  It would be completely impracticable to do so.  There could be no conceivable method by which the procedure laid down in the Bill could be applied to building societies or the financing of house purchase at all.  This measure is designed to enable the Government to guarantee loans for manufacturing undertakings.  The definition of &ldquo;manufacturing undertaking&rdquo; is expressed to include the erection of houses.  As Deputies will remember, originally it did not include the erection of houses. At least, it was doubtful whether the term as defined in the original Act could be interpreted to include the building of houses.  A special Act was introduced for the purpose of amending that definition.  In introducing that Act, I made it clear that the machinery of the Act could be utilised to assist housing schemes of considerable magnitude. In fact, only one such loan was guaranteed.  That was a loan applied for by the company who undertook the <Col N="866" /> development of the Mount Merrion Estate.  That loan has been repaid in full.  I never conceived it possible to utilise the Trade Loans Act for the purpose of financing house purchase, nor do I think it would be practicable for financing the erection of individual houses or small lots of houses.  The question of utilising State credit, or in some other way giving State assistance, for the development of building societies is a separate question altogether which is having separate consideration by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that we would not have a Trade Loans Guarantee Act at all if there was suitable machinery for financing manufacturing undertakings of every kind that were likely to require assistance.  The reason that we have such an Act is that there are difficulties experienced in getting money.  The position of the house-building industry was such, I suppose, that the Minister felt at one particular time that he had to make some kind of an arrangement for giving an opening to a manufacturer of houses, as we might call a builder, to take advantage of the trade loans system in the same way as other people.  Apparently, in a general way, it has not been successful, but it must be to the knowledge of the Minister that the financing of house building is a very important matter, particularly at the present time in a place like the City of Dublin.  Under a Housing Bill that is before the Dáil at present, facilities are being withdrawn from the builders of houses in the City of Dublin, that are going to be enjoyed elsewhere. When we look back over the number of houses built in the City of Dublin under recent house-building schemes, we find that out of 42,782 houses built under the 1924 and 1927 Acts, 21,600, or 50 per cent., have been built in the Dublin and Dun Laoghaire area.  So that from the very area that drew very substantially on the facilities for house building, certain facilities have been taken away.  The building industry in the City of Dublin has met with a very considerable amount of difficulty during the past six months as a result of the wobbling, shall I say, in <Col N="867" /> the attitude of the Government towards it.  Houses will be required in the City of Dublin, but the financing of the building schemes that are necessary in the city is a very difficult matter. I know there are building firms in the city that are being driven to go to the trade loan system for facilities. The Minister must be aware that in Great Britain one of the chief ways in which housing has been financed has been through the tremendous development of the building society there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to suggest to the Deputy that that is an entirely different matter to the one we are dealing with now.  The reference to the erection of houses is, in a sense, incidental. It is merely a clarification of the definition.  It was never contemplated that the Trade Loans Act would be utilised extensively for the financing of house building nor does it in any way represent the Government policy for assisting the building of houses.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health, who is directly responsible for Government policy in the matter of housing, is giving the question very definite attention and possibly proposals relating to that matter will be brought to the Dáil in the near future.  This in no sense represents a deliberate decision to assist house building through the medium of the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act.  The definition, as embodied here, is the same definition as was in the other Act.  We felt that if there was an application made for a guarantee, and a good case was made in relation to an individual enterprise, builders should not be precluded from taking advantage of facilities that are open to manufacturers in other spheres.  On that account we altered the original definition of &ldquo;manufacturing undertaking&rdquo;, but, in fact, experience has shown that the procedure of the Trade Loans Act is not altogether suitable for financing house building. The financing of house building falls under two heads&mdash;the provision of finances by the local authorities, which is a matter of getting money at reasonable rates from the public, and secondly, the setting up of  <Col N="868" /> which will enable individuals to become house purchasers even though they have not sufficient capital of their own to purchase houses.  These are matters of housing policy which are not dealt with in this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A house building society is defined as a society which gets money on deposit or by subscription from its members, and advances it to them to buy houses.  A trade loan could not be given to such a society, because in order to give a guarantee for that loan we would have to get a charge on its assets.  The mere fact that we would do that would shut up the society at once.  Its depositors could no longer withdraw their money, as we would have a charge upon it.  The whole business of a building society debars it from availing of the facilities of the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act.</P>

      <P>There is no use in being here if you do not learn.  I seriously suggest to the Minister that, if he wants to help employment in the building trade, there is only one way of doing it&mdash;that is, to help the thousands who are looking for accommodation to make up 70 per cent. or 80 per cent. of the purchase money.  They have the rest.  There is not a builder in Dublin who has not houses on his hands, and, if he is working at all, he is working with only a skeleton staff.  The way to electrify that business is not to give the builder money with which he might foolishly develop more land and leave the money buried there, so that the Minister for Finance would have great difficulty in getting payment of interest and sinking fund.  That is a dangerous proceeding, and I do not think the Minister should engage in it.  My experience&mdash;and I have a little&mdash;is that if sales are good, no builder wants accommodation.  Any man fit to build a house must have a banking account, and the banks meet the honest man who keeps his word and who is seeking accommodation.  The banks will never turn down such a man, and I repudiate any suggestion to the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither will the builders' providers of Dublin refuse accommodation to a man who makes a fair show.  The key to the whole thing is not the production of the houses but the selling of the houses at a fair price.  The market is gone and if the Minister wants to put life in that business, it is for him or his colleague of another Department to take the appropriate steps.  If the Ceann Comhairle allows me to move my amendment, I shall say that you <Col N="871" /> should withdraw that provision and I am a builder and would like accommodation as much as any other man, though I might abuse it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is really no case to answer.  When the Deputy discusses the needs of the situation, I am largely disposed to agree with him.  If this Bill were a Bill the main purpose of which was to improve house-building in Dublin, I should say that there was a lot in his criticism.  But this Bill has nothing to do with housing except in an incidental way.  The question as to what is needed to improve the housing situation and to get more houses built is a different question altogether and will be dealt with separately when the Government's proposals in relation to that matter are brought before the House.  The Trade Loans Acts were originally introduced to enable persons engaged in manufacturing enterprise to get financial accommodation by way of loan or to get such accommodation more easily or more cheaply by <Col N="872" /> reason of the attachment of a Government guarantee to the loan.  That was considered necessary in the circumstances of this country&mdash;it was also considered necessary at one period in Great Britain&mdash;because of temporary difficulties, the unwillingness of the people to invest their savings in new enterprises which had yet to be proved and the absence of a money market here in the sense that a money market exists in Great Britain.  These Acts were operated for a number of years upon that basis.  Anybody proposing to engage in manufacturing enterprise who wanted a loan for capital purposes and who found that there were immediate difficulties in getting that loan through ordinary commercial channels applied under the Trade Loans Acts for a trade loan guarantee. That application was referred to an advisory committee and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance, then decided whether or not the guarantee should be given.  At one period, an application came to the Department for a loan for the development of a housing estate.  The application appeared to be a good one.  It seemed to offer considerable prospects of new employment and substantial development resulting from the provision of the accommodation.  There seemed to be no reason why the State assistance which the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act made possible to manufacturing enterprise of the ordinary kind should not be given in that particular case, but when we decided to do so the question was raised as to whether the definition of a manufacturing enterprise in the Act covered the building of houses.  I remember I argued strongly that it did, and a number of others also argued strongly that it did, but because there was a doubt we felt it was better to have the doubt resolved, particularly as a large sum of money was involved. The definition was amended, and we are carrying the amended definition into this Bill.  Another application of this kind may never be made, and certainly I would not encourage applications of that kind unless they arose out of some unusual or exceptional circumstances, and not at all unless they were in connection with development projects <Col N="873" /> of a major kind.  The type of application which might be made by an individual who wanted to build a single house, or a small contractor who wanted to build two or three houses, should not be encouraged.  Such people would find that the procedure under this Bill was onerous, and the charges which would fall on them would probably be much heavier than they anticipated.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is moving to alter the definition by taking out the words which we inserted by special Act some years ago.  Perhaps the amendment will have no effect.  Perhaps the point of view I argued originally&mdash;that the original definition covered the building of houses&mdash;is the correct one, and that those words are unnecessary, but on the assumption that they are necessary I see no reason why we should deprive ourselves of the power, even though we have made up our minds already that the use of that power must be restricted; that in the great majority of cases there should be no need for the Government to guarantee a loan for a building enterprise of this kind, and that consequently a Government guarantee should not be given.  But I do not think we should deprive ourselves of the power to do so, nor do I think there is any advantage in depriving ourselves of that power.  The existence of that power is not going to embarrass anyone, and need not in the least interfere with the ordinary conduct of house-building activity by persons who can finance it from their own resources.  Therefore, I propose not to accept the amendment on the ground that there is no reason why we should not have the power, even though it must be recognised now that the circumstances in which that power would be used in relation to the building of houses would be very unusual indeed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, a Chinn Comhairle, I put down the amendment primarily to provide a basis for discussion on the general matters which we have been discussing, so that we would have the Department's position clarified and explained through the Minister.  I think from what the Minister has said that, even if this Bill goes through in its present form with this <Col N="874" /> new clause in it, it will hardly change the policy of administration.  The policy of administration will probably remain the same, unless perhaps in a very exceptional case.  I should like to point out to the Minister that the development of land for building is the first step, and the builder who is not able to take the first step is hardly there at all.  To give money for the development of land is very dangerous to the man who is getting it, because if he gets it handily and gets more than he would get through the ordinary channels of finance he might be tempted to take too much, and thereby create a heavy load of interest which would be dead in the ground for a considerable time without giving him any return.  I have heard that the difficulties which have overtaken the major scheme referred to by the Minister&mdash;I am sure he is aware of them&mdash; were due to that cause.  To give money like that is not ultimately going to help employment, but perhaps to cause sudden unemployment.  I will withdraw my amendment.  I am satisfied that it has served its purpose, and I agree with the Minister that there is no harm in having the power there. There is no harm in clarifying the position. If an applicant comes in, he is in order in making the application, but may not be any nearer to getting it than if he were out of order?  That is really the position?</P>

      <P>The Minister rather disparages the use of money for the purpose of getting a manufacturing concern going in the building of houses.  I should like to get information from him as to whether he has got cold on that matter in respect of say, firms who are building houses for renting purposes?  I submit to him that firms who are building houses for renting purposes in the City of Dublin, at any rate, are doing a very great service at the present time.  As Deputy Hickey suggests, it is not everybody who can purchase a house.  There is a very large number of people who want to get a chance of renting houses.  At the present time, in spite of what Deputy Belton says, it is not so easy to get money for, as it were, putting into houses for which you can simply draw rents.  I take it the Minister is satisfied that those moneys would be available for persons putting up houses for renting at the present time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We have never had an application of that kind, but such an application might be more suitable than the other type of application which has been mentioned, namely money borrowed for the purposes of building houses for sale.  In regard to the <Col N="876" /> operation of the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, under which a loan is secured to be paid back in fixed instalments over a period of years, any operation which suits that method of finance can be considered.  It is only operations which suit that method that can be considered.  That would apply, I think, to a loan secured for the purpose of building houses to be rented.  I do not know what difficulties would arise in connection with the security which the State would require for its guarantee, but there would be no objection in principle to a loan for that purpose on a scale which would justify the bringing into operation of the Act at all.  The giving of a loan is, in itself, a fairly expensive process, and unless, therefore, the loan is for a fairly substantial amount, the charge which must be added to the interest payable makes it an uneconomic proposition.  Therefore, only loans for a substantial amount could be obtained, or would be in the interest of the person applying.  Persons may apply for a loan because of some immediate need, and may be prepared to take a chance on the charge involved, so you have to decide whether it is in their own interests, because the charge would be considerable.  Take an application in regard to the development of a large estate, where a substantial amount of money is put into roads, drains and sewers, before house building can proceed.  Where capital is sought for that type of development, then we can consider guaranteeing a loan under this Bill.  The same may apply, although to a less extent, to loans granted for the building of houses for renting.  There is no objection in principle, but there may be practical objections.</P>

The actual interest paid by the borrower may be more than 2½ per cent., but our guarantee only covers 2½ per cent.  That meets the points raised by Deputy Belton.  The loan may be <Col N="877" /> actually made by a bank or other financial institution, and they will see that the loan is one worth making, because they stand to lose a proportion of the interest if the borrower fails.</P>

That is the only experience we have had there. I think that that loan, as a matter of fact, was repaid long before the building scheme was completed.  That may have been due to the fact that the borrower got a more convenient method of financing the undertaking, or that he found the trade loans procedure not <Col N="878" /> suitable.  In any event, we got our guarantee discharged, and that finished the matter for us.  That was done within a year after the guarantee was given.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking against <Col N="879" /> this Bill, when it was previously before the House, I was going on to consider the basis of previous valuations. Griffith's valuation was based as valuations always are, on the real prices of a series of crops.  The index figures were based on that.  There is nothing in this Bill to indicate that this valuation will be carried out on these lines. It will be interesting to hear the Minister explain that point because, from my reading of the Bill, the meaning I take out of it is, that there are just certain things that have to be considered and a decision come to, and that once that decision is made, all the rest follows.  Outside the Boroughs of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Dun Laoghaire, agricultural land will not be revalued, but agricultural and other buildings will be revalued. The method of approach to valuing these agricultural buildings is their worth in the businesses in which they are used.  I wonder what is the worth to a dairyman of a modern dairy shed that cost £1,000.  If we reckon 5 per cent. for the money, as I read the Bill, that shed cannot be valued at less than £50 a year.  Surely it will be more. No man is going to put up a structure that is worth nothing but the interest on the capital invested.  It would not pay to do so.  As I read this Bill, that is the minimum value that can be put on them.</P>
      <P>In regard to old buildings standing, are they to be valued on the cost of renewal, or are they to be valued on the use of the buildings, or how are they to be valued?  No matter how they are valued, their Poor Law Valuation will come up from two to three times what it is at the present time and, without the valuation of the lands being touched, the value of the holding, buildings and land combined, will be twice what it is at the present time. Considering that all interested parties had the right to move for a revaluation every year, I think the whole case is met without putting the country to this cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course, there is just one thing in it and that is probably the major inducement, particularly to the Government and particularly to the Minister <Col N="880" /> for Finance, that is, to increase the valuation for income-tax purposes.  We have just been discussing housing and the building of houses for renting. Everybody knows that that is not a business proposition to-day.  Twenty or 30 years ago it was.  Nobody is investing money now in house property for letting purposes, for reasons that we need not go into, but the tendency will be still less in future to invest money in houses for renting purposes.</P>
    <P>Take a house, of a valuation of £20, within the metropolitan area of Dublin, let at 30/- a week, £78 a year.  Disregarding the remission of rates that there may be on that house, and paying full rates on it at the present time of 19/6, say £1, that would be £20. With a few shillings insurance, stipulated in this Bill, the rates are the total outgoings.  Take £20 off £78 and you have £58.  According to the formula set out in this Bill, the dwelling-house that to-day is valued at £20 must be valued under this Bill in future at £58 or, if a few pounds are allowed, although I do not think it is mentioned in the Bill, for income-tax, it will be valued at £52 or £53.  The valuation of private dwelling-houses in Dublin is going to be increased two and a half times, as I read the Bill.  Of course, that, at 4/6 in the £, will enable the Minister to tell us once more, in his annual address, that his finances are buoyant.  But, who is paying for it?</P>
    <P>Now, let us consider people who are renting houses.  If they have a house on which they had to pay income-tax at the rate of £20 valuation, and have it let at £X a year, they find they have to pay 4/6 in the £ on an increase of £30 or £32.  Are they going to continue renting those houses at 30/- a week and, if they must, will they, or will any other people, invest their money in Irish house property so as to rent those houses to people who are unable to buy houses but who would be able to rent them?  It will end entirely the renting of houses.  I would like to hear the Minister explain that a little.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see one County Dublin Deputy here and I hope he will consider his constituents <i>vis-a-vis</i> other constituents in Éire in connection with this Revaluation Bill.  There are exemptions here of agricultural land, <Col N="881" /> but, in the Borough of Dublin and the Borough of Dun Laoghaire there will be no exemption.  There is before the Minister for Local Government at the present time the report of a tribunal set up by him to consider the local administration of County Dublin, the City of Dublin, the Borough of Dun Laoghaire and smaller areas within the geographical County of Dublin.  This tribunal sat for a year or two, two or three years ago, and it has reported and recommended.  The recommendation, broadly, is that the whole of County Dublin be included in the county borough.  So that, we have no reason to doubt that that will be implemented, probably without any change, unless the country wakes up and finds that it is time to get rid of this Government because the recommendations of that tribunal have no relation whatever to the evidence that was put before the tribunal.  It would suggest a preconceived notion of local administration for the whole of County Dublin.  However, that may come before the House in its own form as a principal subject matter some day before it will be imposed and I do not want to discuss it in detail.  I only introduce it here and develop it a little, first of all, in order to put before the House in relation to this Bill that is before the House the recommendations embodied in that report and the likelihood of those recommendations being implemented.  If they are implemented, then the agricultural land of County Dublin must be valued because it comes within the County Borough or the Borough of Dun Laoghaire.  There will be no Borough of Dun Laoghaire then.  It will be all the County Borough of Dublin and the agricultural land of County Dublin will be revalued.  According to the formula set out here, how would that work out?  It appears to me, as I read this Bill, that the basis on which the Minister goes is the basis of the old rack-renting landlord of 80 or 90 years ago; that the last penny that can be squeezed out of the land is the rent and the rent is the value which the worker of that land should have to pay the rack-renting landlord.  Our modern rack-renter, the Minister for Finance, gives the same definition of income in <Col N="882" /> this Bill, so that an inflated 11 months' rent for the land of County Dublin will be considered the poor law valuation, less certain outgoings, and that will treble the present poor law valuation. As I explained when I was last speaking on this Bill, motor transport has destroyed the proximity value of County Dublin land, and County Dublin will then be in the unique and unenviable position of being the only county in Ireland the agricultural land of which will be revalued under this Bill.  I hope the Deputies in County Dublin who sit on the Government Benches and who fooled the poor old farmers in County Dublin will now get up and defend them.</P>

      <P>In discussing the previous Bill, we were concerned with getting employment by hook or by crook.  Wherever it was likely to put one man into employment, the Government was prepared to lend money to help that employment.  How on earth has a member of the Government, the Minister for Finance, come to the conclusion that gardens will have their valuations revised and agricultural land will not?  The Minister ought to know that there is no form of tillage employs more expert labour and produces more than gardening, but the garden is to be revalued.  I do not know on what basis he proposes to revalue it and I do not know what prompts him to revalue it, unless it is that he does not want to have any gardening or any decent garden kept in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a means by which people who have gardens can get round the Minister's intriguers, if I may say so, the Commissioners of Valuation.  There is no reason why a breach cannot be made in the garden wall and cattle allowed in to shelter in the garden.  It <Col N="883" /> is then agricultural land and where perhaps half a dozen men found livelihoods, none will find a livelihood because the cow will graze the sweet grass in that garden which has been nourished perhaps for centuries.  An ornamental garden does not pay anybody. It is kept perhaps out of a traditional respect, and possibly generations of gardeners have been employed in such gardens and no generation of owners is going to discontinue keeping these gardens, or to disemploy the people who find a livelihood from them.  If, however, the Minister buts in and wants to fleece these people, a new situation is created, and many of these families, who to-day are getting comfortable livelihoods, gardeners, assistant gardeners and helpers, will find themselves on the dole, thanks to the Minister, in the company of many more whom he has put on the dole already. I know a few gardens in County Dublin.  I keep one of them myself.  I would not let it go down and I keep the three men my predecessor had, but they will go as soon as the Minister's spies come in and my cows can graze on my garden.  I will not then have to pay nearly as much as I pay by keeping gardeners to cultivate it.

      <P>The Minister gave no explanation as to the reason for this Bill.  He spoke about levelling up, but he did not say anything about levelling down.  Deputy Gorey told the Minister the basic item in Griffith's valuation, wheat.  Just before the Minister came in, I said that the Minister did not mention in the Bill any commodity that would be averaged in price and used as the base-line from which to value.  He goes merely upon rents that are receivable. On the question of house rents, because of legislation which left houses <Col N="884" /> for renting scarce and pretty well impossible, every house now let at a rent must be let at an inflated rent, and on that inflated rent the Minister proposes to increase the valuation.  The very fact that he proposes to increase the valuation will make houses for renting still more scarce, and still further will the rents go up, and consequently the new valuations must follow that upward trend.  The Minister will not know where he will be in the end.</P>
      <P>I cannot see the need for the revaluation. It has been accepted here that, generally speaking, Griffith's valuation was a fairly good base-line valuation. Let us take the commodities which Griffith took.  Have those commodities, in the aggregate, risen in price since? If they have, there might be a case for increasing the value, but why not increase it by the percentage without having all the paraphernalia of a revaluation?  If Griffith's valuation is accepted as as fair a valuation as you can get, why not take it, and if the commodities on which it was based have increased in price, you have a case for putting up the valuations by the percentage by which those commodities have increased.  It can be done in an office without going out at all.  There would be certain adjustments which can be made if the public authorities do their duty and if individuals do their duty.  If the Minister thinks that the right of initiation of valuation should be given to the Commissioner of Valuation, let him give it, but let him start on the Griffith line, and if those commodities have gone down in price, there is a good case for a reduction in valuation. I suggest that line to the Minister, instead of the proposal in the Bill, as an equitable way of dealing with the readjustment of valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certainly, in the case of houses, he has no base-line to go on.  You cannot set any value on a house except, and I am sure he knows this, what that house will fetch, either from renting or selling by a free sale, in a free market, to a free purchaser.  You have no free market for houses for renting now, because you will have 100 applicants for any sort of a house to rent anywhere. What price will they pay?  Is it a just rent?  In these circumstances, in that <Col N="885" /> restricted market, and on those inflated prices&mdash;I am speaking for the City and County of Dublin, the places I know&mdash; the Minister proposes to fix the poor law valuation of houses.</P>
    <P>Then, under the social policy, which developed so much in the last ten or 15 years, and which was a good one, tending towards making every householder become a house-owner, people will find themselves faced, in addition to the other financial commitments that they undertook in order to purchase their houses, with the position that their income-tax in respect of the house is 2½ times what it was, and will find that the rates are more than they are at the present time, because the Minister, I am quite sure, is banking on the mental delusion that because the rates in the city, let us say, would come down to about 9/- in the £, these people would think that there would be a corresponding reduction in other ways, and would forget that their valuation was now 2½ times what it was.</P>
    <P>I think that the gem of the Minister's speech in introducing this Bill, was when he held that because the valuation of the country and the City of Dublin will be increased artificially by these means we will have greater credit and be worth more because we can write up the valuation of property, which is now £2,000,000, to £5,000,000, and because of that, people who might be reluctant now to give money, even for the laudable purpose of building houses for the workers in the City of Dublin, would be more willing to provide it.  When I say that now, I am not interrupted, as I was before Christmas, when I said something similar, because now even the thickest head in the Dublin Corporation must realise the financial straits into which we have been driven, and under this Bill we are going to be driven into worse straits.  Of course, the Minister for Finance will rejoice so long as he gets his pound of flesh, but those whom he has deceived will get their lesson and they will have to pay a big price for it.</P>

      <P>No boxing of the compass can possibly deceive anybody who has studied this Bill and the White <Col N="886" /> Paper which accompanied it, with regard to its real object, which is, not to iron out inequalities or to remove blemishes in the existing methods of valuation, but for the purpose, and the sole purpose, of raising more money for the Exchequer.  We might ask at this stage: Who exactly is looking for this Bill?  Has any representative body in the country asked for a Revaluation Bill of this kind, which purports to continue what is an artificial and thoroughly out-of-date scheme of valuation. No bodies in this country have asked for it, nor has any Party in this House sought a Bill of this kind, and no responsible body in this country has dared to suggest that, in existing circumstances, we ought to have a Bill providing for general revaluation throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told in the White Paper and in the Minister's speech that there are injustices and inequalities in existence at present.  There may be injustices in respect of valuation, and there may also be inequalities, but there are injustices and inequalities in respect of more things than valuations, and we do nothing whatever to endeavour to find a legislative remedy for these injustices or inequalities.  We get after the inequalities and injustices in respect of valuation, however, because, through the medium of this Bill, we see an opportunity of raking in more money that could not be got except by the doubtful methods employed in this Bill.  The only body that is asking for this Bill is the Revenue Commission, and the only Department that wants this Bill is the Department of Finance.  I do not say that they want it in any spirit of personal or individual malice, but that, being concerned with garnering all the money they can for Exchequer purposes, they have discovered that this is one of the means, and a very effective means, by which the income of the Exchequer can be increased.  Hence, as I say, the only Department that is asking for this is the Department of Finance, and the only purpose of it is to try to get more money for the Revenue irrespective of the manner in which the money is got, the inequalities or injustices which may be caused in <Col N="887" /> the getting of the money, or the inappropriateness of the time this Bill is being introduced.</P>
    <P>In a Finance Bill of a few years ago we had a scheme which purported to assume that valuations were increased by 25 per cent. for income-tax purposes. During the past few years valuations have been assumed to be five-fourths of their normal value for income-tax purposes. That increase was visited, not merely on people living in houses over a certain valuation but on valuations of all kinds.  It was not merely people who were living in mansions or in houses in Merrion Square who were subject to that 25 per cent. increase, but every type of house in the country was subject to it, even though the person concerned might be a struggling craftsman or a progressive-minded middle-class person occupying a house and buying it on the hire-purchase system.  I said at that time, and I believe it, that a blanket measure of that kind, which took no notice of inequalities, was unfair and harsh, and I opposed it because I felt that it was going to impose hardships on a section of the community which had made very severe sacrifices in order to be enabled to purchase their homes.  For the past two years, at all events, the Department of Finance has been receiving income-tax on the basis of assessments which are 25 per cent. in excess of the normal valuation of houses, and we can be sure that, no matter what the Minister said in his speech on this Bill, or no matter what may be said by way of apology for this Bill, the new revaluation will work out to give the State an increase&mdash;a permanent increase&mdash;of not less than 25 per cent. for income-tax purposes, and it may well be that the authors of the Bill and the operators of the Bill will be able to arrange things in such a way that there may be even a still greater increase than 25 per cent. for income-tax purposes in respect of valuation.  At all events, we may take it that we are not likely to have continued as a permanent arrangement the device of increasing the valuations by a notional 25 per cent. for income-tax purposes.  The aim of the State under this Bill will be to make that <Col N="888" /> permanent, and in revising the whole scheme of valuation, I think that, as a minimum, one of the things that will happen here will be that valuation for income-tax purposes will show a minimum increase of not less than 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton stated that it is highly questionable whether the artificial and slipshod method of valuation which is applied to valuation here is suitable for application to the valuation of houses at a time when there is a very real scarcity of houses for letting purposes. One of the methods of valuing provided for in this Bill is, what is the letting value of a house taking one year with another.  Suppose we were to apply that method of valuing to a house, let us say, in Dublin, Cork Limerick or Waterford at any time during the past ten years, or at any time during the next ten years, does not everybody realise that you will get an artificial valuation by advertence to a factor of that kind, because there are famine rents being paid for houses by persons who cannot manage to raise the necessary money to purchase a house.  An increase in valuation based upon famine rents of that kind is not going to give a true valuation for that house.  If this results in an increase in valuation, while not preventing an increase in the rent&mdash;and there is no proposal to prevent an increase even in the existing high rents&mdash;you may find that rents may be even still higher than they are to-day.</P>

      <P>In existing circumstances, we are asked to accept a scheme of valuation which will take the rents of houses as the test, and we are doing that in the knowledge that the existing rents are artificially high.  If the owner of a house in these circumstances finds, let us say, the existing valuation doubled, there is no provision to prevent his increasing the rent.  The Minister, of course, will not deny that there is no provision to prevent his increasing the rent of a decontrolled house, or a house over £26 valuation, or a house let to another tenant after being previously controlled.  In these circumstances, it is not possible under existing legislation to prevent a tenant suffering an increase in rent.  There is no intimation from the Government that they propose to control rents in order to prevent a situation of that kind arising.  Make no mistake about it, whether we like it or not, whether tenants like it or not, the effect of this Bill, unaccompanied by rent restriction legislation, is going to be a pretty general increase in rents throughout the country in the case of people who are tenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years, particularly since the war, there has been a very definite movement in the direction of encouraging house purchase.  Many craftsmen and artisans generally have endeavoured to purchase their houses upon what we might term the hire-purchase system.  The purchasing of a house in that way involves the accumulation of a substantial deposit, the raising of a loan over a restricted period of years, payment during that period of substantial annuities to amortise the loan, and the meeting of charges for income-tax, ground rent, repairs, maintenance, and <Col N="890" /> the other ancillary charges which run hand-in-hand with ownership of a house.  At a time when the movement has been steadily increasing, and when it is tending to develop, we present house purchasers with a Revaluation Bill, the only purpose of which, in the mind of any intelligent person, is to raise more money from those who happen to own houses.  As I said, we must bear in mind all the time that they are not of the millionaire class.</P>
    <P>But, of course, the injustice will not even end there.  Small towns throughout the country, which have been particularly hard hit by the development of bus traffic and the virtual annihilation of distance, as we formerly knew it, due to improved transport mobility, have been finding it very hard to maintain even the small industrial and commercial life they had in the past. Under this Bill there will be a revaluation of rural areas on the basis of the houses and out-houses there.  There will be no revaluation of land, but in the towns, and in the small towns in particular, there will be a revaluation of the property there.  What is going to happen is that, when county councils are making demands in future for poor rate, the balance between the small towns and the rural area will be disturbed in such a way that the struggling small towns will pay a bigger proportion of the poor rate in future than they paid in the past.  Nobody can see anything in this Bill calculated to give any relief to counter-balance a burden of that kind.</P>
    <P>We may be told, of course, that there are injustices in existence to-day which ought not to be allowed to continue. But it was not to-day they occurred.  They have been there for ten, 20, 30, 40, 50 years.  One questions whether at a time like this it is desirable to have a revaluation of the entire country for the purpose of remedying injustices of that kind. If there are cases where people occupying large houses pay rates on a low valuation and are generally exploiting the houses for commercial purposes, surely it is possible to remedy a situation of that kind by giving the Commissioner of Valuation or new Commissioners of Valuation power to inquire <Col N="891" /> into inequalities of that kind and have them remedied.  It is hardly necessary to have an entire revaluation of the whole country merely for the purpose of remedying the injustices which have been adverted to by the Minister in his speech and in the White Paper which accompanied the Bill.  I think the present is a very inopportune time for a general revaluation.  I think it is most unwise to introduce a Bill of this kind providing for a general revaluation. The complete absence of any enthusiasm for the Bill on the Government Benches is the clearest indication that the Party realises that the Bill is an inappropriate Bill having regard to existing circumstances, It is not the kind of Bill upon the introduction of which we ought to embark this year.  As I have already said, one of its primary purposes is to get more revenue.  It is not concerned with how it gets it or who pays.  The poor will not be exempt from its operations. Another effect of the Bill will be to increase rents because there is no provision to guard against the alterations that will be made arising out of increased valuations.</P>

Bearing all these considerations in mind, the Deputy is convinced and the White Paper bears out what he says that there is no provision by the Government and no declared intention on the part of the Government to prevent tenants being compelled to pay increased rents when those who own houses are compelled to pay increased rates and income tax because of the increased valuations under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think legislation of another kind is much more necessary and much more urgent at the moment.  There is no need for legislation of this kind.  The Government ought to concern themselves <Col N="892" /> with much more pressing matters than with a measure of this kind which is demanded not by the people of the country but by those who want to swell and increase the income to the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>The almost unanimous opposition through the country to this Bill has been a clear indication that the people resent the attempt to wrest from them more taxation than that which they have to lie under at the moment, whether that taxation be through the national or the local authorities.  No matter how many excuses are made for the Bill, there is no doubt about it that the widening of the field for taxation will enable increased taxes to be imposed and possibly delude the people with a sort of conviction that they are not being taxed at all.  &ldquo;He that is robbed and knows it not, he is not robbed at all.&rdquo; If there is a smaller rate in the £, as there must be, there is no doubt it will soften the blow which the people will have to bear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tenderest part of a man is his pocket, and there is no question about the opposition to this Bill.  That opposition to the Bill is unanimous throughout the country.  In addition to letters from other areas, I have here a letter from the representatives of the <Col N="894" /> Development Committee in one of the hardest hit areas in my constituency&mdash; Passage West.  In that letter there is a resolution passed by the people there which reads: &ldquo;That we join with the people of the rest of the towns and cities in Éire in opposing the proposed Revaluation Bill, as we believe that it is an additional device to load a further burden on the ratepayers and taxpayers.&rdquo;  That is a resolution coming from a place that has been deprived of every form of industry.  It is coming from a town where the people are taking the roofs off their houses so as to avoid having to pay rates on them.  This Bill is definitely a tax on thrift.</P>
    <P>I can recall the consternation with which the Bill was received in the suburban area of Cork which forms part of my constituency.  In that area, building had been carried on in the erection of new houses for young workers who by their own thrift or by invoking credit had been able to provide themselves with happy homes.  In almost all cases these are very thrifty people.  They are young shop-workers, clerks, artisans, and people of that sort.  The rates there are 11/10 in the £ under the Cork Corporation and if there is to be a further burden of taxation, these people will be very hard hit by reason of the increased income-tax. There is no question about that.  This will bear very heavily on them and all their thrift and enterprise are to go for nothing simply because there is a watchful Minister for Finance who is skilfull in extorting the finances by which he can increase the revenues of the State.  That is a very worthy object, if these revenues were devoted to worthy purposes.  But all we are getting at the present time is increased taxation.  There are to be increased rates and taxation on those people who definitely have had to use up every economy in order to provide themselves with a home.  Even where they make use of all the machinery of the State, whether the houses are built by State grants or otherwise, I may definitely tell the House that all these advantages are wiped out completely by the increased cost of building materials. These houses are there.  They were built outside the city boundaries and <Col N="895" /> are not subject to the city scale of taxation. The occupiers built them as an investment for themselves&mdash;as something that they might leave to their children.  I oppose this Bill on the ground that those people cannot afford to have any more burdens placed upon them. Deputies who have spoken on the Bill have stressed the fact that the main purpose behind it is to bring extra money into the Exchequer.  It will, unfortunately, also have the effect of enabling local authorities to increase local charges.  No matter how much a local authority may be opposed to that course, the operation of this measure will oblige them to increase the local rates.  That is why I urge on Deputies in all parts of the House to oppose vigorously the passage of this Bill.  The people that I have been speaking of are very easily satisfied so far as local services are concerned, whether it be the emptying of a dustbin or the provision of light or a water supply.  They get no relief from the agricultural grant. They have to pay the full rate that is levied in their area, and in my opinion they will not be able to bear the increased charges which this Bill proposes.</P>
    <P>The people in the urban area of Cobh, and even in Cork City itself, are strongly opposed to this Bill.  The Minister, I think, would be well advised to moderate its provisions.  If the Bill had been introduced before the last general election, when the Government had to carry on with a very small majority in the Dáil, I believe that the outcry raised against it would have been sufficient to bring about the defeat of the Government.  It is well to remember, in connection with a measure of this kind, that the day of the speculative builder is gone.  The result is that the people have to avail of every means in their power if they want to provide themselves with a home.  Therefore, I say, that at such a time it is an ill thing and an inequitable thing to bring in this measure.  It aims a terrific blow at the thrift and the energy which have enabled great numbers of people&mdash;I should say one of the best elements in the State&mdash;to provide <Col N="896" /> themselves with homes.  The case that I have made for the residents in those suburban areas can, I am sure, be borne out by many other members of the House.  The business people and others who are living in those areas and who, as I have said, have provided themselves with homes, have denounced the principles underlying this measure in no uncertain terms.  I have discussed the measure with very many people.  I have not met one who had a good word to say for it.  Everyone is opposed to it.  I oppose it as strongly as I possibly can, despite the fact that it has been put before us in very glowing terms in the White Paper circulated with it.</P>
    <P>There is to be no remission so far as agricultural land valuations are concerned. I am not prepared to rise to that fly, for this reason, that unless derating is given to the agricultural community there is very grave danger indeed that the full incidence of this Bill will fall on the agricultural community by reason of the power which the Minister has to make variations in the amount of the agricultural grant. These variations are of frequent occurrence, and if the Minister for Finance were to avail of that method he might very well widen the field of taxation so far as the agricultural community is concerned.</P>
    <P>I am thankful to say that a higher standard of comfort is now demanded by the agricultural community.  Many of them, by their own energy, have built new houses.  They have been enabled to do that largely because of the free labour supplied by members of their families.  But while that is so, the burden on them has been heavy enough, due to the high costs of building materials.  Under this Bill their thrift and energy in that direction are to be utilised as a means of increasing taxation on them.  Farm economy at the present day demands well built and well equipped farm buildings.  For instance, a farmer cannot get registered as a cow keeper unless his cow houses conform to the regulations laid down by the Department of Local Government. But the strange thing is that if he puts up new and improved cow houses, and if the valuation of the new <Col N="897" /> buildings is higher than that of the old, his taxation is increased.  Surely that is not the way to encourage an up-to-date agricultural economy.  I hope that Deputies in all parts of the House who are interested in the agricultural community will join with me in opposing this Bill.  The whole countryside is crying out against its provisions.  The Minister, by reason of previous legislation, has made himself a very unpopular person, but he will be more unpopular than ever if he succeeds in forcing this Bill through.</P>
    <P>People in the suburban areas of Cork have to pay a tax of 2/6 in the £ for their water supply.  This is the charge imposed by the corporation, while in the city the charge is only 3d. in the £. What will the position of those people be if, as a result of this Bill, the 2/6 becomes 5/- in the £?  Income-tax is another charge which falls heavily on many of those people.  It is a charge which hits businessmen severely.  They have grave fears as to what the results of this measure will be when it comes to be operated.</P>
    <P>Some of the previous speakers referred to Griffith's valuation.  There is no doubt whatever but that the conditions in this country were at that time far different from what they are to-day.  Many of the old mud-wall cabins that we then had in this country have since, I am glad to say, disappeared. The labourers' cottages will be taxed on a higher valuation.  Their letting value will also be taken into consideration, and very definitely a high tax will be imposed on them, a tax much higher than at the present time. That is one of the things that I ask the Party on my right to look into.  They should oppose by every means in their power a tax on a very deserving class, the agricultural labourers, who cannot bear any further increase because they are already bearing a sufficiently high burden.  We trust the Minister will see his way to moderate the provisions of this Bill, and whatever relief he can give the country, we ask him to give it.</P>

      <P>I am not at all surprised if there is an uproar in different towns throughout the country, especially in view of Deputy Brasier's speech here to night.  The Minister was quite right <Col N="898" /> when he stated that this Revaluation Bill was long overdue.  My only regret is that it does not include agricultural land.  I think some definite clause should be inserted whereby individual farmers whose land was valued on proximity value, which no longer exists, or on Griffith's valuation, or whose land was subject to the wheat land valuation which has been described as quite absurd, would be included in some way.  The value of land is entirely different now.  The unfortunate members of the agricultural community who happened to have their land valued as wheat land are ever since bearing an unfair burden.  You have in my constituency a farm that could carry 20 cows valued at 30/- an acre, and the valuation of a similar holding on the other side of the city is about 10/- an acre.  That indicates how some farmers have to bear three times the burden they should be asked to bear.</P>
      <P>How Deputy Brasier comes along here to protest against this Bill is beyond my imagination.  Deputy Brasier represents a rural area on the South Cork Board of Assistance, and he has on several occasions signed protests against being tied up with the city.  I will take the valuations of the different urban areas within that South Cork area, and I will indicate what in my opinion is going to happen.  Take the Cobh urban area, which has a valuation of £24,909.  That valuation in my opinion is going to be enormously reduced.  I can say the very same thing about Passage, which will undoubtedly be enormously reduced.</P>

You have the anomaly in Cork City where you have rents of over £200 and £250 a year being paid for buildings that would carry a valuation of £50.  I would not be at all surprised, and I would not mind the Lord Mayor of Cork, Deputy Hickey, or a representative of Cork City, endeavouring to oppose this Bill; but I cannot understand a rural Deputy whose area is undoubtedly going to get an enormous relief under the Bill, getting up here for the sake of opposing the Government at any cost.

If there is one area in the whole 26 Counties that cannot complain in regard to this Valuation Bill it is the South Cork area that Deputy Brasier represents. There are very few urban areas in it that will be hit in any way by this Bill.  The towns are in the main poor. The principal town is Cobh, with a valuation of £24,000.  It will get an enormous reduction in valuation.  The revaluation of Cobh is long overdue.</P>

      <P>If Deputy Brennan was in my constituency he might get elected to an urban council, but devil a bit more.  I have indicated my view in so far as the Revaluation Bill affects the constituency I represent and the area surrounding it.  In my opinion it is going to bring an enormous relief in rates to the agricultural community. Deputies over there who have been howling about the agricultural community and the unfair way in which <Col N="901" /> they have been treated ever since we came into office should be delighted that now there is going to be a levelling up and that portion of the burden which has been unfairly and unjustly borne by the South Cork area will be borne by the city instead.  I could quite understand that case put up by a City Deputy but I cannot understand that case being put up by rural Deputies.  The valuation of Cobh will be reduced and the valuation of Passage will undoubtedly be reduced.</P>

That is just the same as the advice that was freely given round the country, when the Deputy plunged the whole side of the country into turmoil and misfortune in order to help John Bull to get his annuities.  Everything that this Government has done must be wrong in Deputy Brasier's eyes.  He views everything through red, white and blue glasses.  This Valuation Bill is going to effect an enormous relief for the agricultural community in my constituency. I welcome it for that reason alone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would suggest to the Minister that he should insert in this Bill a section whereby individual farmers will have the right of appeal against the valuation of agricultural land.  I have already pointed out to the Minister that he has given me ample grounds here for this appeal when he said that the valuation made by Richard Griffith in the years 1852-56 may be said to be still in force for rating purposes.  He now comes along and brings in this Bill for the cities and towns, and leaves the revaluation of land untouched.  That is something to my mind that should be remedied in the Bill.  I have already given instances of injustice.  That injustice has been pointed out in this House ever since 1927.  I remember on the first occasion I spoke from the benches on the other side of the House, I appealed for a revaluation of the agricultural land of this country.  I think it is grossly unfair to have one <Col N="902" /> farmer, whose holding is of the same value economically as a neighbouring farmer, paying three times the rates of that neighbouring farmer.  I think that that is a matter that could be remedied by one section in the Bill.  If the Minister does not want to burden the draftsman too much, he might draft a section to cover it himself.  I would certainly suggest to the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Corry is either a very-well informed, or a very innocent, man.  He is probably both but I very often regard Deputy Corry as more innocent than well-informed. At the same time, I do not know that he has the authority of the Minister for Finance for saying either one or other of two things he mentioned, that certain towns are bound to go up in valuation and that certain other towns are bound to go down.  The Minister would not like that.  I think that Deputy Brasier was right from a practical, logical point of view.  If Deputy Corry is right in saying that the valuations <Col N="903" /> of Cobh and Passage are going to go down enormously, I am afraid the country districts are going to carry the load.  You see, you cannot have it both ways.  If you are going to pull down the valuations in Passage, Cobh and other places, some other place has got to carry the load.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid that Deputy Corry is more innocent than well-informed in this case.  Personally, I think that a Valuation Bill could be, or ought to be, a just and equitable measure, an innocuous kind of measure. That was my first impression.  As a matter of fact before I read the Bill I thought it would be a measure of that kind.  Still, of course, when we remembered that we had the Minister for Finance for the last few years increasing the valuation of several houses for the purpose of income-tax to five-fourths of the previous valuation, we became suspicious.  It was evident, and it is evident to-night, that there was something at the back of the Bill that it does not mean just a removal of anomalies and inequities.  There is something else, whatever it may be, at the back of it.  After all, we have had a rather rushed time with legislation and this Bill would not be brought in merely for the purpose of removing anomalies.  There is another very good reason for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point in this Bill to which I should like to direct the particular attention of Deputy Corry, because it is the only thing about which I want to speak.  The position in cities has been dealt with by Deputies who understand cities.  I do not.  I am going to speak for the farmers.  I am going to speak for the people who will come under the provisions of Section 19.  Does Deputy Corry know the implications of that section?  Does he know what he is going to get under that section?  He does not; he has not read it at all.  If he read Section 19 and its various sub-sections, and tried to find out the implications of these various sub-sections which state clearly and distinctly that the new valuations <Col N="904" />&ldquo;shall not be estimated at a lesser sum than&rdquo;&mdash;he would know what the Bill contemplates.  I wonder what is the idea behind that phrase?  You have it running right down through the section.  Deputy Corry will be interested in this because he is a farmer like myself.  He has farm buildings and I am sure that Deputy Corry feels, as I feel, that a farm building is nothing more or less than ancillary to the farm itself.</P>
    <P>I have always felt that in this country you cannot place a letting value upon a man's farmhouse and farmyard as distinct from his farm.  After all, his farm is his industry.  You might as reasonably say to a man who is in business: &ldquo;Even though you have given up your business, you are still going to carry a big valuation on your shop.&rdquo; Or you might as well say to a farmer: &ldquo;You have got £100 worth of machinery to do your farm work and we are going to put a valuation on the letting value of that for the purpose of assessing taxes on you.&rdquo;  If I have a shed or two sheds to house my hay, oats or live stock, I maintain that these buildings are ancillary to my farm.  The Minister says &ldquo;No,&rdquo; that he is going to send a valuer to value the building on the basis of what he considers the letting value of the premises, even taking in the flower-garden in front. He will put a valuation on that according to its rental value, leaving out the farm altogether.  That is what we have here.  Deputy Corry did not read that and he will be surprised to hear of it now.  I do not know what kind of place Deputy Corry has, but if he has a place that would carry, in the ordinary way, a high letting value, well he is going to get it in the neck.</P>
    <P>We have it stated in this sub-section that &ldquo;subject to the provisions of the foregoing paragraphs of this sub-section, the valuation of every hereditament shall be made upon an estimate of the net annual value&mdash;that is to say, the rent for which one year with another such hereditament might, in its actual state, reasonably be expected to let from year to year.&rdquo;  What would a farmer's residence and farmyard let at from year to year without regard to his holding?  Would it let at all?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Every member has got a copy of the Bill and White Paper. The White Paper put the soft pedal upon the whole thing.  I maintain that, under Section 19, farmers' houses and buildings are going to be valued upon a letting basis from day to day. What will that basis be?  The farmer will be in this position&mdash;that, according as he makes improvements, his valuation will be pushed up.  I know that that was so in the past where a report was received from the rate collectors of the county council.  But the Minister is not satisfied with that. He does not think that the rate collectors and the local authorities have done their job.  He does not think that the ratings are high enough, and he is going to give power of initiation to the Valuation Office.  The Minister thinks that that is the right thing to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="906" /> In the future, a farmer or shopkeeper who puts a bathroom into his house or who does some internal improvement, will receive a visit from one of the new army of inspectors which will be attached to the Valuation Office.  The inspector will tell him to unbar his door and let him see what changes he has made.  He will then put a new valuation on his house because he has made some little improvements.  That was never the case before.  If the Minister would only remember the words which he uttered at the bankers' dinner recently in Dublin with regard to greater agricultural productivity and increased export of agricultural produce, he would think twice before he would place an instrument of this kind in anybody's hands.  It will, undoubtedly, be responsible for raising the valuation and increasing the outgoings thereby of farm buildings.</P>
    <P>If we are going to do anything for agriculture, let us not think that we are moving in that direction by this Bill.  We are back, in fact, to the old days of the rack-renting landlord.  If you made any improvement in those days, up went your rent.  Henceforth, if you make any improvement the man from the Valuation Office will come along and up will go your valuation. That is the implication of this Bill so far as the farming community is concerned.  I maintain that the farm and the farmyard are one, and that the farmyard has no letting value as distinct from the farm, but that will not be recognised by the people who are to fix the valuation.  We are going to get it hard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, in reply to Deputy Norton, drew the attention of the House to the last paragraph of the explanatory memorandum where it is stated that a Consequential Provisions Bill will be introduced.  I feel very strongly that we should have that Consequential Provisions Bill before us before we are asked to pass this Bill because many things are dependent upon valuation.  We are asked to pass this Valuation Bill without any idea as to whether the necessary adjustments will be made in the various things which are consequent on revaluation. There is, for instance, the contribution <Col N="907" /> of the local authorities to unemployment assistance which, in the case of this city, is 1/8 in the £ on the valuation. In actual fact, it works out at about 1/10 in the £.  Acting on the general assumption that the effect of this Bill will be to increase the valuation of this city, if the rate is to remain at 1/10, it obviously means that the ratepayers of Dublin will have to pay very heavily, indeed.  There is also the fact that, as this Bill is worded at present, income-tax will be payable in different parts of the country at the same time on the old and new valuations. The Bill provides that the county boroughs will be valued first. When these valuations are completed, the Minister may make an order that they are to come into force on a certain 1st March, which may be three or four years in advance of the coming into force of the new valuations in the rest of the country.  The result of that will be that these areas will be paying on the new valuation while the other areas will be paying on the old valuation.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Dockrell raised the question of the five-fourths for income-tax purposes, the Minister shook his head, suggesting that it was not intended to carry that on after this Bill becomes law.  I think that some more definite indication than a shake of his head is required from the Minister, and I hope he will deal with that in his closing remarks.  The Bill also provides that churches and such buildings shall not be valued under the new Act at all.  The corporation here, and probably local authorities elsewhere, derive revenue from these buildings, based on rateable valuation, for domestic water supplies.  If there is no rateable valuation, perhaps the Minister would indicate on what system that rate should be levied in future.  I should also like the Minister to explain his reasons, if he has any, for selecting the figures of 2½d. and two-fifths of a penny for the initial and annual sums which local authorities are to pay for revaluation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What those sums mean to any local authority it is impossible to say. At the present moment the annual cost to the Dublin Corporation of the annual revision is £200.  Two-fifths of <Col N="908" /> a penny on the present valuation is £3,000, a fairly good interest from the Minister's point of view, but actually the increase will presumably be more than that because that two-fifths will be levied not on the existing valuation, which produces £3,000, but on a new valuation the figure of which is not known.  I do not know what induced the Minister to hit on those particular sums.</P>
    <P>There is also another point which I think requires clearing up.  At the present moment the State owns certain property, but is not in occupation of it.  If that falls vacant at the moment, the State contends that it is not liable to rates, being State property.  I think that is a matter which needs clearing up.  It is liable for rates at the moment.  Why then if it becomes unoccupied should it cease to be liable for rates?  Also I think provision is required for the rating of newly constructed buildings which may be completed and occupied after the beginning of the financial year.  I am not clear whether such a provision exists at the moment.  Perhaps the Minister would look into it, and see if some such provision can be made for the future.</P>

      <P>At this Stage I do not wish to occupy the time of the House for very long.  First of all I should like to know from the Minister who is behind this Bill?  Who has been asking the Minister to introduce such a Bill?  What will its implications be when it is passed?  We were challenged from the Minister's side of the House last week that we had no representations from local bodies against this Bill.  I should like to know from the Minister if any local body has sent representations to him in favour of the Bill?  I have here some representations from local bodies in connection with it.  The first one I will read is from the Castlebar Urban Council. This is dated as far back as 6th February. It reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A Chara,&mdash;I am directed by the Castlebar Urban District Council to ask you to take all possible steps to have the Revaluation Bill rejected when again submitted to An Dáil.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is signed &ldquo;F. O Ríain, Clerk to the <Col N="909" /> Council.&rdquo;  I have also here a resolution passed unanimously by the Mayo County Council.  The majority of that council, as the Minister is well aware, are Fianna Fáil.  In fact, I understand that about three-fourths of the members of the council are members of the Minister's Party.  Here is a resolution which has been sent by them to every member for North and South Mayo, both of the Minister's Party and of the Fine Gael Party:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A Chara,&mdash;Enclosed I send you copy of resolution which was adopted by the Mayo County Council at their meeting on the 28th ultimo, relative to the new Valuation Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is signed &ldquo;M. J. Egan,&rdquo; and the resolution reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That we, the members of the Mayo County Council, register emphatic protest against the enactment of the proposed Bill for the raising of the valuations of all houses, farm buildings, shops and factories in this country.  That, considering the excellent manner in which the ratepayers of Mayo have at all times discharged their responsibilities in the matter of regular payments of their annual rate assessments, notwithstanding the adverse circumstances they have had to contend with in recent years, we consider any proposal calculated to increase their burden as iniquitous. That we call upon our representatives in the Oireachtas, irrespective of Party affiliations, to be united in a vehement opposition to a Bill that, if enacted, will place increased responsibilities on the shoulders of a majority already staggering under the burden they at present have to bear.&mdash;M. Kilroy, Chairman.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the position as far as Mayo is concerned.  That resolution has been sent to the various members for Mayo, including the Minister for Justice.  I wonder how he will vote when he comes into the House to-night? Deputy Munnelly is from the same district, so are Deputy Cleary, Deputy Walsh and Deputy Moran.  I wonder how&mdash;after the action of that council, the majority of whom belong to their own Party&mdash;they are going to vote?  I <Col N="910" /> think they should vote with us, and ask the Minister to withdraw the Bill.</P>
    <P>What is going to happen as far as labourers' cottages are concerned?  We have just had a scheme sent to local bodies by the Minister for Local Government whereby the labourers have been given an opportunity to purchase their cottages.  If this Bill goes through, I have it on reliable authority that the increased valuation of those cottages will mean considerably more than the amount which will be saved in rent.  The valuation will go up by at least three times on labourers' cottages. Take farm-houses all over the country; the same will apply there. That is what you are going to have if this Bill is passed.  What about the houses which have been built in the Gaeltacht?  Those houses are already highly valued.  The old valuations were probably in or about 5/- or 10/-. That has been increased to about £3. If this Bill is passed it will go up to probably £6.  The various towns throughout the country are all up in arms against this Bill.  I think the best thing the Minister could do is to withdraw it.  If he does not withdraw the Bill the people of Ireland will not know him to-morrow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two or three aspects of this Bill on which I should like some information from the Minister when he is replying.  First of all, there is the question of the cost of this revaluation.  I want to know why it is that the cost of this revaluation is being put on the general valuation of the county?  Why is it applicable to land, seeing that land is not being revalued? I think it is only fair to let the houses which are the subject of revaluation carry the cost of that revaluation. It should not be applied to agricultural land.  Secondly, in regard to this figure of two-fifths of a penny per annum, I think it is quite sufficient for the Minister to provide for the actual cost of revaluation within a particular area.  That should be sufficient for him each year, but I estimate that this figure of two-fifths of a penny will bring a very substantial revenue to the State at the expense of the ratepayers in the rural districts, and in the towns also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="911" /> There is another matter to which I wish to refer&mdash;it has already been mentioned by Deputy Nally&mdash;and that is the question of labourers' cottages. Under the Labourers Acts, special provision was made for a very low valuation of labourers' cottages.  The present valuation is, I think, on an average of about 30/-, and the weekly rate amounts, I think, to about 4d. to 7d. in most areas.  If the provisions of this Bill are carried out, the plot will be taken into consideration, and valued on rental value.  The average rent of those cottages in the last five or six years was something like 2/- a week. This would mean a valuation of nearly £6, and it would increase the agricultural labourer's weekly amount by 4d. to 6d.  We know very well that the agricultural labourer cannot pay any more, and in actual fact the ratepayers will bear that burden in some way or other; either that or the farmer will pay additional wages.  That is an important matter, and should be carefully considered.  Special provision was made in the Labourers Acts for low valuations on houses occupied by agricultural labourers.  If the provisions of Section 19 of the Bill are carried out in connection with cottages built by local authorities, a serious position would certainly be created.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Corry referred to the necessity for a revaluation of land.  In my constituency there are certain areas where there has been for years a very strong demand for the revaluation of agricultural land.  That does not apply to the whole county, as revaluation would be as unpopular with a big proportion of people with land as it is amongst people who do not want to have houses revalued.  There are, however, areas where Griffith's valuation does not apply, and where valuations are most unjust at present. The Minister should provide that an electoral area, or an individual farmer, should have the right to apply for the revaluation of agricultural land.  We know that artificial manures have changed what was poor land into valuable land, and that some land is carrying a low valuation while highly valued land is paying an unjust <Col N="912" /> amount.  I was very surprised to hear Deputy Norton, for the first time in this House, as leader of the Labour Party, defending income-tax payers.  That was a new role for Deputy Norton.  I did not think the Deputy or his Party were much concerned about income-tax in cities and towns.  Everybody knows that the business part of some towns has changed in the last ten or 20 years. There are portions of towns carrying very high valuations, but doing little or no business, while other parts of these towns, and doing the main business, have low valuations.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to the position in small towns governed by town commissioners, where houses have been erected under recent Housing Acts. These houses carry very high valuations, and as some of the people who occupy them have been transferred from slum dwellings they are unable to pay rates.  These houses were valued within the last few years.  That matter should be looked into.  It is probable that these tenants were transferred from houses on which the valuations were £1 or 10/- a year into new houses on which the valuations run from £8 to £10.  We know quite well that there are many business houses in these towns on which the valuations are not high.  How could it be expected that people transferred from slum dwellings could pay the county rates plus the town rates where the local authorities are town commissioners.  The county rates might be from 1/- to 15d. weekly and the tenants would be unable to pay.  Before the Bill passes that matter should be looked into.  I wish to impress upon the Minister the urgent necessity of having a revaluation of a certain portion of the agricultural land in the different counties. I am sure if some of the county councils had the power to have portion of the agricultural land revalued they would have had it done long ago.  I understand there was no such power under the old Act for an individual land holder to have portion of an area revalued.  A whole county should be revalued or none of it at all.  Provision should also be made to have an electoral area and to allow a resident to make application for revaluation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to intervene but for the fact that Deputy Allen seemed to be surprised that the Leader of the Labour Party should trouble himself about the question of income tax.  As I do not want the position of the Labour Party to be misrepresented, I should explain that what Deputy Norton was concerned about was not income tax as such, but with what is known as property tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. McEntee Mr. McEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not income tax in the accepted sense.  Everybody knows that.  There are numbers of wage earners who, in recent years, borrowed money under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act and built their own houses.  At present they are being charged five-fourths property tax, and it is for these people Deputy Norton spoke.  What concerns me about this Bill is how urban authorities will be affected by the poor rate demand of the county councils.  The valuation of urban districts will certainly be increased. The amount paid by urban districts for county council demands is based on the proportion of the urban valuation and the county valuation, and it will be considerably and, in my opinion, inequitably increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is going to be a very serious matter for the towns, and will hit very hard the working-class people who pay rates through the medium of rents. Deputy Allen referred to the position of people transferred from slum dwellings to new houses built by urban authorities.  As the Deputy pointed out, some of these people left dwellings on which the valuations were as low as 30/-, while the valuations of the new houses are £6 and, certainly, in no case less than £4 10s.  It is very difficult for that class of people to meet present demands.  If they are going to be increased, I am very much afraid of financial chaos in the case of many local authorities.  Deputy Allen also referred to the position of agricultural labourers.  That position is very serious, because agricultural labourers are at present paid a very low wage, and will be unable to meet extra <Col N="914" /> demands in the way of rates.  If anything could be done, by way of inserting a provision in the Bill to prevent increased valuations in these cases, it would be very welcome.  There is at present a move on foot to try to put the Cottage Purchase Act into operation. It was never contemplated when that Act was passed that there was going to be a revaluation of houses.  In my opinion this Bill will deter a great many people from availing of that Act, if they think that they will have to pay increased rates on new valuations.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill there is to be no revaluation of agricultural land.  Like Deputy Allen, I know certain land in the County Wexford which is valued altogether too high, for reasons that he has indicated, but there is another type of land which, to my mind, should be under review by the Land Commission and the Department of Finance.  I refer to large tracts of land which, for perhaps six months of the year, are under water.  That refers to a good portion of South-East Wexford.  Down around Tacumshane area, there are large tracts of land under water for almost six months each year.  Those people have to pay full rates on that land, and I suggest to the Minister that he should take advantage of this Bill to provide some machinery to have an investigation into cases of that kind. It is certainly a great hardship on these people to have to pay rates on land which they are not able to use for any longer than three or four months of the year.  I hope that the Minister will pay attention to these matters when the Committee Stage of the Bill comes around.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move the following motion standing in the names of Deputies Norton, Davin and myself:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Being of opinion that workers employed <Col N="915" /> on minor relief schemes should be paid at a rate of wages not less than the rate payable in the district by the county council, and that they should be guaranteed six days continuous employment in each week during which they are so employed, the Dáil requests the responsible Minister to make regulations for the purpose of carrying these intentions into effect.</P>
    <P>I consider that this motion is one of very outstanding importance, even much greater importance than it would suggest, because, in asking the House to agree that people engaged upon minor relief schemes should be paid at the same rate as that applying to county council workers, I believe there is a principle involved which, in itself, answers the question as to whether or not the Government has a real appreciation of the seriousness of the unemployment problem or whether it is intended to treat a certain section of our people as going to be chronically unemployed, and, as such, segregating them into a separate class distinct from their fellows.  The question arises as to whether, when the Government, through its various Departments, and the Board of Works or the Local Government authorities, embark upon minor relief schemes, do they not consider or does this House not consider that those people are engaged in work of national and productive importance or are they simply to be treated as being taken away from the door of the labour exchange to engage in some kind of work that is definitely marked down in advance to be of no use to the nation?  I suggest that the intention of minor relief schemes is to do very useful and necessary work to improve the social amenities of the rural districts, to improve the boreens and drains and other things incidental to making the life of the farming and general community of the country more tolerable and, incidentally, to provide work.</P>
    <P>So far, those grants have been of a very niggardly character, having regard to the magnitude of the unemployment problem in the rural areas, but I consider, <Col N="916" /> whatever about the amounts that have been granted, the principle of treating them as a separate class and giving them a specially low rate of wages, with certain short times of work in a week, related directly to the amount they draw at the labour exchange, is utterly and absolutely indefensible and seems to indicate, as I stated at the opening, that the Government envisages the continuance of this class of people perpetually on the dole.  If the work that they are doing is analogous in every way to the work being performed by regular employees of the county council&mdash;that at least ought to be the intention&mdash;why should there be a distinction drawn to mark these people down for lower rates of pay and lesser terms of employment than is given for the county council work?  The obvious answer is that the Government seems to be sorry for having ever introduced the Unemployment Assistance Act and they are taking all kinds of steps, by means of red tape and all kinds of objectionable machinery, to take away with the left hand what they have conceded with the right.</P>
    <P>A very fine principle was conceded in that Act&mdash;that every citizen of this country who was willing to work and able to work but for whom work could not be provided, was entitled to an honourable maintenance from the Central Fund of the State without any taint of pauperism or having to attend at the dispensaries of the poor law system as old, worn and decrepit old men, and that certain funds should be contributed from the local authorities and that, incidentally, the cost would be covered to an extent by the measure that has been discussed up to 9 o'clock, to draw from the nominal valuation of the poorest of this country a rate of 1/6 in the £&mdash;it is not the effective valuation that is called into question, but the nominal valuation.  There is a considerable sum being contributed to the Government to help them to maintain this Unemployment Assistance Act and to provide maintenance allowances to the unemployed people until work would have been provided for them by the planned schemes of the Government.</P>
    <P>The minor relief scheme is the principal <Col N="917" /> medium for carrying this into effect, but we find it working from three days a week and four days a week at 4/- a day.  We find they are working at a disadvantage when they come to work on the scheme, side by side with the county council workers who are entitled to six days a week, paid for out of the pockets of the ratepayers and the local authorities.  The standards of the county councils throughout the country cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, and having regard to the cost of living, be alleged to be inordinate returns for the work that is being done.  We find these employees of the Government on minor relief schemes are condemned to work three or four days at the rate of 4/- a day.  The benefit of the short day on Saturday, which has been earned by workers for giving long hours, and which is prescribed by legislation under the Conditions of Employment Act and every other Act, is denied to these men.  They work eight three-quarter days.  If they happen to be working on a scheme which comes under the Minor Relief Schemes Vote, they do get, in that case, the county council rate of 5/- on that scheme; that is, the county council rate under the Local Government Department; but even there they have to work the same conditions and hours as county council men for two or three or four days. They do not get Saturday work at all, and the county council man works his his half-day on Saturday and gets a full day's pay for it.  On the minor relief schemes under the Board of Works, they only get four days' work, and they work an eight-hour day. There is constant friction arising with the deputy surveyors and county surveyors with the inter-lapping of these schemes.  Is there any reason why the men should not be knocked off after working eight hours, and get the Saturday? The whole thing is muddlesome and troublesome and irksome, and there does not seem to be any need or justification for it, except that it is more or less a subterfuge to try to save the funds of the labour exchange.</P>
    <P>We contend that, if these minor relief schemes are to be of any definite benefit to the unemployed men and the country as a whole, they should be <Col N="918" /> employed for a full week and as many weeks in that particular job as the number of men in the area would allow to give a rotation.  We are not objecting to rotation if there is a full week's work given, so that, when they would complete that week's work, they would be able to go back to the labour exchange to take advantage of the full benefits of the Act that was provided to give them a maintenance allowance from the funds of this State when work was not available for them.  At the present time they are as well off the week they are drawing from the labour exchange, or almost as well off, as they are the week they are working, for, with wet weather and broken time they do not know whether it is an advantage to them or not to be working on the minor relief schemes.  There is no attraction in the schemes.  They are asked to go long distances to them.  If they do not go the long distance, after having their names sent out from the labour exchange, they are automatically struck off benefit.  They may subsequently come along and make their case before a court of referees that the distance was abnormal, and the court of referees will use their discretion and say whether or not the man was entitled not to go to this work.  The lines are not definitely set down, and week after week and month after month this sort of thing is still happening.  The men are sent to a job five, six and seven miles away, without any means of locomotion to get there, and they are asked to go for a few days' work.  They have been drawing unemployment assistance until now.  If they do not go they are struck off at the labour exchange.  They may eventually prove that they were not entitled to go there, and then they will be restored to benefit, but all the time the family is suffering.  Our people are being taught not to do useful work, not to do an honest to God week's work, but they are studying the practices of the labour exchange and trying to exploit its mysteries.  They are accused of not looking for work.  The labourers are accused of not being anxious for work. It is said that this dole system has corrupted them and has smashed their morale, but the fact is that the younger men are going long distances with <Col N="919" /> bicycles to the disadvantage of the older men who have not bicycles.</P>
    <P>That is another disadvantage.  We suggest that that should be wiped out and obviated.  If there was a full week's work given to the men who were engaged on that work and at a rate equal to that being paid by the local authority in that particular county, surely nobody could suggest that that is an unreasonable request to make.  Why should the State come along, setting a headline for undercutting in wages?  If the local authority, representative of the various interests in that county, ratepayers of all kinds, fix and set down a certain standard which they consider reasonable payment for the type of work that is being done by workers in their district, why on earth should the Government, above all, a progressive Government of the type of Fianna Fáil, come along and set down its headline for undercutting that wage, and not even for a full wage, but for the few miserable days they are getting?  If they are going to be employed for only two or three days, one would think that there would be an enhanced rate paid for a short time.  But no; there is a definite cutting down, and that headline is naturally being followed by private employers who, perhaps rightly say: &ldquo;Why should we be expected to pay a rate in excess of that being paid by the national Government, and if the county council does pay a higher rate, we are inclined to take our stand with the Government of the country?  We are paying heavy rates and taxes.&rdquo;  It is causing constant friction with those in the Labour movement who are trying to maintain standards for workers and trying to keep them somewhat level with the increased cost of living.</P>
    <P>This menace of the minor relief schemes is sure to be utilised by the private employers, and we say that the Government has never attempted to justify the action they are taking in this parsimonious dealing with the unemployed. We say that they are treating them as a separate class, and segregating them from their fellows. The Government seem to have adopted <Col N="920" /> a policy of despair; they seem to have abandoned all hope of ever solving the unemployment problem in a big, broad way.</P>
    <P>I suggest that if the millions which we are going to spend now upon armaments, on anti-aircraft guns, artillery and war planes, had been diverted before now to the solution of the unemployment problem so as to bring our people into these useful schemes of work which are lying to the hand of the Government, if they would only open their eyes and see them&mdash;and there are plenty schemes throughout the country that would call for six days' employment&mdash;there would be less need for all these precautions and less disaffection in the ranks of the educated and uneducated young men of the country.  The Government are creating forces of unrest and disaffection by ignoring the constant menace of this growing body of young men, and by treating them with contempt in giving them a few days' work on minor relief schemes.</P>
    <P>For that reason, I say that my opening statement is warranted, that this is a much more important question than the actual phrasing of the motion would seem to indicate, because I believe it goes to the root of the major problem facing the country to-day.  It is not the enemy from without but the enemy from within that must be faced. The principal enemy is with us&mdash;the unemployment menace.  That has got to be faced up to, and I suggest seriously to the Government that they ought, even now, before it is too late, recognise and grapple in a big way with the unemployment problem before the country, starting on the minor relief schemes, and recognise these people as citizens of the State and not a hall-marked, ear-marked class who must stand out for all time, according to the despairing gesture of the Government, as separated from their fellows and must be thankful to God to get a few days' work at any rate the Government likes to throw to them.</P>
    <P>A few of those millions would be wisely spent in the direction of giving hope to these unemployed and semi-employed people and of saying: &ldquo;We <Col N="921" /> are going to put you on relief schemes of national importance which are going to be reproductive even at the moment, and more so in the future, and we are going to treat you as citizens of the State,&rdquo; and that for the time there is not work for them, they will be automatically entitled to go back to the labour exchange until the planning machine of the Fianna Fáil Government can provide other schemes for them.</P>
    <P>That economic thinking-box we have often talked of seems to have rusted very considerably since the fine promises that were made to us of how short a time it would be until all our people would be in employment, and about sending ships to America to bring our people back.  We have not asked them to come back, but we are speaking for those of them that are here, who are unfortunate enough to be unemployed, with families dependent on them, who are undergoing a miserable existence from one end of a year to another, and who are denied the benefits of legislation passed in this House&mdash;the young men completely struck off the benefits of the Unemployment Assistance Act from June to October, the £4 valuation mark from March to October&mdash;and those of them who are left confined to a three-day or four-day week on a standard of 4/- a day.</P>
    <P>That, I suggest, is not in accordance with the wishes or views of any Deputy, and I believe that if this matter could be dealt with by an open vote, irrespective of Party, there is not a man in the House but would agree with me that the motion is modest and wise in its suggestion that the least that is due to the unemployed and the semi-employed is that they get the same standard of employment and the same number of days a week as is given by local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion.  It is often a puzzle to me to understand what really is the mentality behind what are known as minor relief schemes, and I should like to get an official definition of these schemes.  I have often wondered if the idea had been copied from the schemes we read <Col N="922" /> of as being put into operation by the British Government during the famine times here.  Certain schemes were set on foot at those times, not to serve any useful purpose to the community, but ostensibly to relieve distress.  Now we are told that something similar is the idea underlying minor relief schemes, that they are not so much for any useful public service, but in order to relieve distress.  Let us take it then that the underlying purpose is to relieve distress, and let us examine how distress is relieved by these schemes. At present a man with a wife and five children gets a maximum unemployment assistance of 14/- a week.  Under the minor relief scheme system, that man would be entitled to four days' work a week at 4/6 a day, making 18/- a week.</P>
      <P>You have, of course, to take into account that that means working four days a week without a break, and without taking into consideration the vagaries of the weather or other circumstances which may put a man off for one or two of those days.  Even with four days a week, he gets 18/- and this is a scheme which is to relieve distress.  The sum of 14/- is increased by 4/- and that is to keep a man, his wife and five children, I take it, in decent health.  That is putting a very low value on human life and that is why I have often thought that there is some analogy between these schemes and the schemes that were put into operation during the famine periods by the British Government.</P>

    <P>What I suggest is that there is also a device entangled in these minor relief schemes to relieve the Unemployment Assistance Fund of a certain amount, because 14/- a week is given to the unemployed man with a wife and five, or more, children and a maximum of 18/- given to that same man on these schemes, and we are told that the people who have first claim on those schemes are the people who are drawing the largest amount of unemployment assistance.  That is a fact, and I have the idea that the reason for it is to relieve the Unemployment Assistance Fund of the amount they get, and that the whole thing is conceived without any regard for what we prate about <Col N="923" /> so much, Christian principles.  This motion demands that, at least, the county council rate should be paid on these minor relief schemes and that six days a week be the amount of the work given.  We may be told that there is not enough money to go round, but I think that argument will scarcely hold when we remember that last week we had millions talked about here for the defence of the people of the country. As Deputy Keyes has rightly said, the greatest enemy we have is the enemy within&mdash;unemployment, misery and starvation and all the things that arise from unemployment.  That is the enemy I think we should seriously set about tackling here.</P>
    <P>In my constituency there is a good deal of unrest because of these schemes. Not very long ago we had an example of that in Little Island where men were put to work on one of these schemes, and they demanded the county council rate of pay, which was refused to them. They then asked for at least a week's work in rotation, and that again was refused to them.  Those men were working side by side with county council workers, and yet their demands were refused.  It was not that they refused to work in the sense of not wanting work&mdash;they wanted to work&mdash; but there was not a sufficient inducement for them to work.  They were prepared to work for the 27/- a week, but as a result of their action they were struck off the unemployment assistance fund.  The case was brought up before the court of referees, at which I was present.  The deputy surveyor was brought there, and he told me that he could have put those men on for a week but that the regulations did not allow him to tell them that they had a week's work.  I should like to know why these regulations stipulate that a man must have so many days' work, even though the men only have two or three days in the week to work.  At any rate, the result in that case was that, after careful inquiries and the argument that was put up&mdash;an argument that, I think, was put up with justice&mdash;it was ascertained that these men did not refuse the work as work: they were willing and anxious for work, but they did not want to work under the conditions I <Col N="924" /> have described.  In my opinion that was a legitimate reason.  It must be remembered that side by side with these men were county council workers in regular employment receiving 35/- a week and having continuous employment for the six days of the week, whereas the men to whom I refer were only offered three or four days' work in the week and were refused unemployment assistance on the ground that the scheme concerned was a minor relief scheme.  One of these men was a man with a wife and seven children, and I think that a number of weeks elapsed before he got any assistance of any kind.  Yet we hear all this talk about Christian principles and about the unemployed.</P>
    <P>Then, again, we had a case recently in Ballintemple, where men were employed&mdash;I do not think that this was a minor relief scheme&mdash;on breaking stones, and they were supposed to break so many loads of stones in a certain number of days.  These unfortunate young men were not able to break the stones within the specified period, and they had to work extra time in order to complete the number of loads that would entitle them to benefit. These are some of the things that arise in connection with these minor relief schemes.  We had other cases in my own constituency showing that there is general unrest with regard to the way these minor relief schemes are being operated, and with regard to the regulations governing them, and I think it is about time that this very modest demand in regard to minor relief schemes should be put into operation by the Government.  Now, Sir, underlying all this, there is the principle, as Deputy Keyes has pointed out, that employment should be found for the army of unemployed we have at present.  Undoubtedly, there is a definite segregation of the unemployed people of this country.  Means should be provided to get work for the unemployed&mdash;to enable these people to keep body and soul together.  There is no definite plan with regard to the relief of unemployment in this State.  Despite all the promises we got, and despite all the hopes that were held out to us for a number of years by the present <Col N="925" /> Government, to the effect that they had a plan to abolish unemployment, there seems to be no end to this state of affairs.  We were told by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance that the rotational schemes had come to stay.  Well, I hope that he will at least take into consideration the terms of this motion, and that something approaching a regular standard wage, as laid down by the local councils or the local authority, will be put into operation with regard to these things.</P>
    <P>As I have said, there is a number of these schemes of which, I am sure, the Parliamentary Secretary has got word in which there is unrest, and I am equally sure that he has got word of what has happened in regard to some of these schemes.  Undoubtedly, there are causes for unrest in connection with these schemes.  The Parliamentary Secretary, I believe, has investigated the causes of the unrest with regard to some of these schemes, and I am sure he will agree that the causes of the unrest are such as I have outlined.  It is my belief that the remedy for that unrest is what is outlined in this motion.  There is no reason why this motion should not be implemented in connection with those schemes, many of which are useful, and there is no reason why these schemes should not be able to bear the same rate of wages for the workers employed on them as are given to the county council workers in the same district, or why a full week's work should not be given to men employed on those schemes.  For that reason, I strongly support the motion.</P>
    <P>I think it is a very reasonable demand on behalf of a big section of the people of this country.  We do not want to see that section of the people of this country segregated and alienated from the rest of their fellow-citizens. We want to see them fully employed, and, on behalf of the community in general, we want to see the services of these people fully utilised. The work is there and the schemes are there, and there should be full employment on these schemes for every man who is able and willing to work, and if the people who thought out those schemes originally would also think of schemes that would employ usefully <Col N="926" /> the people of this country who are able and willing to work, then the present Government would have something to their credit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this motion deals with one of the biggest problems before this nation at the present moment, which is the providing of employment for the entire population of this country.  I think it is rather a pity that this motion was not more definitely worded.  The first duty of a a Government should be to provide work for its citizens, and to see that the least possible number of its citizens, and particularly the younger people, should be forced to suffer the humiliation of being registered as unemployed.</P>
      <P>In order to achieve the object of providing work for the entire population, it should be the duty of the Government to plan works of national importance on national lines.  Now, as far as minor relief schemes are concerned, we are told that they are devised solely to relieve unemployment and that they are designed or devised to meet local conditions &mdash;that is, in accordance with the number of people who happen to be on the local register in each district. You cannot plan a solution of the unemployment problem, or you cannot plan national economic development on such lines.  If the big question of reducing the number of people now on the register of unemployed is to be tackled by the Government, it must be tackled on different lines.  You must have a national scheme and a big scheme of development which will absorb at least the majority of those now on the register.  First of all, you must have a scheme of development in the agricultural industry which will enable that industry to expand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>We can do very little, because the main point in connection with unemployment is that in providing employment we have to take into consideration the general rate of wages prevailing throughout the country, particularly in the agricultural industry.  Now, if you are to provide work on minor relief schemes at a higher rate of wages than prevails in the agricultural industry, and that is what is implied in this motion, you will completely upset the agricultural industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>You will also upset the working of the county councils.  We must remember that the county councils when employing men on the roads select the men whom they employ. They take steps to employ men who have some experience or knowledge of road maintenance work, some definite standard of efficiency.  If a worker proves unsatisfactory, the county surveyor or the official of the county council has no means of securing an efficient worker except by dismissing that man from his employment.  If you have the same rate of wages prevailing on minor relief schemes as for county council employees, then there is no means by which the county councils can secure higher efficiency amongst their employees.  Therefore, the whole scheme of road maintenance and the whole scheme of employment in the agricultural industry completely would be upset if this motion were given effect to.  The motion proposes to <Col N="928" /> increase the rate of a wages on minor relief schemes to a higher rate than the wages in the agricultural industry and to the same rate as the wages prevailing amongst the employees of county councils.  Obviously, such a motion would completely upset all employment, both under the county councils and in the agricultural industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion is, however, a very desirable one, because it directs attention to the immediate need of reducing the number of people on the unemployed register.  It cannot be contended that all the workers at present on that register are not efficient in some branch of work.  Therefore, does it not stand to reason that the first aim of the Government should be to reduce the number of people on the unemployment register by seeing that they secure permanent remunerative employment.  So far as the question of whole-time employment is concerned, I am in entire agreement with the motion.  I hold that no worker should be compelled to work part-time or short-time, and that every worker is entitled to a full week's employment. I do not agree with the speaker who suggested that the State is doing its duty to the workers if it provides them with maintenance in lieu of work.  No rate of maintenance is a satisfactory alternative to full-time employment, because full-time employment is not only advantageous to the nation but it is advantageous to the individual. Having regard to the fact that we can find money for grandiose armament schemes modelled upon schemes adopted by militaristic nations on the Continent; that we can find money for a useless scheme of revaluation; that we can find money for increasing the salaries of Ministers and Deputies; having regard to the fact that money can be found for everything, why is it not possible to find money for works of national development which will give full-time employment to every man able and willing to work?  I ask the Government not to be misled by the fact that it is suggested that there is not sufficient money available to provide full-time employment for workers.  Money is available and money can be made available for useful work, because useful work is money in itself; it is wealth. <Col N="929" /> Useful work will increase the wealth of the nation; it will increase the productive capacity of the nation.  There is unlimited scope for useful work in this nation in the improvement of our land, afforestation schemes, drainage schemes, etc., and all this work can be done if it is planned on a national basis and the necessary money is made available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I prefer to go on now. I have been asked to do certain things. Now every single thing in connection with this motion has been present to our minds.  This question has been examined in every possible way, and put forward by every possible person. But a great deal more information has been laid at our disposal in connection with this problem than the whirling words the Deputy is likely to put before us.  What I am prepared to do is to meet the convenience of the House and, so far as I can by an objective examination of this motion, to help all Parties.</P>
      <P>The first part of the motion proposes that the rate of wages paid on minor relief schemes&mdash;now more generally called minor employment schemes&mdash; should be not less than the rate payable in the district by the county council. The rate at present paid on minor relief schemes is 4/6 per day or 27/- per week, while the rate paid by the county councils to their road workers varies from 28/- to 37/6, per week.  A higher rate is paid to road workers in County Dublin, but no minor employment schemes are carried out in that county. There are actually ten different rates in operation in different parts of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="930" /> The definite policy of the Government since 1932 has been to pay for each class of employment scheme financed from the Employment Schemes Vote the same rate of wages as are paid for analogous work in the same district; and the only condition, in relation to the rates of wages attached to the grants is that local authorities should not pay a higher rate than that paid on their own works of the same kind.  Again employment schemes which are carried out by contract are subject to the fair wages clause which is usual in contracts for ordinary works of the same kind.</P>
    <P>From this it should be clear that the spirit and intention of the Government's policy to pay the same rate of wages on employment schemes as are paid on normal works of the same kind, are, in fact, being carried out in all cases in which a clear and unmistakable analogy is to be found for the type of employment scheme which is being undertaken.  It is also undoubtedly the intention in the class of works known as minor employment schemes to fix the rate of wages on the same principle.</P>
    <P>The question has often been discussed whether the rates of wages paid on works provided specifically for the relief of unemployment should be less than the rates paid for similar classes of work in normal circumstances.  That is quite common in many countries of the world but that is not the principle here.</P>
    <P>The issue which is raised by the first part of the motion is clearly, therefore, whether or not minor employment schemes should for the purpose of fixing the rates of wages to be paid the workmen engaged in them, be regarded as analogous to road works carried out by the county council.</P>
    <P>The term minor employment scheme is used to describe the following classes of work: (a) the construction and repair of accommodation roads to the houses and lands of land-holders; (b) the construction and repair of roads to open up turbary; (c) drains and embankments.  The works are carried out exclusively in rural areas; where roads are undertaken they are never public roads maintained by a <Col N="931" /> county council and in all cases the work can be shown to be directly or indirectly for the improvement of agricultural lands or for the benefit of those engaged in agriculture.</P>
    <P>As you know some years ago&mdash;I think it was the year before last&mdash;a series of questions in relation to this matter were subjected to a court of law&mdash;the question of whether or not, in fact, minor relief works were not that class of major agricultural work.  That was submitted to a judicial decision.  We collected a dozen typical cases for the purpose of submission to the judgment of the court.  The judgment of the court was:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I may say, generally speaking, that each portion of this (minor employment) scheme is of a local character in which work is to be done upon farms or for the accommodation of the farms of particular holdings of agricultural land, and I am satisfied that in every instance, if the work were not being done by the Board of Works and if the owner had undertaken it himself, or if a group of owners had combined to carry it out co-operatively, it would have been regarded as work of an agricultural character.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary mind if I ask him a question at this stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I think on the whole it is wiser not.  Mr. Justice Johnston in his judgment in the High Court on the 8th April, 1938, is the authority for this judgment that such workers were engaged in work of an agricultural character and were not, in fact, insurable under the Unemployment Insurance Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to 1932 the Land Commission administered the relief allocations that were made from time to time for works in rural areas; and it is true to say that there was no difference then, nor is there now, either in kind or in purpose, between the works done as employment schemes and the ordinary works carried out by the Land Commission in their land settlement schemes.  The main considerations in the matters are that the two types of <Col N="932" /> work are carried out exclusively in rural areas; the same classes of people are employed and the object of both is much the same, namely, the improvement, in one way or another, of conditions in agricultural areas.  The rate of wages paid on minor employment schemes is the same as that paid by the Land Commission for similar work.</P>
    <P>Again, minor employment schemes are specially provided for the relief of unemployment amongst agricultural labourers, owners of uneconomic holdings, and their relatives working on the land; and the great majority of the workers engaged do actually belong to these classes.  It is, of course, true that road labourers and other workers who are better paid in their normal occupations than agricultural labourers, often work on minor employment schemes; but there are many similar cases in other types of employment schemes, as when skilled workmen are given employment as unskilled labourers; and the phenomenon of workers who cannot find employment in their own occupations taking work of a different kind at a lesser rate of wages is often met with in cases outside the sphere of employment schemes.  It may be argued that road work, as such, is common to both county council work and minor employment schemes; but a certain amount of road work must also be done by farmers and their labourers; and, again, road work is only one of a number of kinds of work done under minor employment schemes.</P>
    <P>It is, in these circumstances and for the reasons set out, that the rate of wages paid on minor employment schemes is related to the rates paid to agricultural labourers; and in this regard it may be pointed out that when the minimum rate for certain classes of agricultural labourers was some time ago raised from 24/- to 27/- per week in all parts of Éire except certain districts around Dublin, a similar increase was simultaneously given to workers engaged on minor employment schemes.  For workers of 20 years and upwards, and for a 54-hour week, the minimum agricultural rate has been fixed at 27/-, except in certain districts <Col N="933" /> around Dublin.  The minimum rate for any week in which less than 54 hours are worked is 6d. per hour, or 24/- for a 48-hour week, and this is only for workers of 20 years and upwards.  When the age is from 19-20, the minimum rate is 21/4 per week for a 48-hour week&mdash; this is the agricultural wage&mdash;and 18/8 when the age is below 19.  On minor employment schemes, however, the rate paid is 4/6 a day, or at the rate of 27/- per week, for all workers including large numbers under the age of 20.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>For how many days in the week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to that later.  The rate paid is 4/6 a day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>You are comparing that with a full week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>And the number of hours' work is limited to eight per day, or such lesser number as may coincide with the hours of daylight during the winter. It will be understood, of course, that it would scarcely be possible to fix varying rates of wages for minor employment schemes in different counties and districts to meet the varying rates of agricultural wages paid, and a uniform rate must, therefore, be applied, whatever it is.  It may be stated that a return made some time after the increase of the minimum agricultural rates in May last, shows that the average rate now paid to agricultural workers is 27/- per week, and it is reasonable to assume that in the majority of cases, where a higher rate than 27/- is paid, the workers are picked men, with long experience and service.  The question of a higher rate in those districts around Dublin in which the minimum agricultural rate exceeds 27/-, does not arise, since no minor employment schemes are carried out in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To sum up: the rate of wages paid on minor employment schemes is related to the rates paid to agricultural labourers, for the reasons (a) the schemes are provided primarily to relieve unemployment amongst agricultural labourers and the workers on uneconomic holdings; and the great majority of the workers are, in fact, recruited from these classes; (b) the <Col N="934" /> work done is for the improvement of agricultural lands; (c) it is strictly analogous to the estate improvements works carried out by the Land Commission, and the same rate of wages is paid for minor employment schemes as for the Land Commission estate improvements works.</P>
    <P>The second part of the motion proposes that workers on minor employment schemes should be guaranteed six days' continuous employment in each week during which they are so employed. At present the available amount of work on employment schemes is distributed amongst the largest possible number of unemployed persons by means of a rotational or part-time system of work, under which a worker receives three, four or five days' employment per week, according to the scale of unemployment assistance to which he would be entitled if unemployed, and to the rate of wages paid on the work.  This system of rotation is used not only on minor employment schemes, but on all other employment schemes to which it can be made applicable.</P>
    <P>It should be pointed out that the sums provided in any financial year for (a) unemployment assistance, and (b) special employment schemes for the relief of unemployment and distress, are, in a sense, complementary to each other, and that together they may be regarded as a joint fund which represents the direct provision which the State, having regard to the requirements of other necessary services, can afford to make in any year, for the relief of unemployment and distress among able-bodied persons.  When the total amount which is available for these two services has been fixed, an estimate is made in advance of the savings in unemployment assistance which will be effected by reason of the operation of the employment schemes, and the amount represented by this saving is added to the amount available for the provision of employment schemes.  From this it should be clear that the two votes are, to all intents and purposes, interdependent, and that the amount made available for the provision of employment schemes already includes the estimated saving <Col N="935" /> in respect of unemployment assistance payments.</P>
    <P>It is wrong, therefore, to suggest, as has often been done, that the principle of rotational or part-time employment is merely a device to save unemployment assistance payments.  There is no possible way in which you can employ people which will save the Treasury any money under the head of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>For the current financial year a sum of £1,160,000 has been provided for unemployment assistance payments, and provision is being made for an employment schemes programme representing an expenditure of more than £2,000,000, of which £1,500,000 is provided by the Oireachtas, and the balance by local authorities.  The issue which is raised by the motion is, really, whether the employment provided by the expenditure of more than £2,000,000 on employment schemes should be confined to a limited number of workers, each having full-time employment, or whether the benefit should be distributed over the greatest possible number of workers by giving to each of them part-time employment in proportion to the degree of necessitousness as compared with that of other workers.</P>
    <P>As is well known, the Unemployment Assistance Acts are based on the principle that the weekly payment made to each eligible unemployed person should be proportionate to the degree of his need, as measured by reference to the number of his dependants, and adjusted in respect of any means of which he may be possessed; and, this being so, it is difficult to resist the inference that the distribution, as between individual workmen, of the sum provided by the State for employment schemes should be governed by the same general principle of graduated benefits.  This, in effect, is the principal justification of rotational or part-time employment on employment schemes.  For example, the Unemployment Assistance Acts provide that an eligible unemployed workman with dependent wife and five or more other dependants, shall, other things being equal, receive a weekly payment more than double that given to a single man with no dependants; and considering the interdependence of the <Col N="936" /> two separate votes for the relief of unemployment, and their common purpose, there seems to be no reason why, to the extent to which it is possible in practice, a similar differentiation should not be made with regard to the wages earned on employment schemes. It is only by doing so that the benefits of the moneys provided for employment schemes can be distributed over the largest possible number of necessitous workmen, and in proportion to their individual needs.</P>
    <P>The basis of the rotational system at present in use is that each unskilled workman receives such number of days' employment each week during the term of his employment as represents a reasonable percentage in excess of the value of unemployment assistance to which he would be entitled in the corresponding period if he were unemployed.  The following are examples of various scales of unemployment assistance and the corresponding number of days' work given to workmen on minor employment schemes on which the rate of wages for unskilled workers is 4/6 per day:&mdash; Unemployment Assistance Scale&mdash;not exceeding 9/6, three days' work per week; from 10/- to 13/- inclusive, four days' work per week; exceeding 13/-, five days' work per week.</P>
    <P>If broken weather intervenes to render it impossible for a workman to work in any week the full number of days to which his scale of unemployment assistance entitles him, he receives in the following week or weeks one additional day's employment for each day so lost, so far as this may be possible in practice.</P>
    <P>Rotational or part-time employment applies usually only to unskilled workers.  The advantage of the rotational method of employment on special employment schemes, as compared with full-time employment, is that it distributes the benefits over the largest possible number of workmen, and preserves the principle embodied in the Unemployment Assistance Acts of adjusting the amount of State relief to the degree of necessitousness of the individual workman.  Full-time employment means the same provision for a married man having six dependants as <Col N="937" /> for a single man without dependants at all.  Rotational employment permits of a certain degree of differentiation being made.</P>
    <P>Under the system of rotation at present in use on employment schemes a workman earns in many cases from two to three times as much by way of wages as he would receive in unemployment assistance payments.  That is markedly so in relation to the whole of the poorer districts in the West of Ireland.  For this reason it is clear that even when working on a part-time rotation workmen are placed in a privileged position as compared with less fortunate unemployed persons who continue to draw unemployment assistance. Full-time employment on employment schemes would carry the process of discrimination still farther and emphasise still more the disparity of treatment by concentrating in the hands of a still more limited number of workmen all the benefits of the employment schemes votes.  Numerous alternatives to the system of rotational employment at present in use have been proposed.  First of all, there is the suggestion of full-time employment all the year round for the unemployed on the register.  This would be desirable, no doubt, if it were practicable, but the cost of a scheme of this kind would probably run into many millions per annum.</P>

      <P>The Deputy may think that is easy, but you would have to work out in actual detail the whole of the scheme for all the different districts which all the people could get to, schemes made up of public health works, minor relief works, sewerage works and so on, in which the actual factor of the cost of the work relative to the wages varies from two to ten or twelve, and nothing but an absolutely complete survey of that kind would enable you to get an accurate figure.

      <P>One moment.  I cannot answer every Deputy at once.  I am trying to answer Deputy Morrissey. My feeling is that I would certainly regard myself as requiring £12,500,000 to do the second year of the work, and I would regard that as a figure which would be rising in amount every year, due to the difficulty of fitting in the schemes.  We are at the present moment actually in the position of envisaging the running out of schemes of a practical character in the urban districts inside a couple of years.  I mean schemes with which we are familiar.  We all know we are doing certain schemes and we would rather find better schemes to do.  There is no question about that.</P>
      <P>Anyone who thinks there is an unlimited pool of employment schemes on which men can be employed, in which there is going to be a large labour content, in which there is going to be a large proportion of the money to be given to labour, is entirely mistaken.  Every year as we go on we are going to find it more and more difficult to get schemes, and we are going to find that the lower proportion of the total  of money spent is going to labour, simply due to the exhaustion of the obviously easy and economic schemes.  I appeal to the House; if anyone can devise any addition to the series of schemes which we have at our disposal, in relation to his own district or in general and which he will corelate with the people disemployed in that district, and submit it to me, I shall be deeply grateful.</P>

      <P>Another alternative is in relation to full-time employment in respect of whatever sum is made available <Col N="940" /> for employment schemes.  This would reduce the number of workmen benefiting by the schemes to a little more than one half of those who are employed under the present system of rotation, and would increase the disparity of treatment between those employed and those who remain on the register.  Under the present system of rotation as many as 45,000 workmen are simultaneously employed during the winter months, but if full-time employment were to be given, it would have the effect of excluding some 20,000 of these workmen from participation.  The third alternative is a species of rotation by which workmen would be employed full-time for alternate weeks or fortnights, and would be entitled to unemployment assistance payment in the weeks or fortnights during which they were not working.  I am glad to note that Deputy Keyes, in opening, did say quite clearly that there is no longer a contest on the question of rotation, as such.</P>

      <P>Now we are going to deal with this point.  This has the disadvantages referred to in the previous case, but in a much lesser degree, of course.  It would mean the employment <Col N="941" /> of a somewhat smaller number of workmen, for the reason that it would entail increased payment of unemployment assistance, the amount of which would reduce the sum available for employment schemes.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not save the State one penny, and it would not cost the State one penny.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The motive is discounted from the beginning, because we make up the amount for the Minister for Finance, showing how much money the operation of these schemes has saved, and that money is transferred from the estimated unemployment assistance figure to the employment schemes figure, and therefore the whole of the sum saved, whatever the amount of it, is discounted from the very beginning. The policy of the Government is to expend as much as possible of the joint provision for unemployment assistance and employment schemes on the provision of suitable work rather than on unemployment assistance.  The object is to convert as much of the total fund as is made up of unemployment assistance plus relief scheme expenditure into wages as distinct from unemployment assistance, and that, I think, has the consent of the whole House.  That is the policy, and this other proposal is going to change that.  It is going to increase the proportion of the total sum that is paid on unemployment assistance, and it is going to decrease the amount of money that is paid upon schemes for the relief of unemployment.</P>

      <P>Furthermore, it should be stated that there has always been a well founded objection to providing full time employment on relief schemes at the same rates of wages as are paid for the same work when carried out in normal circumstances for the reason that agricultural workers might be attracted by the shorter hours and leave their normal employments.  Our experience, when we were paying 24/- a week on minor relief schemes, was that the agricultural labourers did in fact desert their ordinary employment.</P>

      <P>What has been our experience of the people working on minor relief schemes?  Their only complaint is that they do not get enough work. The complaint we normally get is one of not being able to get on these schemes.  The total number of complaints we get of the kind and order put forward here to-night is negligible. The complaints we get are complaints of not having an opportunity of participating in these schemes, and complaints that certain people have been employed who were not on the unemployment assistance register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have allegations that certain people have had a preference, that they were on before, or more often than, their proper time, but the number of complaints we get in relation to the matters raised here is negligible.  We have had demands to have these works extended to places to which we cannot extend them.  At the present moment, <Col N="946" /> we are operating in 1,700 or 1,800 of the 3,000 electoral areas in Ireland.  A great many of those are covered merely by minor relief schemes, and the agitation we have is to extend these schemes into other areas in which there are not any.  The amount of complaint we get from men employed on these schemes is quite negligible.</P>
    <P>Let us take the areas of the Deputies who have moved this motion&mdash;Deputy Davin of Leix, Deputy Keyes of Limerick, and Deputy Norton of Kildare. The proportion of minor relief schemes done in Deputy Davin's constituency&mdash;and Deputy Davin is an authority on these schemes&mdash;is .86 of 1 per cent.  The proportion of minor relief schemes done in the constituency of Deputy Keyes&mdash;another authority on the operation of these schemes&mdash;is 3.34 per cent.  In Deputy Norton's constituency the figure is 1¼ per cent.  That is to say, less than one-twentieth of the total.  In fact, the whole Labour Party have not got representatives in more than one-eighth of the territory.  Certain places have had a very large experience of the operation of minor relief schemes.  Take a place like Donegal North, where there are 4,500 men employed on minor relief schemes.</P>

      <P>At the present moment, we are trying to keep them on for about four or five months&mdash;over the winter. The period has been much extended compared with what it previously was, but that is much more possible in those districts than it is in the other districts.</P>

      <P>Four or five months, over the winter.  The aim is to employ two-thirds of the total on the unemployment register over that period of time. Sometimes, the same men are employed on a minor relief scheme and on a roads <Col N="947" /> rural scheme.  We have had no difficulty in the transfer of men from one scheme to the other.  We have experience of the two schemes going on side by side, and there has been no friction, and no cause of complaint.  Take Galway West.  There are 3,000 men employed on these schemes there, and we have no complaint from Galway.</P>

      <P>Why should you?  It is a question of rotation or starvation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, they have no complaint against rotation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the alternative is starvation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether the scheme is rotational or otherwise, the total amount of money to be spent is the same.  Whether we rotate or do not rotate, we have the same amount of money, and we can give them only the same amount of money.  Therefore, the alternative is not between rotation and starvation, but between the Dáil voting this amount of money and voting a larger amount.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="HughVFlinn" hpid="Mr. Flinn Mr. Flinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are getting off the point.  It is not a question of rotation or starvation, because, whether we rotate or not, we have only the same amount of money to give to the individual. You have places like Sligo, with a large number of people on these schemes.  You have Clare, with a considerable number similarly employed. You have Kerry and Donegal.  Where is the complaint from them?  In those districts you are dealing very largely with people who are small holders.  The scheme of three days a week is better for them than a scheme of continuous employment, and they prefer it.  I have <Col N="948" /> actually got into trouble on the suggestion that, in the Aran Islands, I was destroying the system of agriculture because I was employing too many people too long and it was interfering with their work.  Let Deputies not laugh.  That complaint came from a Bishop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>They could have gone off and attended to their work.  On investigation we found that, due to the excellent organisation of the employment scheme, there was no cause of complaint whatever on that score.  I have gone into these matters as fully as I can in this debate, and I have no doubt that I shall have another opportunity of doing so.  I cannot possibly deal now with the answers to all the questions.  I have given you the experience we have had.  That is, that there is no measure of discontent in relation to the rotation system amongst the vast majority of those employed under it; that under it the State is getting good work, and that, if we had more money, the decision would not be to abandon rotation but to increase the number of days in each week to be given to each man under rotation.</P>
