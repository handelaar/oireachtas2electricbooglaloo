    <P>Any person who uses lime, spurge, or any narcotic, irritant or poisonous substance, or any explosive, for the purpose of injury to or destruction of fish in the freshwater portion of any river or in any lake shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not exceeding £25 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding 12 months.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 69 (a):&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 13, lines 38 and 39, to delete the words &ldquo;the freshwater portion of any river or in any lake&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;any river, lake or estuary, whether the same be a public or a private fishery, or in any part of the sea&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to extend to tidal as well as to fresh waters the provisions with regard to poisoning, etc.  I think that is the object which Deputy Lynch had in view.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 70 not moved.</P>
      <P>Section 26, as amended, ordered to stand part of the Bill.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 27.</P>
      <P>(1)  Notwithstanding anything contained in any Act or any bye-law, the whole of the month of October shall, in respect of every river and fishery district, be included in and form part of the close season for angling for salmon or trout with single rod and line.</P>
      <P>(2)  No power now subsisting under any Act of altering a close season shall extend to or authorise the excluding of the month of October or any part thereof from the close season in respect of any river or fishery district for angling for salmon or trout with single rod and line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 71:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete sub-section (1) and substitute the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1)  The period commencing on the 13th day of October and ending on the 31st day of that month shall, in respect of every river and fishery district, be included in and form part of the close season for angling for <Col N="1333" /> salmon or trout with single rod or line, but the foregoing provision of this sub-section shall be without prejudice to the operation of any statutory instrument made under the Fisheries Act and in force at the commencement of this section whereby the said close season includes a greater portion of the said month of October.</P>
    <P>There were some representations with regard to the month of October, principally from Deputy Fred Crowley.  He thought that it would be rather drastic to deprive fishermen or rodmen in County Kerry of the whole month of October, and this amendment is proposed as a compromise.  We propose to give them up to the 12th October. There are three or four other amendments which suggest other dates, but I think that the 12th of October might be generally acceptable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Deputy O'Neill, I move amendment No. 78:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 28 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding anything contained in the Fisheries (Ireland) Act, 1850, and/or the Salmon Fishery (Ireland) Act, 1863, the weekly close season shall be between six of the clock on Saturday evening and six of the clock on Monday morning; and it shall not be lawful in the sea or any estuaries or tideways to take, kill, or fish for any salmon by any form of weir or net whatsoever between the hours herein set out.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Neill asked me to move this amendment on his behalf.  I told him that I rather thought myself that it was a matter that might be settled by bye-law but I am not so sure about that at all.  The object is to curtail the weekly close season.  I do not know the case that might be made in Deputy O'Neill's area for this amendment.  In other areas I suppose the fishermen could also put up a case for it but it is a case that, as regards most areas, I am perfectly certain that, if I were Minister, I would not accept.  That is a rather half-hearted support of the amendment, I know, but I am carrying out my obligation by moving it and I want to make my own position in the matter clear.  I think I was myself responsible for extending the weekly close season from 24 to 48 hours and I do not want to make myself appear foolish by trying to curtail it to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the proposal contained in Deputy O'Neill's amendment. There are several fishermen in <Col N="1335" /> that particular area who have restrictions imposed upon them that do not exist in other areas.  They fish with a rather short net of about 200 yards and when there is a turn on it, it is not possible to catch very many fish.  I think in this case the Minister might extend the privilege asked for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The 48-hour week-end close season was fixed by law and under the existing law it cannot be varied by bye-law.  I think the case that would be made by Deputy O'Neill would be similar to that just made by Deputy Brasier, that the fishermen have had a bad time.  They have had a bad time because the salmon are not there and the object of extending the week-end close season was to allow more salmon to come up.  I think it would be a very short-sighted policy to shorten the close season.  It might, perhaps, be a little better in the next year or two, but eventually it would have a bad effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not consider the fact that they are already labouring under such severe handicaps that salmon are allowed up?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That matter with regard to the length of the net is fixed by a bye-law.  It is fixed having regard to the conditions in the area.  The conformation of the river, etc., has to be taken into account.  With regard to the weekly close season, I think we should leave it as it is.</P>

      <P>At the end of the section to insert the following sub-section&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Where&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  an offence under Section 46 of the Fisheries (Ireland) Act, 1850, has been committed in relation to any fishery by a person in the employment or under the control of the owner or occupier of such fishery; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1336" /> (b)  such owner or occupier is, by virtue of the immediately preceding sub-section, charged with such offence,</P>
    <P>it shall be a good defence for such owner or occupier to prove&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  in case the offence is based on failure to do any act required to be done by the said Section 46, that he used due diligence to ensure that the said act was done and that such failure was not occasioned by his directions or wilful default,</P>
    <P>(ii)  in case the offence is based on the commission of any act prohibited by the said Section 46, that he used due diligence to prevent such commission, and that the said act was done without his consent, connivance, or wilful default, and</P>
    <P>(iii)  in every case, that on being charged with the offence, he gave to the person charging him all information in his power with respect to the person who (as the case may be) failed to do any act required to be done by the said Section 46, or did any act prohibited by the said Section 46.</P>
    <P>It was more or less agreed on the Second Reading that an amendment of this kind should be brought in so as to cover the employer.</P>

      <Col N="1337" /> (2)  Where a notice has been served under sub-section (1) of this section on the occupier of a fishing weir, and such occupier has not complied with the requirements of such notice, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  such occupier shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not less than fifty pounds or more than one hundred pounds,</P>
    <P>(b)  the Minister may, (whether proceedings have or have not been taken against such occupier under paragraph (a) of this sub-section) by himself, his officers or any other person enter on such fishing weir and any land adjoining such fishing weir and construct a free gap in such weir.</P>

      <P>(2)  Where a notice has been served under sub-section (1) of this section on the occupier of a fishing weir, such occupier may, within one month after the service of such notice, apply to the judge of the Circuit Court within whose jurisdiction such fishing weir is situate for any order quashing such notice on the ground that there is already in such fishing weir a free gap constructed in accordance with Section 9 of the Salmon Fishery (Ireland) Act, 1863, and thereupon the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  such occupier shall give notice to the Minister of the application;</P>

    <P>(d)  if such judge is not so satisfied he shall refuse the application and direct such occupier to pay to the Minister the costs of the Minister of and incidental to the application, and may also amend such notice by extending the time specified in such notice for compliance therewith;</P>

    <P>(3)  Where a notice has been served under either sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) of this section on the occupier of a dam, and such occupier has not complied with the requirements of such notice, the following provisions shall have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  such occupier shall be guilty of an offence under this section and shall be liable on summary conviction thereof to a fine not less than fifty pounds or more than one hundred pounds,</P>

    <P>(10)  In this and the next following section the word &ldquo;dam&rdquo; means any dam, weir, sluice, wall, embankment or other artificial work constructed or placed in any river for or in connection with the sustaining of water for navigation, irrigation, water supply, water power or any other purpose whatsoever.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I put amendments down practically on the same lines for Sections 29 and 30. The Minister has, I admit, met me fully on Section 29 and I want to know why he has not met me on Section 30. I think that the same case lies under <Col N="1341" /> Section 30 as under Section 29.  There is no use in the Minister's telling me that this is merely a question of facts and facts only.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, I suppose, is very innocent in matters of this kind, but I can assure him that the interpretation of the section will be a matter very much of law.  For instance, if Deputy McMenamin and myself were arguing the law on that, I think the Minister would have to be pretty slick to find his facts in the confusion we could create.  It is almost impossible for anyone to say in most of these cases what is law and what is fact.  The law reports are full of cases, especially those which would come under Section 29, I admit, where law and fact are almost inextricably mixed.  I think the Minister ought to reconsider this so as to provide some method of appeal.  I am taking full cognisance of his own amendment.  As a matter of fact, Deputy Dockrell, who could not be here, has asked me to move his amendment, No. 88, and that is why I want to get something from the Minister on amendment No. 87 which might ease the pressure on me, as it were, with regard to my obligation to Deputy Dockrell.  If I get some assurance that the Minister will consider something in the nature of a tribunal which would go into the question of mills or dams I will be satisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dockrell has been approached by one set of people especially&mdash;the Celbridge Development Company, Ltd. &mdash;in connection with the hardship which might arise in their case.  I got a memorandum from them too, but I will be candid and say that I had not time to study that as carefully as I should have if I thought I would have to move Deputy Dockrell's amendment, as I thought Deputy Dockrell would be here to move it.  If the Minister would give me some assurance that he would set up some method of appeal from the decision of his engineers where they would say, for instance, that a new work had the <Col N="1342" /> effect of not reducing the horsepower by more than 5 per cent., I would be satisfied.  That type of decision is very arbitrary, and I think there should be some method by which the owner would have some trustworthy person to whom he could appeal.  When all is said and done, the only satisfactory decision in such a case is the decision of a court.  As a rule, arbitration leaves everybody not quite satisfied.  The decision of a court is generally accepted.</P>

      <P>Is it not a fact that boards of conservators have the right to insist upon provision being made for the protection of fish on all such mill-races and dams?  My information is that so long as the fish are protected there is no necessity to interfere with mill-race rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>It was this particular section I had in mind when I mentioned about the gaps in the dams.  I think very great hardship is inflicted on owners of mills, who perhaps may be suffering enough already, by having to carry out works at their own expense which the Minister may insist upon.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <P>I think that under this Section 30 it is really more a case of fact.  I suppose on any section there might be some argument as to the interpretation of the law, but what I had in mind in this was that we would have a member of the Institute of Engineers who would carry out the inquiry. He would be the &ldquo;fit and proper person&rdquo; referred to in the amendment.  He would carry out the inquiry and make a report to me as to whether he was satisfied that the work was not doing more injury to the mill than is laid down in this amendment. If the Deputy wished we could have some arrangement like Section 61 or, in other words, it could be referred to the President of the Institute of Engineers or a person nominated by him.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), page 17, before line 53 to insert the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(c)  such net is a snap net, or</P>
      <P>The section makes it unlawful to use any net for the capture of fish in fresh water except with what is mentioned in sub-section (1).  If the Minister is good enough to accept the amendment it will enable fishermen on the upper reaches of the Nore to benefit.  There are at present fishing in this neighbourhood 35 men who, with their families, are dependent for a livelihood on salmon fishing.  These men, more or less, find regular employment during the season at that work.  Others depend to a considerable extent on earnings in this occupation to supplement their otherwise meagre incomes.  The quantity of fish caught by snap nets is relatively small.  In the three years, 1927, 1929 and 1931, each rod, on the average, caught 76 lbs. of fish, each snap net 941 lbs., each drag net 1,260 lbs., and each fixed engine 4,249 lbs. That is to say, snap nets account for only 13 per cent. of the total catch. Therefore, the injury done to fishing, if there is an injury, by snap nets is infinitesimal.  There is little merit in the proposal in the Bill to prohibit it, and, accordingly, I sincerely hope the Minister will see his way to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>I wish to ask the Minister to give this amendment consideration. There are about 30 families on the River Suir in a similar position to those referred to by Deputy Pattison.  They only fish in tidal water between sunrise and sunset.  That has been their occupation for generations and they look to their children being able to carry on the industry.  Anything that would deprive these people of fishing rights would be resented very much and, if the Minister cannot agree to accept this amendment, I ask him <Col N="1346" /> to give consideration to the case made for these men.</P>

      <P>As I pointed out on the Second Reading every commission on inland fisheries that sat since the beginning of the century has always unanimously recommended the abolition of netting in fresh water.  If we are to proceed to carry out that recommendation and abolish netting, we could not possibly have snap nets, because they form the great part of the netting in fresh waters.  To accept the amendment would really mean dropping the section.  I do not think that should be referred to as confiscation of rights, because they are being compensated as owners of several fisheries and owners of weirs are being compensated for any interests they may have in the business.  It would be impossible to consider the total exemption of snap nets.</P>

      <P>I do not know if the figures ought to be stressed, because I can quite foresee, if the section goes through, and the matter comes to arbitration, that it will be more than 13 per cent.  I am sure they would be able to make a case for more than 13 per cent. if they are to be compensated. I do not know what the percentage is, taking the areas all round, wherever there is netting in fresh water.  It does not take place in every area.  No recommendation was so unanimous by commissions right through as that dealing with the abolition of netting in fresh water and the abolition of snap nets.  I think if Deputies concentrated rather on getting fair compensation it would be the best thing they could do.</P>

      <P>As Deputy Broderick had to go away last night, he asked me to move this amendment.  It is in connection with the matter raised by, I think, Deputy Brasier as to extending the length of the nets.  In my own opinion, that is a matter for a by-law rather than for legislation, and I take it that if a case could be made in the area concerned, after public inquiry in the ordinary way, something might be done in that direction by a by-law, but I really think&mdash;perhaps I am wrong&mdash;that it must be a matter for a by-law.</P>

      <P>In this particular case it is a long-standing grievance of the fishermen, and it unquestionably must be apparent to the Minister that if fishermen were limited to a length of 200 yards, the amount of fish available for these men would be very small.  I suggest that this is a matter for legislation or for some interference by the Minister in order to get justice for these men.  Naturally where you have men of a certain type on a board of conservators and who dominate the board, they are merciless in their attitude to the net fishermen, and it is in this particular direction that the fishermen find their hardest grievances. The Minister must be aware that, even out in the open sea, where they are near an estuary, it would be impossible, under those conditions, for these men to make a living.</P>

We do not fix in any of the Acts what the length of a net may be in any area.  That is fixed by by-law, as Deputy Lynch said, after an inquiry.  An inquiry could be held to see if a reasonable case could be put up, but I suggest that it would be a new principle entirely to have the length of the net dealt with in an Act of Parliament.</P>

      <P>I raised this matter on the Second Reading.  I cannot see why you should have the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in one case and the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in the other.  In sub-section (2) it says that an application may be made to a district justice and that the justice, on being satisfied that such person is a fit and proper person, shall grant a certificate, whereas in the other case the word used is &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  Now, when the particular person who is looking for this licence has gone to all the trouble that he has to go to in order to get this certificate from the district justice, including the cost of getting a solicitor to appear for him and say what a grand fellow he is, he produces that certificate to the board of conservators and, according to this, they may grant him a licence.  If you impose an obligation in the one case you ought to impose it in the other.  I see one difficulty and that is that probably the Minister has in mind some limitation of the principle, but I think that if a man thinks it worth his while to go to the trouble of getting a certificate from the district justice, it ought to be automatic that the conservators should be compelled to grant this licence.</P>

      <P>Well, this is really a matter of legal wording, but first of all I should like to say that this section follows the corresponding section of the 1925 Act, Section 17.  The word &ldquo;may&rdquo; means &ldquo;shall&rdquo;; but the issue of the licence being conditional upon the prior fulfilment by the applicant of the specified conditions, the use of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is correct in drafting practice.  That is the legal wording to which I have referred. However, the Deputy should also look up Section 17 of the Act of 1925, and he will see that practically the same words are used there.  He has probably forgotten that, but I am quite sure that at the time he was quite aware of that legal point I have just quoted.

      <P>In sub-section (4), page 23, lines 6 and 7, to delete all words in brackets after the word &ldquo;particulars.&rdquo; line 5, down to the word &ldquo;of,&rdquo; line 7.</P>
      <P>A duty is placed on every holder of an export licence for the export of salmon and trout to enter certain prescribed particulars relating to the transactions carried on in his premises in a book kept for the purpose, but it is specifically stated in the sub-section that he shall not be required to keep a record of the price received for the salmon and trout exported.  The object of the amendment is to delete the words in parentheses which exempt the exporter from keeping this record of prices.  It is not clear why there should be this prohibition against the keeping of a record of the price received by the exporter for the salmon or trout.  Under our amendment, we make it possible for the exporter to do so when the need arises.  It is difficult to know why the words are in the section at all.</P>

      <P>As I said on the Second Reading of the Bill, a good deal of what appears in it is really re-enacting, if you like, previous legislation. Most of what appears here would be found, I think, in Section 22 of the 1925 Act, and I should say that, as far as getting particulars is concerned, the old section has worked satisfactorily. I should also point out that it will be open to the Minister to get the particulars which the Deputy refers to.  The words in parentheses will not prevent him from getting the particulars if he wants them.  It will be open to the Minister, under the section as it is and without any amendment, to include or exclude the getting of the prescribed particulars at his discretion.  The amendment, if carried, would not have any great effect.  The section of the old Act dealing with this has, as I have said, worked satisfactorily.  While that is so, I would not be inclined to make any change and, therefore, I would ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.</P>

While it may be within the competence of the Minister to ask for the particulars, what is the position going to be if the particulars are not kept?

    <P>This deals with a point that I made on Second Reading.  I am not pressing the amendment.  I am simply bringing it forward for the Minister's consideration.  A rigid adherence to the 60 years might be on the long side. I think I mentioned on the Second Reading that our Valuation Act of 1850 did not really become effective until 1865, or about 74 years ago.  It is well-known that some of these cases were under judicial consideration for a considerable time subsequent to 1863, and it may be that for the next 20 years some of those fisheries did not come in for the purposes of the Valuation Acts.  If the Minister says that he has gone into the matter and thinks that &ldquo;60&rdquo; is reasonable, I am prepared to withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in stating that he raised this point on the Second Reading, and said that he thought there might be some difficulty, because the results of the appeals taken from the Rates Special Commissioners between 1864 and 1868 were not announced until early in the &ldquo;70's&rdquo; and that, therefore, we might not have the full 60 years to go back to.  I have ascertained since from the Valuation Office that these fixed engines or other hereditaments, which were the subject of appeals at that time, were not removed from the valuation lists, and the Valuation Office has assured me that it has no difficulty whatever in going back 60 years in all cases.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of sub-section (2), to <Col N="1358" /> add the following words: &ldquo;and the production of the said certificate in any proceedings before a district justice shall be conclusive evidence of the title of the rated occupier to the fishery so included, and the jurisdiction of the district justice shall not be questioned in any matter concerning the said title.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is an amendment in which I am rather interested, not that I have any particular case in mind at all but on the general principle and with a view, if possible, to stopping now once and for all this raiding on these proprietary fisheries.  The Minister will remember that on the Second Reading I was particularly anxious, in view of the fact that the State is expending a great deal of money in purchasing out these fisheries that, between now and the time when they are taken over, these fisheries would not be subject to raids which might destroy the property for which we are paying.  It does not look like that, perhaps, on paper but raids on these fisheries would really have that effect.  The difficulty created for the proprietors is this, that even when the footiest case comes before the district justice, a case that could be disposed of by a fine of 5/- or 10/-, the solicitor for the defendant who has been encroaching on a private fishery raises the question of jurisdiction. That, immediately, takes it out of the hands of the district justice because he has no jurisdiction on title cases and then we have something on the lines of the Erne Fishery case.  I am not prepared to stand over the drafting of this amendment.  I am not a draftsman but I think if there was some provision put in by which the production of the certificate from the Valuation Office, that this had been a rated hereditament for 60 years, would give you an indefeasible right to title just as when it comes to the taking over of the fishery.  I do not see why the production of that certificate would not stop the question of title being raised before the district justice.  When that certificate is produced the case would be brought within the purview of the district justice.  The amendment would have to be dressed somewhat by the <Col N="1359" /> Parliamentary draftsman.  Probably the Minister will look into that and see whether something should not be done towards helping to stop these raidings. Something on those lines would be the surest way to stop the raiding of these fisheries.  It is entirely in the interests of the State that the raidings should stop so that we would get some return for the money that we are paying for these fisheries&mdash;something that would be worth the price paid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember the Deputy on the Second Reading made the point that he would like to know what we intended doing in order to stop these raidings.  I had assumed that when people realised that these fisheries are becoming State property the raids would cease.  If the raids do not stop, then we will have to take drastic measures to stop whatever raiding there may be.  I want Deputies to realise that in the Bill we are doing nothing to fix the ownership on any particular person.  What we are trying to do is to fix whether the fishery is a several fishery or not.  We are fixing that it is a several fishery by the proof that rates have been paid for the several fishery for 60 years.  I think we are probably in the same position as the Land Commission when taking over an estate.  They take over the estate but sometimes they are not sure as to who the owner is.</P>

This is a particularly technical job. There is only one man in Ireland who really knows the job well.  He knows all about these weirs inside out and he knows what is wanted.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Then this is quite a useful amendment.  I feel that the next amendment would impose a contingent <Col N="1363" /> charge on public funds.  The idea behind this amendment, No. 114a, is that the arbitrator should not find himself excluded from taking into consideration matters prior to the transition period, for instance, a concentrated series of raids over a number of years.  I hold no brief for any of these fellows, and there are some of them whom most of us would be very glad to get rid of, but I have, at the same time, a sense of natural justice, and that any calculation should be based on a premises, using the word in the logical sense, which might not be fair is repugnant to me. Apart from the transition period merely, one has to take into consideration, especially in a matter like fisheries, the resultant effects during the transition period of prior raiding. The Minister agreed with me last night with regard to what Deputy McMenamin tried to make a joke of, biological nets.  We were, of course, not speaking of biological nets&mdash;that was ridiculous&mdash;but there is a biological fact about fisheries, that raiding to-day will only have its real, serious effect in from four to five years' time.  Therefore, if you confine the arbitrator's jurisdiction to the mere transition period and if the case is dealt with in four years&mdash;it will not be dealt with under three years&mdash;the raiding that had gone on immediately prior to the transition period might have a very serious effect on the turnover of that man during that period. That is really the point behind this amendment, so far as I can see.  To tell the truth, I did not have any time to look into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the point is very well covered.  As drafted, we try to cover what happens during the transition period.  I do not think the amendment is necessary at all because sub-section (4) will take everything into account in the way of interference with a fishery before the transition period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows very well that many of these men have been heavily mulcted, and if the Minister will say that there is nothing in it which will exclude the arbitrator from taking a matter of that kind into consideration, I am satisfied.  Some of these men were mulcted in extraordinary costs merely because of the intervention of the Attorney-General, and, again, I think it is a matter of justice, that when we are winding up these people and taking away their property, we should give consideration to such a matter where very heavy costs have been involved.  Apart altogether from the Erne fisheries, there are others in which costs ran into very many thousands of pounds in their efforts, time and time again, to establish title. I should like the Minister to say that there is nothing to preclude the arbitrator from taking a matter of that kind into consideration when working under the 1919 Act, under which the arbitrator acts in nearly all these cases.  I must say this, that so far as I know, and I know something of it, the decisions of the arbitrator appointed to carry out assessments of compensation in connection with the Electricity Supply Acts&mdash;and I presume it will be the same person in this case&mdash;have been received with complete satisfaction, and I have no doubt in my own mind that there will be no quarrel subsequently by owners of fisheries with the compensation he will fix; but it would be useful if the Minister would say that the matter mentioned in the amendment would not be excluded from the purview of the arbitrator when going into the question of compensation to these proprietors.</P>

      <P>It is a very difficult matter to interpret a section like this from an angle I had not thought of before.  It appears to me that the arbitrators must take into account the profits earned during the transition period and, consequently, under the amendment I have inserted, equally the profits made before the transition period.  That, however, is qualified to the extent that if anything prevented a man from making profits, either during or before the transition period, in the way of interference with his fishery, it would naturally be taken into account by the arbitrator.  I think that as the section is drafted, that is as far as the arbitrator would go.  I have been looking at the Acquisition of Land (Compensation) Act, 1919.

      <P>The commission which sat in 1934 gave a lot of thought to the question raised by Deputy Bartley. They recommended a very elaborate and, perhaps, Utopian scheme in respect of the salmon going up river and for improving the fisheries generally.  After hearing the advice of the Department, I was frankly afraid to adopt the scheme <i>in toto,</i> but I think we should give it a trial. I should be very anxious to see the scheme tried on one or two of the rivers when we take them over.  We shall give the recommendation of the <Col N="1367" /> commission a trial under the most favourable circumstances.  In that way, we shall endeavour to find out whether their recommendations were sound or not.  I hope they will be justified because they would hold out great promise for the improvement of our fisheries.  I have no reason to doubt what they say, but I did not like to try it out completely.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2), line 21, to delete the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is, I think, worth while.  I take it for granted that the Minister will, when it comes to the point, pay the amount of the rate for which he will be normally liable, but I can see nothing against making the provision obligatory.  It will ease the minds of people who may be disturbed. I do not think that the Minister can read me a legal argument, as he did before, on &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall.&rdquo;&ldquo;May&rdquo; does not mean &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in every case.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 119:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of the section the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  An offence under the Fisheries Acts or this Act may be brought before and heard and disposed of by a justice of the District Court irrespective of the place in which the person alleged to have committed such offence resides or in which such offence is alleged to have been committed.</P>
      <P>This amendment is to meet a case where fish are taken illegally, say, in Donegal and sold in Dublin.  It would be most inconvenient to try one of the offenders in Donegal and the other in Dublin.  It would be much better to try both at the same place and at the same time.  We may not, of course, always do that.  If it were a small offence, a person in Donegal would be tried there and a person in Dublin would be tried here.  In certain cases where it is a rather serious offence it would be better to have them all tried in the same place and at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with that, but would the Minister give some undertaking in this direction?  If an offence is committed in Dublin, through selling fish caught in Donegal, the Dublin persons should be brought to Donegal rather than bring the Donegal persons to Dublin.  One <Col N="1370" /> might inflict very considerable hardship on some poor unfortunate devil. I may have taken the Minister up wrongly, but I do not think so.  The amendment provides that the offence may be disposed of &ldquo;irrespective of the place in which the person alleged to have committed such offence resides or in which such offence is alleged to have been committed.&rdquo;  That means that if an offence is committed in Donegal it could be tried in court in Killorglin, County Kerry.  That is <i>reductio ad absurdum,</i> but I think it is within the province of the Minister to act in that manner and it could be made impossible for a defendant to defend one of these cases.  Perhaps the Minister would look into it further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to refer to the grave delay which we have experienced in dealing with the land problem.  In my county we have a good deal of land available for division and I must say that for a considerable time back things are at a complete stand still.  I will just mention a few cases. There is the Flannery estate at Tullamore Part, Nenagh; the Carden estate at Barnane, Templemore; the Carden estate at Fishmoyne, Borrisoleigh; the Carneille estate at Silvermines, Nenagh, and the Waller estate at Prior Park, Borrisokane.  In connection with all these lands, the applicants were interviewed many months ago, everybody was allowed to believe that the scheme was practicable, and still we find that nothing has been done.  The delay in taking action has been the cause of keen disappointment and grave dissatisfaction.  Applicants and everybody else have been allowed to believe that a scheme is in preparation, the applicants are visited, interviewed, and still after a considerable time we find that nothing comes out of it.  That is a matter that requires explanation. We have in this particular county a large amount of land suitable for acquisition and division, and also a large number of applicants, and there is grave dissatisfaction regarding the delay in the acquisition of land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Undoubtedly a great deal has been done in regard to land division in County Tipperary, but it is very little in comparison with the amount of land we have there suitable and available. I have here a list of just a few of the estates that we have been urging <Col N="1372" /> should be dealt with, and in regard to which the local people have been agitating for a considerable time; but so far there has been no move.  In the Borrisokane area, in the extreme north of the county, we have the estate of Telford, which consists of about 300 acres; we have the estate of Thomas Towers, Castletown, Borrisokane, consisting of about 500 acres; that of Major Biggs, in the same locality, which is another estate of 500 acres; and we have the estate of Miss Bruce in the same locality, containing 200 acres.  Those are only a few; there are various other estates in the district also, some of the finest land along by the Shannon, and it is not being worked.  In many cases the owners are willing and anxious to sell. Regarding the estate of Mrs. Ireland, the late owner is now dead, and the only heir that we know of came home from Australia, and I understand is very anxious to dispose of the estate. The Land Commission has been very, very slow, notwithstanding the fact that there is a general outcry for the acquisition and division of land in that district.  There was a case recently in that locality where an estate was sold in parcels to some large land-owners adjoining, and there is a general belief that the same thing may happen in this case if the Land Commission does not act.  The owner is willing and anxious to dispose of the property, and I think it is a great shame that the Land Commission cannot be got moving in such cases.  In the Thurles area there is a similar state of affairs. There is Miss Cahill's estate, at Thurles; the Knox estate at Brittas; the Aherne estate at Athnid, and the Barry estate at Turtulla.  Those are just a few of the many in connection with which there are holders willing to sell and suitable applicants from every point of view nestled in amongst them.  It is a source of great disappointment and dissatisfaction that that matter has not been remedied.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies in the Cashel area, where we have Grace and Purcell's estate and various others crying out for attention.</P>
    <P>We have also the problem of the <Col N="1373" /> derelict buildings.  I called attention to this matter before and I am sorry to say that it has not been remedied.  In many of these cases, also, the owners are anxious to dispose of the property. It is very wrong, I think, that the Land Commission does not come forward and relieve that problem.  It is, as everybody will agree, a national loss that those lands are left idle.  It is a problem concerning the local authorities.  It is a source of hardship on the ratepayers.  These places are not paying either annuities or rates and the ratepayers as a whole will have to make up that loss.</P>
    <P>There is also another aspect of that problem which is very, very serious.  I know of a case that happened recently in my district in connection with one of those holdings which was derelict for a considerable time and which was the subject of attention from the Land Commission for the past three or four years but still nothing was done except to hold inspection after inspection. A local man, a very respectable, industrious man, had his cattle on this property and had them fully paid for. The rate collector came along and took away the cattle and it cost that man a considerable sum to have them released.  I think that is very, very unfair.  The Land Commission should remedy a situation such as that.  We had a similar situation in a case, not far from my district, where the court is in possession of a holding as a result of a technical mistake in a will.  Even the court should not be allowed to permit land to get into arrears of rates and annuities and fences to become derelict in a case of that kind. These are all things that cry out for attention.</P>

      <P>There is also the problem of roads and rights-of-way, to which I referred here some time ago. A number of people on the Cronin estate, near Newport, North Tipperary, are terribly in need of rights-of-way. I understand that provision was made for that when the estates were being bought out.  The sites were actually set out for them but, apparently, nothing is being done. This matter has been the cause of representation and agitation for a number of years back.  I went to the Land Commission about it several times, but we seem to be getting no nearer to having the case met.  There is probably a dispute, or the local people are not agreed on where the site should be, but I think the matter should be decided.  It should not be left hanging as it is.</P>
      <P>Another matter to which I would like to refer is the question of bog roads.  We have, on the Hilary estate, also in the Newport district, a large tract of bog which was acquired a couple of years ago and divided amongst the local people.  They are left now without a right-of-way or without a road being made into the bog.  They have been in that position for a couple of years.  They are expected, I suppose, to pay the annuity, or whatever assessment is levied on it, and I do not think it is fair that a road is not provided for them.  There is a large number of people affected and the Land Commission seem to be very slow in providing those facilities for them.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is a great deal more I have to say.  I suppose, as the Ceann Comhairle has said, many of the matters I have mentioned would require legislation, but I hope, if that is the case, that legislation will come soon and that, when it does come, it will remedy all these defects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to say very much on this Vote.  There is one thing.  I know there are certain difficulties in the way of the Land Commission in regard to the acquisition of land but I also know that there is a great deal of available land that, I <Col N="1375" /> believe, could be acquired by negotiation. I know that that is true in the county I come from, County Galway. I have come to the conclusion that the acquisition branch of the Department has either been asleep or has formed itself into a kind of vicious circle in respect of land that could be acquired in that way.  I am not going to specify many cases in particular, but I do know one instance where I am led to believe that the owner would be quite prepared to dispose of his land to the Land Commission.  It is the estate of Helenus Blake, of Hollypark, near Craughwell, Co. Galway.  There is a number of congests in that area, many of them paying a high conacre rent for the purpose of tillage as they are not able to keep up proper rotation on their own small holdings.  That is the only case I will specify, but I also know there is a number of people who, in view of the fact that a new Land Bill is likely to be introduced, are offering large tracts of land, nonresidential holdings, for sale.  I am not one of those people that would expect that the Land Commission should acquire land below its normal or proper value.  I believe that if an individual can come along and give a fairly reasonable price at a public auction or by private treaty for a fairly large area of land that the Land Commission, when taking over land to accommodate migrants or to relieve local congestion, should be equally able to pay a reasonable price for that land.  We have a number of such cases in Galway.  I think the necessity for acquiring land has been very clearly outlined in the report of what is known as the &ldquo;Migrant Commission&rdquo; and, if it is intended to give effect to the recommendations embodied in that Report, I think that when any fairly large tract of land is being offered by public auction, that it is the duty of the Land Commission to make a private offer for that land, place a reserve bid on it and take it over for division.  That is as far as I go in regard to acquisition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the improvement of estates, I have no fault whatsoever to find with the Land Commission in <Col N="1376" /> respect of improvement work carried out on estates that have been acquired in recent years.  But, there is a number of cases of estates that were acquired between the time when the old Congested Districts Board was abolished and the passing of the 1933 Land Act.  Estates were taken over and I state here, very emphatically, that in a number of instances the improvements were not at all what they should be.  This is particularly true in respect of bogs that were taken over. Bogs were acquired and were allotted to the people that were given the land and others.  There was a road marked out but there was no further improvement. The result was that the people that were allotted the turbary had to go to some local turbary owner, either in the immediate locality or a distance away, and they have continued ever since to pay a very high annual rent for a few perches of turbary.  They also have to pay the Land Commission for the turbary that they were given by the Land Commission.  It now happens that the Land Commission have taken over the turbary where they were getting their fuel and they are now told that, because they were given turbary on another estate on a former occasion, their case cannot now be considered. I suppose that is a very good and valid reason why they should not be considered now, but at the same time it is no reason why the Land Commission should not put the bog which they were given ten or 12 or 14 years ago into such a condition that they can get their turf there.  There is one case I have in mind; it is that of a bog on the Garrafine Trench estate.  There is a number of people who are getting turf on the O'Connor Pallas estate because they cannot get it on the Garrafine Trench estate owing to the lack of the necessary improvements in roads and drainage.  All I ask the Department of Lands to do now is to have the necessary improvements carried out on that Garrafine Trench bog. Even if it were necessary to increase the rent, and carry out the improvements by way of a further advance, repayable with the annuity, that would be highly desirable.</P>
    <P>As regards housing, I want to refer to a matter which was mentioned here, <Col N="1377" /> I think, by Deputy Fagan when he brought to the notice of the Minister the necessity for increasing the valuation limit for grants or advances. There has been a regulation in the Land Commission for a few years past that persons whose valuations are in excess of £25 will not be considered for either a grant or an advance. Even in the case of unvested holders &mdash;holders who were given land after the passage of the 1923 Land Act, and are not yet vested&mdash;that is true also. If they happen to have a valuation in excess of £25, no grant or advance of any kind will be made available to them.  Of course, when you argue that matter with the Land Commission they will tell you that there was nothing in the purchase agreement giving them the right to a grant or an advance.  But the people generally did not know that at the time.  They took the holdings on the assumption that they were to get grants.  The time went by, and every day they were living in hopes that a grant or an advance to enable them to erect dwellinghouses and outoffices would be made available to them. They now find that because their valuation is over £25 they will not get either one or the other.  I think that is most unfair.</P>
    <P>I believe also that too much importance is attached to this valuation limit, because people with valuations between £25, and I would even say £70, are in just as much difficulty in many respects as people below the £25 limit.  They are not getting the benefit of any State assistance; they have to pay up in every case; they are looked upon as very well-to-do people, while in many instances the opposite is the case. I believe that&mdash;even in the case of old holdings which were purchased under the 1903 Act and subsequent Acts&mdash;in view of the fact that the annuities have been halved, you would find a number of such people who would now be able to pay an increased annuity if an advance or a loan were made available to them to enable them to erect a dwellinghouse.  I think that is one of the things which the Land Commission should take into consideration. My view is that all this matter of rural <Col N="1378" /> housing should be handed over to the Land Commission&mdash;that the Land Commission should deal entirely with it.  At present a person who comes within the valuation limit has to apply to the Department of Local Government for a grant, and in order to be able to erect his house he has to apply to the Land Commission for an advance.  That is a very slow procedure, because two Departments come into it.  The inspectors of the Local Government Department have to be satisfied in the first instance, and the inspectors of the Land Commission have to be satisfied in the second instance, before the full amount is paid.  I think that if the whole thing were handed over to the Land Commission it would be very much better, and would expedite housing in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>The only other remark I have to make is in connection with the collection branch of the Land Commission. I have always received the greatest courtesy from them.  Whenever a reasonable case for time was put up, I found that it was met fairly and squarely.  It has been suggested here that certain people are not legally or morally bound to pay annuities. I hold that people who advance that argument are treading on very dangerous grounds.  There is one thing I wish to say very candidly, and that is that I hope, in my time anyhow, there will not be any further interference with the land annuities, because I for one do not want to give an excuse to this Government or any succeeding Government for substituting a land tax for my present land annuity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahRyan" hpid="Colonel Ryan Colonel Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With reference to land division, there is one thing with which I have a grievous fault to find. It arises on account of present conditions in the country.  I think that by the method in which land is divided at present you are creating a kind of agricultural slum.  Under modern conditions, and the increasing cost of living, 15 big acres or Irish acres are of hardly any use to a man.  If he is a labouring man working on an estate, it takes him away from his ordinary <Col N="1379" /> avocation.  He has to try and live on the 15 acres, and he is expected to marry and rear a family.  What happens when his family grows up? They have not the bare means of existence, and they are in a hurry to get away from that land.  In fact, a living cannot be made at all on 15 or even 20 acres of land in this country. No matter how scarce land is, no matter how many people are looking for it, I would suggest to the Minister that in future each man should be given a reasonable amount of land on which to get a living for himself and his family.  I hold that anything less than 30 acres is of no use at the present time, and will not be in the future.  We do not want to get back to the conditions which obtained in the past when people were living like slaves.  A man who has to live and rear a family on 15 acres of land is an absolute slave.  That arrangement is tending to create more slums amongst the agricultural community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can quite understand that when an estate is being divided, and there are 300 or 400 applicants, the Minister and the officers of the Land Commission are trying to please everybody.  They are trying to give a bit here and there. But that should not be the case.  It would be far better that the estate were never divided than that the people who get land should not have the means of existence.  If the Minister will inquire into the division of land from its beginning he will find that those people who got small holdings are not able to pay their annuities. They are not able to meet their obligations at all, and very little use is being made of the land.  Take for instance the giving of land to an employee of an estate when that estate is being divided.  I hold that an employee of an estate is entitled to some compensation, but I think that the worst form of compensation is to get him 15 or 20 acres of land and a house, unless he has some capital behind him.  The Land Commission does not bother about that.  They just say: &ldquo;We will compensate this man by giving him 15 or 20 acres of land and a house because he was working there all his life.&rdquo;<Col N="1380" /> What happens?  Before he has it well got, he has it set to somebody else and the trouble is that he is neither a labourer nor a farmer.  Even if he tries to work three or four acres, it takes him all his time and he is looking for casual work on the road and perhaps in other places.  Then there are a lot of people disgruntled because he is getting this work and there are others deprived of it and they are particularly disgruntled because he has the land. Perhaps it would be better if he never got the land.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that in those cases of employees on estates, no matter what the cost will be, if they are ordinary labourers they should get some compensation instead of being given land, or they might get a couple of acres and a house and some money to compensate them for the loss of their jobs.  I think that would be much better than dealing with them the other way.  We are spending a lot of money through the Land Commission and I think it is spent worse than it would be in the manner I have suggested.  I have several cases in mind where employees on an estate got land and to-day they are neither farmers nor labourers and they are pretty badly off.  I would like the Minister to see in future that any man who gets a holding ought to get it where he can rear a family in fairly decent comfort, no matter how scarce the land is or how many are left without it.  We have not sufficient land to cater for everybody.  The Government should not tend to create agricultural slums, and I suggest that is what is being done.  Where it is proposed to give a few acres to a workman employed on an estate, I suggest the Minister should compensate him instead of doing that.</P>
    <P>Another matter I want to speak about is with reference to applicants for land and the capital they have. There is an easy way to enable applicants to get over the matter of capital. The Land Commission inspector comes along and he may ask a man if he was in the old I.R.A., but he will surely ask him how much money he has and the person concerned may not have a <Col N="1381" /> bob.  You will find, however, that somebody will lend him £100 or £200 to put into the bank so as to be able to show the deposit receipt for it. There ought to be some other means of finding out the position of applicants besides that.  I hold that men who have not some capital or some backing ought not to get land.  I think all the circumstances surrounding each applicant should be made known to the Commissioners or the Land Commission Inspector before any person gets a holding.  There has been a good deal of what we might call wire-pulling or political influence used in the matter of land division.  I am glad that that is fading away to some extent, but it should never have been.  There is one thing certain, that in the case of a man who is to get land you should be assured that he is going to work it. It does not matter whether he is black, blue or green, the man who is prepared to work the land and has a certain backing ought to get it.  In the end, that will be better for the country and for the whole community.  I think it would be better for some people if they never got land.</P>
    <P>It would be interesting if the Minister investigated the cases of the people who got land since the first Land Act was introduced in order to ascertain what percentage of them are setting the land and are not paying their annuities or rates and are really becoming a burden on the rest of the community.  We have had experience enough of the whole thing and everybody in the Land Commission has had experience of it.  I think it is time that the Minister changed the whole procedure so far as the matter of giving land is concerned.  A thousand people are summoned by letter to some place where 400 acres are to be divided. Between the numbers the inspectors interview and the numbers they summon there are at least 1,000 people and they are a nuisance to everybody. The inspectors know from the very first, before they ever sent out the notices, that most of the people are not getting the land.  The minute those people get the notices they are certain they are to get the land and they are after me and everybody else.  I think <Col N="1382" /> that is a terrible waste of time.  It means a lot of wasted time, energy and money, and the inspectors would be much better off doing something else.</P>
    <P>They have an easy way of getting information before they summon a whole countryside from six or seven miles around an estate and get the people to lose a day, while they themselves are losing possibly two or three days. They should make inquiries to find out the best people to work the land.  They should find out who has an economic holding and who is trying to pay his way on that holding.  I do not suggest that a man with an economic holding who is not meeting his obligations should get more land, but the inspectors could find out the people who are paying their way and, regardless of their colour, the people who will work the land best should get it.</P>
    <P>There is a very disturbing factor in which everybody in this House is interested, and that is the arrears of land annuities.  While I hold no brief for the men who try to evade paying their land annuities, we must realise that we have some people&mdash;I have known them for the last 14 or 15 years &mdash;who are industrious, hard-working, thrifty people who do not try to evade their obligations but who, because of the troubles in the past six or seven years, the economic war if you like, and the bad year last year, are very hard put to meet their annuities.  I must say with regard to the officials of the collection branch that I have never found more reasonable people in any Department of Government.  I think where there is a big amount due in connection with arrears of land annuities they could accept small sums. I would like the Minister to have this thing examined very minutely, and where people are inclined to pay their arrears in instalments along with their current annuities they should get as much time as possible.  So long as people are not trying to evade payment they should get as much time as the Minister can give.</P>
    <P>The arrears are cleared in this way. The Guarantee Fund has suffered because of the loss of them and the people have paid it up in rates and as <Col N="1383" /> the arrears come back the people who paid them will be getting their own back, and those people who paid and were able to pay will not mind if the arrears are collected in two, three, five or six years.  I would like the Minister to see that the thrifty farmer get almost all the time he requires if he is anxious to pay or to put up any sensible sort of proposition.  If you do that in the case of the decent, thrifty farmer you will collect all the arrears and you will not press on him too heavily.  In some cases when the sheriff goes down a farmer is obliged to sell two or three animals that are not fit to be sold.  Then when he pays the costs of the sheriff he will be losing a couple of pounds on each beast.  That is naturally a drag on him and I am sure the Minister knows that things are not too good in the country and that is the reason I stress this thing so much.</P>
    <P>Another factor that is disturbing the minds of the people in the country is the new Land Bill.  We do not know anything about that Bill, but I will say that when the first Land Act was introduced here we never thought it could be used so harshly as it has been used from one time to another. I believe that when Mr. Hogan introduced the first Land Act in this House that, if it was thought it would be used in such a harsh manner, Deputies in this House at that time would not have stood for it.  I would appeal to the Minister not to bring in another Land Act with such harsh conditions, or conditions which would make it easier for him to take land.  I would suggest to him that lands which are offered to him, and lands which are derelict, some of which we have in County Tipperary, should be first taken.  I say that a man who works hard, and who has bought an outside farm in order to provide for his family, should not be persecuted.  The Minister should think twice before taking over a farm in a case where a man is paying a lot of wages, is a good employer and is rearing a family. A man of that kind is probably paying more wages and providing more comfort for the people around him <Col N="1384" /> than if the farm itself were divided. I would ask the Minister to look into those matters and he will find that in many cases great hardships are imposed on people who are victimised in that way.</P>
    <P>Take, for instance, the case of a man who has bought an outside farm and who may own £1,000 to the bank on that farm.  He wants to sell the farm but, because somebody writes up to the Land Commission, the sale is stopped and the man is informed that no transfer will be given.  That poor man is in desperate straits.  The matter is not decided one way or another.  It is allowed to hang on for two or three years.  The man cannot sell his farm and the Land Commission are neither taking it from him nor leaving it to him.  I would ask the Minister that in such cases, and there are some of them in my county, a decision should be given one way or the other.  Some time ago, I had occasion to approach the Minister's Department in connection with a farm in my county on which a great amount of employment was given, and I suggested that the farm should not be taken from a certain woman who owned it.  In fact, I think I stated that she was looked upon as a kind of philanthropist because of the amount of employment provided on the farm.  That farm was taken over a month or six weeks ago from that woman and three weeks' later it was set to her again in grass.  It is impossible to understand an action of that kind and such things should not be allowed to happen.  I quite agree that the Land Commission is necessary and that the division of land is necessary but I think the Minister should first take the derelict lands of the country and lands that are offered to him and that he ought not to be led by any section who start writing letters up to the Land Commission.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister concludes the debate, I should like to say a few words.  It was very interesting to hear from Deputy Jerry Ryan that representations have come to him in connection with the acquisition and division of land because some Deputies <Col N="1385" /> on the opposite side who preceded him said that all the representations were made by Deputies on our side of the House.  This subject has come up almost every year, on the occasion of the debate on the Land Commission. It is a hardy annual.  Deputies opposite maintain that the officials of the Land Commission are more disposed to lend an ear to members of Fianna Fáil than to members on that side of the House.  In my travels through the country, I meet people who try to persuade me that the Land Commission are more disposed to listen to members of the Fine Gael Party than they are to supporters or members of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I suppose the only conclusion that an impartial observer can come to, in cases like that, is that even-handed justice is being meted out by the Land Commission, that they just take representations from both sides of the House for what they are worth, and no more.  I heard Deputy Jerry Ryan suggesting a scheme by which compensation would be paid to employees on an estate when it is divided instead of giving them land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>He deprecated the idea of apportioning parcels of land to such people but he did not tell us what fund there is available for that purpose. Where is the compensation to come out of and will the payment of such compensation increase the annuities for the people who may get the land afterwards? I do not know whether any one could deal with that proposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very interested to hear from Deputy Martin Ryan that there is so much land for division in County Tipperary.  He complained bitterly that the Land Commission were remiss in their duty, that they were slow in acquiring this land for division.  I never dreamt that there was so much land in Tipperary for acquisition and division.  He named estate after estate. I think he named about 20 estates, each containing, perhaps, about 300 or 400 acres.  The idea that suggested itself to me while he was speaking was <Col N="1386" /> that it would be an excellent county in which to operate a migration scheme.  I do not know of course whether Deputy Morrissey or Deputy Jerry Ryan would agree to the suggestion, but it seemed to be an excellent idea.  I have been informed that very much cannot be done in that direction in County Meath any longer.  Great work has been done there and, from what I can gather, the migration scheme in that county has been an unqualified success.</P>

      <P>We were also told by some Deputies that the people who are brought along from counties such as Kerry and Cork are not fit to work that land in Meath, but there is no proof whatever forthcoming of that.  It is very easy for Deputies to stand up and speak about these people who come from the West as if they were Red Indians or some wild type that came from some other land.  We all know that they are the flower of the flock, people who attain to the front rank in every walk of life in other countries to which they emigrate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not failures. I shall come back for a moment to County Tipperary on which I have set my eye.  I would urge the Minister to consider this suggestion very carefully and very sympathetically because the Tipperary mentality is not very far removed from the Kerry mentality, and I am sure that a colony of Kerry people in Tipperary would get on very well with the people there, not to mention the very good results that would accrue from the mixture of blood. Very much has been said here to-day, and the other night, about the acquisition of land and, of course, that is a very important problem.  But there is one other problem that nobody has touched upon so far and that is the <Col N="1387" /> acquisition of turbary.  I consider that the acquisition of turbary is just as important as the acquisition of land.  I must say that in the constituency I represent, namely, North Kerry, there are wide tracts of turbary yet to be acquired.  At the same time, the local farmers and cottiers have to go miles and miles away for turf and have to purchase it at a high price, while others, not very many, have to purchase coal.  It seems to be a very extraordinary position that, where there is so much turf available, the people cannot get it.  I should say that I made repeated representations to the Land Commission in that connection through the ordinary channels and on a few occasions, I think, I wrote to the Minister himself to put that matter before the Land Commission and to impress upon them the importance and the necessity for having this turbary divided; but I am sorry to say that nothing very much has been done yet in that direction.</P>
      <P>I should also like to refer to the small amount of money spent in Kerry by the Land Commission during the last couple of years.  Of course, when we make reference to that, the natural reply is that there is no land worth while to be divided in County Kerry. But, as I said, there is plenty of turbary to be divided and the division of that turbary would give employment to a good many people, more employment I should say than the division of fertile land.  I hope, therefore, that this particular aspect of the matter will be considered sympathetically by the Land Commission, and that very soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also another problem to which I should like to refer, and that is the repair of river embankments. Operations seem to have come to a standstill so far as that particular problem is concerned.  That complaint is widespread in County Kerry.  There are breaches in embankments here and there, and unless the Land Commission step in soon it will be very difficult to do anything at all.  In that connection I should say that sometimes, when we make representation to the Land Commission with a view to getting them to repair embankments, we are <Col N="1388" /> confronted with the argument that at some time or other there was a fund established on such and such an estate for the purpose of carrying out these repairs.  Of course, in reality, these funds were very small and the people entrusted with the administration of the funds I am informed cannot touch the capital.  It is only the interest on the money concerned that they can devote to this purpose.  I do not think, therefore, that there is any justification for the Land Commission falling back any longer on the argument that there is such and such a fund available to carry out these works.  I consider that the repair of river embankments is a very important problem and unless, as I said, the problem is tackled soon, it will be very difficult to do it later on.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies referred to the courtesy of the Land Commission officials, especially those in charge of the collection branch.  Their remarks, of course, are well-founded, but still I would say that it is always to the interest of the people in charge to listen to a sound proposition in the matter of the collection of arrears, because unless they do that they will find it very difficult to collect them afterwards.  However, they have to do their duty and they are doing it well. In conclusion, I would ask the Minister to impress on the Land Commission the great necessity for the acquisition and division of turbary in my county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>On this Estimate, I want to direct the attention of the Minister to what I consider to be the very slow and unsatisfactory machinery operated by the Land Commission in respect of the inspection and acquisition of holdings.  I do not say it is lack of zeal on the part of the Minister or lack of zeal or industry on the part of the officials, but, whatever the cause, the process adopted by the Land Commission for inspecting and acquiring lands seems to be the slowest process it is possible for that Department to devise.  It appears to take an interminable amount of time to induce the Land Commission to inspect holdings.  One may write to the Land Commission, let us say, this year asking them to inspect land with a view <Col N="1389" /> to acquisition, and two years hence put down a question to the Minister asking whether the inspection has been completed and be told blandly and serenely by the Minister that the inquiries have not yet been completed. I do not know whether the Minister is so conversant with the machinery and so impressed with its slothfulness that that does not seem to be an inordinately long time to him, but I do know that to Deputies and those interested in the acquisition and division of lands the inordinate amount of time the Land Commission take to institute inquiries and to take steps to acquire lands which are considered suitable for acquisition and division is baffling.  I think that some steps should be taken by the Minister to expedite the method of inspection and to expedite the machinery for the acquisition and division of land.</P>
      <P>I have almost despaired of writing to the Land Commission to ask them for information as to what they are doing in connection with any particular holdings.  If one were to sit down and write a letter to the most benighted native of the farthest Pacific island one would get a reply from that native quicker than from the Land Commission.  All you can get from the Land Commission on making representations is an ordinary printed acknowledgment.  Then there is a silence for three months.  You ask for a reply and you get another acknowledgment. You ask for a reply again after another three months and get another acknowledgment.  You begin to wonder whether it is worth while wasting your time asking the Land Commission to answer a letter.  Then you direct a question to the Minister in the hope that somebody may temporarily suffer from perspiration trying to ascertain what is the position, and the Minister answers the question by saying that the inquiries are not yet completed.  If you dare ask a supplementary question, the Minister will get all hot and bothered and say that a whole lot of other places have to be inspected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that that is a very unsatisfactory method of dealing with a Deputy's complaint and indicates that <Col N="1390" /> the machinery in the Land Commission is far from satisfactory.  Nobody would dream of applying to an institution like it the sacrilegious word &ldquo;expeditious&rdquo;, but something should be done in the Department to expedite the present method of dealing with representations.  I do not know whether my complaint in this respect is common to other Deputies, although I know that a number of Deputies raised the matter in this House and complained in somewhat identical terms to those in which I am now complaining. The Minister ought to do something to expedite the method of carrying out these inspections and to expedite the machinery for the acquisition of lands.</P>
    <P>In the County Kildare, in particular, there are vast areas of grass lands which are unstocked and, in many cases, derelict.  It cannot be pleaded that their retention by the existing owner, often an absentee owner, is necessary in the national interest.  Yet one can write to the Land Commission year after year and see no perceptible effort made to acquire land of that kind for division.  The County Kildare, with its broad acres, mostly of very suitable land for tillage and pasture, offers considerable scope for the activities of the Land Commission.  If my observations are correct, I imagine there has been a considerable slowing down in the work of the Land Commission there.  An effort was made a few years ago to divide land on a large scale, but in the past two years there has been a very noticeable slowing down in the activities of the Land Commission in that county, notwithstanding the fact that it is one of the few counties which offers considerable scope for land settlement on decent-sized holdings.  Many persons find it impossible to remain on the land under the present economic conditions, particularly in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The question of migration from the West has been raised, and most of us would say that if there are people in distress in one place, and that distress in another place can be relieved, there is no objection whatever, in principle, to applying any relief measures that are possible and reasonable in such <Col N="1391" /> circumstances, but it seems to me that it is the policy to migrate people from the West without giving adequate consideration to the claims of local applicants. People have been migrated from the West recently and settled in County Kildare.  I know many people in that area who were applicants for land on which the migrants were settled, and who had an excellent claim for portion of the land, inasmuch as they followed agriculture as an occupation, and, in some cases, had young or adolescent families.  They also had some capital, and all the agricultural skill and industry necessary to work land when divided.  It is particulary hard on these people when, perhaps, the only local estate is divided, if their applications for holdings are ignored, while people migrated from the West are planted on places to which they considered they were entitled.  That seems to be an unfair procedure.  It may be said that the people from the West were really in a worse position.  That may be so, but it is no answer to those who wanted portion of the estate, to be told afterwards that they cannot get a holding on another estate in the vicinity because they live too far away, or because there were sufficient local applicants to be satisfied in its allocation.</P>
    <P>In any case I do not think the policy of migrating people from the West is ever likely to make an impression on the problem, where the amount of land available is inadequate or what might be described as overcrowded.  Whatever the problem in the West may be, whether endemic or otherwise, it does not seem to me to be the thing to create a small number of holdings in Meath or Kildare, and at considerable expense to the State, when, at the same time, that policy causes a considerable amount of discontent, and justifiable agitation on the part of local applicants anxious to obtain holdings on portions of a divided estate. Mention has been made of the policy of the Land Commission in respect to the division of holdings.  My complaint is that for some extraordinary reason the Land Commission appears to <Col N="1392" /> imagine that if they settle a man on 16, 18, or 20 statute acres he is a farmer.  Unfortunately, the experience of the average Deputy is that it is impossible for a man, if he is going to have anything approaching a reasonable standard of life, and to provide adequately for his wife and children, to have even a relatively frugal standard on such a holding.  For some extraordinary reason the Land Commission think that that is about the maximum amount of land they could give to provide for a family.  That is proved to be impossible.  At present the Land Commission are putting people on holdings of 20 acres and they imagine that once they are planted there they are farmers.  What happens is that the moment a relief scheme is started in the area, giving three or four days' work a week, a man who has been put on one of these holdings simply goes to the employment exchange and tries to get on the rotational scheme.</P>

      <P>I object to the Minister's reckless statement.  He made one reckless statement and withdrew it and then substituted another.  I will make an effort to explain to the Minister if he wishes.  I did not say that anyone from the West who got a holding of 20 acres has sought employment locally.  I am finished with that.  I say that the policy of the Land Commission appeared to be that when they gave a man a holding of 20 acres they had then made him a farmer, and no more, but he found it necessary to compete with local people for such employment as was available.  If the Minister says that he or his officials have never heard of a case where a man who got a 20-acre holding subsequently sought employment from the county council on some local relief scheme they are living in a fool's paradise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the case which was challenged in the first instance. What is happening in many cases is that a man is given a 20-acres holding, perhaps on portion of a large estate that was grazed by someone else.  There is a case, in which I know the facts, where a holding of 100 acres was divided amongst five or six people. Prior to acquisition and division it was grazed.  The man who had the grazing rights before the land was acquired, simply went to the individual allottees and made fresh grazing agreements with them.  The position then was that the man who originally had the grazing rights continued to graze the land, although the Land <Col N="1394" /> Commission thought they had acquired it and given it to others.  The original holder is now paying five or six people instead of one.  These people simply let their holdings for grazing and registered for employment at the local exchange.  They frequently complain to Deputies that they are not able to get a sustenance out of 20 acres. The way to correct that policy is either to make these people farmers or let them be workers.  A man who gets 20 acres of land is neither a farmer nor a worker.  He is simply holding on to the 20 acres by working it indifferently, or by grazing it, or is competing with local people for such employment as is available.  The Land Commission policy is making that type of man neither a farmer nor a worker, because on 20 acres he finds it difficult to get any type of employment or to get sustenance out of such a holding.  I think that if the Land Commission do feel it necessary&mdash;and I question the economics of it very seriously&mdash;to continue a policy of giving a 20-acre holding, it ought to be given under a revised scheme of distributing land. There is not much use in putting on to a 20-acre holding a man with a young growing family and very little capital, because with the best will in the world, he is not able to exploit the land to advantage.  He cannot buy seeds; he cannot buy manures or implements, and he is frequently handicapped by want of ready cash.</P>

    <P>If the policy of keeping the holdings down to the 20-acre or 22-acre limit is to be persisted in, the least the Land Commission ought to do is to try to devise some means, much on the basis of the experiment adopted in the case of the migrants from the West, of giving a man a start by giving him some stock and giving him a credit note which will enable him, on a repayment basis, to obtain the implements, seeds and manures that he requires.  If that policy was a sound policy and considered to be a sound policy in respect of the migrants from the West to Meath, there is no reason why it should not be extended to other people.  I think it is a sound policy.  I think it is the soundest part of the migration <Col N="1395" /> scheme, and there is no reason why it ought not to be applied in other cases also.</P>
    <P>There is another matter with regard to Land Commission policy which appears to have undergone a change in recent years, and that is their housing activities.  I do not know on what basis they proceed in the matter of deciding when they will build a house for a man and when they will give him a grant and a loan to build a house. In some cases the house is built for him, and in other cases he is given a grant and a loan and expected to build the house himself.  I came across a case the other day where a man had secured a grant from a building society and a loan from the county council to build a house under the Housing Acts. The Land Commission inspector came along and said that he was considering this man for a holding on land on a neighbouring estate, and asked the man would he take it because, if so, they would build a house for him.  He said that he would, and he abandoned his intention of building the house through the utility society and under the Housing Acts normally.  He went into the 20-acre holding that he got from the Land Commission and then asked them: &ldquo;What about the promise to build a house for me?&rdquo;  When the promise came to be translated into action the man discovered that the Land Commission would give him a loan of £100 and an advance of £100, provided he built a house on Plan No. 1 and outhouses on Plan No. 3. Now, nobody would build a house on Plan No. 1 and outhouses on Plan No. 3 for £200 to-day.  It could not be done.  The man tried everywhere to find a contractor who would tender for the work at £200, but he could not find anybody to do it under £280 in that area, and he had neither the resources nor the technical equipment to build it himself.  There is a case where he is offered £200 and will not be allowed to alter the plan or build a smaller type of house.  I think the Land Commission should not expect a man under such circumstances to be able to undertake the work of erecting a house himself and that in all these cases, unless <Col N="1396" /> the applicant wants to adopt another method himself, they should erect the house for him even though the erection of the house may involve the payment by him of a higher rate of annuity than he would have to pay if he were given a loan and an advance.  The policy of the Land Commission is far from a success.  I have represented cases to them times out of number where persons complained that the grant and the loan are inadequate to build a house and where the houses are left unbuilt at present and the persons continue to reside a couple of miles away from the holdings which have been allocated to them, which is a wasteful method of husbandry in respect of agriculture.</P>
    <P>We have had issued to us from Government Departments in recent months statistics which indicate a very serious drift from the land, which indicate that the population on the land is leaving, and which indicate that apparently it is not possible under existing circumstances to keep them there. Now, the acquisition and division of land, speedily and on a comprehensive basis, would help to correct that very dangerous tendency&mdash;a tendency which indicates that the red flag is up so far as the preservation of our population is concerned.  I would appeal to the Minister, who in many matters has a radical outlook, to give serious attention to the question of devising ways and means by which there can be a big push directed towards the inspection and acquisition and division of land. I think it is one of the best ways in which we can arrest the tendency to leave the land, and one of the ways by which&mdash;now that we are faced with a European crisis and may in fact not pass out of that crisis for many years to come&mdash;we can at least strengthen the nation agriculturally and organically. I see in the work of the Land Commission, if it were efficiently directed and speedily executed, possibilities of arresting the flight from the land and, at the same time, possibilities for strengthening the nation and retaining our population in this country.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission, so far as I know, was first started in this country to get rid of the landlords <Col N="1397" /> and to restore ownership in the land of the country to the people who lived on it.  Since the passage of the 1933 Land Act, the work of the Land Commission seems to me to be very largely the creation of new flocks of congests all over this country.  Nobody knows better than the men who have been Ministers for Lands in this country the persecution that they got, and their predecessors got, and that the Land Commission got since it was first instituted in the last century, in trying to deal with the problem created by the congests.  It is one of the most acute of all problems.  Migration schemes have been tried; amalgamation schemes have been tried&mdash;every resource that could be worked out has been exhausted in order to try and abolish the agricultural slum, and it is still a very grave problem after 40 years' work.  I am not at all sure that this endless sub-division, to which Deputy Norton seems wedded, is a wise policy at all. Were the Land League altogether wrong when they attached so much importance to fixity of tenure and free sale?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think they were right.  They believed that if you destroyed fixity of tenure and free sale you destroyed all the farmer's incentive to invest his surplus earnings in the improvement of his land.  They said, therefore, that if the community was to benefit by land reform, the lines the reform should go on would be such as to induce the farmer to increase the productive capacity of his land.  To do that, you have to make him more prosperous in order to provide him with liquid capital, and more secure in order to induce him to invest a share of that capital in immovable improvements on his land: to increase the fertility of his soil, to improve his outhouses and equipment, his gates, fences and the other immovable parts of his property. We all saw in this country the change that took place in the face of Ireland between the beginning of this century and 1931.  There was a steady improvement in the land, and there was a corresponding rise in the standards of living of the whole people, because the farmer felt that his money for investment was safer in his land than it was <Col N="1398" /> in the bank.  You then had the 1923 Land Act, carried to its logical conclusion in the 1933 Land Act, which abolished all fixity of tenure and effectively abolished free sale.</P>
    <P>I ask you to look at the country now. Has not the quality of our land deteriorated?  Has not the rate of improvement on land slackened down, and have not great evils resulted from the abolition of fixity of tenure?  Do members of this House remember that during the debate on the 1933 Land Bill I warned the Government that if they went through with the compulsory acquisition proposals contained in that measure they would start a minor land war in every parish in Ireland.  Was I not right?  You have all seen or read of the events that took place in Ballyhaunis, of what is happening outside of Ballaghaderreen.  You have seen what is happening in these places and everywhere where people were invited to believe that they had the right to go in and take their neighbour's land and divide it up amongst themselves. If that right was not acknowledged, and if their neighbour's land was not taken and given to them, they started an agitation.  You had shots fired at night and cattle driven.  All the paraphernalia that was originally employed to dislodge the landlord, the overlord of the tenants, is now being used at the invitation of the 1933 Land Act by one neighbour against another neighbour, and to whose advantage does that react?  Does Deputy Corish think it is a good thing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be, but it is bad. I think we have reached the point when we ought to consider the question of restoring fixity of tenure and free sale on some basis.  Now this is an important fact that a lot of people lose sight of, that we cannot do that by legislation.  The only way you can do it now is by resort to a constitutional amendment, because if we got into power and passed an Act restoring fixity of tenure and free sale as part of our programme, the Fianna Fáil Party <Col N="1399" /> would announce their intention of repealing that Act, and if the Fianna Fáil Party did it we would announce our intention of repealing the Act. Fixity of tenure must be restored, but legislation is not the way to do it.  I believe there must be some resort to fundamental law which it would not be open to any political Party to repeal. We should have definitely re-established in this country fixity of tenure and free sale.</P>
      <P>That, in my opinion, is the first and most urgent work that lies before the Land Commission.  Administratively, the Land Commission can do much to restore confidence by announcing that, in general, they would not acquire the land of any farmer who was working his land.  At present you have got a situation like this: a man may have 20 acres of land around his house and 60 acres down the road.  The Land Commission will come in and take the 60 acres.  Another man has 70 acres of land.  He may be a man who has no sons, but has a family of daughters. He wants to sell the farm so as to dower his daughters and retire.  The minute that he puts up the farm for sale, and instructs an auctioneer to sell it, there is a Land Commission inspector down the following morning, or else there is a meeting of the local Fianna Fáil club calling for the division of this farm, whereupon nobody will bid for it.  The farm becomes unsaleable, and thus you destroy his freedom of sale.  The Minister knows all that as well as I do.  I do not want to labour that further because I think that the Minister, by this time, is as wide awake to the evils which are arising in that sphere as I am.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made earlier to political discrimination.  I suppose no Department is sacrosanct, and I would not expect, quite frankly, any Department over which the Minister presides to appear with wings and a halo.  He is a good, practical, rough and tumble politician.  He believes in rough dealing. I do not believe the Land Commission is scandalous.  I have not the slightest doubt but that, in certain cases, the Minister wangles the allotment <Col N="1400" /> of estates.  I have not the slightest doubt about that, but considering his outlook I do not think it is scandalous.  I do not suppose that more than 20 or 30 per cent, of the land is wangled.  I believe that the balance &mdash;the 70 or 75 per cent.&mdash;is equitably and honestly distributed, and in all the circumstances.  I do not think that ought to be the subject of unduly strenuous complaint.  We ought to thank God that it is not worse because, personally, I believed it would be. There is no doubt whatever but that the activities of Deputies like Deputy Smith of Cavan, and Deputy O'Rourke of Roscommon, do great damage. Deputy McGovern described Deputy Smith arriving down in Cavan and holding a public meeting and skilfully creating the impression on the minds of the local people that he was coming down to allot land.  Now, whether he had authority to do that or not the people believed that he had, and the people believed that the Minister and himself had a pow-wow up here in town and that Gerry Boland, as they know the Minister, told Paddy Smith to go down and square the estate.  There is not the slightest doubt but that Paddy Smith wanted them to believe that his friend, Gerry, was going to do the necessary.  Now it may have been that the Minister gave Deputy Smith a flea in his ear, but if he did, Deputy Smith did not tell the people in Cavan about it.  He told them that Gerry was a good fellow, and that whatever he said went with Gerry.</P>
    <P>Now, I think that is bad, because it creates a bad feeling in the country and, generally, it spreads the impression that corruption is far more rife in the Land Commission than, in fact, it is.  The Minister is too prudent an old war horse to get up here and protest that since he became Minister he has assumed wings and a halo.  He has not and never will.  On the whole, I do not think there is anything shocking afoot.  In the same way you had Deputy O'Rourke getting up at a public meeting in Roscommon and saying that he was in a position to certify that every migrant from the West was a member of a Fianna Fáil Club.  That was reported in the <Col N="1401" /> columns of the <i>Roscommon Herald,</i> and the general implication was &ldquo;We have a reliable old warrior in the Land Commission and he will see to it that they are.&rdquo;  Of course, the Minister would never dream of saying such a thing.  But when that kind of thing has to be said in the Minister's constituency Deputy O'Rourke is sent down to say it.  I venture to say that the Minister is too prudent an old war horse to say such a thing in public, but I doubt if he would deny it if it were reported to him behind closed doors in Roscommon, Castlerea or Boyle.  Now that is thoroughly bad and it creates misgivings and doubts in the minds of the public, things that are wholly unsatisfactory from every point of view.</P>
    <P>I wonder is there any regard had by the inspectors who inquire into the suitability of applicants for land as to their capital equipment.  There is no use putting men on the land who have nothing.  Such men, if they do not set their land in conacre, cannot possibly raise the money to pay the annuities. I know numbers of cases and the Minister knows them, too, where men were put on land who had not a sixpence.  I know of shoemakers and tailors who were given a division of land, men who possessed nothing but the tools of their trade.  These men had no more equipment for working a farm of land than I have for draining the Sahara Desert. Is that prudent or sensible?</P>
    <P>On the last occasion when this Vote was being discussed I mentioned that when the inspectors go down, they are not always tactful in inquiring into local conditions.  They are not always as discreet as they might be.  Do they try to avoid creating the impression in the areas they inspect, that they interview nobody but supporters of the Government?  I do not think they try to avoid creating that impression. They ought to be warned that in common prudence in addition to getting the information they want, they should avoid giving scandal in the area in which they work.  They ought to avoid giving the scandal that they have associated with acrimonious and notorious politicians exclusively for <Col N="1402" /> getting the information they want. Otherwise they are only leaving the impression on the minds of the public that they are taking their orders from the local Fianna Fáil boss.  A prudent man ought to be able to avoid that. The Minister and his Department ought to tell the inspectors that that is something that should be watched. Otherwise talk will be started and misrepresentation will result.</P>
    <P>We have spent over £100,000 cash in bringing migrants from the West of Ireland.  That out of pocket expenditure does not include the cost of the land at all which falls to be redeemed as to one-half by the annuitants.  I want to ask the Minister this&mdash;does he agree that this endless sub-division of land into minimum economic holdings is reducing the productive capacity of the land as a whole?  Does he agree that the multiplication of small farms means that the whole output of the agricultural produce of this country is declining?  Does he agree that the working of small farms is not economic compared with the working of larger holdings?  Suppose he does and he comes to us admitting the economic argument against sub-division, yet the social arguments are so weighty as to out-weigh the economic arguments against it.  I am inclined to agree with that view.</P>
    <P>But could we not make an experiment with a middle course?  Bringing up migrants from the West to the best land in Ireland could we not say:&mdash;We are anxious to equip each of those families with 20 acres of land. Let us get 12 families who will join with us in the experiment and instead of giving to each of the 12 families 20 acres of land, let us give the whole 12 families taken together a farm of 240 acres.  Adjoining the farm we will build a village of 12 dwelling-houses with 12 gardens, and they can have the usual amenities of village life&mdash; water works, sewerage works and a village hall.  Let them appoint a manager and pool their resources to purchase stock, seeds and manures and combine their labour to till the soils, and to get a profit.  At the end of the year let an account be cast up and let <Col N="1403" /> the profit be distributed amongst the 12 holders of the land.  They will have all the amenities of homes in their own houses and gardens in the village. They will have a sense of proprietorship, of ownership and of independence in their own houses and gardens in the village just as most of us have. They will have an opportunity of earning the maximum amount that the land is capable of producing by operating it on economic lines with their combined capital in a large community. Between them they will be able to retain the services of a farm manager who would be a highly skilled man. They can co-ordinate their joint efforts so as to enable them to extract from their exertions the maximum return.</P>
    <P>That is an experiment that is worth making.  It is worth making for two reasons:&mdash;(1) that we would get a better return for the money laid out on the migrants and (2) we might get for them too a much better standard of living and the easing of their problems when they are transferred from their peculiar land in the Gaeltacht to the rich and fertile lands of Meath, Westmeath and Kildare.  Many of those people come up from the bogs of the West, where I live myself.  In the areas from which they come most of the land is reclaimed bog.  Such people will find that the type of agriculture suitable to the boglands of the West is not at all suitable to the rich lands of Meath, Westmeath, or Kildare.  As a result, these migrants are confronted with problems quite different from those with which they have been dealing in the West.  If they could employ a manager who would guide them over their initial stages&mdash;who would help them in their efforts to extract from the heavy soil of the midlands the most that could be extracted out of it, that would be an experiment worth trying.</P>
    <P>If that experiment succeeded with the migrants in Meath or Westmeath, then it might be considered putting it into effect in parts of the congested districts areas.  Substantial tracts therein of ten or 20 farms could be taken, combined and turned into economic units to be worked by a joint effort for the several families that <Col N="1404" /> originally lived in the several holdings. In this way they could combine so as to help them to build houses in a village with suitable garden spaces around them and suitable village amenities.  In that way the Department could give substantial help towards the solution of the problem in the congested areas even without moving the people off them.  I am not at this stage urging that this is a panacea for all ills.  I am merely saying it is worth investigating because I believe we all want to get away from the policy of endless sub-division.  The only way to get away from it is to make a few experiments along different lines of development so as to see whether they would meet the difficulties with which we are at present confronted.  I have mentioned that there are grave social considerations to which full and weighty consideration should be given and, bearing that in mind, I offer the suggestion to the Minister for his consideration and, if possible, for experiment. I believe it would be much more economical from the point of view of the Treasury, and I believe it would be much more satisfactory to the migrants themselves and, ultimately, to a considerable number of small farmers.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise again the necessity for creating in the minds of our people the assurance that ulterior motives are not allowed to operate in the allotment of land.  The Minister has heard plenty about that here during the last two days.  He knows in his heart that his colleagues are very largely responsible for it, and he is aware, although he will not admit this, that he is not altogether free from blame himself.  Lastly, there is the matter of fixity of tenure and free sale. Would the Minister tell us what his view is on that question?  Does he believe in fixity of tenure and free sale and, if he does, how does he suggest restoring them to where they were prior to 1933?</P>

I do not mind Deputy Dillon&mdash;he is the most amusing member of the House.  My complaint to the Land Commission is completely different from that of Deputy Dillon and of any of the other Deputies who have spoken.  There has been a lot of criticism as to the type of applicants for land, as to their being members of Fianna Fáil Cumainn in Boyle and Castlerea, and as to the Minister being a jolly nice fellow and making sure that the members of these cumainn are all right.  I am perfectly satisfied that the Land Commission, in the policy they are adopting, are acting wisely. The only objection I have is that they are going too slowly.  In County Dublin you have the richest land in the Twenty-Six Counties, land which is as good as the land in County Meath, or any of the adjoining counties, but the Land Commission are not making the progress I should like to see them making in that county. There are thousands and thousands of acres of rich land in County Dublin and some members of the other House &mdash;I live quite convenient to them&mdash;have large estates.  Whether they are able to wangle the Land Commission, or whether they are able to keep the Land Commission from making the necessary inquiries in regard to acquisition of their holdings, I do not know, but they are able to keep the Land Commission off.  The Minister knows well the Senators to whom I refer.  I believe we are forbidden to mention names in the House, and I do not intend to do so.</P>

      <P>I am asking the Minister to go into this question of land in County Dublin.  We have no objection to the Minister's migration schemes and he can bring these people into the county&mdash;perhaps they would be coming back to the land they were driven away from&mdash;if a certain percentage of the land is given to the local people.  Deputy Dillon is not aware that small holders in County Dublin pay £7, £8, £9 and £10 per acre conacre and have to rear families on them.  I am sure that is a surprise to Deputy Dillon.  We have all types of people, foreigners of every description, earls, dukes and lords, who sit nice and comfortable over in London and draw their rents from land in County Dublin, and I think the Land Commission should pay special attention to some of these lands.  The Minister can put his migration schemes into operation there.  Let him bring up suitable applicants from Kerry or Mayo, but let him give a percentage <Col N="1407" /> of the land to the people in the area, and we will be perfectly satisfied.</P>
      <P>I want to say that the applicants selected for land in the county were suitable and that they were selected irrespective of their political beliefs. In fact, there were more anti-Government supporters who got land in County Dublin than Government supporters, but they were entitled to the land they got and they are men who will utilise that land.  I believe that fault cannot be found by any Deputy with the policy that is being carried out at present.  If there is any Deputy who can find fault with the Minister and the Land Commission, it is the Government Deputy, because I think the Land Commission has been too lenient in regard to a number of these people.  We had a parade of County Dublin farmers in Dublin the other day.  When the economic war was on they wanted it settled, and now that that is settled, they want derating. We had the chairman of the Farmers' Union&mdash;I know him well&mdash;and the secretary, who is only six months in County Dublin.  He ran out of the North and came down here to try to create trouble here.</P>

      <P>Some of these farmers' representatives even have the audacity to threaten me in respect of the various businesses with which I am concerned, but that threat was met in the proper manner.  I want to draw the Minister's attention to places like Rush, where there are men living on a rood and a half-acre of ground.  A man is a big farmer down in Rush if he has three or four acres, and I think the position in the county, particularly with regard to places like Rush and Lusk, and Glencullen in South County Dublin, should be examined.  This question of the acquisition of land should be expedited <Col N="1408" /> and the land given to people who are anxious to work it and who will work it.</P>
      <P>The Minister can rest assured that the people who have been grousing here were &ldquo;grousing&rdquo; when I entered public life about 20 years ago and will be &ldquo;grousing&rdquo; for the next 20 years. Deputy Dillon is amused.  He knows that what I say is true.  In the division of land the Minister should give attention to one matter&mdash;the roads that are made through the various estates.  The Land Commission do a very bad job.  The majority of the Land Commission roads are impassable. The county councils will not take them over until they are put in a proper state.  I must have written 50 letters to the Minister and 50 more to the Land Commission in connection with a road in Balbriggan, and the only reply I got was that the matter was under consideration and would be attended to.  These Land Commission roads should be put into a proper state and handed over to the local authority, so that the people concerned would be enabled to carry on their business.</P>
      <P>In some of the places, it is impossible for a threshing machine to reach a farmyard.  Some of the farmers' children cannot go to school, either, in bad weather.  The Land Commission roads are in a dreadful condition.  I do not believe that there is an official attached to the Land Commission who knows anything about a road.  In dividing these lands, the Department should make a deal with the surveyor attached to the local authority and come to a decision with regard to the making and laying of these roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another complaint I have to make is with reference to the water supply attached to some of these farms.  An inspector goes out, visits the different people, takes a note of their claim, goes into their position and the land is divided.  No consideration whatever is given to the water supply.  The Minister should go into this matter and see that the people who are allotted land are provided with a suitable water supply.  I am perfectly satisfied that the Land Commission and the Minister are dealing with this matter <Col N="1409" /> fairly and squarely, but his Department are very slow.  There is not, however, any political discrimination, notwithstanding what Deputies say. The only &ldquo;grouse&rdquo; I have is that some of these &ldquo;buckoes&rdquo; on the far side are getting too fair a deal.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister will look into the question of land division in County Dublin.  Thousands of acres, owned by members of the Upper House and by friends of Deputy Dillon, are available and should be acquired by the Land Commission.  I do not care whether the people who get the land come from Kerry or Mayo.</P>

      <P>I had intended to say <Col N="1410" /> something which, I thought, would be rather hard against the officials of the Land Commission as regards their manner of carrying out the work but, having listened to some of the speeches made during the debate, I realise that I might be blaming the wrong parties.  The claims made by various Deputies in connection with the division of land are almost as varied as the number of speakers, and it would be beyond the power of any group of people to deal with the division of land in such a way as to meet the requirements of each person.  The different outlook in the different localities would be largely responsible for divergence of plan on this very important work. It is obvious that, no matter what set of men were got together to do this work, it would be impossible for them to get even near general agreement. So far as my constituents are concerned, the only interest we have in the division of land is that the Land Commission should undertake in a serious manner to deal with the problem of congestion.  To me, it seems very difficult to understand why that problem was not seriously tackled years ago by a native Government.  I always thought that it was one of the first problems which would be tackled&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>What solution does the Deputy suggest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the Land Commission are concerned I would put my solution under two heads: (1) migration, and (2) a general survey of bogs that could be immediately reclaimed. The delay by Governments in seriously tackling that problem leaves no doubt in my mind that the Department concerned, or the Governments concerned, have not thoroughly understood the necessity for drastic reform in these areas.  These areas have, in the past, lived upon a form of economy which was not entirely dependent upon, or secured from, the land.  Part of it was taken from the emigrants who went to America, and from migrants to England and Scotland. In some parts of the country, at least in my constituency, there has been this migration of labour.  The <Col N="1411" /> entire assistance rendered from outside Ireland was rendered by emigrants in the United States.  That source of revenue is now closed up and the amounts coming in have been dwindling until they are almost negligible. To leave that area without some serious attention is, to my mind, serious neglect that any Government must take responsibility for.  Any Government neglecting to deal with that position is not discharging its duty as a Christian Government.  I listened the other evening, on the other hand, to the extraordinary statements made here by Deputies from Meath, getting up in arms on each side of the House and threatening dire consequences if there was not an end to the attempt on the part of the Land Commission to bring in migrants from the West.  It was suggested that the gun would be used&mdash;the gun was there, anyhow.  I think that form of speech is not anything more serious than mere opposition to the introduction of more migrants into County Meath.  I listened to some extraordinary remarks by Captain Giles, who said that 50 per cent. of those who got land in Meath were making no use of it.  If there is evidence required that the plan of campaign carried out by the Land Commission in dividing land in Meath has been a complete failure, Captain Giles provided that evidence here in his speech.  It is an outrageous thing to find the Land Commission dividing land which, as was said by Deputy Cosgrave, involved an expense of £900, and to find that it is given to men who are making no use of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>It is criminal waste. In spite of the threat that there is a gun somewhere, I think the Minister should be determined that there will be no further confusion and that public and criminal waste of public money will cease, and that a serious effort will be made to deal with congestion in the West of Ireland.  I may have referred to Captain Giles to a greater extent than to the others, but one Deputy after the other declared from these <Col N="1412" /> benches that he was not against migration but he thought that the first consideration should be given to the uneconomic holder in Meath, to the labourer in Meath and the landless man in Meath.  In other words, everything should be done for them before there was the smallest attempt to cater for the migration of people from the West.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not heard those statements contradicted.  I am taking them as statements of a responsible Deputy, and that is all I have to go on.  To me this looks as if Deputies from Meath and the other counties where land is available in a large way have made up their minds pretty clearly that the people of the West are not to receive their due consideration. They are regarded as an unclean people who dare not attempt to put a foot on the soil of Meath.  Our store cattle are good enough for them.  They will be prepared at the double ditch, and will not allow a single human being from the West of Ireland to come across.  They get the people to buy their goods here in Dublin, but when it comes to an ordinary, practical piece of business, to relieving those people in the West of Ireland, there is an absence of Christianity and an absence of a spirit of decency in the attitude adopted.  We are concerned in the Land Commission only in so far as there is a possibility of using the Land Commission for the purpose for which it should ordinarily be used, that is, to relieve congestion wherever it is greatest, to relieve the pressure wherever it is keenest, <Col N="1413" /> and the only way to do that is by taking more people out of the poorer lands in the West and putting them in the lands that are available in Meath and elsewhere.  I can say this&mdash;and I challenge contradiction&mdash;in the whole history of the Land Commission operations not 2 per cent. of the landless men who got land in the county of Leitrim or in adjoining counties during the course of those operations were failures. They are all hard-working industrious men, born that way, because if there was not great enterprise in them they would not have lived.  These people are prepared to work the land.  Why not give it to them?  Why give it to the types of people we have heard described here as wasters and loungers, people who will never make good?  I think that that is the greatest condemnation to which the Land Commission has ever been subjected. I do not believe that the Minister or the officials of the Department feel in one bit threatened by the speeches made here by Deputies.  I do not think that they regard as a bit menacing what Deputy Giles has said about gun-men, or that they regard threats of that kind at all.  I feel there is no desire in the Land Commission to deal with this problem seriously.  There is a county with a variety of resources less than any <Col N="1414" /> other county, and with extreme congestion, and the number of migrants taken out of that county in the last five years did not exceed four people. I say that I had great hopes, great anticipations that things would be better done under a native Government; and one of the most outstanding things that needed to be done was to improve the condition of our people in the West, and now, so many years of native Governments have passed and the condition is only improved to a very small degree.  I know that both the Minister and the officials concerned are sympathetic, but there does seem to be some lack of purpose behind them; and, in view of my experience over a number of years, I am still pessimistic that any practical results will be obtained.  I can state emphatically that the one outstanding claim of the people of the West on this nation is to make provision for their economic condition, and the people responsible who have failed in that duty are liable before the country for that failure.</P>
