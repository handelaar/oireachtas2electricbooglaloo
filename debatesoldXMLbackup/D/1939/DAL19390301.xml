      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether subsequent to the conclusion of the Anglo-Irish Agreement last year he renewed his efforts to secure the repatriation of the remains of Roger Casement for interment in Ireland, and if so, with what result; further, whether he is aware that plans are in progress for the demolition of Pentonville Prison, and that if Roger Casement's remains are not recovered and removed before the prison grounds are utilised for other purposes the opportunity will not recur.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  We have repeated our representations.  With regard to the second part of the question, the possibility of the demolition of Pentonville Prison has from the beginning been borne in mind.  My latest information is that there is no likelihood of this demolition taking place for the next three or four years. Meantime, we shall not relax our efforts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the answer, will the Taoiseach say whether in any communications received from the British Government they have indicated, even at this stage, any willingness to surrender the <Col N="1104" /> remains of Roger Casement for interment in this country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that the cost of manufacturing a ton of sugar is over 50 per cent. higher here than in Great Britain, and that the trading profit arising out of same is 100 per cent. higher; and if he will state if it is at his direction or at the direction of his nominees on the board of the company that the company has each year since its inception set aside a sum of money calculated approximately to recoup the original capital expenditure in a period of ten years; and, if so, if he will in the interests of the future of the industry take the necessary steps to secure that costs of manufacture, profit arising out of same, and the financial policy of the company conform more with similar undertakings in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that the British Government under the Sugar Industry (Reorganisation) Act, 1936, set up a commission charged with the duties of keeping under review the growing of sugar beet, and the manufacture, refining, marketing, and consumption of sugar in the United Kingdom, and of advising and assisting the Ministry and Treasury in such matters relating to the sugar industry as may be required of them, and as a result, that <Col N="1110" /> great economies in manufacture and improvements generally in the industry have been effected; and if he will consider the setting up of a similar body to examine into the causes of the excessive cost of manufacture, the high trading profits of the Sugar Company, the heavy burden on the taxpayer, and the unsatisfactory price to the beet grower.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take these two questions together.  I am not aware that the statement made in the first part of the first question is accurate.  It is not possible in the absence of confidential costing information to institute a comparison of manufacturing costs in the two countries, but I might point out that various important items entering into such costs are higher in Éire than in Great Britain; for example, coal, coke, limestone, sacks, wages, mach inery and machine parts.  These differences have been accentuated by the fact that conditions of optimum working have not obtained continuously in our factories.</P>
      <P>As regards trading profit, the statement made by the Deputy is not appreciated.  The reports of the Sugar Commission show profit on trading of £1,245,143 for the year ended 31st March, 1937, and £672,626 for the year ended 31st March, 1938, while the trading profit of Cómhlucht Síuicre Éireann in the corresponding years amounted to £394,183 and £340,649 respectively.  The two trading profits are, however, not comparable, as deductions for taxation, etc., made before arriving at the figures differ in the two countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the remainder of the question, I would refer the Deputy to the reply which I gave on the 7th April last to a question by Deputy Seumas Bourke in which I pointed out that Cómhlucht Síuicre Éireann, Teoranta, was a limited liability company operating under the Companies Acts; that the powers of the Minister for Finance, as laid down in the Sugar Manufacture Act, 1933, provide, <i>inter alia,</i> for the acquisition of a hmited amount of share capital and for the appointment of a certain number of <Col N="1111" /> members of the board so long as the Minister holds a certain proportion of the share capital under the Act; and that apart from these powers, the Minister's powers are those of an ordinary shareholder and the board, as in the case of an ordinary company, has full responsibility for the management of its affairs.  In reply to a supplementary question by Deputy Bourke, I indicated that there would be as little Governmental interference as possible and that the directors would be left free to operate the undertaking entrusted to them and to develop it in the same way as a purely privately owned company would.</P>
    <P>As regards the Deputy's second question, I am aware of the commission to which he refers, but I am not aware that it had the results he indicates.  In reply to his suggestion as to the setting up of a similar commission in this country, I would refer him to the answer which I gave to a like suggestion by Deputy Bourke on the occasion which I have just mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the Minister interested from the taxpayer's point of view?  Seeing that the industry is costing the taxpayer £1,000,000 a year, is it not necessary to see that the company operating this industry is working efficiently and economically?  I think the Minister can satisfy himself that the cost of manufacture is far higher and that the profit arising out of the operations of the company is infinitely higher than that in any other country in the world and that the grower of beet is getting a relatively bad price. In face of those facts, I do not think that the expenditure of £1,000,000 a year is justified.</P>

      <P>Grants for road works schemes are provided in those areas in which there are likely to be sufficient numbers of unemployment assistance recipients on the register to form gangs of economic dimensions for the particular works in hands.  Roads rural schemes and minor employment schemes together form a joint programme for the provision of employment schemes in rural areas and non-urbanised towns.  The location of each separate work of either of these kinds is conditioned by the distance that a workman can reasonably be expected to travel to and from the work each day; and for the rural areas the district electoral division has been adopted as the unit of area for distribution of the moneys available.  The numbers of unemployment assistance recipients in any electoral division are known from a special census, which is generally taken each year during the winter months, when the register is near its maximum. The grant assigned to each area is broadly in proportion to the number of unemployment assistance recipients available.  The placing of minor employment schemes and roads (rural) schemes, respectively, is arranged between the Department of Local Government and the Office of Public Works, the general principle being to facilitate the councils in the selection of sites for roads (rural) schemes within the eligible areas as defined above.</P>

      <P>In the Scotstown district of County Monaghan, where my Department's congested areas seed distribution schemes is in operation, a supply of seed potatoes at reduced prices for small holders has been made available. While this distribution is intended mainly as a means of introducing and demonstrating the use of improved varieties of seed and is not meant as <Col N="1114" /> a relief scheme in the proper sense, it will obviously help in the necessitous cases in that area.</P>
      <P>It is not the function of my Department to provide relief for necessitous persons.  I am satisfied from inquiries which I caused to be made locally that, although crops have suffered to some extent, there are ample supplies of seed potatoes in the county.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill, to my mind, is a very bad and a very unpopular Bill, and the Government would be well advised to withdraw it.  It is going to affect people who are already overburdened with taxes.  In the cities and towns it will affect professional <Col N="1125" /> men, working men and citizens who took advantage of the Housing Acts to build or to improve their homes.  In the country, the Bill is also very unpopular and is creating a feeling of uncertainty amongst farmers, especially those who go in for cattle raising.  Conditions have changed in connection with that industry, and farmers who want to get into the British store market have to adopt new methods.  They have to provide more housing accommodation for cattle in the winter, and to put the stock on the market earlier than was the rule in the past.  The day when four-year-old bullocks were fattened here has gone.  Irish farmers have now to compete with Canada and other countries in the British market.  British stock owners can get suitable cattle in Ireland. Our cattle suit the climate there, but to have stock in proper condition in the early spring, they must be well fed and well housed.  Farmers are not prepared to put up additional houses if they have the feeling that in a year or three years they are going to be taxed for doing so.  They have the fear that they are going to be taxed out of existence if, in order to compete in the world market, they put up housing to enable them to have their stock in proper condition.  Farmers are affected in other ways.  In districts where potatoes are extensively grown the old custom was to feed potatoes to stock.  This was the severest winter we had for many years, with heavy frost and heavy rain, and many farmers, when they opened their pits in the fields, found that the potatoes were rotten.  The alternative is to build proper potato houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only alternative to that is to build proper potato houses and, according to this Bill, you will be liable to extra taxation on those houses.  It also affects the dairy farmer.  Under the Milk Regulations Act farmers had to improve their cowsheds or else go out of producing milk, whichever they liked.  It cost a good deal of money to improve the cowsheds and now they are afraid they are going to be taxed for that improvement.  They feel that the farmer has no security. <Col N="1126" /> He does not know where he is or what he is up against.  The sooner the Government withdraws this Bill the better it will be for them and the country.  There is a feeling in the country that farmers should be encouraged to put up haysheds and cattle sheds.  They fear that, if they borrow the money to do this or if they do it out of their own savings, they will be taxed on the re-valuation which is sure to come.</P>
    <P>I would advise Fianna Fáil and every member of that Party to study this leaflet, which was circulated before the 1932 election, when they were telling the people the way to reduce taxation, and that the only way was to put Fianna Fáil in power.  I wonder what the poor people who put them in think to-day of that reduced taxation.  They were to decrease taxation by £2,000,000 a year, but what do we find?  It is going up in leaps and bounds every year and there is no sign from this Bill that they are satisfied yet.  They are going to bleed the people further.  It is nearly time for this Government to waken up to facts and to think of all those grand promises in this and other leaflets that were distributed to the country, telling what they were going to do for the poor people, how they were going to help the unemployed, and how they were going to help the workers, the industrialists and the farmers.  First of all, you had six years of an economic war that led this country into debt.  The towns, villages and cities have been feeling the effects for the last two or three years.  In addition to that, you had ten months of the worst weather in living memory.  You all must know that to have this country prosperous agriculture must be prosperous. The farmers must be in a position to make money to pay a living wage to the agricultural worker.  You have no money in circulation in this country if the farmer is down and out. I see nothing in the policy of Fianna Fáil since they got into power but to depress the farmer, to try to get him on the road to ruin, which they have almost done.  It is nearly time for this Government to waken up and, instead of putting more taxes on the <Col N="1127" /> people, come to their assistance right away and not collect the taxes or rents for the next two or three years. The rents have been raised until the farmer is unable to pay them.  Surely they should not be further depressed by trying to get through the flying squad what is not there, by seizing the farmer's stock and putting him in a worse position.  That is not going to make this country prosperous.  There are many farmers in this country to-day, especially in my own county, who do not know where to turn to get seeds and manure for their land.  They have no credit and they have no money and their seed has been destroyed by the bad season.  My advice to this Government would be to withdraw this Bill and instead of increasing taxation reduce it and keep to their promise in this leaflet.  If they do that they will be doing a good day's work.</P>

      <P>Faoi'n mBille seo tá a lán ráidhte ach tá faitíos orm na daoine is mó a dteastuíonn rud eicínt a rádh ar a son, sin iad an fíorbhocht, nár dhubhradh go leor fútha. Má thagann an Bille seo i bhfeidhm ní bheidh siad ann le tada a rádh ar a son, mar cuirfidh na rátaí bhéas i ndiaidh an Bhille seo o theach is talamh iad.  Tá sé dhá thabhairt isteach in am nach bhfuil tada ag na daoine.  Rud ar bith a bhí aca tá sé anois caithte aca, mar an méid a rinne an Riaghaltas seo dhóibh, rud ar bith a bhí le díol aca a chur faoi chois agus gan ceathrú cuid a luach fháil air.  Sna blianta seo atá caithte ní raibh pighinn aca le fáil ar bheithíoch, ná ar chaora, ná ar mhuca.  Maidir le na huibheacha ní bhfuightheá cúig chéad ubh faoi láthair ón Spidéal go dtí Ceann Léime, agus tá fhios go mb'iongantach an áit uibheacha é seo sna blianta atá caithte. Go leor de na sean-daoine tháinig romhainn mhair siad ar na huibheacha. Nuair a chuir an Riaghaltais iallach orainn sé phunt a thabhairt do Sheán Buidhe i ngeall ar chuile bheithíoch os cionn dá bhlian, chuir sé sin as beithígh an ceanntar seo, mar níor bhféidir beithíoch faoi dhá bhliain a dhíol againne mar bheadh siad ro-bheag.

    <P>
      <Col N="1128" /> Maidir le rud ar bith a bhí siad a dhéanamh leis an bhfairrge tá sé imithe le fán uilig.  Chuir an dream seo Fianna Fáil i ngar leaghadh cubhar na habhann air.  Agus anois tá an tAire ag tabhairt isteach an Bille seo le muid chur síos ar chaoi nach mbeidh muid i ndon ar gceann a chrochadh le linn na ndaoine.  Leath leithscéil atá ag an Aire, ach tá mé ag ceapadh go bhfuil sé níos glice ná go gcreidfí leithscéal ar bith uaidh.  Deirtear an té nach bhfuil láidir go gcaithfe sé bheith glic, ach tá aithmhéal orm go bhfuil seisean glic agus láidir faoi láthair sa Teach seo.  Cén leithscéal is mó atá aige?  Seod é.  Má theigheann an valuation suas go rachaidh na rátaí anuas.  Nach é cheapas muid a bheith bog! Tá béal na fírinne annseo agam. An dá Union is boichte in Éirinn, an dá Union is Gaedhealaighe in Éirinn, an dá Union is mó fíor-Ghaedhealtacht, seod é an valuation a bhí ar na tighthe ionta i mbliain 1924&mdash; £11,758 17s.  Sa mbliain 1938 an valuation atá ortha £13,966 7s.  Sin cúigiú cuid árdú sa valuation sa gcúig bhliana déag, no os cionn £2,500.  Más fíor scéal an Aire ba cheart go dtiocfadh na rátaí anuas sa dá Union seo.  Ach céard a thárla?  I mbliain 1924 9/2 sa bpunt a bhí na rátaí; agus sa mbliain 1938 bhí na rátaí 14/7 sa bpunt&mdash;níos mó go mór i 1938 ná i 1924, níos mó ná oiread go leith.  I 1924 sa dá Union sin híocadh os cionn £5,000 ar rátaí ar thighthe; i 1928 híocadh os cionn £10,000 ar rátaí ar thighthe&mdash;dúbailt na rátaí in imeacht cúig bhliana déag.  Cuireann sé sin ar magadh atá ag an Aire abhaile chuige, mar níl aimhreas nach bhfuil uaidh ach an t-airgead fháil.  Ach má chuireann sé an Bille seo i bhfeidhm ní £10,000 a bhéas muid a íoc ach ar a laighead £30,000, mar gabhfaidh an &ldquo;valuation&rdquo; suas trí huaire agus gan aimhreas ní thiocfaidh na rátaí anuas. Tugaim-se fuagra don Aire má dhéanann sé seo nach mbeidh na daoine i ndon é íoc mar ní bheidh sé aca.  Gan aimhreas tá sé ag cur a shúla thar a chuid.  Tá fhios ag Teachtaí Fianna Fáil as an gceanntar sin chó maith is tá fhios agam-sa gurb 'eod í an fhírinne ach níl misneach aca a rádh.  Ní féidir fuil a bhaint as turnap; <Col N="1129" /> mar seo ní féidir rud a bhaint de na daoine nach mbeidh aca.  Suas go dtí seo ba iad an dá Union seo an dá Union is fearr a d'íoc na rátaí i gCo. na Gaillimhe&mdash;go leor leor de na daoine dhá n-íoc agus ag tabhairt anshógh dhóibh féin is dhá muirghín, dhá gcur féin go dtí n-a mbionda agus thairis go minic, ag iarraidh é a chruinniú. Ach nuair a fheicfeas siad anois an t-ualach a bheas ortha tuithfidh an driúll ar an dreall aca agus déarfa siad go bhfuil sé chó maith dhóibh féin iad a bháthadh le n-a gcaitheadh.  Anois tá fhios ag chuile Theachta sa Teach seo a raibh éinní le déanamh aige le Acht na dTithe (Gaeltacht), 1929, gurb é an chéad cheist a d'fhiafruigh na daoine a n-árdófaí an &ldquo;valuation&rdquo; ortha go mór.  Dubhradh leo nach ndéanfaí agus ba ar an ngealladh sin a chuaidh go leor aca ag obair, mar fuair siad an oiread sa sean-aimsir ón gcíos go raibh faitíos ortha roimh na rátaí.  Anois tá dream Fianna Fáil ag dul ag briseadh a bhfocail leo agus an méid gealladh a thug siad a riamh dhóibh go mbeadh chuile rud aca ar leath a luach.  Ach is olc iad na gealla bréagach'&mdash;más fad' díreach an bóthar isé an tslí mhór an aithgiorra.  Cuimhním go maith ag líonadh fuirm do shean-fhear atá anois ar shlí na fírinne. Dubhairt sé liom: &ldquo;A Josie,&rdquo; adeir sé, &ldquo;bhfuil tú siúráilte nach n-árdófar go mór an `valuation'.&rdquo;&ldquo;Sin é gealladh an riaghaltais,&rdquo; adeirim-se, &ldquo;atá faoi láthair againn.&rdquo; Ba shin é i mbliain 1930.  Dubhairt sé: &ldquo;Ar éigin a chreidim é,&rdquo; adeir sé.  &ldquo;Tá súil agam nach cáirde atá ann,&rdquo; adeir sé, &ldquo;mar más eadh, tagann an cháirde ach ní maithtear na fiacha.&rdquo;  Níl baol go maithfidh an tAire seo aon fhiacha ar chaoi ar bith, ach iad a chur suas trí huaire chó hárd is tá siad.  Ní thuigeann sé an tír, go mór-mhór an tír bhocht mar tá sí faoi láthair&mdash;go leor de na daoine nach bhfiul fata aca le cur ina mbéal.  Ach ní airigheann sughach sáthach anshógh an ocrais. Gan aimhreas tá an bhliain seo i ngar chó dona le bliain an droch-shaoil ach mar dubhairt Easbog Chluain Fearta le gairid: &ldquo;Ná ceapadh an tAire gurb é Baile Atha Cliath Éire.&rdquo;  Ní hé, míle buidheachas le Dia.</P>
    <P>Anois faoi bhaile mór na Gaillimhe <Col N="1130" /> is a leitheide, cuirfear iad seo de dhruim seoil uilig.  Tá go leor siopaí annseo cheana atá ag coinneál a gcuid doras oscluithe ar éigin agus nuair a thiocfas an &ldquo;valuation&rdquo; nua seo ortha tá faitíos orm go n-eireoidh an rud céanna dhóibh a d'eirigh do &ldquo;factory&rdquo; na holna, sin é, a dhoras a dhúnadh.  Maidir leis an gCladach&mdash; an ceanntar ar cuireadh go leor de na daoine amach as a gcuid tighthe beaga in aghaidh an dtola, cuid aca ar caitheadh dlí a chur ortha sara n-imeoidís asta go ndéanfaí tighthe nua dhóibh&mdash;nuair a hárdófar an &ldquo;valuation&rdquo; ortha seo gan aimhreas ní bheidh siad i ndon a íoc, mar ar a laghad dúblófar an &ldquo;valuation&rdquo; atá ortha faoi láthair.  Cá bhfuigheadh na daoine bochta an méid seo airgid le n-íoc?  Agus mar a chéile na tighthe nua a rinneadh ar an mBóthar Mór; tá na daoine seo chó bocht faoi láthair agus nach bhfuil cuid aca i ndon teine a choinneál leo féin más fíor a bhfuil ráidhte.  Céard éireochas dóibh seo ach a dhul 'un báin is gan áit aca le dhul.</P>
    <P>An &ldquo;valuation&rdquo; atá ar an talamh i gConamara faoi láthair, tá sé beag ach bheadh sé níos lugha dá gcuirtí faoi &ldquo;valuation&rdquo; anois é mar nuair a bhí Griffith dhá chur faoi &ldquo;valuation&rdquo; bhí luach mór agus cáil ar an bhfeamuinn, agus tá fhios ag muintir Oifig an Valuation é seo.  Anois níl díol ar bith ar an bhfeamainn.  Ní maith liom nach bhfuil an Teachta Peadar O Lochlainn sa Teach, mar tá fhios aige go maith gur minic a chonnaic sé Céibh Bhaile Uí Bheacháin, an Chéibh Nua agus Céibh an Chorainn lán le báid feamuinne le feamuinn as Conamara.  Ach tá an saol sin caithte faríor, o tháinig an guano agus leasú na málaí.  Anois d'iarrfainn ar an Aire, má tá blas suime aige sa gceanntar seo, an Bille seo a tharraingt ar chúl.  Nuair a théigheas daoine síos as Baile Atha Cliath agus a leitheide d'áit, nach 'éard deireann siad: Cén chaoi bhfuilmuid beo chor ar bith sa gceanntar bocht sin.  Ach má bhí sé bocht roimhe seo beidh seacht mbochtaineacht air i ndiaidh an Bhille seo. Chuile dhuine ag magadh is ag fiodmhagadh <Col N="1131" /> faoi'n nGaeltacht agus faoi'n nGaedhilg agus gan de shuim ag an gcuid is mó aca inti ach an oiread le madadh Sheáin Dan, ach go leor aca ag déanamh go leor is go leor aisti. Rud ar bith a fuair muid ariamh&mdash; agus ní bhfuairmuid ach an beagán&mdash; tá chuile dhuine ina dhiaidh orainn tá sé ina &ldquo;Oineach Uí Bhriain agus a dhá shúil ina dhiaidh&rdquo;.  Tá mé ag iarraidh ar an Aire gan an Bille seo a chur i bhfeidhm; mara ndéana sé ar son na mbeo é ba cheart dó é dhéanamh ar son na marbh.  Agus cuimhnigh nach mbeadh sé sa Teach seo marach an Piarsach agus gur go dtí an Ghaeltacht a chuaidh an Piarsach le féachaint le maith a dhéanamh ortha, ní le n-a scrios é mar tá an tAire ag dul a dhéanamh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJRogers" hpid="Mr. Rogers Mr. Rogers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rogers</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to oppose this Bill.  I think it is a most unjust Bill. It is a Bill which is going to put a further burden on the farmers, the farmers who have worked hard and have built decent dwellinghouses for themselves and decent out-offices for their cattle, the farmers who have built hay barns.  We are now to have an army of officials going round the country revaluing these buildings and I believe that these officials are going to do their duty, are going to earn their money and are going to put taxes on the farmers.  I am surprised that the Government should have thought of putting through a Bill of this kind. Think of the case of the unfortunate farmer who tried to build a decent dwellinghouse on the side of a mountain, who had no horse or cart, and had to carry his stuff up and down the side of the mountain.  Now, because that man has managed to build some little outhouse or out-office, his property is going to be revalued, and he will be made to pay, and pay heavily. I am surprised that a native Government should attempt to put a Bill like this through.  Take the case of a poor boy in the country who comes to a town and gets married and builds up a little business through his own industry. That man is now going to be heavily taxed.  Not alone is he going to be heavily taxed as a direct result <Col N="1132" /> of this Bill, but he is also going to have to pay more to the Electricity Supply Board.</P>
      <P>I think that the Minister should have more consideration for this country. To prove that, I may mention that the Sligo Corporation&mdash;80 per cent. of whom are behind the Fianna Fáil Government to-day&mdash;have instructed me to oppose this measure.  That resolution was passed on the 18th of January, 1939, and was duly signed by the town clerk.  I submit that that shows that the Corporation of Sligo, 80 per cent. of whom, as I have said, are Fianna Fáil and supporters of the present Government, are opposed to this Bill.  On these grounds, I think one could presume that a great many of the supporters of the present Government would be against this Bill. Accordingly, I think that this Bill should be withdrawn.  I think it is going to inflict a lot of hardship and injustice on the people of this country, and especially on the farmers of the country.  The farmers of this country fought through the economic war for the last four or five or six years, and now they are going to be taxed on their out-offices and farm buildings.  I would appeal to the Minister, and to the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, to withdraw this Bill.</P>

      <P>We have just heard two speakers from some of the poorest parts of the country referring to this Bill.  Deputy Mongan can go home and tell the people of Connemara what the effects of this Bill will be, but that is not going to have any effect so long as the Bill goes through.  Galway sent five voices, or five votes, into the Fianna Fáil Party, and their decision is going to dictate what is to happen in Galway or in Connemara as a result of this new taxing measure.  The Minister for Finance told us, early in February, that the present cadastre of valuations is an indefensible anachronism, which is injurious to the credit of our public authorities, and tends to impede all social progress.  I suggest that the Minister's attitude with regard to this Bill is a degradation of Parliament, and that the only anachronism in this House, so far as I see, is the <Col N="1133" /> dumb mouths and hang-dog attitude of Deputies sent into an Irish Parliament in discussing important matters of this kind.  I suggest that the kind of dumb tongue and hang-dog attitude one sees now in this House is reminiscent of the days of Hamar Greenwood, or of the landlords and the battering ram.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am discussing things that are important to this country.  The Minister, in his speech, mentioned certain anachronisms, and I say that the only anachronism is that this is somewhat like the days of Hamar Greenwood, so far as concerns the denial of things that have actually happened.  That is the attitude of the Minister with regard to this measure. What did the Minister say about this measure?  In effect, the Minister said that the object of this measure was to settle the relativity of rates&mdash;not to increase income tax or rates, and so on, but that, actually, strictly speaking, as he suggested, it might result in reducing rents and, as he said, would do away with certain inequities and inequalities.  As I have remarked already, the person who can talk in that way about this measure is adapting to Irish life the methods of Hamar Greenwood.  In my opinion, not alone is this going to mean extra taxation, but it is going to take at least £300,000 out of pockets of persons who occupy houses for rent or of people who are owners of houses and occupy them.  It is going to mean at least that.  Does the Minister deny that? The Minister, of course, would have been delighted if he had this measure in 1932.  He modestly admits that, if he had had this measure in 1932 he would have got another £500,000 out of the rate-payers; but in the meantime he took other means of getting money from the tax-payers.  He got something out of the owners of business premises, and he got something out of everybody when he put on the 25 per cent. a couple of years ago.  Now he is going, <Col N="1134" /> as it were, to finish the job, and the finishing up of the job means that he is going to get the rest of this money from the people who are renting houses at the present time and from owner-occupiers of houses at the present time.</P>
      <P>I say, therefore, that when the Minister made his remarks about the taxing capacity of the people with regard to this measure he was misleading the House.  The Minister says that 1932 has been responsible for increasing the taxation of the people of this country by £4,000,000 a year. Now, in the last year it was £4,041,000 more than in the year when he took office.  Not alone that, but the rate-payers of this country, during the same period, have had to pay £1,173,331 more in rates&mdash;so that, in money that actually comes out of the people's pockets, in payment either to the State or to local authorities, despite all the protestations of the Minister and the members of his Government and his Party that taxation was going to be reduced, the amount of money that has been taken out of the pockets of the people last year would amount to £5,213,300 more than was taken out of their pockets before we had the blessing of a Fianna Fáil Government coming into office.  The Minister says that it is not going to increase the rates.  Does the Minister seriously mean that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has happened during the last few years with regard to rates?  I pointed out that the amount taken out of the people's pockets in rates last year above the amount in 1931-1932 was £1,172,000.  Of that, £612,319 came out of the pockets of those who paid rates to county councils.  That is, that for every £100 they paid in 1931-1932, they had to pay £126 in the year ending March, 1938; and in the urban districts and county boroughs, for every £100 paid in 1931-1932, £125 had to be paid in the year ending March, 1938.  The current year is going to be worse.  The only people we have information about at present are those who pay rates to county councils.  The people who pay rates to county councils are going to pay, according to the <Col N="1135" /> warrant when every reduction has been made for credit notes and other things, £240,000 more than they paid the year before; so that in the year ended March, 1939, the payers of rates to the county councils for every £100 they paid in 1931-1932 are going to pay £134 and a few shillings extra.  That is as far as rates are concerned.</P>
    <P>But when we leave the county councils and take those bodies particularly concerned with borrowing for what are called public services a rather interesting position discloses itself. When we take the county boards of health, county boroughs, urban districts, and towns other than urban districts and see what they are getting from the urban ratepayers in the case of urban districts and from the county ratepayers in the case of boards of health, we find that the rates increased £561,328 between 1932 and 1937.  It is only up to 1937 that we have this information.</P>

I am asking the Minister to realise that this is a definite indication that, no matter what he says here, the rates are going to go up, and that, as well as the <Col N="1136" /> money he is going to take out of income-tax payers' pockets as a result of the measure, he is going to take infinitely bigger sums out of both urban and rural payers of taxes.</P>

      <P>I am going to relate it to the Valuation Bill.  I am saying that boards of health, county boroughs, urban districts, and towns with local government handled in the year ending March, 1937, £561,328 of money taken out of the ratepayers' pockets more than they did five years before that.  Where did it go? £579,908, that is the whole of that money plus an additional £22,927, went for the payment, in an increasing amount, of borrowed moneys.  Actually, when these two figures are compared, instead of dealing with the ordinary current expenses of these local bodies at the time, the moneys raised in that way were raised to pay money on additional capital expenditure at that particular time.  Even when we take into consideration increased rents as a result of the houses built and make allowance for the increased cost of repairs, the position was that, out of £560,000 additional raised by taxation, only £22,000 was available for spending on the actual current work of local government.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures seem to me to be very relevant to the Vote for the Minister for Local Government, but the Deputy so far has failed to relate them to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to relate them to this Bill.  I bring that forward as an index of the pressure which is on local authorities at present to take more money out of the people's pockets for work, if you like, of a constructive kind.  I say that the people are not able to bear it, and that the Valuation Bill is going to make it easier for that to be done.  I want to refer to what happened in Waterford in order to show that.  It might be easier for you, Sir, if I had stated what <Col N="1137" /> happened in Waterford first, and then passed on to the position of local authorities.  This is what happened in Waterford.  Waterford was revalued in 1926, and the Minister, in column 275, when he referred to the revaluation of Dublin in 1915 or 1916 and the revaluation of Waterford in 1926 stated it was important to note that this revaluation was on the basis of pre-war money values in both areas.</P>
      <P>What happened in Waterford?  The average valuation for the three years ended March, 1926, was £51,260.  After the revaluation of Waterford the average valuation for the three years ended March, 1929, was £77,368.  Now the average amount of money that was taken out of the pockets of the rate-payers of Waterford for the three years ending March, 1926, was £46,828.  That meant an average rate for those three years of 19/8 in the £.  For the three years following the revised valuation of 1926 the average amount of money taken in rates out of the pockets of the Waterford ratepayers was £58,767.  That works out at an average rate of 16/1. The Minister in his talks to the House says that when the valuation goes up the rates go down in the same proportion. Unfortunately, in Waterford, the anticipated drop of 6/7 in the £ in the rates did not come about.  There was a drop of only 3/7.  If the valuation of Waterford had remained as it was and the average amount of rates taken out of the pockets of the people of Waterford during the three years following the revaluation had to be assessed on the old valuation, the rates in Waterford, instead of being 19/8, as they had been for the three years ending March, 1926, would have risen to 24/9 in the £. Now the Waterford people would not face a rate of 24/9 in the £.  But they were meeting what was the equivalent of that figure when they were paying 16/1 in the £ on the new valuation. That is the case of Waterford valued at the pre-war level and that is the case of Waterford with the additional social services pressure on it with the three years ending March, 1929.  The Minister said the rate will not go up except you have squandermania&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Minister meant was that he wanted to blind this House to the fact that the widening and broadening of the basis of the valuation estimate was going to provide an opportunity for the official machinery of Government policy to take more money out of the pockets of the ratepayers throughout the country, when it had come to the step where there was no other pocket except the pockets of the owners of houses to be searched after all the searching that has been done in the last seven years.  But what is intended and what will happen is that as soon as the increase in valuation takes place, it will be easier for the official screw there on top to extract more moneys out of the ratepayers' pockets. At any rate, that is the hope and that is the plan.  The Minister implies that it may reduce the rents.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mongan talked about what was going to happen in the case of the Gaeltacht houses, and he mentioned a particular section of the Bill under which certain concessions were given to housing.  Amongst other matters the Bill provides that the valuation of houses in the Gaeltacht will be increased; there is no provision for any valuation being decreased.  The Bill specifically mentions the lines upon which the valuation of houses will be increased whether they were new houses or old houses.  In column 260, No. 2 of Volume 74, the Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The increase, therefore, in the income-tax liability of individual <Col N="1139" /> citizens will, in general, be negligible. Where no part of a person's total income is derived from ownership of house property the new cadastre will not affect his income tax liability in any way.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I interjected &ldquo;or his rent?&rdquo; and the Minister replied, &ldquo;except, strictly speaking, to reduce his rent.&rdquo; And by way of appropriate comment on that I asked &ldquo;by what percentage?&rdquo; The Minister said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That is a matter that remains to be seen, when the revaluation is complete and is in operation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Does the Minister think that there is a single rented house in this country where the rent is to be reduced as a result of the operation of this Bill?  I know he does not, and when I asked him &ldquo;by what percentage?&rdquo; I do not suggest that I believed him for a moment in the slightest degree.  I thought it the best way of making him realise what I did mean by forcing him to work it out by some calculation&mdash;if he had not already gone beyond the calculation point and that he knew it was not necessary to make a calculation. What is going to happen certain rents?  In the City of Dublin at the present moment a person derives, let us say, his income from ten houses of £30 valuation.  Assume that that person is in the position that he has, in fact, an income of £50 from every house.  In that case while under the present scheme his income for income-tax purposes would be £300, that is, calculated on the valuation of his houses, his actual income would be £500.  The income-tax people can only deal with him on the £300 basis. Let us take it that his commitments brought him to the point that the £300 left him at the point at which he would not be liable for any income-tax.  Let us say&mdash;and I am giving moderate figures compared with what happened in Waterford at the pre-war valuation rates&mdash;that the valuation of each of these houses was going to be increased to £50.  Then his income for income-tax purposes would be £500.  He would in that way be brought £200 above the pre-1926 level that we were <Col N="1140" /> assuming before.  That is, he would be liable for an income-tax of £45 at the 4/6 rate of income.  Now who is going to pay that £45?  Is the house still to be controlled at the new valuation of £50?  If not, does the Minister in the case of a person enjoying an income of £500 from ten houses&mdash;and finding that he is forfeiting in taxation £45 of that income&mdash;really think that that person is not going to take out that £45 in increased rent if he can? At any rate we are in the situation in which the Minister suggests that rents may be reduced as a result of the operation of this Bill.  I want to know even assuming that this house is still going to be controlled at £50, who is going to be forced to pay this £45? Evidently, it is the owner of the property, but what position is he going to be in in relation to the person who has the house rented from him?</P>
    <P>Now, take the person whose house is beyond control.  Let us say the valuation of this house is £31.  In that case, if there is an increase in his valuation to £50, the owner of the house will be liable to pay £42 15/-, assuming that the £300 brought him to the limit of exemption.  Who is going to pay that £42 15/- in the case of that uncontrolled house?  The owner of the house has had an income of £500 up to the present, and is going to be asked to pay the Revenue Commissioners £42 15/-.  What is going to happen there?  Do not tell me that that is a case in which the rent is going to be reduced.  In this rent question we are up against one of the most important things in the Bill, because the whole of the additional amount of money that is going to be taken for income tax under this Bill is going to come proximately out of the pockets of the people who either own their own houses or who have houses to rent&mdash; that is the classes that have been escaping the Minister up to the present.  If you are below the limit either to rent a house at the ordinary market rent or to buy a house you can get assistance from the public authority to provide you with a house.  If you are in the position of being the owner of business premises, well then, it does not matter, because if the <Col N="1141" /> thing does affect you in any way you can pass on your increased costs either to reducing your Schedule D payments to the Revenue Commissioners, or you can pass it on to the public, so that the people who either rent a house or the people who own a house are the people who are going to be hit, as far as income-tax and rent are concerned at the present time.  In spite of that, the Minister can bring himself to make even the shadow of a suggestion here in this House that rents are going to be reduced.</P>
    <P>The next Hamar-Greenwoodism in this matter is that there are inequalities in the present situation that this Bill is going to remedy.  I wonder does the Minister know anything at all about it.  We are led to understand that there is a scheme of things in the minds of modern valuation experts that is going to level out all the inequalities, all the inefficiencies and all the injustices of local taxation and, I may say, all the income tax burdens at the same time.  This was the point that the Minister most relied on. However, perhaps I had better get one thing out of the way before I deal with Irish realities.  There was a paper read the other night at the Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland on &ldquo;Rating and Valuation.&rdquo; Now this is not a political body in any way. Things are discussed there with academic detachment.  With regard to this new equality-securing business of the Minister, we read here:</P>
    <P>Critics of the present rating system have condemned it as &ldquo;illogical,&rdquo;&ldquo;antiquated&rdquo; and &ldquo;unfair.&rdquo; The allegations are hard to refute. They say it has outgrown the times for which it was created and that modern changes in economic and social conditions have rendered the system obsolete and wholly out of accord with the times.</P>
    <P>The writer of the paper is Mr. Harry Lisney, F.S.I., who, at any rate, is nearly as expert in valuation as the Minister.</P>

      <P>Then I must say that the Minister can find support in the queerest possible collection of words if he finds support either for his outlook or his Bill in the statement which I have quoted.  I take it that the comfort the Minister was looking for was in the last part of the quotation:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The economic and industrial changes which have taken place since its introduction and early development.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister tell us if the economic and industrial changes during the last six years here, or the early possible economic changes foreshadowed by the Minister for Industry and Commerce this morning, implying some of the things that we have had suggested to us here in this House during the last couple of weeks in regard to world circumstances, have anything to do with the justice or otherwise, the fairness, the logical nature of, or the modern nature of the thing that is proposed here?  We are told that by allowing the <Col N="1143" /> Valuation Office to have a free hand in valuing buildings, in valuing everything, other than land in the country during the next seven years, that we will make up for a century of backwardness; that not only will we be translated to true 20th century values in our general outlook, but that we will be brought almost to the very threshold of the 21st century.</P>
    <P>That is what can be said about the system by an Irish student of valuation here.  This is what other people think about it, in Great Britain where the scheme came from.  The same paper refers to two Royal Commissions that were set up in 1901 and in 1914. It says that, in the case of the 1901 Report, nine members voted in favour of the retention of the present system and six against.  In the case of the 1914 Report, seven members were for retaining the present system and six against.  Then we come to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that he is twisting that sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to give the Minister the opportunity to explain what he means.  Does he desire me to allow him the opportunity of explaining how I am twisting the sentence?  No.  The Royal Commission of 1901 stood by a majority of nine to six for the &ldquo;illogical,&rdquo;&ldquo;antiquated&rdquo; and &ldquo;unfair&rdquo; scheme, and the Royal Commission of 1914 by a majority of seven to six stood for the same thing.  Then we come to 1936, and as regards the Finance Committee of the London County Council who have a certain interest in this matter, it says of them:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The last attempt to take action was made in July, 1936, when the council expressed the opinion that the present rating system was inequitable in its incidence, and passed a resolution calling on the Government to introduce legislation to empower local authorities to levy a rate on site values.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>There was a certain lack of sympathy, I understand, but it goes on:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Undismayed by this lack of sympathy, the London County Council <Col N="1144" /> returned to the attack, and on the 26th July, 1938, the council decided by a large majority to promote legislation in the 1938-39 session of Parliament to provide for the rating of site values in the administrative county, including the City of London and the Inner and Middle Temples.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is Great Britain.  As regards Scotland, Glasgow was interested in it earlier.  London is interested in it now.  I am not too clear as to what it means in the matter of an alternative, but I am clear that it somewhat backs up the suggestion that the present rating system is, as was quoted here before, illogical, antiquated and unfair.  I will leave it at that.</P>
    <P>I want to look at just a few facts in the situation that will prepare us for what we may expect, if anything can prepare us for what we may get from the Fianna Fáil administration.  There was a valuation in Belfast, and we are able to compare here the increase in valuation in Belfast from 1931 to 1937, and from 1931 to 1938 in the Twenty-Six Counties.  In the Six Counties, in the rural districts, between 1931 and 1937, the valuation rose by 21.4 per cent.; in the urban districts by 60.5 per cent., and in the country as a whole by 41.2 per cent.  I am told that so far as Belfast was concerned the re-valuation put up the valuations there by 50 per cent.  When we take, for the purpose of comparison, our condition as regards valuation and the condition in Northern Ireland on 1st April, 1938, we find that the Six-County valuation had gone up by 41.2 per cent., and we had gone up here to the extent of 4.56 per cent.  There was a difference of about 37 per cent. in the increase in the valuation of the country as a whole here as compared with Belfast.  The increase in valuation as a result of the revaluation in Belfast, which was a revaluation up to post-war standard, was 50 per cent. and in Waterford it was 51 per cent.</P>

      <P>Very good.  At any rate Waterford, on a pre-war valuation, went up 51 per cent.  Now, it and the rest of the country are going to be revalued on a post-war valuation basis and we are warned by the Minister that this rise of 50 per cent. in Belfast was from an 1894 basis, but that the rise that we are going to get is to be from an 1852 basis.  We know what we can expect.  There is a suggestion, on the one hand, that this valuation business is an exact science and, on the other hand, there is a kind of suggestion the Minister would like to make that valuations in this country are not going to be doubled.  I think the Minister would like to resist that suggestion for the moment, and possibly he would like to suggest there is not much in the talk about income-tax and an increase of rates here and, indeed, there may be a reduction in rents.  But what you are going to get is a doubling of your valuation rather than, as Waterford got on a pre-war basis, an increase of 50 per cent.</P>
      <P>We hear a lot about the exact science of valuation.  The Minister, I am sure, has some knowledge of the history of valuations in this country, both in Dublin and in Belfast.  Dublin was revalued in 1916.  When the work was done in Dublin, in 1916, what was the result?  What was the result when Sir John Barton put his findings before the British Treasury?  What did they say? They said: &ldquo;Oh, hell, the Dublin fellows will never stand for this.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, practically. If I got a little more expression into it, it would be a verbatim report.  The British Treasury got the document put up to them by Sir John Barton and they felt that the high-spirited citizens of the City of Dublin were not blooming well going to stand for it; he was handed back his sheets and told to reduce an increase of 25 per cent., to an increase of about 15 per cent., and he did it.  I do not know whether there was anyone there to feel the shock of the Waterford people when the 51 per cent. was added on to their <Col N="1146" /> valuations in 1926, or in Belfast when there was an increase of 50 per cent. In what circumstances was Belfast revalued?  Belfast was going to get an up-to-date and absolutely correct valuation, too.  Did it get it?  The Minister must know very well it did not.  The same type of opinion in the British Treasury that was able to get the kind of shock the Dublin people would have got if their valuations were increased in 1916 by 25 per cent. was able to sense the kind of shock that Belfast would get, and particularly the kind of shock they would have got in the circumstances in which the Valuation Bill was introduced there.  We are not going to get here even as reasonable a jolt in the raising of our valuations as either Dublin got in 1916 or Belfast got in 1931 or 1932.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am saying.  I am saying that I do not know if there was anybody there in 1926 or 1927 sensitive enough in their administrative organisms to feel any fraction of the shock the Waterford people did get.  With that in front of us, so far as valuations generally are concerned, where do we expect this burden is going to fall?  Is it going to fall on the industrialists?  No.  If the Minister knows anything about the history of valuation in this town he must realise that valuation does not necessarily fall as heavily as it might on industrialists.  Surely when the Minister is holding up to local authorities the bait of getting industrialists to go down the country and set up new industries there is going to be that same sensitive feeling regarding the valuation of different industrial concerns under the new valuation scheme as there was in respect of certain industrial concerns here in the past, and the incidence of the increase is going, therefore, to fall on dwellinghouses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had occasion here in discussing in general increases in taxation on the part of the Government which they stated would come out of the pockets of the rich to trace the incidence <Col N="1147" /> of this taxation year after year on to the shoulders of the poor until we have got the admission from the far side: &ldquo;Yes, why should not the workman pay?&rdquo; We have had to point out that every scrap of furniture, every scrap of equipment, that went into an Irish dwellinghouse has been taxed and retaxed in the past few years.  Under this scheme of valuation, as the Minister knows, and as we have had experience in the past, the incidence of the increased valuation will fall on the dwellinghouse, whether in the shape of income-tax in certain cases or as increased rates in other instances.  Equities!</P>
    <P>Then we are asked to consider that land will be excluded from this valuation. I believe that this scheme of not allowing land to be valued at the present time is designed to enable the valuations of farmhouses in the country to be raised rather higher than they might safely be if the land were being valued at the same time.  However, what I want to assert with regard to land is that you cannot put an increased valuation on the small dwelling houses in some of our rural towns or urban areas and take away completely the idea of a valuation of the land outside. What is a dwelling house, in any case? It is simply a shell in which people live, a shelter in which they may raise their families.  If so, there is no element of production in it.  You cannot have land outside a town free from the idea of valuation, free from the idea of having rates paid on it, if you attach, to an excessive extent, the valuation label on our urban towns.</P>
    <P>Why is Dublin being valued first, and Waterford also, in spite of the fact that Waterford was re-valued some short time ago?  Because the country, as a whole, will probably not mind very much the extent to which an increased valuation is imposed in Dublin.  But when the standard is set in Dublin, the Government can move throughout the country.  With the standard fixed on the threshold of the 21st century, as regards valuations on buildings and houses in the country, then land can be dealt with.  Land cannot avoid being dealt with.  It may <Col N="1148" /> be part of the Minister's schemes to say that derating must come, and, therefore, by increasing valuations on dwelling houses in rural areas, he hopes to recoup himself for the loss of revenue due to the derating of land. That may be part of his scheme, but whatever his scheme is, he cannot pile the load on small towns and urban districts, in the condition in which they are at the present time, and let land go free.  It will not be free.  To use a word which Deputy Costello introduced, if there is anything sinister in this measure, as there is, I think the most sinister part is that which leaves out land.  The measure which we have before us is a taxation measure. It is intended to squeeze the last bit that can be squeezed out of the people, to get increased revenue for State purposes.  It is intended to widen in an artificial way, as it were, the channels by which rates are extracted from the people.  The position with regard to borrowing throughout the country shows the pressure there is on our local authorities at present.  That pressure will be increased.  It will be increased by the policy of the Government which pushes more and more over on local authorities the burden of providing relief, which pushes more and more over on local authorities the frills and the fringes of propaganda schemes such as A.R.P. and other matters of that kind.</P>
    <P>Let us look back for a moment on the various banners under which the Fianna Fáil Party have marched.  In their first great march, when they were going &ldquo;another round,&rdquo; we had the banner of &ldquo;nationalism.&rdquo; Then we had the banner of &ldquo;Christianity,&rdquo; and now we have the banner &ldquo;equity.&rdquo; The banner of &ldquo;equity&rdquo; is raised to-day when the people are taxed almost out of existence, when the economic condition of the country is such as to drive people by thousands out of the country and when so many people are unemployed.  Two years ago, taking the number of people who were registered as unemployed, and those working on relief schemes, the total number of persons unemployed was 108,000.  That was the average for every month of the year 1936.  The <Col N="1149" /> average for every month of the year 1938, in the same circumstances, was 107,000.  There had been a fall of 800, but what had happened in the meantime? Fifty-seven thousand people had emigrated and the population of the country had fallen by about 30,000. Yet, the number of people whose economic condition was such that they had either to get assistance of one kind or another, or had to get relief work, stood at 107,000 or 800 less than two years before.  If the Minister wants to measure the financial condition of people, he can look at the position as regards savings, the savings of the people who are going to be hit particularly by this measure, the savings of the middle classes and of the workers.  In 1931, the net savings shown by purchase of savings certificates and Post Office deposits amounted to £1,340,000, while last year the savings had fallen to £574,000.  The savings of the people had fallen that year as compared with the year 1931&mdash; the year before all the increased taxation, before all these economic and social policies of Fianna Fáil were embarked upon&mdash;by 57 per cent. or by £765,000.  Forty-three thousand fewer people were employed in the last four years.  We had been arguing here that the consumption of bacon had gone down by 26 per cent.  The official report disclosed recently that it had gone down by 29 per cent.  The position is similar in regard to bread, butter and milk. In circumstances like these and with the promise of relief of taxation when the economic war was ended, the Minister comes in with this Bill the results of which are plain to be seen by anybody. He covers it over with misrepresentations as to both its contents and its effects.  He talks of anachronisms. The only anachronism we have is to be found in the cowed faces and silent tongues of men who should be Irish representatives and views from the Front Bench of an Irish Parliament which remind us of the views of Hamar Greenwood.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Mulcahy and other Deputies in appealing <Col N="1150" /> to the Minister to withdraw this Bill.  The time of its introduction is inopportune.  The uncertainty of trade in the City of Dublin and the uncertainty regarding the future of many thousands of employed persons should, in themselves, serve as a reason for the withdrawal of the Bill.  We in Dublin are aware that, particularly in the building trade, there is a complete hold-up as a result of the introduction of this measure.  People in business who were considering the building of new premises have had completely to reorganise their whole programme because of the dangers involved in going ahead with big schemes, having regard to the threat of revaluation.  Their schemes were based upon the present valuation.  If their valuations were appreciably increased the amount of rates and income-tax payable would be far beyond what their business could afford.  One must have regard to the small, struggling shopkeepers who improved their premises in the hope that trade would increase.  Trade has not increased, and they have had to pay rates on an increased valuation because of the improvements made. They have also to face the prospect of a further increase as a result of this Bill.  The shopkeepers of Dublin and of the different towns will tell you that they are hard put to it to meet their expenses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies must be aware that this is the most expensive country in the world in which to live.  The cost of foodstuffs has gone beyond the purchasing power of the ordinary working man.  Foodstuffs, which in the past were plentiful in the workman's home, are to-day considered luxuries.  The price of potatoes, bacon and butter in the City of Dublin is extremely high.  These are all things that have to be taken into consideration. There are no purchasers now for many of the things which the small Dublin shopkeeper used to sell.  The municipalities will, whether they like it or not, be immediately faced with a levy by the Government for the expenses of this Bill.  Dublin is expecting a demand for 2½d. in the £ before the corporators have time to meet at all.  I understand that the <Col N="1151" /> cost of the periodic valuations of small property and improvements worked out in Dublin at about £200 a year.  Immediately this Bill is passed that figure will be increased to about £2,000 per year.  When occupants of large houses in the city find their valuations increased, with consequent increases in their rates and income-tax, they will let their houses out in flats, which will possibly be decontrolled. The result will be that people urgently in need of housing accommodation will have to pay higher rents.  The Minister is aware that there is a general hold-up of finance for building in the country.</P>

      <P>It would be helpful to us in Dublin if we heard of the experience of Cork.  We are anxious in Dublin, and I am sure the Government are anxious, to go ahead with big building schemes, but if private building is to be held up and the builders have to depend on municipal schemes, then there is a bad time ahead for those interested in the building trade.  I should like to see more confidence on the part of the investing public.  This Bill makes for uncertainty.  One or two building schemes were recently stopped in the country and people are wondering why.  If private building has to stop and if this uncertainty <Col N="1152" /> continues, the building trade will have to depend on municipal housing schemes and that will be a bad day for the country.</P>
      <P>Some of the speakers have touched upon a matter affecting a very important trade, in connection with which special demands may be made for exemption.  We all know that the licensed trade pay their licence duty on the valuation of their property.  If their valuations be increased there will not only be an increase in their rates and income-tax but their licence duty will also be increased.  That is an imposition of which Deputies will hear in the very near future.  I think the time is not opportune for the introduction of this Bill.  As I have said before, in view of the fact that Ireland&mdash;and Dublin City especially&mdash;is the most costly country in the world to live in, I think the Minister should withdraw the Bill, and give those with money to invest in building some encouragement to go ahead, in the hope that it will take some of the many thousands of unemployed off the market and give them reasonable employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As one who represents an urban area, I rise to welcome the Bill, and I do so because I am satisfied from my experience of local administration that this Bill is very long overdue.  In the urban areas throughout this country there are very grave anomalies which require amendment.  During the discussion on this Bill I have not heard the people who are opposing it adduce any arguments to satisfy me, at all events, that there is no necessity for the Bill. In towns such as the one I represent there are very grave anomalies, and during the discussion on this Bill I have been rather surprised by the attitude of the Labour Leader, Deputy Norton, who seemed to think that his sole interest should be in what be described as the black-coated wage earners.  I would remind Deputy Norton, and remind this House in general, that there is a very important section of the community in every town in this country.  I refer to the working classes or the slum dwellers. I think the Labour Deputies and other. <Col N="1153" /> Deputies who are opposing this Bill should take the trouble to give a little thought to the position with regard to those people and the circumstances under which they are compelled to live in the slum areas.  They should make a comparison between the valuations which they have to meet when occupying slum dwellings and the valuations of the new houses which have been provided largely by the policy of the Government, a policy which was long overdue in respect of most people in this country.  They will find that in many cases the slum dwellers had to meet something like a valuation of 10/-.  What do we find when those same slum dwellers are removed to the new artisans' dwellings?  The valuation of the new artisans' dwellings in the town I represent, at all events, is £5 10/-.  That is an enormous increase in the valuation placed on the shoulders of the slum dwellers.  But we hear no wails of woe from any section of this House in regard to those people.  That is one anomaly which.  I submit, justifies the introduction of this Bill.  Another anomaly which exists is in connection with vacant sites.  We know from experience that vacant building sites in every town throughout this country are deliberately being held up for the express purpose of exploiting their value in connection with the Government's policy of housing.  If any Deputy in this House will take the trouble to look up the valuation sheets and find what those people are paying on those vacant sites, and then compare that valuation with the price which they demand for those sites when they are being acquired for housing purposes, or for playgrounds, or for the building of schools, he will find justification for the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Mulcahy's reference to Hamar Greenwood, I as a one-time colleague of the Deputy would suggest that he would be well advised to draw a veil over such names as Hamar Greenwood in this House or outside it.  What we want here is constructive criticism of the Government's policy, and that should be the object <Col N="1154" /> of every member of this House, instead of dragging in personalities and making capital out of the unfortunate situation which has arisen, and in which the Government finds it necessary to introduce legislation such as this in order to ameliorate that situation.  I was rather of the opinion that the Leader of the Opposition, when he spoke on this Bill, was consistent at all events. The main Opposition in particular have been consistent in this respect, that they are prepared to defend the the vested interests in this country to-day as they did during their ten years of office.</P>
    <P>Now, there is one suggestion which I would make to the Minister, and that is with regard to agricultural land within the borough boundary.  I submit, Sir, that it is not just or equitable that holders of agricultural land within the borough boundary who do not enjoy any of the benefits of agricultural derating or remission of rates are still to be excluded from this Bill. I submit that those people to-day are not in any privileged position, due to the development of rapid transit.  Take for instance a farmer living 30 or even 40 or 50 miles distant from the town, in which a market is held on a certain day, and those farmers with small valuations can in a few hours be competing with the agricultural holder within the borough boundary&mdash;and competing very effectively with them &mdash;when the markets open at 7 o'clock in the morning.  That is an anomaly, and I would appeal to the Minister to give some consideration to the matter so that he can come to the relief of agricultural land holders within borough boundaries.</P>
    <P>We have heard from Deputy Rogers of Sligo that the Sligo Corporation passed a resolution asking him to oppose this Bill.  I respectfully suggest to Deputy Rogers that, if he took the trouble to investigate, through the representatives of Sligo Corporation, the exact valuations which slum dwellers were paying before they were provided with new homes, and compare the figures with the valuations that these people are now paying.  I am quite satisfied, if the investigations were carried out impartially, the <Col N="1155" /> answer would convince even Deputy Rogers that there is justification for this Bill.  With regard to what Deputy Byrne said about Dublin, I suggest that if he got some of his officials to make a comparison between what slum dwellers in old tenements paid, and the valuations on the new houses that have been provided for these people in and on the outskirts of the city, he will find justification for the introduction of this Bill.  I know that Deputy Byrne is a busy man, and that he would not have time to make a comparison, but he can get it done.  In my opinion it is flogging a dead horse to argue against a Bill such as this.  I am quite satisfied from my own experience that this Bill is long overdue, and I welcome it as being just and equitable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHCrowley" hpid="Mr. F. Crowley Mr. F. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to touch upon a few points in connection with this Bill.  One is the question as to how it will affect hotels and the catering trade.  A new Bill dealing with the Irish tourist traffic is about to be introduced, and I am afraid, if the Minister does not take suitable steps, this Bill, as a result of revaluation, will cut right across the benefits that could accrue to hotels.  I appeal particularly to the Minister to take into serious consideration the fact that some of the hotels do only a seasonal trade for four or five months, especially along the sea coast.  The position really is that hotels in these areas are paying as much as if they were busy the whole year, whereas the season only lasts from four to five months.  If some amendment is not introduced into this Bill so as to give consideration to the position of hotel proprietors who carry on a seasonal trade, I am afraid there is not much use in bringing in a Bill to develop the Irish tourist industry.  Under the present valuation system, if a hotel has 40 bedrooms, and if ten additional bedrooms are added to the old building, the old building is revalued and an increased valuation put on it, while there is an addition to the valuation of the new structure.  If there is not some provision made in this Bill to cover a situation like that.  I have the feeling that it is going to do serious damage to the <Col N="1156" /> Irish tourist industry.  For that reason, I appeal to the Minister to take these points into consideration.</P>

      <P>Quite a large number of points have been raised which are really Committee points, and which I will deal with on the Committee Stage.  With regard to the point raised by Deputy Crowley, I should like to assure him that the question whether a hotel is or is not dependent on seasonal traffic is always taken into consideration in fixing the valuation on the premises, and that will continue in future.  However, I shall look into the matter, and if it would appear that the general re-valuation would, in any way, hamper hotel traffic, or tourist traffic, I will not only consider it myself, but I shall bring it under the special consideration of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in connection with the Bill dealing with the tourist traffic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some Deputies who spoke in this debate paid me the compliment of praising the skill with which the case for the Valuation Bill was made in the White Paper, and in the speech which opened the debate.  I should like to reciprocate that courtesy, and to say how highly I admired the quality which was most in evidence in the speeches against the Bill.  It was the high quality of courage.  In the Opposition speeches there was, if I might say so, courage of the most reckless fervour. It was what I might call the courage of Balaclava, the courage that thunders and blunders.  I think it is true to say that in every civilised country you have, in one form or other, taxation for public purposes on immovable property.  We have it here in a somewhat imperfect form, in a somewhat unjust form, so far as the great mass of the people are concerned, and one of the purposes of this Bill is that, since we must have that necessary evil, taxation of immovable property for public purposes, at any rate, we are going to see that the burden of that taxation is justly apportioned.  So far as I know, we have this system of taxation for public purposes of immovable property in every civilised country.  But never, so <Col N="1157" /> far as I know in any country, until now, has there been any responsible political party to be found to enunciate the proposition that, when taxing immovable property, the best way is to go on the basis of the value which that property had 80 years earlier. Yet, it is upon that patently absurd proposition that the Opposition in the Fine Gael Benches, and the Labour Benches, have taken their stand against this Bill.  They, certainly, as I have said, have courage and audacity and both are buttressed by profound ignorance of the whole problem.</P>
    <P>I wonder if those who propound the thesis that, in taxing immovable property in this country, it is best to be 80 years behind the times in their computation of value, realise what the conditions were in Ireland when the present valuation was made.  The poverty was terrible, the agencies for the relief of it were few, and the means, it was said, were scanty.  If a small farmer had a shirt then, it was in rags, like the rest of his clothing. His mud cabin not so much sheltered him as stifled him in its dark and unhealthy shroud.  You had a stagnant, decaying country and, in most areas, a terrible burden of rates.  It was with these conditions Griffith had to deal when he began his gigantic task of making a general re-valuation of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Did Griffith, however, in 1852, adopt as his basis of general re-valuation the value of 80 years before&mdash;the value, say, in 1772?  Not at all.  He was not insane.  He was one of the greatest practical geniuses of his century, whose fame, solidly based upon the work which he did, remains to this day.  If Griffith, in that year, had met Deputy Cosgrave and had been told by him that it was all nonsense to base the valuation upon the 1852 values, that, in fact, 1772 was the critical year, he would simply have said, &ldquo;Deputy Cosgrave is as mad as a hatter,&rdquo; and every farmer in Ireland and every man of sense in the country would have endorsed Griffith's verdict and not without reason, unless he knew Deputy Cosgrave's somewhat peculiar sense of humour, a sense of humour which <Col N="1158" /> governs Deputy Cosgrave's attitude towards this Bill and towards the other measures of reform which from time to time have been introduced from these benches.  Deputy Cosgrave, as former Minister for Finance and as former Minister for Local Government, just like Deputy Mulcahy, knows as well as I do how urgently and pressingly necessary this Bill is.</P>

      <P>This Bill has been met with bitter hostility and unscrupulous misrepresentation from the benches opposite and from the Labour Party.  I expected it would, for it is a measure which, as Deputy O'Sullivan had to admit, is designed to remove injustices and &ldquo;to promote justice as between man and man and citizen and citizen.&rdquo; Failure to do such justice between citizen and citizen as would be right, as this Bill seeks to do, and to right, as this Bill seeks to do, widespread wrongs and inequities, is one of the most active factors in creating discontent among the people.  The Party opposite and the Labour Party trade upon such discontent. They have erected for themselves a vested interest in injustice. Any measure, therefore, which would ameliorate injustice and ease discontent is opposed by them and misrepresented by them, as this Bill has been misrepresented by them, simply because it cuts across their own petty, factional, selfish, Party interests.</P>
      <P>I have been criticised because I have not given detailed examples of the injustices in the removal of which this Bill is the first step.  Why should I waste the time of the House upon that matter?</P>

      <P>I was saying, Sir, why should I waste the time of the House reciting specific instances of injustices when we see those injustices all around us in the hovels and the slums, the working and the middle-class districts of our towns and cities, where the great majority of our people are rated to the uttermost so that they are paying much more than their fair share of the municipal burdens, while the select and fortunate few, whose properties are, by comparison, grossly undervalued, get away with paying much less than, in justice, they should. Why should I waste the time of the House when Deputy after Deputy, getting up to make the case against this Bill, in fact, made the case for the Bill when they told us about the small towns where the local services were in danger of breaking down because the cost of them bears too heavily upon the mass of the people?  That is the case for the Bill, and it has been made by every Deputy who, whether out of innocent ignorance, like Deputy Brown, or calculated malevolence, like Deputy Norton, spoke against the Bill.  They know as well as I, and they have by implication admitted it, that the reason why the local services and the local authorities are in such an unsatisfactory position is that the burden of the local rates is so unfairly distributed, that it presses much too heavily upon the poorer ratepayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite easy to understand why that is so.  The majority of the buildings in our towns are very old, 70, 80, or 100 years old in fact.  They were valued for rating purposes when they were built and the majority of them have not been revalued since.  The valuations put upon them when new&mdash; and they are now old&mdash;approximated very closely to their true net rental values at the dates of their construction, and they have carried those valuations, and they have paid rates upon those valuations during the whole period they have been in existence. Moreover, the poundage of those rates has gone up from 2/- or 3/- in the £, at which it stood when the premises were built, until to-day when it may stand at 20/- or even 25/- in the £. Now I am speaking of the older <Col N="1161" /> hereditaments, perhaps once very fashionable and eagerly sought for and, therefore, rightly carrying a high valuation then, but now mainly to be found in those quarters of our towns or cities which fashion has abandoned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>And, except to poke a little fun at him now and again, in the manner of an innocent joke, I did not try to throw him off his argument. I was saying that the majority of the hereditaments in our towns and cities are, in the main, occupied by the less wealthy elements of the population, the workers, the small shopkeepers, the struggling middle-class families.  They constitute, as any one of us can see, the greater number of the buildings in every town in the Twenty-Six Counties, and they are all valued now&mdash;and I want to repeat and to emphasise it&mdash; as they were when they were first built, 70 or 80 years ago, at their full net rental values, or very near it.  Therefore, they are weighted up to the limit for rates, so that the occupiers of them &mdash;and again I want to repeat it because this is the basis upon which I am defending this Bill&mdash;are bearing very much more than their fair share of the cost of the local services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Contrast the position of these people, the majority, as I have said of the ratepayers in any urban community, <Col N="1162" /> with the favoured few, the privileged classes upon whose behalf Deputy Norton, Deputy Cosgrave and their satellites are opposing this Bill.  They are the occupiers of the newer, the more up-to-date, the more fashionable premises in any town.  Such premises are rated, not upon their true present-day net rental value, or near it, as the older premises in general are rated, but at a written-down value which is perhaps not even equivalent to one-third of the true figure.  Those who occupy these premises, therefore, get away with paying perhaps only half or one-third of what they ought to pay in rates, and, as I have made plain, they get away with that at the expense of those much less fortunate people, the majority of the ratepayers.  The home of the postman living in Ballybough, or in Beggars' Bush; the middle-class business or professional man living in the neighbourhood of Northumberland Road, Palmerston Park or Clyde Road, relatively speaking, is valued up to the hilt, and the occupant thereof is called on to pay his £10, £20, £40 or £60 in rates each year accordingly.  But the palatial premises of the wealthy public company, carrying on business in the centre of the city, making large profits and with huge resources behind it and serving no indispensable public purpose, is valued at one-half or one-third of what it ought to be valued at, and escapes with a payment of £2,000 a year in rates when it ought, in justice, to pay at least £4,000 or £5,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that such an inequitable distribution of the municipal burden is unjust.  Because of the fact that the wealthy company pays only one-half or one-third of what it ought to pay in rates, the postman in Ballybough, who relies on Deputy Norton to protect his interests, is called on to pay £10 in rates where he should only pay £7, and the middle-class supporter of Deputy Costello and Deputy Benson has to pay £60 where, in fact, he ought only to pay £40. That is what the opposition to this Bill, if it were successful, would cost the voters who sent Deputy Costello, Deputy Benson, Deputy Norton and the entire six, seven or eight Deputies of the Labour Party here to look after their interests.  That is what it would cost them, if you could turn the Government out on this Bill and beat them, as you beat them on the question of Civil Service arbitration.</P>

      <P>That is not the view of the leader of the Opposition, nor is it the view of Deputy Norton, the Caballero of the Labour Party.  They want the injustices to continue so that social discontent may be fostered, for it is upon such discontent that Parties like theirs thrive.</P>

      <P>There is an ill-assorted coalition against this Bill, and I say &ldquo;ill-assorted&rdquo; because I will readily admit that their ultimate aims are not identical.  Deputy Cosgrave only wishes to defeat the present administration in order to replace it by one of his own, but Deputy Norton, as he himself has so often declared, is out, not merely to overthrow the Government, but to overthrow the whole social system in this country. That is why, when he is told that &ldquo;there are injustices in existence to-day which ought not to be allowed to continue,&rdquo; his rejoinder, as we may read in column 890 of the Official Reports is: &ldquo;But it was not to-day they occurred.  They have been there for ten, 20, 30, 40, 50 years,&rdquo; and accordingly, says this great reformer, let injustices remain.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton is a Labour politician and an agitator of great international experience.  One year, he is colloguing with the bosses of his international labour association in Vienna, and the next, or the preceeding, year he is in Madrid, Brussels or some other Continental capital.  It is surprising, therefore, that he should give himself away so easily and resist this Bill which he admits will redress injustices which have been in existence for &ldquo;ten, 20, 30, 40, 50 years.&rdquo;</P>

The tubercle of Communism will not become active in a justly-administered or well-ordered society.  It can only become active and malignant when it is injected into a body that is already weakened by social disorders and corrupted by injustices &mdash; injustices which may have &ldquo;occurred,&rdquo; to use Deputy Norton's significant words, &ldquo;not to-day,&rdquo; but that &ldquo;have been in existence ten, 20, 30, 40 or 50 years.&rdquo; It is, Sir, as we know, in just such conditions that the Caballeros, and the Bela Kuns, and the Lenins find their opportunities.

That is what has happened in France and in Spain, and the same would happen here in Ireland.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by redressing grievances which have existed for many years, and the redress of which is so necessary.  That is why this Bill is being introduced, and if ever the necessity for reform in this matter needed proof, I think it was proved up to the hilt by the speeches made in opposition to this measure.</P>
      <P>Take, for example, the speech of the principal Leader of the Opposition.  I think that Deputy Cosgrave's statement could be taken as being a strong argument in favour of this Bill.  If you are to take the statement he made, as reported in columns 274 and 275 of the Official Debates, I think it is as good a case as could be made for this Bill.  Certainly, in my opinion, it is as good a case for this Bill as ever I heard.  Let me read the passage to which I refer.  Deputy Cosgrave said, as reported in columns 274 and 275 of the Official Debates:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;If, over a period of 40 or 50 years, property comes on the market and is purchased, according to the lease, the valuation, and the condition <Col N="1168" /> of the property, and if people buy it with their eyes open, it is nonsense to say that those who bought it, no matter how much it has increased in value, have not paid a fair share.  They bought it in the open market at the highest price at which it could be bought, and it is those from whom they bought have escaped, by reason of the low valuation put on such property.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, let me examine that statement with a view to seeing how it makes a case for the Bill.  First, we are told that if over a period of 40 or 50 years property comes on the market and is purchased according to the lease, the valuation and the condition of the property it is nonsense to say that the people who bought that property, with their eyes open&mdash;no matter how much the property has increased in value&mdash; have not paid a fair share.  I agree with Deputy Cosgrave that if people buy property in such conditions, with their eyes open, it is nonsense to say that they have not paid a fair share, or, in other words, that they have not paid a fair price for the property.</P>
    <P>What was the position here?  The position was that, under our valuation code, all properties were liable to be revalued at any time that the competent local authority thought fit to move in the matter, and, in fact, a number of local authorities such as Belfast, Dublin and Waterford did so move in the past 30 or 40 years. Furthermore, the longer local authorities refrained from moving, and the further nominal valuations of property tended to diverge from the true net values of such property, the greater was the likelihood that either these local authorities would move for a revaluation or that the State&mdash;in the words again of Deputy O'Sullivan&mdash; would be called upon to intervene to the end of promoting &ldquo;justice as between man and man and between citizen and citizen.&rdquo; We have the position that during the last 40 years or so any person who bought property in this country, North or South&mdash;whether in Dublin or Belfast &mdash;with his eyes open, and knowing the conditions of the property and the valuation and so on, could <Col N="1169" /> not be blind to the fact that one day or another, sooner or later, that property would come to be revalued. Presumably, any person of normal intelligence would take that into account in deciding the purchase amount of the property, what it would be to him.  If he failed to do that it was his own look out and, ultimately, he must abide by the consequences of his failure.  There is one thing, however, that the Government cannot do, and that is to allow the fact that a certain limited number of individuals have made foolish bargains to deter the Government from&mdash;again in Deputy O'Sullivan's words&mdash;doing &ldquo;justice as between man and man and between citizen and citizen.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So much for the consideration to which Deputy Cosgrave has so tactfully directed the attention of the Dáil.  If individuals have purchased property, over a period of 40 or 50 years, with their eyes open, they must be presumed to have paid a fair price for that property, and I hold that it must also be presumed that, with their eyes open, they were taking into account the risks of that property being revalued.  Accordingly, the fact that a few individuals may have purchased foolishly should not stop the Dáil from proceeding with this Bill.</P>
    <P>But consider what conclusions are to be drawn from the remainder of that remarkable passage of Deputy Cosgrave's speech.  They bought, he says, speaking of this deal in property, with their eyes open, at the highest price.  What the Deputy really meant was the lowest price at which in the open market it could be bought.  He goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is those from whom they have bought have escaped, by reason of the low valuation put on such property.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What a remarkable admission that statement contains.  Somebody got away with something, somebody escaped with something belonging to somebody else, something which, at any rate, did not belong to him.  He was able to escape with that something which did not belong to him <Col N="1170" /> because, as Deputy Cosgrave says &ldquo;of the low valuation put on such property.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What did this lucky individual, about whom Deputy Cosgrave was speaking, get away with?  He escaped with the capitalised value of all the rates and taxes which he might have been called upon to pay if this property had been rightly and truly valued, but which, because it was not rightly and truly valued, he did not pay.  In some cases that might be a very considerable sum indeed.  I know one case in the City of Dublin where property belonging to one very wealthy and very prosperous concern is so undervalued that it pays, perhaps, anything between £3,000 and £5,000 less in rates than it should.  The undertaking in question, I should make it clear, has no very ancient associations with this City and could not be described as one of our largest employers.  It escapes, to use Deputy Cosgrave's very significant and felicitous phrase, paying that £3,000 or £5,000 a year at the expense of those ratepayers in the City, among whom it should be our aim, as it is our duty, to promote justice between man and man, between citizen and citizen.  Not merely does this ratepayer get away with between £3,000 and £5,000 a year in rates, but, if the property owned and occupied by it were to be sold to-morrow the present owner of it would, in Deputy Cosgrave's phrase, &ldquo;by reason of the low valuation put on such property,&rdquo; escape with anything between £60,000 and £100,000 belonging to the Corporation of Dublin, belonging to the citizens of Dublin.</P>
    <P>Does the Lord Mayor of Dublin, who, I notice, came in to scatter his few gems of eloquence in this debate, and has not been in the House otherwise throughout it&mdash;though we are told that the fortunes and interests of the citizens of Dublin, and particularly the working class citizens of Dublin, who vote for him in such overwhelming numbers at every general election, are concerned in this Bill&mdash;or does Deputy Belton, who is Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Corporation of Dublin, think it is right and just that a concern should get away every year with underpaying rates to the tune of <Col N="1171" /> between £3,000 and £5,000, and, in addition, if it happens to sell its property to-morrow should get away with £60,000 or £100,000 belonging to the citizens of Dublin and the ratepayers of Dublin?  If the Lord Mayor thinks that is not right and that is not just, or if Deputy Belton thinks that is not right or just, that is the sort of thing they are voting for if they vote against this Bill.</P>

      <P>It is true that Deputy Cosgrave says that when the property changed hands it was the vendor got away with it and not the purchaser.  But every purchaser of immovable property is a potential vendor, and the longer he holds the property at an unduly low valuation for rating purposes the more there accrues to it in increment after increment of unearned real value, value which in justice belongs not to this one-time purchaser and now potential vendor of the property, but to the community, the municipality, the local <Col N="1172" /> authority within whose boundaries the property is situate and, collectively, to those ratepayers who have paid and are paying too heavy rates because the property in question has been too lightly valued.</P>
      <P>Is this a situation which ought to go on?  Does Deputy Davin think that that situation should be permitted to continue, or Deputy Norton, or Deputy Hickey, or Deputy Cogan?  If they do not think that it should go on, what do they think we ought to do? My view is that we ought to take steps to restore to its rightful owners, that is to the community in general and the local authority in particular, the unearned increment which has accrued to the property.  I think that that would appear to be the right and proper and just course.  That is what this Bill proposes to do, and that is what Deputy Norton, the Chairman of the Labour Party, and Deputy Belton, the Chairman of the Finance Committee of the Dublin Corporation, are opposing.  They are anxious to let the holders of the unearned increment get away with it; to let, if Deputy O'Higgins will permit me to say it, the thief escape at the expense, of course, of the citizens of Dublin and of the constituents who have sent them here. Deputy Norton and Deputy Belton will rub their hands, saying: &ldquo;Well, if that is not good business, at any rate we think that at the moment it is good politics.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is what is behind the opposition to this Bill, the thought that it may be good politics to oppose it.  There is nothing new in the Opposition's proceeding on that assumption in regard to any measure touching the public good.  But there is something very new and something ridiculously original in the grounds upon which that attitude is based.  Because, protest Deputies Norton and Cosgrave against the Bill, vendors of properties have been able to cash in on the unduly low valuations that have been put on them and, as Deputy Cosgrave has put it, have escaped with the swag in the past, it would not be fair to prevent others from getting away with it in future.  The community has had its pockets picked and its safes robbed in <Col N="1173" /> the past, but, say Deputies Norton and Davin, that is no reason why the State should endeavour to stop such depredations now and in the future.  I wonder would the Deputies opposing this Bill apply that principle to their own personal private affairs?</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition, or should I say the Leader of the chief Opposition, may in private life, he exceptionally hospitable.  But I have yet to learn that he keeps open house for burglars.  Deputy Belton may be kindly and generous, but I doubt if he ever throws open the doors of his premises and calls in the passers-by to help themselves.  But it is on these principles that the Labour and Fine Gael Parties wish local administration to proceed.  If they had their way the future in this country would be very pleasant for the speculative builder, the property jobber and the business man.  The injustice which we have had here for the last 20, 30, 40 or 50 years is to continue.  These people are to reap the benefits and the advantages which they have gained from that injustice and that state of affairs is to continue with the applause, approval and the guarantee of the Irish Labour Party.</P>
    <P>This then is the absurd position into which these opponents of this Bill have landed themselves.  Even more absurd are the other arguments with which they propose to justify their opposition to the measure.  We have the objection raised against the measure that it does not propose to revalue agricultural land.  Deputies Belton, Gorey and Costello are particularly strong on that point.  Deputy Costello, with his colleague Deputy Benson and myself, shares the representation of the very important agricultural constituency of the Dublin Townships.  He is particularly strong against this measure because it does not propose to revalue agricultural land.  Deputy Belton stated that revaluation was the one thing the farmers in the County Dublin had been clamouring for for years.  If that statement of Deputy Belton's had been well founded, what a dull-witted Chairman of the Dublin County Council he must have been. <Col N="1174" /> One of the aims of Deputy Belton's life, his one ambition was to be the acknowledged leader of the farmers of the County Dublin.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton for years was the leader of the majority Party in the Dublin County Council.  He was Chairman, in fact, of the Dublin County Council.  But these County Dublin farmers could have their land revalued if the Dublin County Council had passed a simple resolution asking to have it revalued.  During the whole period in which the Deputy was Chairman of the Dublin County Council and all the time&mdash;I think for almost two decades&mdash;that he was a member of that body he did not propose a resolution that the County Dublin farmers should have their lands revalued.  That train of thought naturally leads to the conviction that Deputy Belton does not in his heart believe that the farmers of the County Dublin or, indeed, any other county for that matter, want a revaluation of their agricultural land.  Whether they do or not, whether or not it would be advantageous to them to have their lands revalued, are, of course, matters of opinion.  I wonder if the opportunity arose whether those who have been so loudly demanding a revaluation would be so steadfast in their views, the views which they have expressed on this stage of the Bill. Perhaps we shall see.</P>
    <P>Admittedly, the Bill in its present form does not propose to revalue agricultural land.  Because, apart from other practical difficulties which such an operation would involve, my feeling and my opinion, giving it for what it is worth, is that the farmers do not desire such revaluation.  But if the Bill does not propose to revalue agricultural land it will, nevertheless, have important reactions on the rating of agricultural land.  It will decrease the rates upon agricultural land.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan and Deputy Hughes have spoken against this Bill, and I presume they will vote against it.  I have made an estimate as to what is likely to be the effect of this Bill upon the rates on agricultural land in their own counties.  The result of that <Col N="1175" /> investigation is this: that when the revaluation contemplated by this Bill is completed the rates upon agricultural land in Wicklow, should other things remain the same, will be reduced by about 9d. in the £.  I hope Deputy Cogan is taking in that information. In Carlow the reduction would be about 6d. in the £.</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney made a number of other points which I will deal with later on.  He commenced hunting the mad March hare, which Deputy Cosgrave raised, around the farmer's garden.  I want to say definitely now in regard to the garden of the ordinary farmer, that the intention is to value the whole of his land on Griffith's valuation, and to have no fiddling about because he has a few flower beds or fruit trees.  There is the land of the gentleman farmer who has a garden attached to his residence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney was terribly&mdash;I suppose that is the right adverb to apply to Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's speech&mdash;agitated as to the meaning of the word &ldquo;lawn.&rdquo; I am not going to debate with any lawyer the legal meaning of any word. I need not say that I have had lawyers, and very good ones, to help me with this Bill.  I conveyed to them what my intentions were, and they chose the wording.  The word &ldquo;lawn&rdquo; passed muster with them, and it did not occur to us that it could be held to mean an ordinary grass field.  Perhaps, however, my advisers are wrong.  Perhaps, on the other hand, it is the lawyers of the Opposition who are wrong, and heaven forbid that I should have to settle a dispute between lawyers about the legal meaning of any word.  There will <Col N="1177" /> be no dispute, however, if the lawyers in this House think that the definition of agricultural land in Section 3 is unjust or unfair and if they will on the Committee Stage suggest any alternative wording which avoids that, I shall put it to my lawyers and I am sure there will be no trouble about having the wording amended if necessary.</P>
      <P>But at the same time I do not want it to go out that I have no idea of what &ldquo;lawn&rdquo; means.  The Oxford dictionary gives it as meaning &ldquo;portion of a garden,&rdquo; etc.  &ldquo;Covered with grass which is kept closely mown.&rdquo; In fact, &ldquo;lawn&rdquo; means what it is clear from the context it is intended to mean in this Bill, that is to say, &ldquo;a piece of grass which for the sake of ornament or amenity, or for the sake of playing some game is kept closely mown all through the seasons when grass is growing.&rdquo; That, of course, may be only a man-in-the-street definition, but as I have said, it has passed with some good lawyers.</P>
      <P>The next ground upon which members opposite have striven to found their opposition to this Bill is that stated by Deputy Costello, that we ought to adopt some different standard of assessing annual valuation from what was adopted and devised by Griffith.  So far as this question, considered merely as a matter of academic interest, is concerned, there might be some room for discussion on that thesis, but there is none in the long argument which led the Deputy to the conclusion &ldquo;that the House is entitled to demand that the machinery of taxation for local purposes should be brought up to date.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as I am concerned, I readily agree with Deputy Costello that &ldquo;the machinery of taxation for local purposes, intermingled as it is, with the machinery of local taxation, should be brought up to date.&rdquo; This Bill, in fact, is the first and essential step to that end.  I am proposing it, and Deputy Costello is opposing it.  As to why, I can only assume that it is because, among other things, the Deputy has utterly confused in his mind the valuation code with the <Col N="1178" /> rating code.  An investigation of the rating problem and a codification of the rating law cannot take place until we have had a general revaluation of the country, or, at the very least, of the structural hereditaments of the country.  That is what the Royal Commission on local taxation meant when, so far back as 1902, it reported that it was &ldquo;not easy to exaggerate the importance of fair, uniform and accurate valuation as a preliminary to any just distribution of the burdens of local administration.&rdquo; Deputy Costello desires that the machinery of taxation for local purposes should be brought up-to-date.  So do I, and that is why I have brought in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Let us return, however, to the other objection which Deputy Costello offered to the Bill, an objection which was also supported in the House to-day by Deputy Mulcahy: the objection that in making the revaluation we propose to proceed according to a well-tried and well-established principle. Deputy Costello, in regard to matters of valuation, belongs to the smart set: what was good enough for our fathers and grandfathers is not good enough for him&mdash;he wants to be modern.  He reminds me, indeed, of those people who are so ultra-modern that they consider clothes old-fashioned, and in their desire to be thought progressive, dispense with them altogether as the Opposition has done with truth and commonsense in the discussion of this Bill, and go about naked.  The basis of valuation laid down in Section 19 (k) of the Bill is one which, as I have said, has been well-tried and well-established.  It goes back not merely to the Act of 1852, but to the Irish Poor Relief Act of 1838, and by reason of Irish judicial decisions over a long period of years the application of every word in Section 19 (k) to the varying sorts of property which arise in practice for valuing is pretty definitely settled.  If we used new words, as Deputy Costello wants us to do, it would inevitably only mean a lot of litigation before their application to the various sets of facts were settled.  Naturally, the Valuation Office does not want a lot of litigation, and members of the public do not want a lot of litigation <Col N="1179" /> either.  It only means for them endless trouble and endless expense.  The legal profession, I dare say, must be pardoned if they look on the matter differently.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello, however, ought to be aware that the basis, as I have said, of valuation as set out in Section 19 (k) of the Bill has been for over 80 years found flexible enough, as construed by the Courts, to deal with every sort of immovable property which exists in Ireland or in Great Britain for that matter, including unusual kinds, like cathedrals, railways, canals, mines, buildings like the Four Courts, and so on.  Does the Deputy think that the rule of thumb which he has in mind would be flexible enough to do all that?  In this connection, since Deputy Costello was talking about cathedrals, may I remind him that in Section 5 (1) paragraph (d) of the Railways (Valuation for Rating) Act, 1931, in which year the Deputy was Attorney General, the rule for valuing railways is laid down in these words:</P>
    <P>Estimate by reference to the average net receipts so ascertained the rent at which the railway hereditaments occupied by such company might reasonably be expected to let from year to year....</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello, on Thursday I think it was, said that there is no market for cathedrals on a letting basis.  And there certainly is not; but then neither is there a market for railways upon a letting basis.  Yet, in 1931, Deputy Costello, who wants to be so modern and who accuses me of not being modern and scientific, was himself not a whit more modern and scientific when he kept to the old 1852 wording in regard to the valuation of railways. Deputy Costello forgets that as medicine and engineering are sciences, valuation is a science, and a science which, so far as I know, he has not studied.  That being so, I think in relation to valuation he might reflect that &ldquo;humility is the beginning of wisdom.&rdquo; But even when the Deputy disclaims any special knowledge of agriculture, the fact does not prevent him from saying that if farms were valued on the basis of Section 19 (k), the valuation of every farm in the <Col N="1180" /> country would be increased.  I do not believe there is one intelligent farmer in all Ireland who would agree with Deputy Costello in that statement.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello dogmatises about valuation, dogmatises about farms, and he has no special knowledge of either one or the other.  There is something characteristically modern and up to date about that attitude.  It does not date back, like our principle of valuation, to 1852 and earlier, and accordingly it satisfies Deputy Costello.  I trust the Deputy will forgive me if, in regard to this intricate matter of the general valuation of the country and the basis to be used for that valuation, I prefer to take the advice of the expert and rather experienced officers whom I have at my disposal rather than to rely upon him for slick, newfangled, untried ideas upon the matter. I am quite certain that is an attitude on my part of which the general public would approve.</P>
    <P>One other view for which I have no doubt approval would be forthcoming would be this, that since the local authorities have to pay all their expenses in post-war pounds and are compelled to levy their rates and collect their revenue likewise in post-war pounds, it is only commonsense that the valuations upon which those revenues are based should also be expressed in post-war pounds.</P>
    <P>The last and most surprising ground upon which this Bill is being opposed is that it may bring in some money for the Exchequer.  With that romantic, childlike predilection for exaggerated statements which expresses so happily and so precisely the operations of his intellect, the Leader of the Labour Party went so far as to say that this Bill was being put forward for the sole purpose of raising more money for the Exchequer.  That is very far from being the case.  The amount of revenue which the Exchequer may expect eventually to derive from this Bill will be about the equivalent of a farthing per lb. upon sugar.  I hope the Deputies on the Labour Benches will note that fact, that when this Bill goes through, and when the revaluation has been made, it will bring into the Exchequer the equivalent of a tax <Col N="1181" /> of a farthing per lb. on sugar, a commodity which is consumed in every working-class household.  Deputies should know that when they vote against this Bill they are voting to put a tax of a farthing per lb. on the sugar of the workers in the town and country.</P>

      <P>Supposing the sole purpose of the Bill was to raise more money for the Exchequer&mdash;and, as I have said, it is not the sole purpose, and it is not even the primary purpose, but supposing it were&mdash;is that any justification for the votes which the members of the Labour Party propose to give <Col N="1182" /> against the Bill?  I should have thought that they would have welcomed any measure which would have brought more money into the Exchequer, because no Deputies make so many demands on the Exchequer as the Deputies of the Labour Party.  They have the Order Paper at this moment cluttered up with motions demanding more and still more money from the Exchequer.  Deputy Norton appears to be the Diamond Jim Brady of the Labour Party, for no extravagance is too absurd for his indulgence, and he has his name to no less than four such motions, while the lesser lights are content with two, and in some cases only one each.  In fact, the position is that of the eight members of the Labour Party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Very well, nine.  I would hate to do the Labour Party any injustice.  I would like to remove that anomaly and to say nine.  The position there is that of the nine members of the Labour Party all of them, with the exception of Deputy Hurley and Deputy Tadhg Murphy, have motions making demands upon the Exchequer any one of which, if granted, would mean hundreds of thousands of pounds.  They are going to vote against this Bill, says Deputy Norton, because it will produce more money for the Exchequer.  Yet the Deputies have put down motions asking that workers employed on minor relief schemes should be paid higher wages and given continuous employment; that unemployment assistance for pensioners should be increased, and that the Government should absorb in useful employment at adequate remuneration all workers able to follow useful occupations.</P>

A little over two months ago these gentlemen were loud in their protestations against the Bill to increase Parliamentary allowances.  Perhaps the simple minds of Labour Deputies were impressed by the qualities of self-denial and abnegation with which these Deputies at that time credited themselves and are hoping that they will finance the Labour Party's proposals to the extent of £10 <i>per mensem per capita.</i></P>

Of course, we know that the Labour Party do not anticipate that Deputy Norton or Deputy Davin will take these heroic measures or that we shall have this self-denial and martyrdom on the part of Deputy Bennett and Deputy Cogan of which they were so full about three months ago.

      <P>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; says Deputy Norton, &ldquo;we cannot permit you to tax property.&rdquo;&ldquo;What,&rdquo; says Deputy Corish, &ldquo;Deputy Norton was concerned about was not income tax as such, but what is known as property tax.&rdquo; Well, there is no annual tax on property as such in this State.  There is a tax upon income derived from property, just as there is a tax on income derived from other investments, or from the profits of the business, or from wages and salaries of employees. All these forms of income are taxed. and, in my opinion, justly and rightly taxed, within the limits laid down by the income tax code.  Before the State goes further and imposes indirect taxation upon such articles and commodities as motor-cars, petrol, tobacco, spirits, tea and sugar&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is in error.  There is no tax upon bacon.  It is quite true, mind you, that certain people have got away with it during the past three or four years.  But there are also people, according to Deputy Norton, who have been getting away with it for the past ten, 20, 30 or 50 years&mdash;getting away with it to the tune of £250,000 a year, perhaps.  I think we had better get after those who got away with it first.  They have got the biggest start and the problem of the bacon curers can be dealt with in due course, and I am certain will be dealt with in due course.  I was saying that in so far&mdash;and this is the point I want to make&mdash;as our revenue from the tax on incomes, including incomes notional or actual arising from the ownership of property, falls short of the requirements of the public and social services, we have to fall back upon indirect taxes.  In short, if we do not collect what is due to the Exchequer from property owners we must tax the food of the people.  The Labour Party are opposed, says Deputy Corish, to this Bill because that Party is &ldquo;concerned with what is known as property tax.&rdquo; It is to tax the food of the people and to oppose a tax upon property that the Labour Party propose to vote when they go into the lobby against this Bill. <Col N="1186" /> For the sacred cause of property, therefore, the Labour Party is prepared to tax the people's food.  But that is not the end of their iniquity.</P>

      <P>The revaluation which this Bill proposes will, other things being equal, result in a reduction in the amount paid in rates by three out of four householders in the State.  I shall go further and say this: Eighty per cent, perhaps 90 per cent., of the wage-earners of this State live in homes which are covered by the terms of the Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Acts.  They enjoy the benefits of these Acts and in so far as any reduction takes place in the rates paid on their homes, that reduction must be passed on to them in the shape of a reduced rent.  I wish to tell the Labour Deputies, deliberately and emphatically, before they vote on this measure, that the revaluation which I propose, will result in a reduction, in some cases a relatively large reduction, in the rents paid, under the Rent and Mortgage (Restrictions) Acts.  This Valuation Bill, in short, though it is not expressed to be so, is a Bill which will materially reduce the rents paid for 90 per cent. of the working class houses in the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This measure, this Bill which the Labour Party are going to vote against because, as Deputy Corish says, &ldquo;Deputy Norton is concerned with the tax upon property&rdquo; is one which will reduce the rates on agricultural land. It will help the small and decaying towns.  It will reduce the rates paid on three out of every four middle-class houses.  It will reduce the rents of working-class houses.  It will, by providing <Col N="1187" /> more money for the Exchequer, relieve the impoverished elements in the community.  But&mdash;let those Deputies who sit on the benches behind me and who are helping the Government to put through this great measure of social reform tell it in every constituency for which a member of the Labour Party sits or in which that organisation put forward a candidate at the last election; let them tell it at every meeting between now and the next general election&mdash;the Labour Deputies are going to vote against this Bill.  This Bill means cheaper houses for the postal workers.  This Bill means cheaper houses for the railway workers. This Bill means cheaper homes for the urban teachers.  This Bill means cheaper homes for the tradesmen and unskilled labourers in every city and town in the Twenty-Six Counties.  But Deputy Norton, Deputy Davin, Deputy Tadhg Murphy, Deputy Corish, Deputy Everett and Deputy Pattison are going to vote against this Bill because, forsooth, it will tax property justly and will bring in more money to the Exchequer.  The Labour Deputies &mdash;these alleged disciples of James Connolly&mdash;are in fitting company.</P>

      <P>I do not traffic in it as some people do.  The <i>Irish Independent</i>&mdash;that tireless champion of the Irish worker&mdash;is against this Bill also and for the same reason as Deputy Norton, Deputy Corish, and the other members of the Labour Party are against it&mdash;because it will put a just tax on property.  On the coming 1st May, Deputy Norton, draping Connolly's blood-stained shroud around him, will tell the workers of Dublin to rise, that they &ldquo;have nothing to lose but their chains.&rdquo; In the meantime, however, under the flag of the <i>Irish Independent</i>, he will fight here in the Dáil to deprive these workers of all the gains which the revaluation proposed by this Bill will assuredly secure for them.  He will do that in order to enable big and wealthy companies, such as that which controls the <i>Irish Independent</i>, to get away with paying <Col N="1188" /> thousands and thousands of pounds less than they ought to pay to the rates of Dublin City.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> and its like are escaping, to use Deputy Cosgrave's words, with these thousands upon thousands of pounds at the expense of the Dublin workers, the small shopkeepers and the struggling middle-class families of this city.  Under Deputy Norton's leadership, the policy of the Labour Party of Ireland, should, accordingly, be expressed: &ldquo;No tax upon property; no tax upon big companies; no tax upon the <i>Irish Independent</i>; but the poor and the weak you shall grind to the dust.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I said, in my speech in introducing this Bill, that it is indispensable to the future orderly progress of our people. Next to land purchase, it is, perhaps, the most important and far-reaching social reform that has been proposed here within the century.  It will lay the foundations of a new, efficient, economical and progressive system of local government here.  In regard to the local public services, it will enable the local authorities, under that new dispensation, to make good the accumulated deficiencies of years.  It will enable them to provide for the Irish people decent homes, clean towns, good roads and proper health services.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As I was saying, this Bill will enable the local authorities, under the new dispensation, to provide for their people decent homes, clean towns, good <Col N="1189" /> roads and proper health services.  It will do all that without imposing undue burdens upon the resources of individual citizens, for it will enable the Government to carry out a reform which was authoritatively recommended about 40 years ago in these emphatic terms:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is not easy to exaggerate the importance of a fair, uniform and accurate valuation, as a preliminary to any just distribution of the burdens of the local administration.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That reform was overdue even 40 years ago.  It is much more overdue now.  It is a reform which, like Deputy Norton's injustices, has waited &ldquo;for ten, 20, 30, 40 or 50 years.&rdquo; Yet, despite the opposition of Deputy Norton, the Labour Party and the party opposite, who are concerned to oppose this Bill because it may be a tax upon property, the Government is <Col N="1190" /> going to go forward to prepare a fair and accurate register of the real property of this country for the purpose of justly apportioning taxes, for the Government believes that such a just apportionment as between man and man and citizen and citizen does not exist at the present time.  The Government has no vested interest, as the Labour Party and the Party opposite have shown they have, in maintaining injustices unredressed&mdash;injustices which breed social disorder and revolution.  As I said, it is the policy of the Government to forestall revolution by redressing injustices and, as a first step to the redressal of widespread injustices, we are introducing this Bill.</P>

    <P>The items are set out on the Order Paper and on the Vote on Account in the White Paper.  The total net provision in the Supply Services for 1939-40 is £30,248,897 as compared with £29,861,881 for 1938-39.  The 1938-39 figures take account of the revised Estimate for export bounties and subsidies, the new Estimate for industrial alcohol, and the Supplementary Estimates to date.  The net increase in the cost of Supply Services is £387,016, to which has to be added £370,000 for Supplementary Agricultural Grant, for which the House will be asked to provide in due course upon a Supplementary Estimate.  The net increase is, therefore, £757,016 as compared with last year.  The increase is due in the largest measure to the increase of £1,256,515 in the Estimate for Defence, with which the House is familiar, but there are also increases upon certain other Estimates which are worthy of note.  It will be noted that on Vote 11&mdash;Public Works and Buildings&mdash;there is an increase of £181,479.  The principal increase in this Estimate occurs under sub-head B, for new works, alterations and additions, amounting to £168,415.  This is mainly due to an increase of £50,000 in the grant for the building of national schools, an increase of £12,000 for heating installation at the Central Model Schools, and several increases for new military barracks and ordnance stores.</P>

      <P>Among the latter items are £16,000 for accommodation for Air Corps Cadets, £114,900 for the reconstruction of Kildare Barracks, a work which is long overdue, £55,000 for erection of magazines, and £20,000 for general storage.  There is also, in addition to the provision of £194,000 for Rynanna, and £170,000 for Collinstown, a further provision of £60,000 for an aerodrome to be provided in connection with the development of air transport. On Vote 41 for Local Government and Public Health, there are increases of £1,500 for medical treatment of schoolchildren, £3,300 for grants for school meals, £6,500 for treatment of tuberculosis, and £26,890 in respect of contributions towards annual loan charges to local authorities for housing purposes.</P>
      <P>There are many notable increases in the Education Votes.  In Vote 46 for Primary Education, there is an increase of £15,000 under sub-head C. 6. in respect of grants towards the cost of heating and cleaning schools.  A new sub-head, C. 10. provides £16,500 towards the cost of free school books for necessitous children, and sub-head D, Superannuation, etc. of Teachers, shows an increase of £8,400.  On Vote 47, for Secondary Education, there is an increase of £28,120.  On Vote 48, for Technical Instruction, there is an increase of £26,530 towards which sub-head B&mdash;Annual Grants to Vocational Committees &mdash; accounts for £23,349, caused by (a) increase in State grants in accordance with the provisions of the Vocational Education Act, 1930, and (b) the Continuation Education Scheme in Cork City, carried under Part V of the 1930 Act.  In Vote 54, for Lands, there are increases of £59,000 under sub-head N, advances to meet payments under certain sections of the Land Act, 1931, and £13,000 under sub-head Q, Payments under Section 27 (2) of the Land Act, 1933, to meet deficiencies in the Land Bond Fund arising out of the revision of annuities.  There is an increase of £1,250 for improvements of estates.</P>

    <P>On Vote 55 for Forestry there is an <Col N="1196" /> increase of £25,000 under sub-head C. 1. for Acquisition of Land, and an extra £11,557 under sub-head C. 2. in respect of cultural operations, maintenance etc.  Against these and certain other less important and casual increases there are decreases upon other Votes.  The Vote for Agriculture accounts for a decrease of £238,599, due mainly to the disappearance, except for a token provision of £5, of the current year's figure of £220,000 under sub-head M. 7. for expenses in connection with the provision of butter for winter requirements.  Under sub-head O. 9. there is only a token provision of £5 made for expenses on the purchase, storage and export of butter, eggs and some other products.  The net decrease under this sub-head, after allowing for appropriations-in-aid, is £37,260.  The cessation of the scheme for the distribution of cattle export licences accounts for a further decrease of £6,261.  There is a decrease of £192,715 in respect of the production of industrial alcohol and there are also decreases under other Industry and Commerce sub-heads, as follows:&mdash; £12,400 under sub-head I, where there is a reduced provision for the exhibition at the New York World Fair; there is £23,452 under the M group of sub-heads relating to the Turf Development Board, Limited; and sub-head I of the current year's Vote relating to the Glasgow Exhibition disappears, involving a reduction of £10,000.</P>
    <P>On the Vote for Unemployment Insurance and Unemployment Assistance, there is a decrease of £94,000.</P>
    <P>The Vote for Army Pensions shows a decrease of £117,000.</P>
    <P>Lastly, on Vote 70, there is a decrease of £219,000, accounted for by the disappearance of certain export bounties on the termination of the economic war.</P>
    <P>The position, therefore, briefly, may be summed up thus.  The abnormal increase in the Estimate for Defence, which the uncertain international situation has forced upon us, accounts for £1,256,515 and to this may be added £265,900 for new defence buildings charged to the Vote for Public Works and Buildings.  But additional money has also been provided for the following <Col N="1197" /> important public and social purposes:&mdash;for new schools and for education generally, £128,853; for housing and other social services administered by the Department of Local Government and Public Health, £28,300 approximately; for land purchase, etc., £51,648; for afforestation, £37,321; for Posts and Telegraphs, £42,880.  Against these increases there are decreases on other Votes amounting in the aggregate to so much that, notwithstanding the increases which I have just enumerated, there would have been a net decrease in the Estimates for the year of over £1,120,000, approximately, if it had not been, as I have said, for the wholly unavoidable additional expenditure which has to be undertaken for the defence of our country and our people.  I move the Vote.</P>

      <P>The Minister has just tossed off his peroration on the Valuation Bill in which he gloried in the resources that were thereby made available to extract a greater revenue from the people of this country than had ever been extracted before.  And true to form, he launches this Vote on Account with the announcement that it represents a Vote on Account of the largest bill that has ever been presented to the taxpayers of this country in the history of Ireland.  The British Government in the days of its wildest extravagance in Ireland never dreamt of asking the people of the whole of this country to produce one half of the sum that the present Minister for Finance requires the people of 26 counties in this country to pay this year, and that, after an economic war which, by the admission of the Minister's own colleagues, has practically completely exhausted the people who live upon the Land.</P>

      <P>It is interesting to note, Sir, and I need hardly say, it is absent from the mind of any member of the Government Party, that, in addition to this monstrous burden of taxation which they now heap upon the people, over the same period, one of the reliefs <Col N="1198" /> which they used to boast that they conferred upon the agricultural community, they have swept away.  They used to glory in the fact that they had remitted one-half of the land annuities. That remission ammounted to the sum of about £1,500,000, but over the same period the total rate collected has gone up by £1,172,301.  In the county health districts the rates collected amounted to £2,445,269 in 1932.  In 1939, the assessment, less the credit notes, for the county health districts is £3,298,037, representing an increase of £852,768.  It is true that agricultural land is relieved by the agricultural grant.  It is, nevertheless, true that the increase in rates, taken as a whole, is represented by the figure of £1,172,301 as between 1938 and 1932.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also absent from the minds of the members of the Party responsible for this Vote on Account that the estimate of receipts and expenditure presented by the Government now is a wholly illusory document, because this Government has discovered the expedient of short-circuiting taxation, and a very considerable part of the tax burden imposed on the people, and mainly on the agricultural community, because they ultimately pay all the taxes, is represented by the concealed taxation.  There is the scandalous levy which was made upon our people by the bacon curers under the Pigs and Bacon Act; there is the immense tax laid upon our people by the millers under the Wheat Act; and there is the immense burden laid upon our people by Customs and Excise, but that is not all, because that is included in the figures mentioned by the Minister to-day.  Over and above the taxes levied by the Revenue Commissioners, and shown in the receipts, is the immense burden laid upon our people by the tariff-mongers, who collect an immense levy of subsidy direct from the people, instead of getting it from the Treasury, and although it does not pass through the Treasury, and is never shown in the public accounts, it leaves the pockets of the people, none the less, and contributes to the burden they have to bear.  There is the tax on butter, and there are several others, such as the tax on sugar which represents about £1,000,000 a year.  All these <Col N="1199" /> our people have to bear, in addition to the figures mentioned by the Minister in asking for this Vote on Account.</P>
    <P>Taking the major ones amongst them, I submit that the tax on flour is costing our people to-day not less than £2,000,000 a year.  I submit that the tax on sugar represents an additional £1,000,000 a year, and that the additional costs laid upon everything that our people have to buy in order to live by those who are benefiting by the tariff legislation of the Government represents another £5,000,000, so that the true tax burden on our people to-day, as a result of Government intervention, is nearer to £50,000,000 than it is to £30,000,000, and the body corporate is showing every evidence of the strain.  One of the most deplorable and most dangerous symptoms of that strain is the decline in the population on the land.  I could go through the economic indices of financial emergency which are abundant, such as the decline in our net external assets and the balance of trade, but these are the cold figures of statistics.</P>
    <P>The feature upon which we may most profitably dwell now is the question of the urgent social problems which are being created by the financial strain which is being placed on the community, and first amongst them I would name poverty, the decline of the standard of living and the consequent flight from the land.  Some of us in this House well remember the jubilant declaration of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that not only was it his intention to provide employment for every man and woman looking for work in Ireland, but that he confidently and anxiously looked forward to the day when he would summon back from abroad the emigrants who had been driven there in the past, and would feel himself uneasy until he was assured that they would return in sufficient numbers to fill the vacuum of employment which it was his purpose to create.  There are men, incredible as it may seem, still sitting on those benches opposite who believed him. One would have expected that, long since, they would have retired to the mental hospitals of this country.  But far from it; they have found their way <Col N="1200" /> back into the Legislature.</P>
    <P>On their return, they may contemplate the unemployment figures.  What are they?  If we take the total number of persons registered as unemployed and the average number of persons employed on relief schemes, we find that the average at the end of each month, for the year 1938, was 107,903, representing those unemployed and those working on relief schemes. There were 88,713 without any employment at all, and 19,190 employed on relief schemes.</P>
    <P>Does that complete the picture&mdash; 108,000 destitute persons in this country called to take pick and shovel and to go out on relief schemes at whatever wage the Government is prepared to offer them?  Does that complete the picture?  Not at all; because it would be almost 100 per cent. worse but for the fact that the best fellows and the best girls in rural Ireland have been swept out of this country in the last three years in a tide of emigration more hideous than any that has been seen by any of us in this House.  I have seen special trains, within the last fortnight, leaving the West of Ireland, full of boys and girls emigrating to England. For the last three years I have watched trains coming up from the West of Ireland, when I travelled between my home in Mayo and this House, week after week, and month after month, carrying thousands of boys and girls out of this country&mdash; not to good jobs in England, but to look for work in England.  We have read in the papers, and we have heard from our friends, how hundreds of these boys and girls ended upon the streets in London, begging for the price of the fare to get home, or for enough to keep body and soul together. And that when they were supposed to be enjoying the incomparable blessings of a Christian country! The number of people who fled this country in 1936 was 23,711, and the number of people who fled this country in 1937 was 30,630.</P>

At least, we have that admission, when at the present moment there are 108,000 people in this country reduced to destitution and to unemployment or work <Col N="1203" /> on relief works, as well as the 80,000 more boys and girls who have had to go to England.

If so, let them be as eloquent about that matter of the 80,000 emigrants and the 108,000 people whom you have made paupers, at the Party meetings as they are about the super-patriots.  Let them be at least as eloquent about that matter at their Party meetings as they are about the super-patriots.  In the three Party meetings a week that they hold, let them give the major portion of the time to this problem and give the spare time to the super-patriots.

I was brought up amongst these people, and I know the circumstances under which they are trying to survive.  I was brought up to glory in the rise of the small farmer from the depression into which the landlord threw him.  Every improvement made in the lot of the small farmer or of the people of the countryside was something that the people of my generation gloried in, but I am living to see the day when, under our own Government, the improvements we got for the people amongst whom I live are being taken from them.  The Minister has not seen such conditions and never will.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the trouble with the Minister.  His outlook and mind, as well as the outlook and mind of most of his colleagues, are circumscribed by the North Circular Road.  Dublin is his end-all and be-all.  So long as everything is rosy in the garden, so far, let us say, as Lucan, everything is all right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  It is a fact, and if the Minister and his colleagues would wake up to the facts they would be able to do more for this country.  At least, there are some Deputies here, and in the Fianna Fáil Party also, who know the conditions of the people to whom I refer, and see upon those people the evidence of the depression that is being pressed down upon them by the present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies know the circumstances under which the small farmers, the ten-acre men, are at present living.  They know what the increased taxes mean to these people.  They know what it means to the small ten-acre farmer to be fined 8/- on the bag of flour when he goes to buy it.  They know what it means to see him paying 2/6 on the stone of sugar.  They know that that means the difference between a very <Col N="1205" /> modest standard of comfort and something closely approximating to pauperism. Take the agricultural labourer, and, mind you, the distinction between the ten-acre farmer and the agricultural labourer is not so wide.  I doubt if the man with ten acres of land has an assured income any greater than the agricultural labourer who gets 27/- a week.  But take the agricultural labourer getting 27/- a week, and picture that man going in to buy a bag of flour, which bears on it to-day a tax of about 8/-.  He buys his bag of flour and pays 18/- for it.  I have a case in mind.  He pays 2/- a week off the bag of flour, and for the first five weeks he is paying for the flour.  Then, for the following four weeks he is paying 2/- a week taxation on the flour.  After he has paid for the flour, he has to go on for four weeks paying 2/- of his 27/- each week taxation on that food.</P>
    <P>Can any man living in Dublin envisage what it means to have a family of five children and 27/- a week to keep them, and pay 3/- rent for a labourer's cottage out of that?  I freely and openly say that I do not know how it can be done.  Is there any Deputy who can devise a budget, which includes one item of 3/- for rent which must be paid, and which will maintain a family of a wife and five children on 27/- a week? That is the wage for the agricultural labourer in this country.  How they live on it I do not know.  But, in the light of that fact, why people should marvel that our people are flying from the land I cannot see.  Who would not fly from the land if he had to subsist on 27/- a week, of which 3/- has to go for rent? So put, I think that dilemma goes home to Fianna Fáil Deputies.</P>
    <P>But I ask them now to think of the ten-acre farmer.  How many weeks can he be certain that he is going to earn 27/-?  How many ten-acre farmers west of the Shannon have a guaranteed income of 27/- a week? Very, very few; they are living on less. It is on the shoulders of these people that you are putting down the burden that the Minister for Finance mentioned to-day, because ultimately it is those people who are going to pay the taxes.  It is going to appear in the cost of everything they have to buy.  It <Col N="1206" /> is at this moment appearing in the cost of everything they have to buy.</P>
    <P>Take the small ten-acre farmer earning 27/- a week.  He is a fairly well-off man.  When he buys a bag of flour, 8/- of the cost of that flour is tax.  If there was no tax on the flour, when he goes in with the price of the flour in his hand he could buy the bag of flour and bring home 4 lbs. of butter and bacon for the family as well. Under the dispensation of this Government that man must do without the butter and the bacon.  Do Fianna Fáil Deputies want that?  Do they think it is right, in the interests of the millers of this country, to tell the people living west of the Shannon that they must go without butter or bacon; that the money which they ought to spend on butter and bacon must go to the Minister for Finance?  I think that is wrong, and I think that is what is driving the people off the land.  I say that it is an inevitable consequence of piling on the body politic the burden of taxation which you have in mind to-day.</P>
    <P>But where are you going?  We always believed that when the economic war was over the tax burden was going to fall steeply and all the Fianna Fáil Deputies believed it, but, far from that being true, it is going up.  Where is that going to end?  It is not as if we had a country overflowing with milk and honey where we were doing everything we wanted to do.  On the contrary, there are many things we ought to be doing and that would cost money to do; and the last farthing we have is being poured forth at the present time and the burden tends to rise.  Surely it is time for Deputies to ask themselves if that is right.  Surely it is time for Deputies who represent the small farmers to ask themselves is it fair that these people, struggling with adversity, should be forced to pay taxes on the things they have to buy to live in order to provide tax revenue and profits for people who are growing fat, sleek, and comfortable in the City of Dublin and the other urban centres.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be told, if they make that complaint to their own Minister, that he is helping agriculture.  I am sure Deputy Breslin of Donegal has <Col N="1207" /> often told the people of Donegal the inestimable boon the Minister had conferred on County Donegal by opening the alcohol factory at Carndonagh. Does Deputy Breslin know that there are tanks being built on the quay at Sligo now in which to store treacle imported from Florida for the production of alcohol for the Carndonagh alcohol factory?  If he does, will he go to the farmers of Donegal and tell them that they derive any benefit from manufacturing alcohol from treacle carried from the United States of America or does it begin to dawn upon him that somebody was pulling his leg?  Does it begin to dawn upon him that some of the benefits he was led to believe were going to bless the farmers are just cod, just eye-wash, just put there to fool him?</P>
    <P>We have to face the question that unemployment and poverty are driving the people from the land.</P>
    <P>We have got to ask ourselves the question are we prepared to face that situation and to remedy it.  The thing that makes it peculiarly hard to bear patiently with the situation is that it could be remedied if only the Government of this country would face it.  The first essential is to make agriculture pay, to make it yield a profit.  How are you going to do that? You have got the market.  You got it back under the Anglo-Irish Agreement. You have got the men.  You have 108,000 unemployed waiting for work. You have got the land.  Now you want the profit.  What is the profit on agricultural production?  Is it not the difference between the price you can get in the British market for the goods you have to sell and the price which it costs you to produce those goods on your own farm?  If it cost you 5/- to produce an article on your own farm and you get 8/- in England you have a profit of 3/-.  If it costs you 8/- to produce it on your farm and you get 8/- for it in England, you have no profit. We cannot raise the price in the British markets because we do not control the British markets.  We have to take in the British markets whatever price we can get.  Say, it is 8/- and <Col N="1208" /> here at home we find that the article is costing 8/- to produce.  We might increase the farmer's profit by raising the price of the article in England.  But we cannot raise the price in England.</P>
    <P>But we could also increase the profit to the farmer by reducing the cost of production here at home.  It does not matter so much to us if a thing costs 8/- to produce here and we get 11/- for it in England, or if we get only 8/- for it in England and we could bring the cost of production here down to 5/-, we could still get for the farmers of this country a profit.  We can get for the farmers of this country a profit on all they produce within the next two years if we put our minds to bringing down the cost of production in this country. Unless we do that thing, so surely as we are standing in this House, the economic fabric of this country will be destroyed, and when it is destroyed, it is not the gentlemen who have grown rich by tariffs who will suffer, because they can fly away to whence they came. It is the poor of this country who will suffer.  It is the poor living on the land and the poor living in the cities, all of whom depend on this country for their living, who will suffer. These people depend on this country for everything they possess.  They are the people who will suffer if the economic collapse comes.  It certainly will collapse, as the Government itself admits, unless we can make agriculture pay.  There is no other method of making agriculture pay, but by reducing the cost of production in this country.  So surely as that is done, by taking the tax off all raw materials of the agricultural industry, so sure will agriculture be made pay.</P>
    <P>I am not now asking that the Government should abandon all their tariffs.  We regard the present emergency as one of far greater gravity than would permit of our waiting to see the Government completely routed and overthrown.  I want to see this Government in the immediate future taking the necessary steps to deal with the situation.  I do not ask them to abandon their tariff policy, much of which I believe to be mistaken and wrong.  All I ask is that they should review the tariffs at present in existence. Where the tariff operations <Col N="1209" /> raise the cost of some essential commodity that the farmer must buy in order to produce the agricultural goods which he is going to sell in the British market, that tariff should come off so that our farmers could get their raw materials at the lowest possible price. In that way only can their finished product earn the widest possible margin of profit.  We have no other source of income in this country.  The only asset we have got is 12,000,000 acres of arable land.  Other countries have gold, coal and other natural assets of that kind which can be exploited to increase the public wealth.  We have no such assets in this country.  The only asset we have is the 12,000,000 acres of arable land. Now, 5,000,000 acres of arable land will produce all the foodstuffs of every description necessary for the people of this country, including wheat and sugar.  If you fill every stomach to bursting point the produce of 5,000,000 acres will be sufficient.</P>
    <P>We have, therefore, got to export the produce of 7,000,000 acres.  It is on the profits we make on the export of that produce that the wealth of this country will ultimately depend.  The urgent vital necessity at this moment is to restore the profits on those exports produced by our people living on the land.  If we could do that we could stop the flow from the land.  We could stop the wild tide of emigration that has carried away 80,000 of our people in the last three years.  We can provide employment for thousands of the 108,000 at present unemployed.  When I say employment, I mean profitable employment, not relief schemes.  We can provide employment for these people to enable them to make their own livings and to contribute to the wealth of the nation as well.  I do not want to say nor to pretend, in the hope of catching a few votes, that any policy that I have now can provide employment for every man in this country who wants a job.  I wish to God I did know of such a plan.  No money would be too much to spend on such a plan, and no sacrifice would be too great to put it into operation.  It is an idle falsehood to pretend that by any legislation we could provide work for all who are anxious to work&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am saying now that I know of no scheme that could do it.  I wish to God the Deputy could tell me how it can be done.  If he does I will go out and campaign with him to carry it into effect.  I am looking for such a plan.  But this country, in common with every other country in the world which has preserved individual liberty, has failed to solve that problem.  The only solution so far has been the solution of slavery: to take the unemployed man who is there and to convert him into a slave&mdash;to force him to work on whatever terms his employer cares to impose on him.  Unemployment is bad and poverty is bad, but slavery is ten times worse.  Now, if we could get for our people the profits that they could earn if given the chance by their own Government, I have always believed, and I still believe, that we could get for our people the highest standard of living enjoyed by any agricultural community in the world.</P>
      <P>It is not true to say that we could get for our people the highest standard of any people in the world, because being a predominantly agricultural country we cannot hope to have for our people as high a standard of living as a wealthy industrial country can provide in the existing state of the world, but we can get for our people, in my judgment, the highest standard of living enjoyed by any agricultural community because, by the mercy of God, we are in the Commonwealth of Nations and only 30 miles away from the British market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, if we can get back that standard of living for the country I deliberately want to ask Deputies to consider two things&mdash;I am glad the Minister for Finance has returned to <Col N="1211" /> the House at this stage&mdash;which, I think, might contribute to the solution of the unemployment problem, one of which I am sure is desirable and good, and the other of which I am still in doubt. I mentioned here to-day the position of the agricultural labourer or, indeed, the small farmer whose weekly income is 27/- and who has four or five children.  Now, I do not know how that man lives.  The small farmer has some chance because he may have a few hens, he may grow a patch of oats and he may have a cow, so that with milk, eggs, oatmeal and potatoes he is just able to keep above the border-line of destitution; but take the agricultural labourer who has only 27/- coming in and who has to buy everything, because remember if he gets perquisites they are deducted from his wages, out of this 27/-.  Not only has he to buy everything out of this 27/- a week, but he has to pay his rent out of it.  How does that man live?  I do not know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no use inveighing against such a situation if we are not prepared to face the measures necessary to remedy it.  I believe that when a man marries, in accordance with the right that God gave him to marry and bring up a family, he is entitled by some fundamental law to receive into his home the children God may send him with gratitude rather than with horror.  I say that at the present time if an agricultural labourer in rural Ireland marries he may be able to struggle on after the first baby is born, but if that marriage be blessed with two, three or four children, far from looking upon those children as blessings, each one of them becomes a growing menace to the ability of the remainder of the family to survive; each one of them becomes a charge upon the minimum food that the family already has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that in no civilised community, never mind a Christian community, should that state of affairs be allowed to continue.  If we could recover for our people the prosperity they could get and the income they could earn if <Col N="1212" /> they be let earn it, and if we could bring this tax burden down to some more reasonable figure than it represents at the present time, and correct the immense appropriation for rates, I believe that we could find the money, and must find the money if we are to keep the people on the land and give to our people what the people of many other countries enjoy, and that is a family allowance of so much per week in respect of each child for persons earning less than a certain scheduled weekly income.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that may sound revolutionary to the ears of so prudent and conservative a financier as the Minister for Finance, but it is not.  It is nothing wonderful.  It is in operation to-day in Australia.  It has been in operation for 20 years in New Zealand and they do not think it wonderful at all.  If you said to them that, when people fall out of work, their children must roam the streets blue with starvation, they would laugh at you; they would use language which we in this country would regard as Bolshevistic.  They would simply answer: &ldquo;We would not let them go hungry.&rdquo; Is there any Deputy sitting in this House who, seeing his children hungry, would let them go hungry?</P>
      <P>I often stand in amazed admiration at the patience of the poor.  I admire it.  I admit freely that they may be right and that I may be wrong, but I do say that we who are not poor lose half the enjoyment of the goods that we have got by the knowledge that families about us send their children to bed hungry because they have not the money to feed them.  Now, I am not suggesting, and I do not want to be taken as suggesting, that the Minister for Finance in this Government is in a conspiracy to starve the poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no doubt that he might speak as freely on this subject as I am speaking, and may feel as deeply as I feel now, and is restrained from giving expression to those feelings by a grave sense of responsibility of the difficulty of finding the money for such a reform as I am putting to him, but so long as money cannot be found for that kind of reform, it is shocking that our Government should sanction expenditure <Col N="1213" /> on the wild-cat schemes that I have referred to, or should tolerate any policy which would rob our people of the capacity to earn the money necessary to finance such reforms.  I do not think that people think of these things, and I suppose they do not think of them because they do not come in contact with them, but how can any of us sleep in our beds knowing that there are people in this country with 27/- a week&mdash;a man, his wife, and five children&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>And sometimes ten and 11 children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who have got to go literally hungry, and that some of those children die because they have been starved.  That is a situation that I do not believe would be tolerated to continue if people only realised what it meant.  Now, Deputy Hickey&mdash;the Lord Mayor of Cork&mdash;has referred to even a larger family.  It, of course, is a much greater dilemma.  As a start, to tackle the problem, could we not agree in principle to a solution of that problem by providing at first that in any family with over four children there should be an allowance in respect to each additional child of 5/- a week for those under a certain income?  I think, in the initial stages of such a scheme, we would have to resolve that the qualifying income should be very low.  I think that, in the initial stages of the scheme, we would have to content ourselves with trying to abate the greater hardships, hoping in due course to provide for every child of a wage-earner a sum sufficient to make it possible for the family to rear that child and give it the minimum nourishment necessary to good health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, if we are going to stop the rush from the land, we have got to face that, and make it possible for people to rear decent families.  I do not think the agricultural labourer can now. I think we are asking him to do the impossible.  I put it to Deputies to reflect that, if we could do that, bitter as is the burden of unemployment on the vast majority of unemployed men, it would be made much less harsh if they felt that, whatever misfortune they encountered, their children would <Col N="1214" /> not suffer thereby.  Let us not overidealise this thing, because there will be abuses, and we all know that happens.  You will find an odd man who, instead of improving his children and instead of giving every penny to his children, would spend it on horse-racing and other things of that sort; but 99 per cent. of the people whom we might hope to benefit would benefit immensely thereby, and 99 per cent. of the people of this country, whether they shared directly in the benefits or not, would be happier in the knowledge that we were able to provide them, because in the enjoyment of the goods we had ourselves, we would have the satisfaction of knowing that nobody else was left outside in the cold, hungry, while we were enjoying comparative luxury.</P>
    <P>On that question I am as clear as day. That is a reform we ought to have, a reform to finance which we have to earn the last penny the land will yield, and it is because I want that type of reform brought about, because I want the standard of living of the people raised and their happiness made greater, that I should like to see the land used to its greatest advantage.  That is why I lose patience when I see things done that strike down the capacity of our people to earn money, to improve their own lives and provide for their neighbours the minimum which makes it possible for a decent man to lead a decent life.</P>
    <P>I heard the Lord Mayor of Cork assent to a good deal of what I said.  I wonder will he assent to the next part? I think unemployment is a tragedy, and that view is shared by everybody in this House.  But unemployment is a complex tragedy.  The poverty that it causes is not the whole story.  One of the grimmest consequences of unemployment is that the fellow who never has had a job, or who has lost his work, may become incapable of work altogether. He loses his physical strength, his skill; he loses being accustomed to a regular life, and all those losses go against him when he gets a chance of a job again.  You have married men unemployed and you have single men unemployed.  I think the necessity for preserving the home intact is so vital that we can envisage no circumstances <Col N="1215" /> which should require a married man to leave his home altogether and set up a separate establishment from which to do his work.  Therefore, I feel that if a man cannot get work in the locality where he has made his home, for the present, in any case, we have to reconcile ourselves to unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance until we can find work for him in a place which he can reach from his own home.</P>
    <P>The single man is different.  I have no sympathy with the single man who is not prepared to travel to take up work or to leave home in order to do so.  There is no reason why a single man should not be glad to go to Drogheda in order to take up work.  I know he might not be very happy or contented to be working in Drogheda if all his friends are in Dublin.  We have known men to go to places like India and to go to the very ends of the earth in order to take over jobs, and I think it is no great hardship for a young fellow if he has to go from one end of Ireland to the other to get a job.  Therefore, bear in mind that in the case of the young and single unemployed the prime hardship, and the menace to the community of that problem, is principally the lack of work more than the lack of going to it; the fact that he does not keep his hand in, that he loses his physical health and becomes under-nourished in the period of his unemployment.</P>
    <P>I think there is scope for something along the lines of President Roosevelt's C.C. Camps.  I think, when confronted with that problem, President Roosevelt, in the United States of America struck on a very good plan and, oddly enough, it is one that the Republicans and the Democrats and everyone in America are agreed upon. To the young unemployed there he says, as I think we ought to say: &ldquo;If you are out of work and if you cannot get a job and if you are hard up, we will provide a camp where you will get three square meals a day, where you will do useful work or, if you do not, where you will be given a life which will maintain you in good fettle and good trim and your hand will be kept in at whatever job you want to work at.  Any day you want to leave, off you pop; you are quite free to go <Col N="1216" /> home to your friends and relations if you want to and live on them, but the State will not provide you with unemployment assistance if you are not prepared to come to the camp and work there either at public works or maybe only at physical drill, just to keep yourself in good trim.  When work does come up you will be able to go straight to your job and do yourself full justice.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I believe that in that way we will prevent the immense demoralisation which any one of us would suffer if we went for years looking for work and never finding it.  There is not a man here who, if he was year after year without any occupation, would not run to seed.  If you take a youngster out of school, 16 years old, who never knows what it is to punch a clock or present himself on time, how can that fellow at 21 do himself justice if a job turns up?  Certain families might feel inclined to say: &ldquo;We would sooner give the boy some little thing and keep him amongst ourselves; we will look after him.&rdquo; To the fellow who presents himself for unemployment assistance I would say: &ldquo;Come to a C.C. Camp. There is no question of conscripting you and there is no question of compulsion. If you want to go home, off you pop.  All it means is that you get nothing when you go home.  If you want something, you are welcome in the camp.  You will be given useful work of one kind or another, and three square meals a day to keep you strong and healthy.  Whenever you get a job, or if you want to go home, off you pop. If it is a job we will help you in every way we can.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Our aim should be to run these camps so that those who have jobs to offer will be glad to get a fellow from the camps.  That is the case in America. In respect of anyone in a C.C. Camp there, no reference is asked; if he has been in the camp, it is all right.  Surely it is worth considering that plan here? If we could restore the profit-earning capacity of agriculture, if we could deal with the juvenile unemployed by looking after them properly, if we could ease the condition of the family man and provide the children of the masses of our people with an assurance of security of the minimum nourishment <Col N="1217" /> in their own homes, surely those things are worth doing?  Surely the time has come to realise that if we cannot do those things, independence and sovereignty and liberty and all the other things we fought for have proved a fraud.  Is not that what freedom is for&mdash;to make this country better for our own people than ever it was before?  I am profoundly convinced that in the situation in which we at present find ourselves we have an opportunity which may never recur to achieve those things.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is unparliamentary to mention the fact that we have got an Irishman as Minister for Agriculture in the British Government&mdash;a good Cavan man.  Why cannot our Minister go over to that man and say as one Irishman to another: &ldquo;We are prepared to give you something&mdash;security in time of war, food when you want it &mdash;if you will give us something in return.&rdquo; Ministers on that side have paid a tribute to the general attitude of the British Government, and, if I am any judge of it, I think they would be glad to do a deal on those terms, and to get for our people a very valuable share of the British market on advantageous terms.  If we can take anything off the cost of our raw material in this country, we are going to grow rich.  I have been a prophet of evil, a prophet of despair, so long as the economic war went on.  I tell you now that this country can grow not only comfortable, but rich, if we take our chance, and out of those riches we can provide comforts and happiness, not only for the farmers, but for the poor and for every section of the community. Surely that is worth doing?  Surely it is something worth asking for?  Surely it is more useful and less sterile than 90 per cent. of the codology that goes on in this House?  If we can make a considerable part of our people happier, better and stronger than ever they were before, that is what this Party ask the Government to do.  They have got a chance such as no Government or no representatives of the Irish people ever had before.  I think it is the fervent prayer of everybody on this side of the House that, no matter where the political advantage may lie, <Col N="1218" /> for the sake of the country and for the sake of our people, the present Government will not lose their opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>This Vote on Account, associated with the Estimates which were recently circulated, is, I presume, supposed to represent the cost of government in this country, or this part of the country, under normal conditions. This is the first year in which Fianna Fáil have introduced a Vote on Account, or Estimates, to be followed later by the Budget, under normal conditions, because, practically since they came into office, they have been associated with an economic war which gave them the excuse for refusing or failing to put their own policy and plans into operation.  Before the Fianna Fáil Party were voted into office in 1932, they indicated to the country that if and when they came into power they would reduce the Estimates for nonproductive services by a total of £2,000,000.  I have been reading some of the statements made by the Minister and his colleagues previous to that particular period, and they indicated that they would be able to make up this saving of £2,000,000 per annum from services such as the Oireachtas, Law Charges, Department of Justice, Gárda Síochána, the Army and the Civil Service, meaning, presumably, the Department of Finance and those servants of the State who come under its control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting, and I am sure it will be instructive to quote, for the information of those who want to have the figures in this debate, the cost of the services referred to at that period compared with the cost of the same services in this year.  The Estimates for 1932-33, which were the last Estimates presented to the House by the Cosgrave Government, indicated that the cost of the Oireachtas at that time was £114,360.  That figure has increased to £125,070 for the current year.  The cost of the Department of Finance for the year 1932-33 was £61,130 while for the current year it is £71,220.  Law Charges in 1932-33 cost £58,767 while the cost for the current year is estimated at £69,293.  The Department of Justice for 1932-33 cost £40,218 while for the current year its cost is £43,461.  The Gárda Síochána <Col N="1219" /> in 1932-33 cost £1,683,365, while for the current year the cost is £1,880,551.  In 1932-33 we were told that the Army would not be required at all, that it was likely to be abolished and that we might expect a saving in future years of the amount which was estimated for it that year, namely £1,318,455.  Yet, in the Estimates for the current year, for the Army alone we are presented with a bill of £3,252,199 or 146 per cent. more than the cost of the Army in the last year of the Cosgrave Government. The six services which I have mentioned were the services which were specifically referred to by the Fianna Fáil Party and its leaders, as being services which afforded an opportunity for saving, before they were voted into office here.  Members of the Fianna Fáil Party, who want to know, can now see the picture presented to the House and to the people who have to pay the increased charges for these non-productive services.</P>
    <P>We are told, of course, by Ministers, when they sit at night at ceremonial functions in the city and in the country, that the country is much more prosperous to-day than it was during the last year of the life of the Cosgrave Government.  How are we to judge the prosperity of the people of this country?  The Minister for Finance in his wildest moments&mdash;and he sometimes gets off the track as he did here to-day &mdash;would hardly suggest that the increased number of motor cars in this country is any indication of the general prosperity of our people.  I certainly would not rely upon the increased number of motor cars to justify the suggestion that the people of the country are more prosperous to-day than they were in 1932, 1929 or at any period prior to this Government coming into office.</P>

      <P>When I talk about the prosperity of the people of this country, I have got to find out for myself what generally are the conditions prevailing amongst the agricultural community to-day.  Is it to be taken for granted that the farmers in the country&mdash;and I should like to hear some of the Fianna Fáil Deputies from my constituency on this matter&mdash;are getting out of the beet growing industry because they are getting too much profit out of it?  I speak with knowledge&mdash;and I should like to be contradicted if I am not stating facts&mdash;when I say that there is a considerable decrease in the acreage of land under beet, not alone in my own constituency but all over the beet growing counties.  I suggest that the decrease in the acreage of beet is due to the fact that the beet-growing or tillage farmers of the country are unable to make that part of their industry pay.  In other words, they are not getting a profitable return for their labour out of that particular section of the industry.  I believe it is due to some extent to the fact that during a limited period of the time that has elapsed since the economic war was settled, the farmers, or some of them, have been getting an increased price for live stock.  But another section of the farmers can prove to the satisfaction of those who want to find out that they have been getting a lower price during portion of that time than they received during the economic war.  The figures at our disposal prove that from 1929 to 1938, there has been a drop of 10.2 per cent. in agricultural prices.  On top of that, there is, to the knowledge of every Deputy who knows anything about the position of the farming or rural community, an increase of about 30 per <Col N="1221" /> cent. in rates, apart from increased cost of production.  If the rural parts of the country are, as some people suggest, more prosperous than they were in 1932-33, how is it that the sons and daughters of the farmers are clearing out of the country and trying to find a livelihood elsewhere?  The Minister for Local Government gave us on the 26th October, 1938, figures to show that, in the middle of 1936, the population was 2,967,000 and that, in the middle of 1938, it was 2,937,000. These figures show that there has been a decrease in the population of the State of 30,000 during that period. From the Minister for Industry and Commerce, we had the statement the other day, when he was introducing his Supplementary Estimate, that the number of unemployed in the rural areas had increased by 10,000 over the figure for the corresponding period last year.</P>
      <P>Deputy Childers is a student of figures and has taken part in debates in this House.  He may know more about conditions in his own constituency than I do, but I speak with knowledge of the position in my own constituency.  I say that farmers and the people generally in my constituency have just passed through the worst winter for 15 or 20 years.  I am in intimate personal contact with working farmers in my own constituency and I have the benefit of their experience, apart from the general knowledge that any Deputy can pick up.  I am assured that the majority of farmers who had capital prior to the economic war have lost it as a result of the fight they put up during that war.  As a result of the failure of the Government to find working capital for them, hundreds of farmers are working their farms in a way which they should not be allowed to work them. A farmer must have adequate working capital at his disposal in order to work his farm to the best advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If he has not that working capital, he should be provided with it by some State or semi-State institution, so that he may stock his holding and purchase the necessary seed.  A shopkeeper who has his shop only half stocked will not, <Col N="1222" /> if he keeps a full staff, be able to pay his overhead charges.  The position of the farmer, from that point of view, was never worse since I was elected a member of this House in 1922.  I am saying this because I want the Ministry to make up their minds to come to the aid of the farmers by providing the capital necessary to enable them to work the land to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>During the last general election, the Minister went down the country and, with that tongue of his which knows no limit so far as slander and personal abuse are concerned, suggested that if his Party got a clear majority, they would immediately put their agricultural, transport, and industrial policies into operation.  &ldquo;Give us a clear majority,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and we will put our policy in operation,&rdquo; conveying to any intelligent person who might be listening that the Government had an agricultural, a transport and a financial policy&mdash;a general plan&mdash;ready for operation for the solution of all the ills from which the people were suffering at that period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not much annoyed by the type of language the Minister for Finance uses.  What I suggest is that the Minister, his colleagues and the candidates of the Fianna Fáil Party misled the people when they told them that they had an agricultural policy. Instead of producing their policy for the solution of the difficulties of the farmers, they walked into the parlour of the Opposition and accepted a proposal to set up an agricultural commission. If they had a policy, there was no necessity for setting up a commission, consisting of 21 or 24 persons, who will probably sit in secret for four or five years, or until the eve of the next general election.  I suggest that the Government should not wait for an interim or final report from the agricultural commission to make up their minds&mdash;if they have any minds to make up&mdash;to provide farmers and those dependent upon them with the capital necessary to work their land and make a decent livelihood.  As this Government has, with the consent of the majority of the people, presented a Christmas box of £10,000,000 to John Bull, in satisfaction of a debt which they alleged for years they did not owe, they should be able to find at least £5,000,000 to provide farmers with money free of interest or at a nominal rate of interest for the development of their land.  If they can ask the people, through this House, in which they have a clear majority, to vote £5,500,000 by that machine-like majority, for a defence plan which they admit is useless against the great European countries, they should be able to find the money necessary to enable the farmers to work and till their land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same can be said in regard to their failure to provide money for the relief of unemployment.  We had the silver-tongued Parliamentary Secretary attempting the other evening to justify the present method of administering minor relief schemes and the rotational method of employment on those schemes.  He asked me whether I was aware of the amount of money expended for the relief of unemployment under such schemes, or whether I was aware of the amount of money expended in my own constituency.  I had to confess that I was not aware of the <Col N="1224" /> exact amount made available for that purpose, but it was very interesting&mdash; and I am sure it must have been interesting to the Fianna Fáil Deputies for the same constituency&mdash;to learn from him that 86 of one per cent. of the total Vote was allocated for the relief of unemployment under minor relief works in my constituency.  It is no wonder that Deputy Gorry would blush, as he did blush on that occasion. I wonder will any Fianna Fáil Deputies suggest that that is the proper way to carry out the promises which were made during the past year?  I wonder will any of them suggest that that is the proper way to carry out the promise to produce and put into operation a plan for the relief of unemployment?</P>
    <P>What is the method of administering minor relief schemes?  Certain individuals, a limited number of individuals, who are placed on minor relief works are told to take up their jobs on those schemes, and they have to work for a month before they get a penny in the shape of wages.  When they cease work on those schemes they have to go back and register at the labour exchange, and it is two weeks before they are reinstated for the payment of unemployment benefit.  That is the so-called Christian policy which this Government has put into operation so far as the provision of money for minor relief works, or the payment of those who are compulsorily employed on those schemes, is concerned.  They can provide increased sums to the tune of millions for the Army, for the Civic Guards, for bounties which never get back to the producers, and for other non-productive purposes of that kind, but money cannot be provided for the purpose of supplying cheap loans or loans at a nominal rate of interest for the farming community, nor can sufficient money be made available for the provision of continuous employment at decent rates of wages for those who are willing to take work on any kind of scheme, rather than try to exist on the miserable pittances which are provided by way of unemployment assistance. They had their plan for the solution of the unemployment problem, and the plan so far has produced an unemployed register list of 104,000 people. On top of that we had it from the <Col N="1225" /> Minister for Local Government that there has been emigration from this country, to England presumably, during the past two years to the tune of 30,000 people.  That is the plan which they promised the people of this country to put into operation when they got their clear majority.</P>
    <P>What is their transport policy?  The Minister for Industry and Commerce made speeches to enthusiastic thousands in Inchicore on the eve of the last general election.  He repeated those speeches in other places where there was a large number of railway workers who had been thrown out of employment, and who were hoping that somebody would come forward and save from ruin the industry in which they had been employed for many years.  The transport policy which the Ministry has produced since the last general election is a tribunal of inquiry to report to them by 8th February.  I do not want to suggest that a tribunal could be set up which could possibly submit sensible recommendations inside the period mentioned by the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he was moving that motion here in the House before Christmas.  I do suggest, though, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his colleagues misled the people who are dependent on a well-organised transport in this country. They misled them during the general election period of last year when they told them they had a plan and policy for the solution of the chaotic position in which the transport industry then found itself.</P>
    <P>They promised that the necessary money would be provided for carrying out extensive schemes of bog reclamation, for afforestation, for drainage, and for every other kind of useful work, and those are useful works which would give valuable and perhaps well paid employment to large numbers of people.  The money cannot be found. What are they doing in connection with the drainage business?  Like every other Deputy from my own constituency, and like every other Deputy who deals with the communications that come to him from his rural constituency, I communicate from time to time to the <Col N="1226" /> Board of Works and other Departments proposals which I get from my constituency, suggesting that money should be allocated for carrying out drainage schemes in my constituency.  They have a stock reply which now says that pending the findings or recommendations of the Drainage Commission&mdash; another commission which has been set up&mdash;nothing further can be done for the present in connection with the suggestions or proposals put forward by you.</P>
    <P>Afforestation is the kind of work which can provide a good deal of valuable employment for the workless if the Government would make up their minds to find the money to enable them to carry it out.  I dare say that in those matters the Government is largely influenced&mdash;I should like to hear the answer to it if they are not&mdash;by the advice given to them by their finance officials or by the bankers of this country who are behind the financial advisers to the Government.  It must be admitted that there is a queer kind of mentality in this world of to-day when we find that every country, including this so-called Christian country and so-called Christian Government, can get millions of money from the people of the State for the purpose of supplying implements of destruction, but we cannot get the money from those so-called Christian-minded men, or those who are behind them, for increasing production or carrying out works of a constructive nature.  I read recently, and was very glad to read, that this Government will be represented at a coming ceremony in Rome. I hope the representatives of this Government who go to Rome will spend a few days extra there trying to find out the real meaning of the Pope's Encyclicals, and not come back here and quote them here on suitable occasions, as they have been doing, but without carrying them out or giving effect to them.</P>
    <P>The cost of living is a problem which affects large numbers of our citizens to-day.  We have a Prices Commission, and the work of that Prices Commission has been under consideration in this House on several occasions recently.  There are people sitting on the Government Benches and on the <Col N="1227" /> Opposition Benches in this House who know more about the activities of the Prices Commission than I do, but we have had it proved in the report of the Prices Commission recently printed by the Government that the bacon curers of this country have been making a little bit more than they should.</P>

      <P>Only about 3d. per lb. more than they were legally entitled to charge or rightfully entitled to charge, in the opinion of the Prices Commission, and they only made excess profits to the extent of about £308,000.  Of course, that is nothing when you say it quickly, but it would provide a good deal of employment for our people in carrying out works of national and local importance in this country.  We have had it denied repeatedly by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, before that report was published recently, that there was any such thing as profiteering going on in the bacon industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>May I respectfully point out that it is not necessary to introduce legislation to give effect to my suggestion? On the occasion that the last measure was introduced setting up the Prices Commission, the Minister said that he was prepared, in certain circumstances, to set up a permanent body, or to increase the numbers on it, or to duplicate it, should the necessity arise. We had it then from the Minister for Industry and Commerce that over 100 applications had been received from <Col N="1229" /> British industrialists, and the Minister, in his frank way, on that occasion suggested that it would perhaps take about three years to deal with the work which had been delegated to the commission as a result of the Trade Agreement with Great Britain.  I am suggesting that the Prices Commission should be duplicated or be made a permanent body, or the personnel increased, in order to deal with the profiteering which has been going on.  It is more important from my point of view, and from the point of view of the average citizen, that the Prices Commission should deal with matters referred to it by the Minister, or by other organisations in connection with allegations of profiteering internally, than be concerned about undue delay in dealing with the 100 applications received from British industrialists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to the details published in the appropriate Government Journal in 1932 the cost-of-living index figure stood at 155, while the latest figures to which I have access, up to November, 1938, show that the cost-of-living index figure was 176.  That is a serious matter for the workless, as well as for the lowly-paid in every section of the community.  If the Minister for Agriculture takes part in the debate I want to know what proposals he intends to adopt, or what action he proposes to take, to deal with the profiteering activities of the bacon curers, as a result of the information in his possession by the publication of the recent report of the Prices Commission. I am taking part in this debate for one reason only, because I feel it is a scandalous state of affairs for a Government to come to this House, and to ask it to provide millions of money for a defence scheme, which the Minister for Defence admitted would be ineffective in a general European war.  The Minister said it would take £50,000,000 instead of £5,550,000 to provide an effective defence scheme for this State, so that in that way the spending of £5,550,000 this year, presumably on defence, is useless.  I suggest if that money is available it could be spent more usefully, from the national point <Col N="1230" /> of view, in providing loans for farmers to enable them to work the land, to increase production, and to make a livelihood for themselves and their dependents.  Another matter that I wish to raise on this debate is the attitude of the Government in connection with the applications made for military service pensions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

      <P>I should like to have the matter disposed of before the end of the world or the Resurrection.  According to my figures it will take 33 years to dispose of the applications that have been received, judging by the way that applications have been dealt with during the last four or five years.  I appeal to the Minister for Agriculture to realise, as I am sure he must, the present position of farmers.  I ask him to realise that many of the farmers who supported him in silence, and probably publicly also, in order to win the economic war that was carried on by the Government for three or four years, are to-day without any capital as a result of the sacrifices they made.  How can the Government expect these people to increase production, and to provide a livelihood for themselves and their children on the land if they do not get the necessary capital to enable them to do so?  If the Minister and his colleague do not face up to that pressing problem immediately, by taking the necessary steps to provide money that <Col N="1231" /> is urgently required, I think there will be a different tale to be told when the Vote on Account is brought before the House this time next year, by whatever Government will be in charge of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I think on an occasion like this it is better, if possible, to speak, as far as is humanly reasonable, aside from mere Party prejudice.  I wish to support the Vote on Account, principally on the ground that to make any drastic changes at the present time would be extremely unwise, unwise because the economic war has only just passed, and also unwise in this respect, that a new situation has to be considered, and the country is faced with the danger of a change in its internal economy and in certain ameliorations, as well as matters which arose at the time of the crisis in international affairs.  I feel that we should make no serious change in the Budget or the Estimates, on the ground that the Government cannot possibly have had time yet to study the Report of the Banking Commission, whose conclusions lead us to believe that the rate at which certain things have been done by the Government may be excessive, and that the cost of certain things done by the Government may be excessive.</P>
      <P>All the conclusions lead us to believe that we should maintain our Estimates at approximately the same level and without any drastic changes.  I think it is opportune now to refute many of the statements made by Deputy Dillon in which he gave the impression to the House that the country was going through a very serious financial crisis, that it was rapidly going downhill, and suggested that unless something extraordinary was done it would be in a very grave and precarious position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Do you deny it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I deny that definitely. On the contrary.  I say that the position is far more complex, but taking what I consider to be an impartial survey, I advance the opinion that the Estimates should be left where they are.  As far as the general financial position of the country is concerned, I take it that it can only be discussed in a general way <Col N="1232" /> until the Estimates are introduced.  The general trade of the country is up by £20,000,000, but, at the same time, taking the period before the Government took office, we are, as far as external trade is concerned, £25,000,000 below the 1921 figures.  That is offset, to a certain degree, by an increase in the circulation of money, through our industrial development, of over £10,000,000.  The adverse trade balance, which was alluded to in the Banking Commission report, and which would give anyone cause for alarm who was presenting large estimates before a House, is, luckily, reduced during the past year by £3,000,000, and as the Banking Commission report suggested that there was a real adverse trade balance of over £3,500,000, after allowing for all invisible export items, we may take it that the worst of the adverse trade balance has been removed, that there is, in actual fact, for last year, very little excess adverse trade balance if the invisible export items are included in the account.  At the same time, we have nothing to fear as far as the figures of the circulation of money show.  The figures for the circulation of money show a constant increase, indicating that there is no serious position in that regard.  It is true that, during the period of the economic war, in order to finance the economic war, for which we feel we had political justification, we lost a considerable volume of external assets.  An important part of these were reinvested in home industries, and what the actual external assets lost, after eliminating the transfer of our external assets to home industries, is a matter that has not yet been determined, but there is evidence that the decline in those assets is beginning to cease.</P>
      <P>The same thing would apply to our banking deposits, which showed a certain decline during the economic war, but which, according to the chairmen of the various banks at their recent meetings, showed a change for the better in the beginning of the present year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the general financial position of the country, certain Deputies have already referred to increased export prices, since the lowest period of the economic war, to <Col N="1233" /> the general increase in agricultural prices.</P>
    <P>We should bear in mind one thing in connection with the unemployment figures.  You must not think too hastily on this question of unemployment.</P>

      <P>We have to look back to the yet more important year of 1935, when we were in the middle of an economic war, and receiving very small support from the Opposition, carrying out a national policy that had been approved by the people as a whole. During that year there were 141,000 persons unemployed in October, and during this year, in February, there were 105,000, indicating a very distinct improvement; indicating, as I have said before, that the position is gradually getting better.  What we are all anxious to do is to make sure that it gets better quickly enough.</P>

      <P>And, also, during the period of the Opposition's administration, over 250,000 left for England, under an economic system that was supposed to be ideal, under a system in which we did everything England wanted us to do, when we were joined by every sort of link with England. One quarter of a million went to England at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the same period there has also been a reduction in the number of people receiving home assistance.  The figure is woefully large still, but the fact remains it has gone down by nearly 15 per cent. since the period of 1935, which was the serious period of the economic war.  I come now to the question of agriculture.  I come of a family part of whom have been in farming for many years.  I am not a farmer myself, but I have taken opportunity to inquire with the greatest possible detail into the position of agriculture at the present time.  I first of all would like to agree with Deputy Davin that, in the areas surrounding the Shannon, there has been very considerable distress, and in the areas <Col N="1234" /> where there are flat, low-lying lands, and I would like to ask the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture to consider seriously the position of the farmers of this country, at the end of an economic war, who are going to begin production in the spring, who, in addition to the losses entailed in the economic war, have also suffered serious losses in the value of their crops last year, and who have a lack of certain agricultural capital requirements, both in kind and in money, I would suggest to them that, from the psychological point of view, if not from the financial point of view, they do need special assistance if it can be given.</P>
    <P>With regard to the agricultural position in general, here again I absolutely deny that you can describe the position in one word, because my conclusion is precisely the conclusion derived from the Banking Commission Report, in view of the fact that the deposits of farmers, their hard won savings which no one would encourage them to disburse with facility, in relation to their total debts, show a very large proportion to the good.  There is no question that there are also certain classes of farmers throughout the country who have virtually gone out of production and who are not paying their rates or annuities, and who will have to receive assistance from the Government when the Agricultural Commission has made its report.  For farmers of every size, of every acreage, in every part of my constituency, the position is, I feel, a complicated one. There are people who have obviously survived very successfully, and many others who are obviously in a very difficult position, and no generalisation with regard to the agricultural position is, I feel, safe at all.  It is a matter which requires the careful and quiet consideration of just such a commission as the Government has established simply because it is not a simple problem.  I feel more intensely every time I visit my constituency and become acquainted with conditions there that it is not a simple problem and that mere generalisations will never serve to solve the problem of increasing agricultural production.  The farmers have been discouraged by the <Col N="1235" /> economic war and bad weather from investing any of their hard won savings in their industry.  They have been discouraged by the uncertainty of the international position and by the uncertainty of what the future of agriculture will be.  It is no use providing quick and hopeless remedies for that position.  Only a clear and careful consideration will possibly be of any use in building up agricultural production.</P>
    <P>I do agree with Deputy Dillon when he spoke of the necessity of reducing agricultural costs and increasing production.  I feel convinced that, unless the farmers of this country can produce about 30 per cent. more off their present acreage of land, by Government assistance, by more modern methods, by greater certainty in their livelihood, and by general reduction in their costs, we shall never be able to continue to pay for the very heavy social services for which the people are now taxed.  I admit that is a very serious problem and will require, not one month nor six months, not one year, but a number of years of research, before the matter is finally put right.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to the question of land reconstruction.  I would not advocate for the moment that there should be a large increase in the amount of money allocated for drainage until we have been able to study the whole problem of what should be the contribution of, first of all, the State, secondly, the farmer and, thirdly, the average individual, towards the various types of drainage works on which depends a great part of agricultural prosperity.</P>
    <P>One of the most difficult positions in the country at the present time is that in the &ldquo;yellow&rdquo; areas, as they are called by the Public Works Department, where there is not a sufficient number of unemployed at the present time to warrant the minor relief grant. The farmers in those areas are unwilling to undertake public works of great importance, partly because of difficulties they find there, and partly because they feel that grants should be forthcoming which, in fact, will not be forthcoming.  That is a matter which also will require the attention of the Government in the future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1236" /> The question of rural unemployment, I think, is bound up with this whole question of uncertainty.  I feel convinced, in my own constituency, that unemployment in rural districts is not due solely to economic distress that may have been occasioned to farmers but is due far more to the under-employment of agricultural labourers which is taking place because we are so near the end of the economic war and because there is as yet no definite policy advocated and there cannot be a definite policy advocated until the Agricultural Commission has laid down some lines for the future.  I feel that very strongly, that the whole position of unemployment in the country is partly a matter of under-employment, rather than a matter of financial distress preventing employment, or rather I should say it is a combination of both. It is the existence of the combination of both these factors that makes it so difficult to advocate any general policy until we have had the results and the reports of these two commissions.</P>

      <P>I said that it was due to a combination of two circumstances and that there were two types of farmers in this country&mdash;those who, owing to uncertainty, are unwilling to risk any small capital expenditure on new developments, and those who have definitely suffered from the economic war and who are not in a financial position to employ people.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that in a few moments.  Coming to the general position of the country, I say unequivocally that, without any question, the people of this country are better off than they were before this Government entered into office, that the people have a better appearance, have a better life, and, in the vast majority of cases, have more money to spend.  I make <Col N="1237" /> that claim definitely.  I claim that the whole position of the Government is exactly as I have described it, that it is not a simple problem, and I am willing to admit that the reason there is that money circulating is that the Government have enormously increased expenditure on State service, and have enormously increased taxation, which they have distributed amongst the less well-off section of the people.  As a result, there has been a certain increase in our total dead-weight debt which will have to be paid off by a future generation.  The problem is far more one of how to readjust our agricultural economy to ensure that our position is economically sound over a period of 10 to 15 years, rather than any immediate problem of how to deal with the question of any supposed lack of purchasing power in the country.  I deny, from going around Longford, South Roscommon, and the Athlone district of Westmeath, that the people are not relatively better off than they were. I have gone amongst them, and I have spoken to them, and I claim that their position at the present time is definitely a tolerable position.  There are areas where there is serious unemployment, and there are areas where there are congested districts and peculiar problems to be faced, but, taking it large and wide, the Government, by their wise policy of expansion in expenditure and development of social services and public works, have caused to circulate amongst the people of the country a sufficient amount of purchasing power to offset the worst effects of the economic war, and which leaves the country in a relatively stable condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I say that with full responsibility for knowing what I am saying, and I am prepared to go back to my constituency at any time and face the people there, in the full confidence that what I am saying is sincere and true.  Our position now is a matter of adjustment, a matter of studying how to improve our relations to the English market, and how to overcome the difficulties that have arisen from the economic war. There is nothing fundamentally serious in it.  I would add that so far as unemployment figures are concerned, in relation to the principal countries of <Col N="1238" /> Europe, we are among the five lowest figures, in spite of having fought an economic war.  I do not deny the seriousness of the position, but let us be fair.  We are among the five lowest figures for unemployment, even if we add the figures for two years' emigration during the past five years.</P>
    <P>Since the debate has turned to a very considerable degree on the question of emigration, the Deputies should face up to reality, and I, in saying what I believe and perhaps being almost too impartial in the matter, have no hesitation in doing so. Emigration in this country has for many years been a pretty serious problem, and one of the cardinal facts of emigration which we all have to face is this: The position is exactly the same as it was in the 19th century, in this, that, in the 19th century, from 1851 for 50 years, emigration from Ireland and from Germany to America was in exact proportion, indicating that emigration is to a very considerable degree due to an attraction from another country, rather than to particular financial conditions in the country of origin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy believe that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures are definitely true.  They cannot be denied. I say that there is that element in it. For many years, emigration from Ireland, under many changing conditions, has been equivalent to the emigration from Germany to America. I do not believe that the conditions have altered sufficiently seriously to warrant our changing our belief that it is very frequently, to a great degree, due to the draw from a country where they speak the same language as ourselves and where there are often temporary and permanent financial inducements. As far as emigration in the last three years is concerned, I would remind the House that the national income of the English people reached a record figure for all time in the years 1936 and 1937.  The amount of money which the English people had to spend reached a record figure, due partly to a recovery from the depression, and <Col N="1239" /> partly to armament expenditure, and there was a demand for labour in England which had to be satisfied, and which could not be satisfied from their home sources, according to the admission of a British Parliamentary paper, and which would have drawn people, sadly enough, from this country, no matter what Government were in office and no matter what financial conditions were at the time.</P>
      <P>That is a very serious fact which we have to face.  We have also to take into account that, in 1940, the English population, according to their experts, will begin to decline, and the lure to emigrate to England will be more dangerous and serious than ever.  It is a national problem which goes far beyond any Party delimitations, or any question of what our economic position is in this country.  It depends on the changing economic policy of England, and not to a great degree on the effect of the last five years of government. As the House well knows, a great part of the emigration takes place in the Gaeltacht, in the very poorest part of Ireland, and there the position always is that if there is a certain amount of labour available in England, the people will leave, no matter whether this country is in a condition of great prosperity or not.  I am not saying that more would not leave if the country were poor, but there will always be a certain number of people going to England for those positions.  I need only remind the House at present that there are licences for over 12,000 non-nationals, Austrians in service in England, so great is the demand for a certain type of labour, and I suggest that if the British Government allow 12,000 people from Europe to enter domestic service, there must be a demand for labour, but no financial difficulties we have caused in this country, through the policy which we believe succeeded in determining a great part of our national problem, were in existence for a great part of that emigration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to the Deputy, I know something about drainage, and I do not believe that anything can be done in a small way in the two places I have mentioned. Something extremely big will have to be done, and the excuse we have always got from the Government for the last two years when we raised these questions is &ldquo;Wait until we set up the commission.&rdquo; Twelve months afterwards, we ask: &ldquo;Have you set up the commission?&rdquo; and we are told: &ldquo;No, we are going to set it up.&rdquo; We ask: &ldquo;When will it report?&rdquo; and we are told: &ldquo;We do not know.&rdquo; We ask: &ldquo;How long will it take after the report has been presented to deal with the situation?&rdquo; and the answer is: &ldquo;We do not know.&rdquo; The Government will have to consider the report; then they will have to legislate on the report; and then they will have to report on the schemes.  Meanwhile the Shannon, the Brick, the Main and the various other rivers will have to conduct themselves and not overflow their banks.  As I say, the Deputy cannot be described as a young man in a hurry.</P>
      <P>We have the same thing with regard to agriculture.  He admitted that the problem was complex and that there were a number of people who were fairly well off&mdash;I do not want to misrepresent him&mdash;others not so well off and others on the brink.  Are we going to have to wait until these others are fully over the brink in order to get this commission to make up their minds as to what the Government have to do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1241" /> The whole plea of Deputy Childers was that the Government should not be hurried, and Deputy Davin's plea was that he hoped the Government would make up their minds to do something one way or the other.  Candidly, I think that, when it comes to a matter of the Government making up their minds to do certain things, in view of many of the things they have done in the past, it would have been better if they had not been able to make up their minds to do anything.  There have been so many things that have been harmful to the country, put through by the present Government, I think it would have been better if they had got away from this question of general policy altogether and had settled down to matters of detail, such as the question of drainage or the question of unemployment.  I think that if they had dropped their general policy altogether and got down to matters of detail such as I have suggested, it would have been much better for the country.</P>
    <P>I gather that the Government has been so busy during the last seven years, or whatever the number of years is since they came into office&mdash;since 1932, at any rate&mdash;waging the economic war that they had not time to think of the needs of the country&mdash;that they had not time to deal with these other matters.  During the period of that economic war we generally used to hear that period referred to by Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches as the glorious years of the economic war, but at least to-night we have heard that period referred to as the &ldquo;grim years of the economic war&rdquo;.  We have that admission, at last.  How was that period referred to from Deputies and Ministers on the opposite benches during the period in which the economic war was going on?  How was it pictured by the Minister for Agriculture?  We were then told that the farmer was never so well off as he was during the economic war.  Now that the economic war is over, we are being told the same thing now&mdash;that at last the farmer is well off.  The Deputy, it seems, has been down the country, and he comes back and tells us that this year is looking well for the farmers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1242" /> In my opinion, although the economic war is over, it is only now that the farmers and the people in the small towns in the country are beginning to feel the brunt of the economic war. Then, to add to their misfortunes, they have to contend with one of the worst years we have ever had in this country from the point of view of the weather. I quite admit, of course, that the Government is not responsible for the weather conditions, but the Government is certainly responsible, I hold, for putting the farmers in such a condition as makes it impossible for them properly to meet bad years like the present, when they come.  That is the real position.</P>
    <P>Then we have this talk about lightening or reducing the overhead charges on farming, but year after year we have these Estimates, each of which is higher than the one that went before it.  Of course, if one looks at the cover of this book, one would imagine that the Estimate is smaller, but if you take one item&mdash;the Agricultural Grant&mdash;you will see that there is £370,000 there not accounted for; it does not appear in this figure of £30,000,000 because the necessary legislation is not there to provide it; but that legislation will be brought in.  The case is similar with regard to other items.  Then take the case of the Army or the Gárda Síochána&mdash;items that were always subject to severe criticism from the people opposite when they were in opposition.  We were always being told of the savings that could be effected in connection with these items.  Have any savings been effected?  What has happened?  The very opposite.  Savings, it seems, have been effected with regard to agriculture and industry and commerce, and that is how the figures are apparently less than last year's figures, but in reality, so far as really useful services are concerned, there is a reduction, but actually the figures are a great deal higher than last year's figures.  And yet we have Deputies speaking of the necessity of keeping down the overhead charges on the farmer.  A nice way they are doing it! There is, undoubtedly, a type of expenditure that is not reproductive&mdash;that on defence.  We discussed that here a short time ago, but I hold that if the <Col N="1243" /> Government is really serious about attacking the problem of keeping down expenditure, it should have put up a much better case for its so-called defence policy than was put up in this House.</P>
    <P>Does anybody suggest that any satisfactory case for a defence policy was put up here by the Government to justify the expenditure that is now being made on it?  We voted against it because no case was put up by the Government to justify that expenditure, even for the purpose of defence. Yet, the Government cannot cut down taxation, and Deputy Childers' great plea is: &ldquo;Keep things as they are.&rdquo; They have not time to think of where they ought to save money! Give them a chance, we are told.  They have only been in office for the last six or seven years, but &ldquo;Give them a chance.&rdquo; and if you give them a chance for another 20 years, perhaps they might be able to strike on some place where they might be able to cut down expenditure and save money; but since they have spent so much money already, the plea that is now put forward is to keep it up, to keep things as they are, not to disturb them in their spending.  Well, at least, that is as good a defence for Government policy as any that has been heard from the Ministers.  I will say that at least for the Deputy.  You cannot have all this kind of expenditure without a great deal of the burden being passed on to the consumer.  Of course it is the consumer who has to foot the bill.  As has been pointed out from these benches here, year after year, these items of expenditure which involve taxation are only a portion of the burden the people have to bear. We all know the clever&mdash;I was going to say, manipulation, but let us say the clever book-keeping transaction of which the Minister for Finance was guilty a few years ago by which he transferred, in the matter of taxation, the direct passage of money from the consumer to the manufacturer, and the people were led to believe that they had escaped taxation in that way, whereas they were paying up to the hilt just as they had been paying before.  Our concealed taxes are a very heavy item in our burdens, but they <Col N="1244" /> find no mention in this £35,000,000.</P>
    <P>The Government, apparently, has learned one lesson, at any rate.  I gathered from the Deputy's speech that the one thing the Government had done, beyond involving us in the &ldquo;grim years&rdquo; of the economic war, was, that they had collected and spent more money than their predecessors. That, however, was called by another name.  They helped the circulation of money, we are told.  That was the principal service&mdash;the circulation of money, by taking the money out of the pocket of Peter in order to pay Paul, and so on.</P>
    <P>The economic war was well fought and well borne by the country for that great service! No consideration at all is given as to where that policy will lead.  Apparently, if we are to follow that particular line, the Government ought to be condemned, not for presenting us with a demand for £35,000,000, but for not presenting us with a sum of about £70,000,000, since the circulation of money would be all the greater in that case! Yes, that is the policy that was chosen, not merely by the Deputy who has just spoken, but by the man who was at that time Vice-President and is now the Tanaiste: namely, that they did raise this money and that they did spend it and would raise and spend more&mdash;one of the few successful industries they succeeded in establishing during their period of office&mdash;raising taxes.  They did politically teach the people of this country one thing, namely, that no matter what some people may say it is not an unpopular thing to increase taxation and forget all about the future.  However unsound that policy may be, the Government at any rate have learned that it is not a vote-losing policy.</P>
    <P>A policy for agriculture! I had the good fortune a few days ago to read the address of the Minister for Agriculture to the Agricultural Commission. Not a single word of that could not have been spoken by the late Minister for Agriculture, Mr. Hogan.  It is almost word for word a reproduction of the policy for which he stood.  For six years they jumped from one thing to another trying to kill that policy, determined not to give it a chance. <Col N="1245" /> They tried every possible thing, except the one obvious thing they have now come back to&mdash;the return to Mr. Hogan's policy.  We are told by the Minister for Agriculture in that address:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Agriculture may be said to be the very life blood of the nation.  It is the basis on which our whole economic structure is built up, and anything that affects the prosperity of farming is reflected in the conditions of livelihood of the whole community.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We preached that year after year and we were scoffed at for doing so and told that we were satisfied to have the country as a ranch for Great Britain. We were also told by the Minister the other day that other markets were hard to get, that they are very limited, and that we should try to make the most of the one which was once hailed as &ldquo;gone for ever&rdquo;, but which we have been told in the speech just delivered by Deputy Childers has established new record years in its history.</P>
    <P>This Government has a policy.  I do not deny that it has.  It has had ten different conflicting policies on agriculture. It has harmed the farmer with them.  It has tried them all, and, as a result, it has come back to what was the policy of the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, so far as agriculture is concerned. Let the Deputy himself read the account in the Press of the address of the Minister, and let him show me a single line of that particular address that could not have been put to the commission by the late Mr. Hogan.  I should like to know what there is left in our whole policy that they, having tried other policies, have not come back to.  They still do not attend public functions in tall hats, but I think that is about all that is left of them.  That is all that is left of the original Fianna Fáil policy.  I wonder how much longer that will last&mdash;perhaps a fortnight.</P>
    <P>The Deputy spoke of emigration.  Is he not aware that when that was first brought up by Deputies on these benches it was denied?  I myself was accused by the Minister for Finance of shamefully drawing on my imagination <Col N="1246" /> because I called attention to it.  Now it is admitted; it is something, we are told, that cannot be prevented, something that is natural, something that is not the fault of this country, but is due to the superior attractiveness of Great Britain.  &ldquo;The superior attractiveness of Great Britain&rdquo;&mdash;and therefore the less attraction of this country &mdash;I should say that is the converse of it.</P>
    <P>When people speak of the flight from the land, I know they are touching a complex problem.  I do not pretend that it is a matter for which that Government policy alone is responsible. All sorts of forces are operative to bring about that flight from the land, as it is called.  But that does not make it less regrettable.  There is a general unrest all over the world, which you will find here as well as anywhere else. There is a desire on the part of the people of the country to get out of what they consider the dull life of the country into the towns.  That is there; but if it is there, and if flight from the land is not desirable, surely there is all the more reason for trying to overcome that natural urge that people have to go from the country to the towns, all the more necessity for the Government to make the country more attractive, to try to realise that there is a problem there.  From anything I heard to-night I gathered that in the minds of Fianna Fáil there is no problem there, or at least that it is not worthy of consideration, until possibly at some future date a commission will be appointed when the Government wake up to the fact that there is a problem.</P>
    <P>What I hold is this.  There is that natural urge on the part of a large number of young people to leave the country and get to the towns.  But the Government have increased that urge; their policy has increased that urge.  As the Deputy said, we are only just over the economic war, and the effect is still with us; the years are still &ldquo;grim,&rdquo; no matter what the Government may say. They are particularly grim for a number of people in the country and, instead of trying to put a brake on this flight from the land, the whole policy of the Government is accelerating the <Col N="1247" /> flight from the land.  That is why we criticise it&mdash;because they ought to be active in the opposite direction, in stemming, not in helping that flight. Their policy is helping the flight from the country into the towns, and that is our objection to it.  We do not get rid of the problem by calling it complex, as the Deputy did.  That is not to say that the Government are not one of the complex factors in a complex situation &mdash;they and their policy have been in no small measure responsible.  They refused to face the problem of emigration three years ago, when it was first brought up in this House.  They contented themselves with denying it flatly and completely.</P>
    <P>The difficulty I find with the Government is, not that I have lost hope that in the long run they will adopt our policy, but that it takes them too long to do it.  &ldquo;Agriculture is the life blood of the country.&rdquo; Was it necessary to wait until the patient was drained practically of his life blood, was in a state of collapse from lack of blood, before making up their minds to that particular truth?  We are either serious about agriculture or we are not. The Government ought to make up their minds as to whether they are going to save agriculture: whether they are going to take the necessary steps to save it or not.  Is it fundamental? I hold that anybody who has watched their policy for a number of years past has drawn a very different conclusion. The whole policy of the Government, in so far as it favoured anything, was aimed at favouring industry in the towns against the agricultural industry. I do not say that they were completely unsuccessful in their industrial policy. They were not; not every industry was a failure by any means.</P>
    <P>After the presentation of the Prices Commission's report on the bacon factories, what are we to think of a Government that were unaware of the fact that this was going on, that no amount of protest would get them to open their minds?  Deputy Davin asked where were the motor cars coming from&mdash;and Deputy Tom Kelly intervened with an interruption.  Three hundred and eight thousand pounds extra profit would buy a fair share of motor cars to go about the City of <Col N="1248" /> Dublin and present the Dublin Corporation, of which Deputy Kelly is such an illustrious member, with a parking problem and make it more difficult for them.  There is no difficulty in explaining where motor cars come from.  We on these benches never denied that a certain number of people were making easy money.  Our whole contention was that it was extraordinarily difficult for some people not to make money under the policy of the Government in recent years; that it was extraordinarily difficult for certain people not to get rich quick as a result of Government policy in recent years.  No wonder there is money for motor cars.  It has at least one significance. The increase in motors cannot be regarded as an index of the general improvement of the country.  The difficulty is that the Government always wait several years too long to discover what the policy ought to be.</P>
    <P>We have heard much about unemployment. I am afraid the point of Deputy Morrissey's interruption was not quite grasped.  If I take the figures mentioned by the Deputy I think they are, as far as my memory of his speech goes, 135,000 and 104,000.  That is the reduction, that is, the Deputy claims, an improvement in employment.  But it leaves out of account the fact that there was an increase of 80,000 in emigration.  I fail to follow the course of the argument that leaves that calculation out in this &ldquo;complex&rdquo; problem. What are the figures?  Are we not being told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance that the one thing you cannot do with figures in connection with unemployment is to base any conclusion on them?  I often wondered why they were published.</P>
    <P>Again and again we have been told by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance that proper use has not been made of these statistics published by the Department of Industry and Commerce.  But neither the Minister nor the Parliamentary Secretary ever told us or ever enlightened the House as to what proper use could be made of these figures.  One point made was that <Col N="1249" /> whatever use is made of them the Government could not be criticised on them.  That was the conclusion they reached&mdash;the conclusion was more fundamental than the premises.  I gather there is not very much agreement between the Minister and the Parliamentary Secretary in this matter. It is the Parliamentary Secretary for Finance who has to do with the problem of unemployment.  Last week here he was asked how much it would take to put the present number of unemployed men into full employment. What was the answer?  The Minister can look it up.  He said it would cost from £10,000,000 to £15,000,000, then he came to £12,500,000.  I wonder what figure of unemployment does that give? I suppose we take the average agricultural wage per week at 27/-, find how much is that for a year and divide the figure into £12,500,000, leaving so much for materials.  In materials should not be included the amount of labour it took to produce the materials here in Ireland and to make them available that gives employment too.  If you work that out you get a figure not of 104,000 unemployed but a figure running from 50,000 to 200,000 unemployed. Now, is it the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary who is misleading the House?  Having had experience of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. I should not be inclined to say that it was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance who was misleading the House.</P>
    <P>There is just another matter with which I wish to deal.  I have referred to it already.  Again and again the Parliamentary Secretary has justified his scheme of partial employment.  My objection to that is the bad effect it has on the morale of the man.  It has a bad effect on any man to give him this employment.  He is entitled to what is called the dole, and now he is asked to work three days a week for the difference between the dole and the wages he gets for these three days' work.  If you take that man as being an ordinary man like, say, any member of this House, does anybody think that he is not regarding that three days' pay as a dole?  The difference is really only a few shillings per week extra. <Col N="1250" /> That is what it comes to.  He is bound to regard it as the dole, and the system is destroying his morale.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>You are getting that man into the sort of mentality that he regards work of that kind as a dole, and that he is quite entitled to give as little return for it as he can.  I hold that a man of ordinary mentality like, say, any member of this House, will drift into the position of looking at it as a dole.  I say that is a disastrous state of mind for every class in the community.  We have had mounting expenditure.  We should not object to that so very much if we thought there was any decent return; but the return we get is the &ldquo;grim years&rdquo; of the economic war, and the &ldquo;grim&rdquo; aftermath in which we now stand.  There may be factories in some towns, but I know of many towns in the country that have in recent years been reduced to built-up deserts partly as a result of Government policy.  Your Pigs Marketing Board has interfered with the ordinary pig markets in the country towns. It is the same with every phase of Government policy; the effect of this Government policy has been to destroy the ordinary business town in the country.  Serious as is the position this winter for the farmers, the position in the towns is still worse.</P>
      <P>When I go into these towns they remind me of built-up deserts.  I have gone into them in my own constituency and in my own town, I have looked through the streets and I have not seen a single countryman in the town.  The only people one sees there are the townspeople.  Yet, we are told here, to-night, that the country is prosperous. There is a chance of doing something, but judging from what we have seen up to the present we are forced to the conclusion that every effort on the part of the Government in the way of building up only means interference and still more interference.  We are told they are building up the country. Nothing of the kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture at last realises that the Government cannot do much for the farmer.  Well, at least, if <Col N="1251" /> they did not do much for him they did quite a lot to him.  If they might now let him alone instead of pilling taxes on him and, indeed, on everybody else, there would be some respect for the farmer.  Having destroyed the foreign market for six years, the Government are now engaged in destroying the home market.  I suppose when that is destroyed we shall be told that the home market in this country is not of much use, and that the great and important market is the market beyond the water.  We shall be told that that is what the Government always preached, and we shall be told that it. was only the wicked Fine Gael Party insisted on decrying the foreign market.  But that was the market that the Fianna Fáil Party some years ago thanked God was gone, and gone for ever.  However, if the country thinks that is a policy that is worth spending £35,000,000 a year on, well and good. But the Government are gradually learning their lesson.</P>

      <P>It is interesting to hear Deputy O'Sullivan talking of the Fianna Fáil Party coming round to his point of view.  I would like Deputy O'Sullivan to give us part of his Party's election programme in 1932 so as to allow the House to realise what was their policy at that time, what they said of the things the Government had been doing and the things his Party have now sanctioned and are part of the Fine Gael programme.  The one thing the Deputy stressed was that I made a speech at the Agricultural Commission which might have been made by my predecessor.  Am I to be blamed for it if my predecessor made a sound and sensible speech?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan is clever enough to make the point but why did he not point out to me anything I said on that occasion that I <Col N="1252" /> was not prepared to say in the last seven years?  The Deputy said I had departed from what I had been saying here.  I do not know that I or anybody else said that the farmers were better off during the economic war than they were before.</P>
      <P>We had to make the best case we could, I admit, because we were up against a powerful enemy, and with the Party over there willing to help that powerful enemy.  In those circumstances we had, as I have said, to make the best case we could and show that the farmers were able to stick it out, and they did stick it out in spite of that powerful enemy, and in spite of the insidious propaganda of the Party opposite.  They held out to the end, and we can say, at any rate, that they did not take the advice of the people opposite and give in.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan spoke of the Pigs and Bacon Act.  That was one of the things that we agreed on, because, as a matter of fact, in 1934 the Pigs and Bacon Bill which came before this House was agreed to by all Parties. There was no division of Parties on it. It was sent to a Select Committee, and the Select Committee agreed on it, and when it came back to this House all Parties were in agreement on it.  But, because some defects have developed in that legislation, the Party opposite now washes its hands of the whole thing, and puts the blame on the Government for whatever went wrong. That is the kind of talk that we get from Deputy O'Sullivan and the Fine Gael Party.  At one period in his speech the Deputy was referring to his Party as the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, but I suppose the less said about that the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to leave that subject and to deal with what is before the House &mdash;the mounting Estimates, as they have been referred to by Deputy O'Sullivan.  How did they mount?  I think that when discussing a subject like this we should try to get down to the facts, and not be satisfied with generalities such as Deputy O'Sullivan indulged in.  The Deputy spoke about the big change-over to the Fine Gael side.  He said that we had changed <Col N="1253" /> over to that side.  He mentioned that Fianna Fáil took seven years to make up their minds on matters that they on that side would come to a decision on in a few months.  That was the kind of talk we had from the Deputy. But let us get down to the true position, and find out how we really stand in regard to these Estimates, and, if there is anything wrong, let us see what the remedy is.  We have heard a lot from the opposite side about the mounting Estimates.</P>
    <P>The Deputies opposite, instead of coming in here and indulging in generalities, would, I suggest, be better employed in making a comparison between the Estimates for 1931-32 and 1939-40.  If we do that we shall see where the increase in expenditure, so much spoken about on the opposite side, is taking place.  I find that practically all of it is taking place in what are largely classed as social services. The Abstract of Statistics for 1937 is available for all members of the House. I have examined it, and on page 134 I find the Estimates for 1931-32.  When I make a comparison between them and the present Estimates I can see there the reason why the Estimates have gone up.  By taking only two items&mdash; Old Age Pensions and Widows' and Orphans' Pensions&mdash;I find that the Estimates have gone up by £1,250,000 as compared with 1931-32, when the Fine Gael Party were in office.  That Party, according to themselves, could not afford to raise the old age pensions.  As a matter of fact, they were defeated on a vote in this House on the question and resigned office rather than increase the old age pensions.  They would not bring in a Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Bill because, according to them, the country could not afford it.</P>
    <P>This Government brought in such a Bill, so that on these two items alone we are spending £1,250,000 more than the Fine Gael Government spent in 1931-32.  We are doing that at a time when, according to Deputy O'Sullivan, we have gone over to the policy of Fine Gael.  Does the Deputy want us to go back to their policy of 1931 and cut down old age pensions and drop the Widows' and Orphans' Pension Act?  Not at all.  The Fine Gael <Col N="1254" /> Party would not think of going to the country and saying that they were prepared to drop these items.  In other words, they have become Fianna Fáil on that question and on many others, too, that I am going to mention.  Fine Gael have approved of the Fianna Fáil policy on many of these matters, and have never suggested that we should go back to the Fine Gael, or Cumann na nGaedheal, policy of 1931.  Yet, in spite of that we are told that we here have now gone over to the extent of 99 per cent. to the Fine Gael policy. Well, that is really too good a joke.</P>
    <P>Let me take another item.  On employment schemes we are spending £1,340,000 more than was spent by our predecessors in 1931-32.  We have been accused of not doing much for the relief of unemployment.  Well, at least we are raising this year, and intend to spend, ten times as much on employment schemes as Fine Gael did in 1931-32, and it only took us seven years to reach that figure, while it took Fine Gael 10 years to reach an expenditure under that head of £150,000.  The Estimates for unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance are £1,000,000 higher than they were in 1931-32.  As regards money spent on local government and public works&mdash;I mean money expended mainly on building work&mdash; the Estimate is up by £1,620,000, and in the case of agriculture, the Land Commission and export bounties, the Estimate is up by £2,000,000.</P>
    <P>Is there one single item that I have mentioned in respect of which the Fine Gael Party will say the expenditure should be reduced?  I am quite certain that they will not advocate any reduction in old-age pensions or in widows' and orphans' pensions, in the Employment Vote or in the amount spent on unemployment assistance.  Neither will they advocate a slowing down in our housing schemes, or in the expenditure on the improvement of estates, or on export bounties.  These items that I have taken tot up to £7,600,000.  That is where the increased expenditure comes in, compared with 1931-32.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>What about defence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that.  We have been accused of promising to reduce expenditure by £2,000,000.  We <Col N="1255" /> are doing that and giving it to defence. As I have shown, we have increased our expenditure by over £7,500,000.  I have given the House the items responsible for that increase.  Is it not obvious that, if we are spending £2,000,000 more on defence, that we are spending it from savings?  The Estimate for retired allowances and superannuation is down by £1,200,000, and that money is going towards defence. Instead of paying pensions to the R.I.C., as our predecessors did when in office, we are devoting that money to the building up of our own defence, and yet we are told that we are going over to the Fine Gael policy.  I think the position is that Fine Gael is coming over to us instead of we going over to them.</P>
      <P>If they were to come back to power, are they going to resume the payment of these R.I.C. pensions?  Not at all. Fine Gael have adopted the Fianna Fáil policy so far as that is concerned. I have shown that we are financing defence and, further, that every halfpenny of the increased expenditure referred to is accounted for in the items that I have read out to the House.  If Deputies will take the trouble of looking into the matter themselves they will find that this increased expenditure is going to social services&mdash;the division of land, improvement schemes, export bounties and the improvement of agriculture.  If there is increased expenditure on defence it has to come out of savings, one of which I have mentioned&mdash;the saving on superannuation and retired allowances.  I do not think that the Central Fund services have increased in any way as compared with 1931-32.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must now find out how this money is being raised.  Deputy O'Sullivan and others have told us that we are putting a great burden on to the people: that we are putting an impossible burden on industry, and that we are making it impossible for the poor man to live by taxing his essentials, foodstuffs and so on.  I would advise Deputies to look up these matters for themselves and see whether that is actually so or not&mdash;to see whether we are doing the things that we are accused of doing.  If we make a comparison <Col N="1256" /> between the last complete financial year, 1937-38, with 1931-32, it will be found, it is true, that there is an increase in the collection from customs duties, but when we come to examine the essentials that every man needs such as tea, sugar, clothes, boots and so on, what do we find?  That the amount collected in customs duties in 1937-38 was lower than it was in 1931-32. Taking tea and sugar together, we collected about £500,000 less than Fine Gael or Cumann na nGaedheal collected in 1931-32.</P>
    <P>On clothes we collect less, and on boots and shoes we collect less, so that we do not get our increased yield there from customs duties on such necessaries of life.  Any Deputy can get these figures by looking up the Abstract of Statistics for 1938 and turning up Page 147.  He will see there all that I am now telling him.  Where we did get that was from tobacco, and that yielded a large amount, £800,000. That was almost entirely due to the increased consumption of tobacco. People smoked more, and they are smoking more than in 1931-32.  If they are, it is a good sign.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Even the women, when they smoke, have to pay for it the same as the men.  On petrol we collected £730,000 and on imported beer £100,000. There is where we get our increased customs duties.  None of these could be regarded as an essential.  It is not essential to a poor man rearing a family to have tobacco, beer or petrol. In the case of the excise it is the same.  When we examine the yield we find we collected a little more from the excise, a little more from beer and entertainments, and a little more from home-produced sugar and tobacco.  In the matter of motor duties, estate duties and stamps we collected £1,000,000 more than in 1931-32.  Under miscellaneous headings we got £1,500,000, which is to a great extent made up from the land annuities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the land annuities here now.  We have, we are told, gone over to the Fine Gael policy.  I wonder would they now put up the leaflets they put up in 1931-32, stating that <Col N="1257" /> the land annuities must be collected and paid to England?  If we were to say anything like that we would be told we were going over to Fine Gael, but we have no intention of saying that.  The fact is that Fine Gael are coming to us.  They have now adopted the Fianna Fáil policy of keeping the land annuities here.  In income-tax corporation profits tax and excess profits tax we collected £1,000,000 more than in 1931-32.  Taking it all in all, we collected £5,700,000 more in 1937-38 than they collected in 1931-32, and we have done that without increasing taxes on anybody&mdash;at least on essentials, I should say.  We have taken over £5,500,000 in addition to what they collected in 1931-32 and we did that without hurting anybody.  We took less on tea, sugar, clothes, boots and shoes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say that Deputy Davin did it intentionally, but he quoted figures rather unfairly.  He compared the figure in 1932, 155, with November, 1938.  I will give you figures over the years.  The cost of living began to go down in 1929, when it was 176.  In 1930 it was 171 and the following year it was 160.  That was the last year of the Cumann na nGaedheal reign.  It went low in 1934 and 1935 and then it began to go up again, and it has gone up exactly as it went down. In 1936 it was 160, in 1937, 171 and in 1938, 173.  It has not gone up perhaps as steeply as it came down.  Deputy Childers spoke of imports being down, but, taking imports less exports, which indicates the balance of trade, there is no great difference between 1938 and 1931.  I say, therefore, that we cannot be attacked with any reason, or any logic, on the cost-of-living figure.  It has gone up, it is true. Naturally it has gone up as food prices have gone up.  It has gone up for the last two or three years, but not as steeply as it came down during the last three years of the Fine Gael Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard a lot about employment and unemployment Deputy <Col N="1258" /> O'Sullivan said he was warned not to place too much reliance on the unemployment figures.  I do not know whether you can or not.  Perhaps the Deputy is right: that you cannot put too much reliance on them.  But there is one case where we have correct figures, and where there is no possibility of any error being made.  That is as regards the number employed, according to the Insurance Acts, the National Health and the Unemployment Insurance Acts.  I think everybody will admit that there is no employer who is going to buy stamps in order to show that there was a large number employed in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>National insurance, certainly. The number of people whose cards were being stamped, and who were insured under the National Health Insurance Act in 1931, on 31st December, was 451,000; and the number on the 31st December, 1937, was 584,000.  It had gone up by 133,000 in these years, and it was a very big increase, an increase of 30 per cent. over those years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>How much of that was due to relief schemes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There would not be very much.  There were not more than 20,000 on relief schemes.  I believe there would be about that number.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, that would be the number of people.  With regard to unemployment insurance, on the 31st December, 1931, there were 314,000, and when we come to 31st December, 1937, we had 428,000 insured, which showed a very big increase in employment during those years.  In addition to these people being employed, according to the figures under the national health insurance and the unemployment insurance schemes, they would naturally be <Col N="1259" /> reckoned as additional consumers of goods, whether agricultural or industrial. We had also numbers of people in receipt of benefits under such things as the Old Age Pensions Act and the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, and so on.  In the case of the old age pensions and blind pensions there were 24,000 more in receipt of those pensions in 1937 than in 1932.  But that does not give a true picture of the position, because what really was the true picture was this, that there were 36,000 more in receipt of the full pension, that is 10/-, in 1937 than in 1932, and these people naturally were in a position to purchase goods, and they were not in such a position in 1932.</P>
      <P>Under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act we had 48,000 drawing benefit at the end of 1937.  I need hardly remind Fine Gael that many a time when they were in power they were asked when they intended to bring in a widows' and orphans' pensions scheme and they said the country could not afford it.  If Fine Gael are going to stick to the old Cumann na nGaedheal policy, as Deputy O'Sullivan tried to infer, I wonder would they be prepared to say they would drop this widows' and orphans' pensions scheme? Have they not become Fianna Fáil-minded? I have no doubt at all that they would not go back on that scheme if they were to take over the government of the country.  We had 60,000 drawing unemployment assistance, and there was a sum of £1,340,000 spent on employment schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely to goodness all these moneys spent by people drawing these benefits must have made a very considerable change in the consumption of goods in this country in 1937 as compared with 1933?  With regard to agriculture, one is given to understand in this House, listening to Deputies on the opposite side, that the position is much worse now than it was in 1931.  Let us take the official figures.  I know that Fine Gael Deputies will go on saying that the position is much worse while we contend that it is much better.  The problem is never going to be resolved by having Fine Gael Deputies saying one thing while we say another, but let us look at the figures published <Col N="1260" /> officially.</P>
    <P>The agricultural index price figure in 1931 was 110.  In 1937, which is the last year for which we have complete figures, it was 104.9.  The economic war was in full swing at that time.  It was settled in the middle of 1938.  If I were to be guided by Fine Gael speeches delivered during the economic war, I should add 40 per cent.  to these prices after the economic war was settled, but of course that was not a fact.  We cannot add 40 per cent. to these prices, unfortunately.  There was no great change after the economic war.  The farmers did not get much more than they had been getting during the economic war.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That shows that the Government had done a lot to compensate the farmer during the economic war for the losses he had incurred.  If he had not been compensated in that way, after the settlement of the economic war naturally prices would have jumped up to a much higher figure. In fact, as I have said already, we had to keep the export bounties scheme in operation in order to prevent prices going down.</P>

      <P>I am informed that the agricultural price index figure for the last three months, although it is not officially published yet, is 112.  I may be wrong, but that is the figure that I have been given by the people who will produce it eventually.  I am only giving it for what it is worth.  That proves that the price which the farmer is getting now is on the whole as good as he was getting in 1931.  We will say that it is as good, though I think it is somewhat better.</P>

      <P>What about overhead charges?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall give you that in a moment.  The rates payable by the <Col N="1261" /> agricultural community in 1936-37 were £460,000 more than in 1931-32.  As against that, they paid £2,000,000 less in land annuities.  Therefore, taking the annuities and the rates together, the farmers in the aggregate in the whole country are paying much less in overheads, as far as these charges are concerned, than they were paying in 1931-32.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be.  I did not want to be accused of saying that the farmers are well off, a statement attributed to me by Deputy O'Sullivan. What I want is to ascertain how exactly they stand at present and that was the object in setting up the Agricultural Commission.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister contend that there has been a reduction of £2,000,000 in the annuities since 1931-32?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a reduction of almost £2,200,000 in the annuities. The amount payable in rates has increased by £460,000 but taking these two items together, the farmers are paying much less now than they were in 1931-32.  In this same book of statistics for 1938, the figure given for costs of animal feeding stuffs, fertilisers, seeds, etc., for 1930 was 100, while the figure for 1937 was 99.2.  Therefore, in 1937 they paid a little less for feeding stuffs, fertilisers, seeds, etc.  They are getting at least as good a price as they were getting in 1931-32.  They are not paying any more for fertilisers or seeds while their overheads, as regards rates and annuities, have been reduced by over £1,500,000.</P>

      <P>I repeat that although they may not be well off at present they are in no worse position than they were when Cumann na nGaedheal were in office.  The bigger farmers are in no worse position; neither are the small farmers.  We brought in many schemes for their benefit such as providing grants for the erection of poultry houses, manure schemes, etc., all of which met with a very poor reception from Deputies opposite.  In fact, whenever I introduce a scheme which meets with a poor reception from Deputies opposite I say to myself: &ldquo;That means that it is good for the people.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I shall conclude with this point.  When I spoke to the Agricultural Commission I talked about the position of agriculture in this country. Deputy O'Sullivan has stated that my predocessor in office, the late Mr. Hogan, could have said just the same. I take that as a compliment.  Deputy O'Sullivan thinks I should not.  I take it as a compliment if I say anything about agriculture that the opposite Party would have been delighted to say because, then, I say the opposite Party must be getting sense.</P>

      <P>I did not want them to go into the history of the economic war.  I do not mind getting advice, but I did not want them to go back to ascertain the farmers' position in 1931-32, because if so, all the commission could do would be to tell us that the farmers' position is at least no worse to-day than it was then.  I set up the commission, not for the purpose of ascertaining whether the farmer is worse off than he was at that period&mdash;I believe he is better off&mdash;but to get the advice of the commission, firstly, as to how the farmers stand in regard to credit, and all these other problems they are examining, and, secondly, to get recommendations from the commission as to how the farmers' position may be improved. So far as we can improve that position, it will be improved.  It will be made at least much better than the position in 1931-32, when Fine Gael were in office.  I move to report progress.</P>
      <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again to-morrow.</P>
