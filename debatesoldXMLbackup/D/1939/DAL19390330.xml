    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he is aware of the unsatisfactory state of the law relating to the adoption of children; whether it has been brought to his notice that the corresponding legislation in Great Britain was repealed in 1926, and by the Adoption of Children Act of that year a more satisfactory and reasonable code was introduced; and whether he is prepared to introduce proposals for legislation along lines similar to those of the British Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he is aware that many prosecutions have recently been instituted against owners of tractors in West Cork for not having bands on their wheels when travelling on the public roads; and if he will issue an instruction that where such tractors are incidentally used for pulling threshing machines from one haggard to another or for taking a plough from one part of tillage to another, for a short distance on the public road, he will advise that no prosecution should be instituted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that a number of prosecutions have been instituted.  Regulations 29 and 34 of <Col N="330" /> the Mechanically Propelled Vehicles (Construction, Equipment and Use) Order, 1934, which was made by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health under the Road Traffic Act, 1933, prescribe the types of tyres which must be used on tractors when they are being driven on public roads.  These regulations allow certain exemptions in favour of land tractors.  It would not be proper for me to give instructions of the type suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonnONeill" hpid="Mr. O'Neill Mr. O'Neill">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not ask the Minister to have the law defined in any way but I would ask the Minister, having regard to the conditions under which some of these poor people work, to have certain exemptions allowed. I would not say exemptions, but a nod is as good as a wink to a tractor-owner as it is to a horse, in certain circumstances.  The general tendency is to have tractors fitted with pneumatic tyres and all new tractors going on the land have those tyres but there are some old tractors, bought by some of the poorer farmers, and all I would ask the Minister is that, while no positive instructions should be given to the Guards, a little leniency might be exercised.  I would ask him to do that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he is aware that a serving soldier with continuous service since 1922, who has been awarded <Col N="331" /> a military service pension under the Act of 1924, is debarred from receiving such pension while on active service; that a soldier to whom a pension becomes payable under the Act of 1924 on his discharge is entitled, if he reattests, to be paid the military pension while serving; and, if so, whether he is prepared to take the necessary steps to make similar provision for men with continuous service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the facts are as stated by the Deputy.  I do not propose to take any steps to make similar provision for men with continuous service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, does he consider that two soldiers serving in the one rank and under similar conditions should be treated in this anomalous manner for the purpose of military service pension? Does he not think it equitable that the law should be revised so as to enable both of them to enjoy the same pensions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is a reasonable thing to have serving soldiers drawing military service pensions. There were only a few of these cases where men left the Army and then came back, and I do not see why we should extend the practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>But is it not a fact that if two persons joined the Army in 1922, for instance, and served together until 1930, the one who served continuously until 1939 gets no pension while the other who left in 1930 and reattested in 1931, continues to enjoy a pension from 1931 to 1938?  That is obviously an anomaly and discrimination against one type of soldier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Because a few people got back by mistake, under those circumstances, is no reason why we should extend the mistake to all.  The fact is that those who did resign and who have rejoined are not entitled to the same length of retired pay as the men having continuous service.</P>

Níor deineadh aon staonadh sa troid atá ar siubhal againn in aghaidh galaracha máithreachais agus aicídeacha an aosa óig.</P>

Tá béilí bidh le fáil in aisce in a lán de na scoileanna agus bainne freisin.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhí an Bhóta so os cóir na Dála anuraidh labhair mé i dtaobh an Acht Bainne agus Déirithe.  Tháinig an tAcht so i bhfeidhm i mbliana agus tá mé cinnte gur fearr agus gur folláine an bainne atá le ceannach ag an bpobal anois de thairbhe an Achta so acht 'na thaobh san is uile is cosamhail go mbeidh sé tamall sara dtuigfear i gceart cadiad buntáistí na reachtaíochta so.</P>
    <P>Maidir le ceist na heitinne is taithneamhach liom a rádh go dtáinig tuitim ar réim an ghalair seo i rith na bliana.  Tá scéimeanna leighis ar bun i ngach áird den tír agus, i gcomparáid le tíorthaibh eile, is mór atá an galar tar éis dul i laighead in Éirinn.</P>
    <P>I rith na bliana do críochnuíodh trí óisbidéil chonndae agus óisbidéal amháin fiabhrais: sin trí óisbidéil is fiche do críochnuíodh ó tosnuíodh ar an obair.  Deisíodh agus méaduíodh cuid mhór eile, agus díoladh a lán deontaisí i leith an mhéid airgid a cailleadh ins na h-óisbidéil i rith na bliana.  Tá socruithe againn óisbidéil áirithe i mBaile Átha Cliath a chur le chéile agus a mhéadú agus tá súil agam go mbeidh bille agam 'na thaobh so os cóir an Oireachtas sa tSamhradh.</P>
    <P>Mar adubhairt mé cheana, is le cúrsaí tithe bhaineann dhá dtrian d'airgead an Bhóta so.  Nuair a réitíodh an staile a bhí ann anuraidh, cromadh arís ar an obair go fuinneamhail agus is cosamhail go dtóg-faidh na húdaráis áitiúla beagnach seacht míle teach i mbliana.  D'iarr an Bárdas orm fiosrúchán fé leith a chur ar bun i mBaile Átha Cliath i dtaobh cúrsaí tithe sa chathair agus beifear ag pléidhe na ceiste seo gan mhoill. I rith na bliana thugamar céim mhór eile ar aghaidh maidir le cúrsaí tithe ar fuid na tíre.  Críochnuíodh tuairm cúig is fiche míle teach&mdash;deich míle acu i mbailte&mdash;agus, maidir le haththógáil agus deisiúchán tithe, tugadh <Col N="336" /> deontaisí i leith beagnach fiche míle teach go deireadh na bliana.</P>

    <P>Maidir le cothabháil na mbóithre, chuir na húdarais áitiúla beagán níos mó airgid ar leath-taoibh 'na chóir i mbliana ná mar chuir siad anuraidh agus caitheadh níos mó ná leathmhilleon púnt as ciste an Bhóta Dhíomhaointis ar oibreacha bóthar.  Is cosamhail dá bhrí sin gur mór an feabhas atá ag teacht ar bhóithre na tíre ó bhliain go bliain.</P>
    <P>I rith na gceithre mblian a ghaibh tharainn bhí biseach ag teacht i gcomhnuidhe ar bhailiú na rátaí agus tá súil agam gur mar seo a bhéas an scéal feasta.</P>
    <P>Tháinig feabhas freisin ar bhailiú na mblianacht talmhan agus thainig laigheadú ar iasachtaí gearr-théarma na n-údarás n-áitiúil.</P>
    <P>Is breagh liom a rádh gur beag rud dá bhfuil fé n-ár gcúram a chuaidh ar gcúl i rith na bliana le n-a mbaineann mo chunntas.</P>
    <P>The Estimate makes provision for a net expenditure of £1,349,834.  Grants for housing amount to £852,919, and for health services to £340,350, making a total sum of £1,193,269 for the social services included in this Vote.  The public health services are being gradually developed each year.  There has also been a considerable increase in public health activity throughout the country.  A higher standard of public sanitation has been secured by an extension of the environmental services, such as water supplies, sewerage systems and disposal of house refuse.</P>
    <P>In considering the progress achieved by the various remedial measures it is wise to take as a criterion their effect on the incidence of infectious diseases <Col N="337" /> and on the general death rate.  A considerable period may elapse after the adoption of public health measures before their effect is reflected in the vital statistics because some other factor may arise to neutralize or conceal the actual progress attained.  A particular instance of this kind is the large number of deaths attributable to influenza in the year 1937.  The number recorded was 2,772, as compared with 683 in the year 1936, and an average of 1,248 for the decennial period 1927 to 1936.</P>
    <P>In the year 1938 the total mortality from the principal infectious diseases was 1,241, including 667 deaths from influenza.  If the deaths from influenza for the past four years are excluded, the mortality due to the principal infectious diseases shows a steady decrease from 941 in the year 1935 to 574 in the year 1938, which is approximately one-half of the number of deaths from such diseases in 1922.  The vital statistics for the year 1938 are at present only provisional and may be subject to slight modifications, but they indicate a definite advance in the control of infectious diseases.  The number of deaths from these diseases, excluding influenza, provisionally recorded for the year 1938, viz., 574, will very likely mark the lowest mortality record yet attained for these diseases.</P>
    <P>An outstanding feature of the statistics for the year 1938 is the absence of any death from, or notification of typhus fever.  This is the first year in which this has occurred since registration of deaths and compulsory notification of infectious diseases came into operation.  The deaths attributed to typhoid fever in 1938 were 47, the lowest number of deaths attributed to the disesase in any year.  The number of cases of typhoid notified in 1938 was 254, as compared with 413 in 1937, and is the lowest number of recorded cases since the notification system was efficiently enforced.  As the incidence of this disease is to some extent an index of the standard of sanitary services in a country, the decline in mortality in 1938 is significant of the advance which has been made in public health administration. <Col N="338" /> For the decennial periods 1911 to 1920 and 1921 to 1930 deaths from typhoid averaged 195 and 108, respectively.</P>
    <P>The number of deaths from diphtheria in 1938 was 308, being 15 in excess of the number in the year 1937.  The number of notifications also increased from 2,511 in 1937 to 2,983 in 1938, but almost a third of that number is accounted for by an epidemic of the disease in Dublin City.  The average mortality from the disease for the preceding five years, 1932-36, was 373.  The total number of deaths from scarlet fever in 1938 was 80, as against 128 in the year 1937 and 173 in the year 1936.</P>
    <P>The number of deaths from cancer in 1938 was 3,532.  The disease continues to exact a very heavy toll on human life.  The Provisional Cancer Council which was set up last year will investigate and report on such aspects of the problem as the council thinks fit and submit proposals for the provision of a radio therapeutic institution for the modern treatment of cancer. The expenses of the council will be met out of the Hospitals Trust Fund.</P>
    <P>Much attention has been directed in recent years to safeguarding the health of expectant mothers and removing as far as possible the preventible dangers attendant on childbearing. The mortality rate from puerperal sepsis which is the chief factor affecting the maternal mortality averaged 1.49 per 1,000 births for the period 1927 to 1936.  In 1937 the rate of mortality fell to 0.9 per 1,000 births, and for the year 1938 a further decline to 0.7 per 1,000 births has been provisionally recorded.  It is significant that while the aggregate urban death rate from all puerperal conditions including puerperal sepsis decreased from 4.2 per 1,000 births in 1932 to 2.6 in 1937, being a reduction of 39 per centum, the aggregate rural death rate only decreased from 4.76 per 1,000 births in 1932 to 4.26 in 1937, or a reduction of 10 per centum.</P>
    <P>Special attention is given by school medical officers to the disease of the eye known as trachoma.  It is a disease generally associated with poverty <Col N="339" /> and unhygienic conditions of living. Recently it was stated that trachoma is assuming alarming proportions in this country.  The investigations made by the county medical officers of health do not support any such allegation. Of the school children medically examined in the four county boroughs during the past three years, about one per 1,000 was affected with the disease. In the rest of the country the disease is rare amongst school children, the incidence being on the average one per 25,000 in 1938.</P>
    <P>There was a reduction in the number of infant deaths in 1938 as compared with the years 1937 and 1936.  The total number of deaths was 3,757, a rate of 66 per 1,000 births, and the corresponding totals in 1937 and 1936 were 4,121 and 4,309, representing rates of 73 and 74 per 1,000 births, respectively.  The infant mortality rate for 1938 is still above the rates for the years 1933 and 1934, when the infant death rates were 65 and 63 per 1,000 births, respectively.  The latter rate, however, was the lowest hitherto recorded in this country.</P>
    <P>There are as yet no reliable figures as to the distribution of infant mortality in respect of 1938, but in 1937 the rate for all urban areas was 91.5 per 1,000 births as compared with 98.6 in 1936, and in rural areas 60.7 as compared with 58.9 in 1936.</P>
    <P>In the County Boroughs of Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford the recorded infant mortality rates per 1,000 births in 1937 were, respectively, 102, 103, 68 and 97.  The main causes of infant deaths in the county boroughs were diarrhoea and enteritis, pneumonia and premature birth.  With the development of maternity and child welfare schemes, it is hoped that it will be possible to reduce avoidable infant mortality to a great extent in these areas.  In the counties the highest mortality rates per 1,000 births in 1937 were in Dublin (109); Wexford (89); Kilkenny (85); and Carlow (84). The lowest mortality rates were in Leitrim (46); Mayo (46); Clare (49); Offaly (49); and Cavan (50).</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="340" /> The number of deaths from measles in the year 1938 was 99 as compared with 126 in the previous year.  As measles is not a notifiable disease, it is only possible to adjudge as to its incidence by the mortality attributable to it.  This further decline in mortality is encouraging.  The average number of deaths for the decade 1911-20 was 383, and for the decade 1921-30, 253, whilst the seven years 1931-37 give an average of 210.</P>
    <P>Maternity and child welfare schemes are being carried out in the four county boroughs, in 20 urban districts and five county health districts.  In addition 115 voluntary associations are engaged upon this work throughout the country.  In Dublin City there has been a very large expansion in the maternity and child welfare services.  Several pre- and post-natal clinics have been established and valuable assistance and advice are being given to mothers and children. In the report for the year 1937 the medical officer states as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Pre-natal work has progressed to an extraordinary extent in the city.  Ten years ago the pre-natal departments of the maternity hospitals were poorly developed and very poorly attended.  There has been a sustained improvement over the last few years and for 1937 it has been found necessary to specially enlarge these departments and extra medical assistance will soon be necessary.  At these departments 6,706 expectant mothers, all new cases, were seen, which represents 60 per cent. of the city birth rate.  In the year 1927 only 850 mothers so attended.  Unquestionably this increase has been largely due to propaganda and advice given under the city maternity and child welfare scheme by both health visitors and the medical officers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Each successive year shows progress and expansion in school medical inspection schemes.  The system of inspection carried out in the schools has the approval of school managers, teachers and the parents of the children.  It offers great scope for the <Col N="341" /> detection and treatment of disease in its early stages.  Already there is evidence of improvement in the general health and physique of the children who have received advice or treatment, and of greater attention on the part of parents to the personal hygiene and the physical health of their children.  The total number of children examined in the year 1937 was 124,256.  The following defects were ascertained: dental defects, 54,118; number of children treated, 37,952; tonsils and adenoids and affections of nose and throat, 27,821; number of children treated, 7,199; defective vision, 16,200; number of children treated, 11,871; other eye defects, 5,460; number of children treated, 527.</P>
    <P>School meals are provided in four county boroughs, 41 urban districts and seven towns under town commissioners. The meals are provided in 227 national schools.  For the year ended 31st March, 1938, the average daily number of children in receipt of meals was approximately 28,000.  The total number of meals provided was approximately 4,830,000.</P>
    <P>School meals are also provided in rural areas of the Gaeltacht by the Board of Health for West Cork and by the Boards of Health for the Counties of Galway, Donegal, Kerry and Mayo.  The total number of meals provided in the financial year ended 31st March, 1938, was approximately 2,800,000.  In the majority of districts the school meal consists of milk or cocoa with buns or bread and butter or jam.  Local authorities have been advised from time to time to make tuberculin tested or high-grade milk as far as it is available at a reasonable price the basis of the school meal.  The importance of milk as an article of food cannot be too strongly stressed.  For young children especially it is an essential part of diet.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for the supply of free milk, for which a sum of £90,000 is provided in this Estimate, were continued during the year in urban and rural areas with the exception of two urban districts in which the councils again declined to co-operate on the <Col N="342" /> grounds that the amount allocated for their districts was inadequate.  The conditions governing issues from the grant were the same as in previous years.  The allowances of milk are limited to children under five years whose parents and guardians are in receipt of assistance or are unable to provide from their own resources an adequate supply of milk for children under this age.  The general supervision of these schemes is entrusted to the chief medical officers.  The local veterinary inspectors inspect the premises of suppliers of milk to ensure that the methods of production are satisfactory.  Tests as to the purity and quality of the milk supplied are made from time to time.</P>
    <P>The Milk and Dairies Acts and Regulations thereunder form a comprehensive code for securing effective administrative control by local authorities of the supply of milk for human consumption in their areas.  Any person who intends to supply milk for public consumption must be registered.  A number of persons accustomed to sell milk were refused registration on the ground that their cowsheds did not conform to the requisite standard for the clean production of milk.  The reduction in the number of registered dairymen affected to some extent the supply of milk under the Free Milk scheme.  In some cases, too, increased prices were charged for the milk supplied on the ground that the carrying out of structural alterations to cowsheds before registration could be secured involved increased costs in production.</P>
    <P>There was a scarcity of suppliers of milk in the rural areas of Donegal, Kerry and Limerick and, to a lesser extent, in the counties of Galway, Mayo and South Cork.  In certain areas the experiment of issuing supplies of dried milk powder was resorted to as a temporary measure so as to obviate as far as possible any hardship on the children eligible for a supply of free milk.  Before such action was taken an analysis of the powder was made and it showed that the powder when reconstituted as milk contained as high a percentage of milk fats as is <Col N="343" /> laid down in the regulations for new milk.</P>
    <P>In some areas the sale of milk by unregistered dairymen has been continued in defiance of the law without appropriate action being taken by the sanitary authorities, and in such cases it became necessary to draw special attention to the necessity of securing full compliance with the provisions of the Milk and Dairies Act.  Generally speaking, however, the Act and Regulations thereunder are being more widely complied with, due in a large measure to the enterprise and efforts of the medical and veterinary staffs of the local bodies.  During the past year 1,119 orders refusing registration under the Act were made by sanitary authorities.  Formal appeals against these orders were received in 35 cases. In every case the appeal was disallowed after investigation of the circumstances.</P>
    <P>There are now in operation those parts of the Act governing the designations which may be used in connection with the sale of milk.  Special designations are, highest grade milk, standard milk and pasteurised milk. The general designations prescribed are, milk, new milk and fresh milk. No licence is required in respect of the use of a general designation in connection with the sale of milk.  The use of any descriptive words or signs other than those coming within a special or general designation which indicate or are intended to indicate that the milk is of a particular quality, or prepared in a particular manner, or suitable for a particular purpose, is prohibited. So far 99 applications for special designation licences have been received under the following categories:&mdash; Highest grade milk, 45; standard milk, 32; pasteurised milk, 22.  There have been 12 applications withdrawn and the total number to be considered is therefore 87.</P>
    <P>Under the Milk and Dairies (Special Designations) Regulations, 1938, the minimum milk-fat content for any sample of highest grade milk and standard milk had been fixed at 3.5 per cent.  Representations were made in <Col N="344" /> this matter by representatives of the milk trade that the percentage of milk-fats was too high.  After due consideration it was decided to modify the milk-fat standard, and amending regulations entitled the Milk and Dairies (Special Designations) (Amendment) Regulations, 1939, have been made.  The new standard fixed is a minimum of 3.1 per cent of milk fat for any sample of highest grade and standard milk and an average content of milk fat of at least 3.25 per cent. for all samples taken from the supplies of the same dairyman over any continuous period of six months.</P>
    <P>Schemes for the treatment of tuberculosis are in operation in each county and county borough.  The slight increase in mortality from tuberculosis reported in 1937 has been followed in 1938 by a definite decrease to 2,464 deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis as compared with 2,854 in 1937, and 686 deaths from non-pulmonary tuberculosis as compared with 785 in 1937. The figures for 1938 represent a rate of 0.8 per 1,000 of the population in respect of pulmonary tuberculosis, and 0.2 in respect of non-pulmonary tuberculosis, making a total of 1.00 per 1,000 of the population for all forms of tuberculosis, which is the lowest rate recorded in this country.</P>
    <P>The progressive development of institutional treatment of all types of tuberculosis on modern lines is proceeding throughout the country.  On a previous occasion there was some adverse criticism of the form of treatment which I do not think was fully justified.  Under a typical tuberculosis scheme treatment may be obtained in an institution or at a dispensary or in the patient's own home. There is usually a central dispensary and a number of branch dispensaries selected as far as possible with reference to the centres of population in the various areas and to the means of transport from outlying districts. In these dispensaries patients are examined on fixed days by tuberculosis officers, assisted by trained nurses.</P>
    <P>Medical officers of dispensary districts are encouraged to send patients whom they suspect to be suffering from <Col N="345" /> tuberculosis for examination at the central or branch tuberculosis dispensaries and any doctor sending a patient for examination may attend for a personal consultation with the tuberculosis officer if he so desires.  Specially trained nurses visit patients in their own homes, including patients who are able to attend dispensaries.  Sputum examination may be carried out locally or by specialists in the laboratories of the medical schools.  X-ray facilities are available locally in many areas, and where they are not available patients may be sent to the nearest hospital possessing the necessary apparatus for x-ray examination.  Sufferers from pulmonary tuberculosis who can benefit from active treatment of the disease by modern methods are sent to sanatoria. For the non-pulmonary forms of tuberculosis, treatment is available in the various county hospitals and in public hospitals in the larger centres of population. The special needs of child sufferers from surgical tuberculosis are catered for in four open-air hospitals. The reduction in the tuberculosis death rate in this country over the past 20 years compares favourably with the decline in mortality in other countries. In the year 1904 the death rate from all forms of tuberculosis was 2.77 per 1,000 of the population, and in 1908, the date of the passing of the Tuberculosis Prevention (Ireland) Act, the death rate was 2.5 per 1,000 of the population. The corresponding rates in 1936, 1937 and 1938 were 1.17, 1.23 and 1.00.</P>
    <P>A sum of approximately £350,000 is being spent on new public health works in the present financial year, apart from the new scheme of water supply for Dublin, on which work is proceeding.  The total number of hospitals provided by boards of public assistance to date is 21, viz., five county hospitals, 11 district hospitals, five fever hospitals.  Two nurses' homes have also been provided.  Improvements have also been carried out at seven other institutions.  The erection of eight county hospitals is proceeding.  They are being erected at Cashel, Ennis, Mallow, Kilkenny, Portlaoighise, Tullamore, Roscommon, and Sligo.  The buildings at Cashel, Ennis and Mallow are almost completed, <Col N="346" /> while that at Portlaoighise is well advanced.  There are also in course of erection district hospitals at Gorey, Killarney, Listowel, New Ross and Schull, and two fever hospitals at Killarney and New Ross.  The expenditure from Hospitals Trust funds on the provision of county, district and fever hospitals up to 31st December, 1936, was £1,142,164.</P>
    <P>Works for the improvement of accommodation in mental hospitals have been completed at five institutions. Improvements at seven institutions are in progress.  The expenditure out of Hospitals Trust funds on mental hospitals up to 31st December, 1938, amounted to £788,597.  On the provision of new sanatoria, public health clinics, the expenditure to 31st December last amounted to £198,825.  The total grants made within the same period to nursing associations amounted to £56,020, to the Library Council £6,104, to the Medical Research Council £10,000, and to the Provisional Cancer Council £500.</P>
    <P>Applications were made to the Hospitals Commission on behalf of 42 voluntary hospitals for grants towards meeting expenditure in excess of income for the year 1937, and on the recommendation of the commission payments amounting to £106,541 were made to these hospitals.  The commission pointed out in their general report for the year 1937 that voluntary hospitals are becoming every year more dependent on the proceeds of sweepstakes and that the payment of the annual maintenance deficits has had a decided effect on hospital methods of controlling expenditure.</P>
    <P>In 1934, when hospital deficits amounted to £65,000, it was estimated that £2,000,000 would be sufficient to set aside for endowment.  Since that year the total deficits of the voluntary hospitals have gradually increased to £106,541 in 1937, and the amount set aside for endowment has had to be advanced to £3,000,000.  The additional provision necessary for endowment involves a corresponding decrease in the amount available for the erection of new voluntary hospitals and the extension <Col N="347" /> and improvement of existing voluntary hospitals.</P>
    <P>Unless it is possible to control the expenditure or increase income so as to keep the annual deficits of voluntary hospitals within a reasonable limit new projects will be seriously affected. There is £8,000,000 available from Sweepstake funds but, as I have indicated, £3,000,000 must be earmarked for endowment.  Any provision for endowment above that amount would affect the building programme to be undertaken within the next couple of years, and I trust that the occasion for any further such provision will not arise.  It will be readily agreed that it would be unwise to enter into any large commitments until they are adequately covered by funds in hand.</P>
    <P>The future hospital requirements for Dublin City are to be met by an enlargement or replacement of three of the existing principal hospitals and by the erection of a new hospital to replace Sir Patrick Dun's, Mercer's and the City of Dublin Hospitals.  The three existing hospitals to be enlarged or replaced by new hospitals are the Mater Misericordiae, St. Vincent's and the Richmond, Whitworth and Hardwicke Hospitals.  The arrangements for the amalgamation of Sir Patrick Dun's, Mercer's and the City of Dublin Hospitals are well advanced. Proposals which will be necessary to give effect to the arrangements have been discussed with the representatives of the controlling authorities of these hospitals and a Bill will be introduced in the early summer, I hope.</P>
    <P>The provision of additional bed accommodation and other improvements to be undertaken at the Mater Hospital and the building of a new hospital at Elm Park in place of the present St. Vincent's Hospital are at present being considered by the respective governing bodies of those hospitals.  In regard to the Richmond, Whitworth and Hardwicke Hospitals, I understand that the board of governors as an alternative to carry ing out extensions at the present site <Col N="348" /> are considering the erection of a new hospital on the outskirts of the city. I hope to have an opportunity of discussing with them their final plans at an early date.</P>
    <P>In addition to the provision of adequate facilities for medical and surgical treatment, there is an urgent need for the provision of a chest hospital, an extension of orthopaedic facilities and psychiatry clinic for research into mental disease.  It was schemes of this nature that I had in mind when I adverted to the possible postponement of some works owing to the increased demands on the funds to meet hospital deficits.</P>
    <P>The Medical Research Council received 29 applications for grants for work on medical research.  Eighteen awards were made.  Six of the grant holders are occupied full time in connection with research, one of whom is undergoing training in juvenile rheumatism to be followed by a six months' survey of the disease as it occurs in Dublin and district.</P>
    <P>The hospital library scheme which was put into operation in 1937 under the general control of the Hospital Library Council now extends to 57 hospitals with over 4,400 beds.  Under the scheme 11,678 books were supplied for the use of patients.  The council have rendered valuable assistance in the work of administering the service within the hospitals by advising on the provision of suitable accommodation and equipment and giving instruction in the method of issue of books to patients.</P>
    <P>The provision in sub-head S for payments to local authorities in respect of housing schemes under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932, and grants to private persons and public utility societies for the erection of new, and the reconstruction of existing, houses amounts to £826,590.  The number of houses built by local authorities in the present financial year is likely to reach 6,600, which is the largest number of houses erected by these bodies since the 1932 Act was passed.  During the year 1937 there were strikes in the building trade <Col N="349" /> in Dublin and Cork and the total number of houses built by local authorities in the financial year ended 31st March, 1938, fell to 4,890.  During the financial year ended 31st March, 1937, the total number of houses built by local authorities was 6,094.  In the previous year the number was 6,245. Of the 6,600 houses estimated to be completed between 1st April, 1938, and the 31st March, 1939, there were 3,750 houses built by urban authorities and 2,850 by rural authorities.</P>
    <P>In Dublin County Borough the total number of dwellings completed during the year is likely to reach 2,300, which would be a record number of houses provided by the Corporation of Dublin in any year.  The number of dwellings at present in progress in Dublin is almost 2,000.  In response to a request made to me by the Corporation of Dublin for an inquiry into housing shortage in the State with particular reference to the position in Dublin, I have directed an official investigation to be made into all aspects of the housing question in Dublin.  The investigations will be begun at an early date.</P>
    <P>Last month in introducing a Housing (Amendment) Bill I gave statistics of the number of new houses completed by private persons and public utility societies, and of houses reconstructed with the aid of grants.  The number of new houses was 25,835 of which 10,383 houses were erected in urban areas and 15,452 houses in rural areas.  The total number of houses reconstructed by farmers and agricultural labourers was 19,946.  The amount paid in grants up to 1st March, 1939, was approximately £2,500,000.</P>
    <P>In the rural areas the largest numbers of houses were built in the Counties of Mayo (2,361); Kerry (1,842); Dublin (1,748); Cork (1,727); Galway (1,304); Monaghan (751); Roscommon (744); Sligo (635); Limerick (623); and Clare (584).  The largest numbers of houses reconstructed were in the Counties of Cork, Mayo, Galway, Louth, Longford, Kerry, Rescommon and Monaghan.</P>
    <P>The Housing and Labourers Act, 1937 made provision for State assistance <Col N="350" /> towards the reconstruction of houses in urban areas.  The regulations under that Act governing the payment of grants were circulated to the urban authorities in October last and they were requested to make a careful survey of all houses in their area that are defective in sanitary accommodation, and if such houses can be repaired at reasonable expense and made suitable as working-class dwellings, to take stops to serve notices on the owners thereof under Section 19 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1931.  The survey of insanitary dwellings which urban authorities were asked to make would form part of a general survey which they had been requested to undertake earlier in the year with the object of ascertaining definitely the extent of the housing problem in each area and the number of new houses required to eradicate slum dwellings.</P>
    <P>Only one-half of the urban authorities has yet completed the necessary returns in respect of the general survey.  With the limited information at the disposal of the Department no comparison can be yet made with the surveys of requirements made in the year 1929.  It is again being impressed upon urban authorities to complete the survey of insanitary dwellings for the purposes of the 1937 Act and to institute the necessary proceedings for the reconditioning of dwellings which are structurally sound but otherwise unfit for human habitation.  Already these authorities are bound under the Act of 1931 to compel owners to put houses suitable for the working classes into a proper state of repair.  The Act of 1937 provided a grant up to a quarter of the cost or £40 and enabled local authorities to operate the Act of 1931 with the least hardship to the owners.</P>
    <P>Grants will only be made in respect of houses which can be converted into suitable family dwellings and in respect of houses situate outside places that will require to be cleared under the provisions of the Act of 1931.  Normally no grant will be allocated in respect of any such house unless the separate dwellings are self-contained. In such cases, however, the <Col N="351" /> entrance door to the separate dwelling may lead off a staircase, landing or passage used for access to other dwellings.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that if houses which are structurally sound can be reconditioned at reasonable expense to conform with modern standards of comfort and sanitation, a good deal could be done to remedy bad housing conditions in urban areas and thereby help towards a solution of the slum problem.  The preservation of existing dwellings which are capable of reconstruction should also reduce the need for new houses and to some extent lessen the charges on ratepayers.</P>
    <P>There has been a new sub-head introduced in connection with the Seeds and Fertilisers Supply Act, 1933. Under that Act the Government undertook liability for one-half of any loss incurred by county councils in 1933 on seeds and fertilisers supply schemes. The maximum liability was limited to £25,000 apportioned between county councils.  Sixteen county councils adopted schemes at a cost of £13,466. It is anticipated that claims for recoupment will be received from 12 counties and that in the aggregate these claims will not exceed £600. Except in Kerry County the loss did not in any county exceed £63.  In Kerry it is expected the loss will be about £200.</P>
    <P>The net provision made by county councils for road maintenance in the coming financial year amounts to £1,274,257, which is slightly in excess of the net provision made in the present year.  The provision for main roads shows a decrease of approximately £12,000 and an increase of £25,170 for county roads.  During the present financial year grants were made from the Employment Schemes Vote for road works in urban and rural areas.  A sum of £243,324 was allocated to urban authorities and £390,970 to county councils.  At the middle of last month employment on a rotational basis was afforded to 16,000 men on these works.</P>
    <P>During the past four years there has <Col N="352" /> been a gradual improvement in the collection of the rates in counties.  In the present financial year the collection will show a further improvement.</P>
    <P>Upon the clearance in February last of the Land Purchase Guarantee Fund to which local taxation grants are hypothecated, there was a net issue to the local taxation account of £63,368 over and above the amount of the grants paid to the fund during the year, owing to the amount of arrears of annuities recovered during the year being in excess of the net amount of new arrears that accrued in the same period.  Fourteen councils received £85,760 in addition to their full grants, whilst in the remaining 13 counties the aggregate amount absorbed in the fund was £22,392.</P>
    <P>There has been a steady and substantial reduction of temporary borrowing by county councils for revenue purposes, and with two or three exceptions their financial position is very satisfactory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In introducing this Estimate, the Minister, very properly from his own point of view, left to the last information with regard to the rates.  That, in my opinion, was the most important matter he dealt with, and we ought to have been told of it in detail.  The Minister did not tell us anything about the position in which the ratepayers find themselves with regard to the increasing burdens which are being placed upon them.  He did not tell us how he thinks they are going to carry these burdens or attempt to carry them.  This year, 1939, in comparison with 1932, there is an all-round increase of 34 per cent. in the rate burden which the people have to carry.  In the Minister's Estimate, we do not find any encouragement as to a reduction of the total cost of local government or an easing of the burden so far as the central authority is concerned.  As a matter of fact, there seems to be a tendency to extend the local government machine.  Last year and other years, in speaking on this Estimate.  I expressed doubts that the local government machine which we have is <Col N="353" /> the most suitable one we could have in this country.  The Local Government Department stretches its tentacles over the people in a way in which no other Government Department does.  It is a very important Department, and it has to take cognisance not only of the medical and other needs of the people but of their ability to pay for and maintain the public services.  We find that the machine is going to cost us more this year than last year.  Year after year, there is an increasing demand upon the country for the maintenance of the Local Government Department itself. This year, salaries, wages and allowances are increased by £7,772.  They have been increasing gradually since 1931.  The figures of Departmental costs for 1931, as compared with these figures, constitute a terrible revelation. They are increased by three to one.  Of course, there are certain reasons for that, housing, for instance.  But, outside that altogether, there seems to be no limit to the increases being placed upon the public to maintain the Department of Local Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is satisfactory to hear from the Minister that the rate of mortality from notifiable diseases has decreased. That is a tribute to the system of county medical officership which was established here.  It is also very satisfactory to learn that the number of deaths from pulmonary tuberculosis has decreased.  I do not think that the Minister is entitled to say&mdash;if his information is correct he would, of course, be entitled to say it, but his information is not correct&mdash;that non-pulmonary cases are specially provided for in the county hospitals all over the country.  That is not my experience. Our experience is that there is not accommodation even for pulmonary cases.  We put up a scheme for reconstruction of the County Home and Hospital at Roscommon last May in order that we might be able to deal in some way with this matter, but we have not got sanction for the scheme yet, nor has any reason been given for failure to issue sanction.  We had reports from inspector after inspector at the board of health in Roscommon telling us that our building was not in a condition to receive patients. <Col N="354" /> Some ceilings were falling and various repairs were required.  We were advised to put up a scheme to alter the whole position.  We did that last May.  We engaged the services of an architect and we sent forward our plans in May, 1938.  We have not yet had a reply from the Department. Since then we have been having reports from inspectors complaining of the non-segregation of patients and of the inadequate provision made for patients.  Still, the Department has not moved.  Recently I raised the matter by way of question, and the answer I got from the Parliamentary Secretary was that they did not know how many patients for the new hospital were going to be taken out of the old one and, consequently, could not deal with the matter.  In my opinion, that reply was thought of on the spur of the moment for want of a better reply.  The alteration we wanted in connection with the hospital was for patients who would not, in any circumstances, be transferred to the new county hospital.  When the Minister comes into the House and tells us that special arrangements are made for tuberculosis cases, I must tell him the circumstances in Roscommon.</P>
    <P>On the question of hospitalisation generally, the Minister told us that 24 hospitals were built.  I wonder does that number include the two hospitals in Boyle, County Roscommon?  Some time ago, I put down a question with regard to Boyle hospital and the Minister gave me an answer that the scheme was now passed.  I found later that the story was being circulated in other places that the Boyle hospitals were being built and some enterprising gentleman in America who had an interest in Boyle wrote for a photograph of the two new hospitals. That started it.  The cause of the delay with regard to the Boyle hospital has been inexplicable; so far as we are concerned we do not know why it has been held up.  I know that the Boyle people are not at all pleased, either with the Minister or the Roscommon Board of Health, with regard <Col N="355" /> to the way in which this matter of the hospitals has been mismanaged.</P>
    <P>Dealing with hospitals generally, the Minister referred to the Sweep money. I do not want to go very deeply into this matter; it is a very sore one in the City of Dublin, but it does appear that, notwithstanding the fact that the Minister has yet under his control this money, there has not been one new bed added to the Dublin hospitals. That is a very serious thing.  I think the sooner the Minister wakes up to the fact that he will have deficits the better it will be.  He will not find any way of ending that state of affairs until he produces some scheme to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that he expected to have a Bill for the amalgamation of three Dublin hospitals&mdash;Sir Patrick Dun's, Mercer's and the City of Dublin Hospital.  I understand that those people had three years ago a Bill of their own.  They were asked to withdraw that Bill by the Minister, but the Minister has not yet taken the matter in hand himself.  I hope he will take serious steps to do so without any more loss of time.  If the Minister requires the assistance of the medical profession in this very important matter I hope he will ask their assistance and I am sure that it will be willingly given.</P>
    <P>Now we come down to the Estimate and I find there the old hardy annual &mdash;the National Housing Board.  We have always been trying to find out what the functions of this board are. The Minister never told us what they were.  I am very anxious to know what the activities of the Housing Board were&mdash;what they were doing.  We are paying the chairman of that board £1,000 and two members, part-time, £500 a year each.  Other Deputies like myself were always very anxious and intrigued to know about these activities, but we never could find out what they were.  Surely if the members of the Housing Board were doing something useful, the Minister would not be compelled at this hour of the day to set up a commission consisting of <Col N="356" /> these very people plus a couple of other people to find out what the housing position is.  If these people had been active as a housing board&mdash;and we never had any evidence of that&mdash;surely they would be able to find out this information through the local authorities and they would be able to put their fingers on every want that existed.  Apparently they have not been active, for if they had we would know about it.  At any rate we have the situation that the Minister feels obliged to set up a commission to find out the position with regard to housing in this country and particularly with regard to housing conditions in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>There is apparently some difference of opinion between the Dublin Corporation and the Department of Local Government and Public Health with regard to the manner of financing housing and also with reference to the assistance that ought to be given to private builders.  I am informed that through the operations of public policy there is at the present time an increase of 30 per cent. on housing costs, and this increase has arisen within the last two and one-half years. That statement was made here by a Deputy yesterday evening, and I am informed it is correct.  Surely if that is the situation it is something to which the Minister should direct his attention. If housing costs have increased by 30 per cent., how can we have private building in a prosperous condition? How, in fact, can we have any building?  If Government policy has forced up the price of steel, cement, timber, and all those other things by protective tariffs and, as a result, forced up the housing costs by 30 per cent., it is useless to expect activity in the building of houses.</P>
    <P>In dealing with that matter I would like to draw the attention of the Minister to some figures that have been before me with regard to the houses that had been built by the local authorities, particularly within the last five or six years.  Charges have been made from time to time that a good deal of the building was inferior work, that, in a word, inferior work was <Col N="357" /> being done in the building of houses. I think the Minister himself was forced to admit that.  Everybody regretted that that was so.  I find from the figures that have been supplied to me that the repairs to labourers' cottages since 1931 have increased so largely, even in the case of the cottages quite recently built&mdash;even within the last six or seven years&mdash;that it is clear that the workmanship put into them and the materials put into them have been very defective.  So much has that been the case that these cottages are now in need of repairs.  That is a very alarming state of things.  In the year 1931 the repairs of cottages cost the local authorities £26,295.  In 1938 the cost of these repairs came to £83,376.  These are very alarming figures and I am afraid they show great deterioration in the building and in the construction of houses.  The depreciation is certainly not creditable.  On repairs to labourers' cottages there has also been an increase, but not to the same extent. In 1931 the cost of repairs to these cottages was £50,000.  In 1937 the cost had risen to £68,500.  The figures for 1938 were not obtainable.  Taking the whole lot together, I am afraid that there is a great deal to be said for the charges that have been made with regard to constructional work.  It may, of course, be argued that some of the labourers' cottages might be expected, as the years advanced, to show the need for greater and more repairs.  But, still, that could not account for the huge increase that has occurred.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister what steps, if any, he is taking or intends to take with regard to the recommendations of the Banking Commission in connection with repayments on the local loans.  Personally, I think that the recommendation of the Banking Commission on that particular matter&mdash;I am sure the Minister has it in mind; I am sure he has read it and studied it&mdash;calls for very serious consideration by the Minister.  The Government is paying, say, roughly 60 per cent. of the repayments of the loans on the cottages.  The Banking Commission pointed out that in fact it would be better if the Government wrote off those debts altogether&mdash;if <Col N="358" /> they regarded this money as a grant to the local authorities&mdash;and that in fact there was nothing being gained by having this appearing year in and year out as a liability against the State, because that is what it is.  You have also that other situation, that the sum of say £6,500,000, which has been borrowed from local loans for the building of all those houses, may appear on the face of it as a State asset.  It may appear as a sum of money which is due to the State by the local authorities, and which has the backing of the local authorities for payment. Of course that is not true at all.  As a matter of fact to the extent of 60 per cent. it is a State charge; it is a State liability; it is a dead-weight debt to that extent.</P>
    <P>This year we have the Minister estimating for a payment of £381,590 under sub-head S (1)&mdash;Contributions towards Loan Charges under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932.  As was pointed out by the Banking Commission, if those payments are being made by the State towards this fund there must be some object in view.  Is it anticipated that there will be for all time the same need of housing that there is to-day?  Does the Minister now feel that after his seven years endeavouring to clear the slums he still has not even made a start?  Even if the Minister feels, or if the Government feels, that that fund ought to be kept up, I do not think that is the way to do it, because surely if there is a need for further accommodation in that way it will be an immediate need&mdash;at least within, say, the next eight or ten years&mdash;and you will not get it filled up in that way.  I do agree, of course, that there is this other point&mdash;that the Minister can say to the local authorities: &ldquo;Well, unless you do so-and-so, we will not make a repayment for you this year.&rdquo;  He has used that whip, if I may say so, down the country, and used it effectively and rightly. He has told the local authorities that unless they put the proper tenants into the cottages he will not be responsible for the repayments.  I think he is right in that.  Nevertheless, I do not think that this State <Col N="359" /> recurring charge year in and year out, which is an increasing charge up to a point&mdash;possibly for another couple of years it will be an increasing charge&mdash; is getting us anywhere.  I think it would be much better for the Minister simply to write it off as a grant, because that is what it is.  If he wants money for the immediate needs of housing again he will have to borrow it, and he will have to borrow it even if he continues that, because that is too slow.</P>
    <P>I remember drawing the Minister's attention here some time ago to the engineering inspectors.  At that time there was certainly an outery, and I think it was justified, for some prompt dealing with matters relating to housing grants generally.  It was felt that the engineering staff was short, but I remember pointing out to the Minister that, after all, housing needs were not, I hoped, a permanent feature of the country, and that in appointing inspectors for this particular purpose we ought to be careful that we were not creating permanent jobs for what is after all a temporary need.  I find this year that we have abandoned all our temporary engineers&mdash;that we have made them all permanent.  Is not that so?  Twenty-four temporary housing inspectors still remain temporary, but we have added three, two, four, and three in another place, and we have taken off one further down as temporary. Of course the Minister may have some very good reason for doing that, but I hope he has not lost sight of the fact that after all we hope that the need for services of this kind is only temporary, and that we ought to ensure that we are not creating permanent jobs in order to deal with a temporary matter.</P>
    <P>Last year I drew the attention of the Minister to what I considered was a very unsatisfactory state of affairs, and the Minister agreed with me, with regard to county boards of health.  I thought then, and I have thought since as a matter of fact from some statements of the Minister himself, that the Minister had in mind some system <Col N="360" /> which would either supersede or assist the present system whereby county boards of health are supposed to deal with all the matters that come before them.  The Minister, of course, knows perfectly well that the county boards of health cannot adequately deal with them.  It is not within human reason to expect ten members of a county board of health, ten men scattered all over the county, to come in once a fortnight from their work and to deal with 60 or 70 or 80 items on an agenda. It is impossible.  It cannot be done. I drew the Minister's attention to that last year, and I thought he felt as I felt about it.  I am a member of a county board of health, and I know what happens.  Certainly the members are deserving of great sympathy and great consideration.  They come in there at their own expense, and in their own time, and they have got to try to muddle through 20 or 30 items, and to get them done anyhow. That is not satisfactory.  Something ought to be done by the Minister to ensure that public services are properly done.  We want to do them, and the boards of health want to do them, but they cannot; it is impossible.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to road grants that were made available.  I have always looked upon the Department of Local Government as the ratepayers' bulwark, as the great safeguard the ratepayers had with regard to expenditure. I always felt that between the sanctions of the Minister, the inspectorial staff, and the audits, the ratepayers were quite safe, and that nothing illegal, nothing outside the law, could be done or would be done or would be tolerated.  I am afraid that, with regard to road grants, my confidence has been badly shaken, very badly shaken.  Firstly, let me say that the Department of Local Government, particularly, should be entirely above any kind of Party or politics.  There should not be anything of that kind in it.  Even if the Government Party wanted to redeem their promises or wanted to pretend to redeem their promises to the people of this country, the Local Government Department, at least, should stand fast in defence of the ratepayers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="361" /> What I am referring to is this. When the present Government were seeking office one of the things promised to the people was that they were going to put every man in the country into employment.  That was, of course, merely a promise.  It was never meant to be kept or else the people who made it were so far from understanding the position that they thought they could carry it out.  However, they have found that they could not do that.  Then we find that the Road Fund, which hitherto was always operated in the interests of the ratepayers, was allowed to be raided by other people in order to pretend that the Government were redeeming their promises to provide employment for every person in the country.  Not alone was that done, but when grants were made available for local authorities, the local authorities were compelled to fleece the ratepayers of their own county before they could avail of the grant, so that to some extent the Fianna Fáil promises to provide employment for all would be redeemed.  Even then, it was not done at a time or in a manner which gave any consideration to the people who had to pay, the ratepayers.  Not alone was the money pilfered from them, but it was given back only on condition that they made a further contribution from the rates and the time and the manner in which that notification came was as follows: The county council met at its roads meeting in January, passed all the road works which they could, rejected some others, and said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is our budget; that is as far as we can go.  There is not any more we can do, because we cannot ask the ratepayers to carry a bigger burden than is provided for there, as far as roads are concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then a week or a month after that we had a letter from the Minister for Local Government informing us that a grant would be made available for the county out of the E.S.V. grant, provided we put up a certain sum of money.  There we were then between the devil and the deep sea.  We did not want to refuse the grant notwithstanding <Col N="362" /> the fact that it would put anything from 3d. in the £ to 5d. in the £ on the ratepayers.  It would be at least 3d. in the £ in our case.  The least one would expect was that we should have been informed of that grant before our roads meeting, so that we would know exactly where we stood.</P>
    <P>Then we have a situation which is entirely new to me at least, a matter to which I regret having to refer.  We have two classes of these particular grants, the E.S.V. roads rural grant to which the ratepayers make a contribution and the minor relief grant to which the ratepayers do not make a contribution. The minor relief grants are supervised by the officers of the local authority and a certain percentage is allowed for the administration of that. Notwithstanding that, we find that permission was granted to appoint an extra engineer to superintend the ratepayers work, that is the E.S.V. grants, the road rural grants, and the county council had to pay its contribution to that.  The next thing we found was that that man was doing minor relief work and that his travelling expenses were being charged to the county council fund.  I wonder who connived at that?  I am informed that there was a complete understanding that that was to happen.  It was most irregular in my opinion, a thing that should never have happened.  It was a thing that was never known to have happened before in the Local Government Department.  Surely if the Local Government Department was ever regarded&mdash;as I did regard it&mdash;as the great safeguard of the ratepayers, it has lost that reputation.  The people have been pushed into a position which they never thought they would occupy. I do not want to say anything more about this matter.  I feel very strongly about it and I think there is somebody very gravely and very seriously at fault.</P>
    <P>With regard to audits, I should like to know from the Minister when replying if audits are kept up to date.  I think it is a very important matter that they should be kept up to date. It is very unsatisfactory to find <Col N="363" /> occasionally that when the auditor comes down to audit the accounts of a local authority he has to go back four, five or six half years.  That is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs and, even if it were to cost more, I think it would be much more satisfactory for the Department, for the councils and for everybody concerned, if audits could be kept up to date or at least fairly up to date.</P>
    <P>Coming to rates, I have some newspaper cuttings about them, but I do not want to tire the House by reading expressions of opinion all over the country by members of various county councils.  Certain relief from rates is granted to people who employ labour or who happen to have sons 17 or 18 years of age in their homes.  That was a kind of gesture to induce people to employ labour on the land.  I do not know if the Minister has ever had any examination made to find out to what extent that has happened.  I am afraid if there was an examination he would be sadly disappointed, as it has not induced people to employ more labour. It has resulted in some cases of very grave hardship on fathers of young families who are not able to employ anyone, and who have no children of 18 years of age.  I have had instances brought to my notice of people who have no sons, but have daughters. These people have to muddle along, while neighbours who may have no families and who may be well able to employ labourers or pensioners of some sort get an allowance.  The poor unfortunate man with a houseful of children, none of whom is up to 18 years, gets no consideration, The Minister ought to have an examination of the position to see if any assurance whatever could be got that the inducement to employ more people on the land has been a success.  I remember drawing the Minister's attention a few years ago to the position created by the issue of credit notes for rates.  I pointed out that the introduction of that system was a distinct disadvantage to a man who was not able to pay before a particular date.  I notice with satisfaction that that system has been dropped practically all over the <Col N="364" /> country.  I wish that the Minister would direct his attention to the other matter, to see to what extent cases of hardship exist with regard to allowances for labour employed on the land.</P>
    <P>The Department appears occasionally to get into a groove or perhaps some section of it or some of the officials, and they stick there, and no consideration can move them out of that attitude.  We had a rule or an order made by the Department that dispensary doctors must live in their districts.  That is a very reasonable regulation, and I think it is an essential one for the sake of the people, but there are cases in which discretion ought to be exercised.  However, no one appears to think that any discretion should be used.  We had a case in Roscommon recently, in a particular rural district, one end of which is behind a bordering town, and we were asked to build a residence there for a doctor.  The people say they do not want the doctor in that district, that he is nearer where he is now, taking the whole district into consideration, and the doctor also does not want to go there.  There is no residence available, but he has the telephone and there are two Gárda barracks at each end of the district. Notwithstanding that, the Department wrote down to the board of health at meeting after meeting that the residence must be built for the doctor, although the people do not want it there and the doctor does not want it.  There ought to be some discretion in a case like that.  We have what is practically a similar case bordering on another county, where the Minister is insisting on a dispensary residence being built, although the position is that a small portion of our county is administered by a doctor from a neighbouring county, who will be retiring shortly, and then that small portion will come into our county for administration, and will naturally be attached to this particular district.  If we build the residence, as is suggested, that will be the end of it, yet the Department insists on it. We offered to send a deputation to the Department to explain the matter, <Col N="365" /> and the reply was that they did not see what good a deputation could do, as no evidence was supplied to the Department.  The board wrote back that the deputation would give evidence, but the reply again was that they would not have it.  These are matters that want looking into, because they cause annoyance down the country.  Anything that would make for the smooth working of the Department should be insisted upon. I strongly advocate that there ought to be some kind of systematic examination of dispensary districts, as some of them are unwieldy, irregular, and not conveniently placed.  Some of them have arms going out for miles from where the doctor lives, and others may be at his backdoor.  That is the position all over the country, and I do not think it would take very much time to have a new allocation of dispensaries in electoral districts, villages or townlands, and to have boundaries straightened.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I must say that I do not think it would be fair if I did not pay a tribute to the unfailing courtesy that I have always received at the hands of the officials of the Department.  That has been the experience of everyone.  Occasionally, of course, we complain, but we are invariably met with courtesy and with the desire to help.  The complaints I generally go in about concern housing grants.  These grants are being held up unduly, and I never found that the fault was at the Custom House, but attributable to some of the officials down the country.  I know of cases where people got goods and building materials on the strength of certificates, and where shopkeepers are pressing people who have been living in the houses for two years for payment, but who have not yet got certificates.  That is a scandalous state of affairs.  It is not due to the officials in the Custom House, but to officials in the country.  I am not so sure that some of the officials in the country are just playing a straight game at all.  I remember asking the Minister a question last year about the fees an inspector was entitled to ask from persons in order to give the <Col N="366" /> initial certificate and I was told that it was £1 or £1 1s.  I know that certain people were demanding £3 3s.  Of course, they are entitled to charge for plans.  I also know that when they supply plans in duplicate they are entitled to charge £2 2s., at least they say they are, but even where they do not have to supply plans they expect to get £3 3s., and inspections are held up.  I think the Minister ought to look into it.  I have not much more to say, but I am going to end on this note, that, so far as the officials in the Department are concerned, I have always been treated with the greatest courtesy and given the greatest help. If we bring our grievances to their attention they assist us as far as they can.  That is the right spirit.  That is what we want, and I do not think there is any other Department in which it is so essential to have that spirit.  I am glad to be able to pay that tribute to them.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am all for that arrangement, Sir.  I want to deal, first, with the question of the new hospitals that are being erected under the Hospitals' Sweeps scheme.  Hospitals are being erected throughout the country and very large sums are being spent on them.  My experience is that they are magnificent buildings, very elaborate and very ornate&mdash;perhaps too much so&mdash;but there does not seem to be, from the point of view of the people who will have to go to those hospitals from time to time, very much improvement. I do not mean to say that the hospitals are not vastly improved from the point of view of equipment and such things, but I refer to the number of beds available.  I do not know whether <Col N="367" /> other Deputies have the same experience. Let me give a case of a hospital in my own town with which I am perfectly conversant.  We have a splendid hospital built there&mdash;a magnificent building, equipped, so far as I understand, as well perhaps as any hospital in Europe&mdash;but so far as the people of the town and district are concerned, there is only the same number of beds as was in the old hospital, if there are not fewer, and only a percentage of the people who have to seek hospital treatment can be accommodated there.  The position is that the hospital, so far as ordinary sickness cases are concerned, is not there for them, and people have to be sent 20 or 30 miles to an outside hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must confess that I was always against this amalgamation scheme from the beginning.  I could never see very much in it, and I am strongly against taking people away from their own localities, because there is something in the human touch, and people should be kept as near as possible to their own homes, their friends and relatives, if they have to go to hospital.  Many people will not agree with me in that, but there is a lot in that human touch, that a person who is unfortunate enough to have to seek hospital treatment should be able to have visits from his friends, relatives and perhaps his children.  There is another aspect of it which is more serious.  There is a sort of centralisation of fever hospitals, and that is, in my opinion, even more serious because parents will not, in a great many cases, notify disease, if it means that they have to send a young child, 30, 40 or perhaps 50 miles away from home, and in attempting to cloak the disease a real danger arises.  I could elaborate on that, but I merely make the point, because I am sure that there are other Deputies who look upon these matters as I do and who perhaps will elaborate on them when they come to speak.  I think it is absolutely essential that the Minister should consider the question of the number of beds available in these new hospitals.  They are, as I say, very fine buildings, of which we have every reason to be <Col N="368" /> proud, but we ought to see that the maximum number of people are going to get the benefit of these buildings and the equipment in them.</P>
    <P>With regard to roads, I look upon this matter as a very big matter, and I think it is one of the questions to which the Government will have to apply themselves in respect of stemming what is called the flight from the land.  As the Minister knows, road work is one of the principal employments available in rural areas. Outside purely agricultural work, there is scarcely any other work available, except in the last couple of years, and probably for a few years to come, whatever employment is given in the building of labourers' cottages and minor relief schemes.  The main work in rural areas outside the land itself is road work.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Hugo Flinn, speaking here recently on a motion, said that the problem facing them was not so much a problem of finding the money as of finding the work upon which to spend the money.  I should be the last to deny for a moment that there has been a very substantial improvement in our roads, and that very good and useful work is going on in the removal of dangerous corners and so on, but I am not satisfied that a great deal more could not be usefully done.  This is useful work and work which absorbs unskilled labour.  It is the sort of work on which you get the highest wage content, so to speak, because the percentage of the amount available which has to be spent on materials is very small indeed.</P>
    <P>While our roads are good and, in many cases, very good&mdash;I am talking for the moment of our main trunk roads&mdash;some of them are definitely deteriorating and there are stretches of our trunk roads that are not what they should be.  When you come to the county roads and the smaller roads, I am afraid we cannot say that they are good.  I am not now thinking of my own county.  The roads there, generally speaking, are as good as they are anywhere else, but I have in mind &mdash;I am sorry Deputy O'Loghlen is not <Col N="369" /> here&mdash;roads in other counties of which I have experience.  Last year, for instance&mdash;this, perhaps, is bound up with the question of tourist development&mdash;I spent a couple of weeks in the County Clare, and I must say that some of the roads in the County Clare are a scandal and, far from attracting tourists to that county, which should be one of the best tourist centres in Ireland, these roads would frighten the life out of any tourist so that he would never go back there again.  That is true even of some of the main tourist routes.  There is a road from Lisdoonvarna, around by Blackhead, into Ballyvaughan, and the tourist who would bring his car there would never bring it again.</P>

      <P>Well, evidently, he was near me.  However, I only mention that to show that there is plenty of work available in this country, plenty of work that not only is useful but necessary to be done, and, God knows, <Col N="370" /> we have a sufficient number of men to do that work.  I confess that I have looked to the Department of Local Government and Public Health, perhaps, more than to any other Department, to be able&mdash;I shall not say to provide work, because I know they cannot do that&mdash;to administer the type of schemes of work in this country that will employ the people we want to have employed.  Take the question of sewerage.  Under the Minister's housing scheme we have houses going up, generally, all over the country, both in rural areas and in the towns, and we find some of our provincial towns&mdash; I was going to say, with a sewerage scheme&mdash;without any sewerage at all. Some of them have only partial sewerage, that is, sewers only in part of the town, and even those sewers of a very primitive type indeed.  It seems to me that there again you have necessary work that requires to be done, and again the men are available to do that work.</P>
      <P>I have no criticism whatever to make of the housing schemes&mdash;none whatever. The only criticism I could make in connection with them is that I am not at all sure that it is wise&mdash;and this is an aspect of the matter to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention; I may be a bit late, but it might not be too late&mdash;I do not think it is wise, in connection with the slum clearance schemes, to be huddling all the houses into one little corner of a field as if it were in the City of Dublin, where no land is available, rather than in the country where there is plenty of land; nor do I think it is at all wise, from any point of view, that all the people from the slums should be huddled into one place and treated as a class apart from the rest of the community. I think, moreover, that it is a danger because I am afraid that, if we are not creating new slums, at least we are creating new slum conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of that to which I should like to refer.  In the demolition of slums there has necessarily arisen, in our towns and villages, a number of very unsightly gaps in the streets and at the entrances to our towns, and at the moment one <Col N="371" /> would be almost ashamed of them.  As far as I know, at any rate, I do not think the Minister's Department is doing anything whatever to encourage local authorities to build upon such cleared ground or where these particular gaps occur in streets.  I can see, of course, arguments against doing that on the ground that the cleared place concerned may not be able to provide garden or even yard space. Personally, I prefer, so long as one does not remove the tenants too far away from their work or from their means of livelihood, that they should get out as far as possible into the open.  Notwithstanding that, however, there is undoubtedly a problem with regard to those gaps and cleared spaces to which I have referred, and I should like the Minister to give his attention to that matter.</P>
    <P>My main reason, however, for speaking on this particular Estimate is to show, even under a few heads, that there is no foundation whatever for the statement made by Deputy Hugo Flinn, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, that the problem is not so much to find the money as to find the work.  There is plenty of useful and very necessary work to be done in this country.  There is no question at all about that.  I do not think that any person who is at all conversant with this country would deny for a moment that there is work to be done here, useful work, and work that, in my opinion, can be done.  I do not think there is any question of insolvency from the financial point of view. I do not believe it, but I do believe that any money that is spent on useful and necessary work, and that is used in paying wages to the unemployed, is money that is well spent and money that any Government would be justified in raising by way of loan if that were necessary.  As I say, I do not want to elaborate these points any further.  I just raised them in order to bring them to the Minister's notice, and I daresay they will be dealt with by other Deputies who desire to speak.  I think that, on the whole, the Minister's opening statement was a satisfactory one&mdash;satisfactory, <Col N="372" /> particularly, in so far as he dealt with disease in the country.  It is certainly a good thing to know that there is a steady decline in mortality from disease, and particularly from notifiable diseases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike Deputy Brennan who, in his closing statement, bore testimony to the unfailing courtesy of the Minister and his Department, I wish, at the beginning of my remarks, as one who possibly has more intercourse with that Department, through the offices I have the honour to fill, wish to join with the Deputy in support of that tribute to the unfailing courtesy and helpfulness of that Department.  I, too, have to compliment the Minister on the statement he has presented to the House to-night, particularly as to the points dealing with public health and the prevention of disease.  Previous speakers have gone over the details of the administration and have commented upon and criticised the matter sufficiently, I think.  I would rather take the line, although paying tribute to the Minister and his Department in that way, that I disagree with some of the principles on which the Department is administered&mdash;some in degree, and some fundamentally.  For instance, I shall take the first item&mdash;grants in aid of local authorities for unemployment. These grants-in-aid are given on a contributory basis to the local authority. The local authorities, in their desire to help the unemployed, are stretching themselves beyond their capacity in order to comply with the Minister's request or the Minister's conditions.  Is that condition absolutely correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The burden of rates on a contributory basis is now getting beyond the capacity of many of the local authorities, particularly in small urban areas. The weight of rates in trying to carry out this agreement with the Minister is bearing down on the unfortunate residents like a penal burden.  But that is not the point I wish to raise, although that matter is entitled to serious consideration.  The point I wish to raise is that I have a distinct recollection of the House carrying through, by way of resolution, a proposal that every citizen of the State <Col N="373" /> is entitled to work or maintenance.  I submit that that resolution was the father of the Unemployment Assistance Act.  It never referred in any way to the application of a contributory basis to local authorities.  It took it over as a complete national charge and such, I think, it ought to be, because on the contributory basis it has induced, I should say in some respects seduced, the local authorities too far from their duty to local ratepayers by imposing on them to comply with the grants-in-aid by levying too high a rate on the local authorities.  I think that for the future those grants should be given, and if the resolution passed by this House, the resolution which was the father of the Unemployment Assistance Act, is to be interpreted as it was conceived on the first night, unemployment grants will, in future, be given to the local authorities in proportion to the requirements of the unemployed in the area without local contributions.</P>
    <P>I merely wish to refer to the principles with which I disagree and I leave it to the Minister to remedy the matters complained of.  We have heard a good deal about anomalies under another Act.  The time has come when they ought to be rectified.  I would like to call attention to an anomaly that exists in one county where agricultural land inside an urban area was deprived of the agricultural grant and, in other areas in the same town, land was getting the benefit of the grant. Worse still, you have urban areas, portion of which get the benefit of the agricultural grant and the other portions do not.  To pretend that I do not understand that would be wrong.  It is quite clear that everything that was in the urban area, under the Local Government Act of 1898, is not entitled to the agricultural grant, but urban areas created since are entitled to it and any extensions of the borough boundaries of an urban area are entitled to it.</P>
    <P>There is another anomaly, something that I might call an injustice, for which the Government are not in any way responsible.  I refer to an inherited accidental liability.  I have in <Col N="374" /> mind the report of the Derating Commission, on which I had the honour to serve.  It was there discovered that there were four counties in the Saorstát that were not getting the benefit of the agricultural grant, when they should be getting some benefit from it.  I do not know whether I am quite in order on this question, but I am dealing with a matter that comes directly under the administration of the Minister.  In the county that I have the honour to represent there is a very substantial loss suffered.  The Act came into operation in 1898 and the relief in aid of rates was made operative two years previously.  We were then in the United Kingdom.  It was applied in a haphazard way in this country.  When the Local Government Act was put into operation they applied its provisions to the estimated and not to the actual expenditure. Any counties that had exceeded their requirements as estimated benefited more than they were entitled to.  In counties that were economical and that cut down their estimates below their actual requirements, they suffered. One of those counties is County Waterford. Their estimate was £39,384 and their expenditure was nearly £47,000. They lost the refund of the agricultural grant of £3,600.  That loss continued until 1926 when the double agricultural grant came in.  Then they had to face double the loss.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>When the recommendation of the commission was put into operation there was a sum involved of £750,000.  That was not distributed on the basis of the valuation; it was distributed half in relation to the population and half on the valuation.  That brought the loss up to £10,000 a year.  That remains there still and there is an accumulated loss over the year of £229,000 and it continues year after year to the extent of £10,000.  It is not hard in these circumstances to visualise the difficulties of the ratepayers.  They are being deprived of grants-in-aid to that enormous extent.  They are deprived of £58,000 which has been withheld in respect of annuity payments. The sums withdrawn from Waterford, the accumulated arrears, amount to £229,000, together with £58,000 in lieu of grants.  I leave that matter to the Minister to investigate and, if it is possible, I should like to see a long-standing grievance of that kind, affecting three other counties, remedied.</P>
      <P>The next point with which I would like to deal is the question of the capitation grant to mental hospitals.  I hold, if you do not consider it presumptuous, that this has not been administered by the Local Government Department strictly on the interpretation of the Act.  The Act was set up providing for a 50 per cent. refund on the capitation grant.  The sum at that time was approximately 8/- per head and that meant 4/-.  The actual words of the Act of Parliament are &ldquo;a sum of 4/-, or the expenditure, whichever is the lesser.&rdquo;  There you have two principles accepted.  You have, first, the principle of 50 per cent. of the capitation grant, and to make that doubly sure and to save the Treasury in the event of the mentally afflicted being able to be maintained at less than 8/-, it adds the words &ldquo;or whichever sum is lesser than 8/-.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My next point is in regard to main roads.  I am quite aware that the Minister's Department is merely concerned <Col N="376" /> with the licence duty.  I hold that by way of grant and direct refund the entire amount, less administrative costs, is returned.  I do not think that is fair, and I put this point, that the entire revenue from main roads, between petrol and licence duty, is £3,250,000.  I need not remind you that those roads were built by the ratepayers. They are now taken over by the motor trade.  Is it not most unfair that, after taking over those roads which the ordinary ratepayer or agriculturist cannot use now unless as a motorist, that he should be compelled to pay 60 per cent. of the cost of maintaining those roads for another traffic? I think it is unjust.  If you go back to visualise this thing in its proper perspective, to when you had no motor traffic, you will find there was no difficulty in maintaining the roads.  Now a traffic has come on the scene that has, possibly, quadrupled the expenditure. The Government monopolises all the revenue from that traffic, and compels the man who built the roads, whose roads they have taken from him, to contribute 60 per cent. of the upkeep of those roads.  I think it is unfair.  I think the least he is entitled to, and which would leave the Treasury plenty of revenue afterwards, is that the full amount of money should be granted to the maintenance of main roads.</P>
    <P>Another point that I find very difficult is the withdrawal of grants from local authorities.  I know I may not refer to the reason, but we all know the reason why they were withdrawn. When they are withdrawn the burden is placed on the man who pays.  He has to pay the entire amount.  Is it not an extraordinary position that the struggling, hard-working man, the energetic and enterprising man, must pay, not only his own debts, but he must also pay for his spendthrift, reckless or improvident neighbour?  I know there are cases of domestic tragedy where people are entitled to consideration.  I am not dealing with isolated cases, but with the general case.  A still worse feature of this case, Sir, is that it comes on unurbanised townspeople, who have no connection whatever with the land and who have nothing at all to do with the rates on land.  They are <Col N="377" /> held responsible for the unpaid liabilities on land.  In the county that I have the honour to represent, we will take Tramore, Cappoquin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If I may interrupt the Deputy for one moment, I think he is referring to the application of the agricultural grant and, as far as I can understand him, he is criticising something that is done in accordance with existing law.  It is something that the Minister, as far as I can see, cannot do without legislation or cannot change without legislation. If that is so, it is a matter which cannot be raised on Estimates.  You cannot advocate legislation on an Estimate discussion.  You must merely discuss the administration of the law as it stands.  I think that the Deputy is going off on a line in which he is advocating a change in legislation.  I may be wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>My whole point is that I want to make known what is the effect of these withdrawals.  I want to point out to the Minister that it was the general belief that the people who had to pay this liability, or who were deprived of these grants, were the agricultural community.  I want to point out to the Minister, for his consideration, that the people who suffer most are the people in unurbanised towns, because they pay their full rate and any deductions that are taken from that grant are put on that full rate, with no reductions for agricultural land or anything else.  I do not want to be unparliamentary, and I rarely use exaggerated language, but I think it is legalised robbery to make a man, who is struggling to pay his own liabilities, nationally and locally, and struggling to keep his family and give them a decent chance and a decent outlook on life, responsible for his next-door neighbour's liability for land 50 miles away from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been touching possibly, even by implication, on points that it is only the indulgence of the Chair allowed me to develop.  I have made the points as strong as I can.  My first question is the question of the distribution of the grants-in-aid of unemployment.  There ought to be a full grant from the Ministry so as not to reduce local authorities to their own destruction, particularly in small urban areas.  The second is that on the interpretation of the Act the grant is clearly defined as 50 per cent., but that the revenue for main roads justifies the full amount of money being given to maintain main roads. Thirdly, the Minister ought earnestly consider, as Minister for Local Government <Col N="379" /> and Vice-President, the full reactions from any deduction in grants.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to take up much of the time of the House.  My apology can be that I do not very often rise to speak.

      <P>In respect of public health, the wiping out of disease and so on, I think this Government Department is doing excellent work, but I certainly am not going to say that I am going to throw bouquets all the time at this Department.  I think there are certainly many items in which great improvement can be made. One of the things mentioned by the Minister was the treatment of tuberculosis. I am very sorry to say that in the constituency I represent we are very far from satisfied with the present position.  There is no sanatorium in County Roscommon and those patients who cannot be catered for in Peamount or elsewhere&mdash;and there are a good many of them&mdash;have to stay in their own homes.  It is now two or three years since representatives of four counties met in the town of Athlone and unanimously agreed to have a four-county sanatorium.  This proposition was put up to the Department, and as far as I am aware no answer has since been received to it. On the last occasion that this Estimate was under discussion I inquired what had become of that proposition. I have heard nothing about it since.  I think it is an excellent proposition, one that would I think prove economical for the counties concerned.  I know that we in Roscommon would be very glad to have such a scheme.  I am personally aware of many patients who have to be kept in their own homes because the county medical <Col N="380" /> officer of health is not able to get accommodation for them outside.  Even if he did succeed in that it would mean the payment by the board of two guineas a week for each patient, and that would be a heavy charge on the county.  There is no need to stress what a terrible thing it is to have to keep young boys or girls who are affected in a home where there are other young boys and girls, or where a parent is affected, and has to be kept at home until death takes place.  I am not speaking now at random but of what I know to be a fact.  I hope, therefore, that the Minister and his Department will make an examination of the scheme that I have referred to and have it put into effect.</P>
      <P>There are some other matters that I have also to complain about. Deputy Brennan mentioned one&mdash;the district hospital in Boyle.  A proposition in connection with that has been under consideration for years, but it appears that no finality has yet been reached on it.  There is great discontent and vexation, I may say, in that district, which is a very large one, over the delay that has taken place. To my mind, a lot of it is unnecessary delay.  I do not think that anyone can explain away this delay of over three years in connection with the putting into operation of a £30,000 scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning to housing, speaking generally, I do not think any one can do otherwise than compliment the housing section of the Department of Local Government on what they have achieved in this direction.  There are, however, a few things that I would like to put before the Minister with a view to the bettering of conditions.  I found recently&mdash;I do not know whether the Minister is aware of it or not&mdash; that there is a tendency to reduce reconstruction grants.  For example, I have seen estimates up to £60 and only about £25 offered instead of the £40.  Possibly, the Minister may not be aware of that.  I suggest that is a very wrong thing to do.  These reconstruction grants have been availed of to a very great extent in my own county, throughout the province of Connaught, and I am sure in every <Col N="381" /> other county in the State.  I think they have been a great blessing.  They have had the effect of improving conditions wonderfully throughout the county.  I think it would be a very bad policy&mdash;it may possibly be a saving policy, but I do not think it would be a wise or a good policy&mdash;to have a reduction of these grants especially in cases where the estimates are rather high.  There should be no coming down of the grants in these cases.  I hope that policy, if it is a policy, will be reversed.</P>
    <P>There is another type of individual in this country for whom, apparently, no provision has been made under the Housing Acts.  They are those who are in poor circumstances, who live on small patches of land or on bog land. I refer to cottiers for whom grants of £80 are available if they can use them, but they cannot because they have no means of their own to supplement the grant in any way.  If they apply to the Land Commission they can get very little by way of a loan because the value of their holding is so small that the chance of a repayment of it would be small.  In the County Roscommon, at the moment, I believe 160 demolition orders have been issued to people of that type.  When the county medical officer of health condemns a house the board of health is obliged to issue a demolition order.  The houses that these people occupy cannot be demolished unless you first turn them out on the roadside.  That is a situation that the board of health could not face very well.  I do not think that it would mean a very big charge on public funds if special provision were made to meet cases of this kind.  To do so would, I imagine, require an amendment of the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Fionán Lynch">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy cannot advocate that on an Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielORourke" hpid="Mr. O'Rourke Mr. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyhow, I put forward the suggestion to the Minister. There has undoubtedly, as various speakers have pointed out, been a very big increase in the rates.  I have a great deal of sympathy with the last speaker who spoke on this matter.  I imagine that the Minister for Local <Col N="382" /> Government will tell us that it would be impossible for the Government to take over the entire burden of the cost of the main roads.  From what I know of the situation I do not think that this increase in the rates is going to be continuous or that the present burden will go on increasing, because we have to remember that the loans obtained will eventually be paid off. I do not think that any ratepayer is going to have any reason to regret having to pay for what is being done. The County Roscommon has not many large towns, but I think I am safe in saying that in every fairly large town in the county a new sewerage scheme has been installed, or is about to be installed.  That indicates, I think, that the provision of an amenity of that kind was neglected for a very long time.  Therefore, in all fair play, we should bear in mind that even though we have an increased burden to bear that it arises largely from neglect of that kind over a very long period of time.  I happen to belong to a local board, and I am satisfied that after a period a lot of this expenditure will disappear and that it will then be possible to reduce the rates.  Of course, the road estimate has been increasing year after year.</P>
      <P>I am sorry to have to refer to some matters that were mentioned by Deputy Brennan.  First of all, he mentioned the vastly increased cost of repairs to labourers' cottages.  I do not think that any part of that increase is due to Government policy.  I should say that those cottages, so far as repairs are concerned, were badly neglected for a long period.  Further, in our county at any rate, within the last few years, more attention has been given to the repair of cottages than previously.  In addition, within the last couple of years, in view of the purchase scheme that was about to come into operation, repairs were carried out on a much larger scale than heretofore.  I believe that all these factors account for most of the increased expenditure on the repairs to labourers' cottages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was another matter that Deputy Brennan referred to.  To his eyes it appeared to be a mountain, but I think it is simply a molehill.  He <Col N="383" /> delivered a terrible onslaught in connection with the appointment of a temporary engineer for a few months to supervise E.S.V. works, and using the time of that engineer for a period on minor relief jobs.  That happened in the County Roscommon.  In view of a big amount of increased work on the roads in a certain area in the county, it was indicated to the county surveyor that an assistant might be appointed.  An assistant engineer was appointed.  After his appointment there was no work for him on the E.S.V. jobs.  They had not begun, with the result that for a month or slightly more he was employed on the supervision of minor relief works.  I do not think there was any scandal at all about that. I believe that it is all part and parcel of the ratepayers' work, even though, technically, there may have been a departure from the rules.  Nevertheless, I do not see that there was any scandal about it.  Further, I do not think that it is a matter that should have been brought up here.  It is really one that might easily have been settled between the county council and the Department.</P>
    <P>These are the only matters that I want to deal with.  I consider that some of them are very important, particularly the one relating to the condition of those who are not able to avail of any grants for the building of houses or the reconstruction of houses. I especially commend that particular matter to the attention of the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a couple of matters of general policy in connection with the Department to which I want to refer.  But before doing so I propose to follow the Minister in his opening statement, because he raised in that some important points about which I do not see eye to eye with him. I am sorry that he is not here just at the moment because I think it would be for the good of his soul to ask him a question.  As I listened to my colleagues on these benches gladly acknowledging that in some particulars his administration came up to their expectation, I could not help wondering when he was sitting here <Col N="384" /> and Deputy Mulcahy occupied his position, how many of his colleagues ever said in public that anything that Deputy Mulcahy ever did as Minister was done for any other purpose than for the purpose of solacing John Bull and stamping down the long-suffering Gael.</P>
      <P>I direct his special attention and that of his colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, to the attitude taken by the Opposition in discussing this Estimate, because I think it is a part of their political education.  To-day I heard nothing from any side of the House but helpful suggestions for improved administration, and where the Minister appeared to be doing his best, congratulations on the measure of his achievement.  I trust that when he retires, as I suppose in the due course of democratic politics he will retire to Opposition, he will turn frequently back to the Official Report of to-day's debate so that he and his colleague, the Parliamentary Secretary, may learn a lesson on how to conduct a useful and constructive opposition in a democratic Parliament.  I have no doubt that when the Minister has an opportunity of studying the Official Reports he will regret his temporary absence which denied him the pleasure of hearing my introductory remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the matter of supplying milk powder where grade A milk was not available in a rural area for children's milk schemes.  We had some experience of that in the county where I belong to the local authority.  When the grade A milk men came before the board and sought what appeared to be an extortionate price we learned that it was impossible to get grade A milk from anybody but the members of the deputation who were before us.  I recommended to the board that these men should be sent about their business and milk of some other character supplied.  Then there came this proposal from the Local Government Department that we should supply milk powder.  How on earth has the Department come to the conclusion that milk powder is superior to <Col N="385" /> pasteurised milk?  I would like to see a local authority which is held up by a ring of grade A milk producers instal a pasteurising plant, and where an attempt is made to hold them up in future, buy milk freely from registered milk suppliers anywhere, pasteurise it, and then distribute it.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke of the fat content of milk, which I admit is a very important criterion; but I should think that for children a further important criterion is the vitamin content of milk.  I do not know what the vitamin content of milk powder is; I have never heard it described.  I am aware that there are those who hold that pasteurisation may reduce the vitamin content of milk, but it certainly does not destroy it.  I think it is true to say that if you pasteurise milk and bottle it under proper hygienic conditions you get it to the consumers in as safe a condition as it is humanly possible to get milk to them.  Though you may have people holding themselves out as grade A producers&mdash;many of them may produce grade A milk, but we have reason to apprehend that some of them do not &mdash;you create a false sense of security if you tell people that they are getting grade A milk unless you have means of making absolutely certain that it is grade A milk.</P>
    <P>I think that in that matter of milk supply we are making a serious mistake. With the resources at our disposal at present, I do not think it is possible to secure adequate supplies of grade A milk in this country.  It would be a great mistake if, in that circumstance, we rejected pasteurisation as an imperfect method of securing pure milk.  We would fall into the same error that certain surgeons fell into through the 19th century.  They recognised that if you use Lister's carbolic spray effectively you reduce postoperative septicæmia, but they said: &ldquo;It is an extremely imperfect method of antisepsis, and until something more satisfactory emerges we shall just go on in the good old way.&rdquo;  If all the surgeons had taken that attitude, thousands of people would have died of blood poisoning whose lives were in <Col N="386" /> fact saved.  It is true that now the general practice of surgery is aseptic surgery, but if we had waited until the methods of aseptic surgery had been perfected immense human suffering would have resulted.</P>
    <P>Pasteurisation is, in the sphere of milk, what Lister's carbolic spray may have been in the sphere of surgery. Perfect production of grade A milk may be the equivalent of aseptic surgery, but I do not think we have reached the stage of aseptic surgery in the milk sphere.  Therefore, I press on the Minister the desirability of making the universally available method of pasteurisation more attractive to local authorities and other persons who are charged with the responsibility of making available supplies of pure milk for the poor.  I do not condemn milk powder, because I do not know anything about it; but I should like the Minister to examine its value from the point of view of vitamin content and if, as I suspect, it is unsatisfactory, to press on the local authorities the advantages of pasteurisation where guaranteed and adequate supplies of grade A milk are not available.</P>
    <P>I noticed, with some alarm, in recent reports that we are confronted with an increase of infantile mortality in this country.  That is strange.  I cannot think of any good reason for it.  In many countries, if there are no extraneous identifiable reasons, it is interpreted as evidence of general malnutrition.  I am afraid that if we examined the facts in the City of Dublin&mdash;possibly it is the same in Cork; I do not know&mdash;we would be shocked to discover the state of maternal nutrition amongst the poor. A lot of people in this country think that infantile mortality depends on the treatment the child receives after it is born.  In fact, its chances of survival are principally determined by the treatment it gets for the nine months before it is born, and that means that its mother should receive that measure of nourishment which will enable her to look after her baby as she ought to. I am sorry to say that she is not getting it.</P>
    <P>Infantile mortality is, I know, just <Col N="387" /> as distressing to the Minister as to me. I recognise the difficulties inherent in this situation.  We have got to be careful, lost in our solicitude to protect the poor, we turn the poor into semi-convicts.  There are limits to the extent to which we can impose upon the poor what we think is good for them.  But what we ought to be quite sure of is that if the poor coincide in their minds with informed opinion the means of getting what is good for them is available to them.  No Deputy, no matter what side of the House he sits upon, would consent for a moment to the proposition that any of his fellow-citizens should go hungry.  The trouble is that many of us here and throughout the country think of hunger only in terms of having a hunger pain in the stomach. You can very frequently eliminate the hunger pain in a human creature's stomach by filling his stomach with anything.  I expect that you could eliminate it if you filled it with sawdust, but you can certainly eliminate by filling it with food which is not calculated to provide the essential nutrition that a person's body wants. The tendency of the poor, when in straitened circumstances, is, unfortunately, to buy the bulkiest food that the money will reach to and kill the hunger.  It is very often not bulky food the human creature needs, and I think all will agree that in the period before a woman's baby is born it is not bulky food she requires, but milk, eggs and the other vitamin-containing foods which not only maintain her strength and vigour, but also provide for the additional strain which the impending birth of her child places upon her.  People may say that these are scarcely suitable subjects for detailed discussion in Dáil Eireann, but in a democratic country you have got to get from the elected representatives of the people consent for the expenditure necessary to remedy existing evils.  I do not believe it suits anybody's purpose to pretend that Deputies on any side of this House are meanly or grudgingly withholding from the poor that of which the poor stand in urgent need and, therefore, in so <Col N="388" /> far as I am able, I think it right to explain to Deputies, subject to the correction of those who are better informed, the nature of those necessities and their urgency, so that when the Ministers reflect upon them, they will realise that if they come to the House and ask us to request the taxpayers to make sacrifices in order to provide these things, they are coming to an informed body of men who are prepared to carry that information further, if necessary, in order to justify the proposed expenditure before the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>Poor women are not getting the nourishment they require or the attention they require before their babies are born.  I am afraid that has resulted in an increase in the infantile death rate, and it is a matter which, I am sure, is causing the Minister keen anxiety.  I suggest to him that, without more ado, he should call into consultation the almoners of the maternity hospitals of our principal cities and, where such officers have not yet been appointed, the masters of these hospitals, and ask them to tell him what their view is.  If he finds, as I think he will, that the majority of the poor women coming in to have their babies born in these hospitals are under-nourished, will he ask the almoners what they suggest in order to secure that these women will be under-nourished no longer?  I am sure they will point out to him the schemes in England and the U.S.A. which adequately provide for that difficulty.  I want to emphasise, again, that we must not, in our zeal to remedy the evil, impose on the poor what we think is good for them any more than we should wish our neighbours to impose on us what they think is good for us.  But we ought to place at the disposal of the poor those things which our expert advisers assure us the poor should have, so that when the education of these simple people reaches the proper stage, they can go and look for these things and they will be there for them to get.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I directed the Minister's attention before and which I think has escaped his <Col N="389" /> memory.  In certain of our county homes and surgical hospitals there is no accommodation for segregation of juveniles.  I admit that, in certain hospitals, you will find only two juveniles and, sometimes, only one.  The Minister will be inclined to ask: What are you to do in that case?  The remedy is quite simple.  Lay down a general rule that the doctors will have a discretion, where the juvenile population of the institution is habitually low, to send all juveniles to the Children's Hospital, in Dublin, when they have to be detained in hospital for any protracted period.  If they are not prepared to do that, then put the obligation upon them to provide a separate ward for boys under 16 and another ward for girls under 16.  We have got to remember that, in the county homes, you have a strange and miscellaneous population.  My experience is of the Roscommon County Home, and a better-run institution I do not believe there is in the world.  It is a rotten, old building&mdash;a deplorable old workhouse.  You would be amazed, going into an establishment of that kind, with a stone floor, to see what cleanliness and industry on the part of those who look after it have managed to achieve.  I go so far as to say&mdash;I am usually critical of these old establishments&mdash;that there is something about this queer old place&mdash;now that it is properly looked after and kept the way it is&mdash;which gives it a homely atmosphere, which some of these new aseptic institutions have not got.  You feel that it is not very grand and not very elaborate and, in fact, you begin to feel that there is something of home about it.  When you go into one of the new hospitals you nearly break your neck on the terrazzo floors.  You find that all the floors have a curve at the bottom, that the beds are two feet wide and five feet long and that they run about on wheels.  In a modern hospital you wonder whether you are in a morgue or in a hospital.  Then you begin to realise that you are in a modern hospital.  It is interesting to know that these deplorable old places, if looked after by people with kindliness in their hearts and zeal in their work, can be made quite bearable.  But they cannot sort out the patients who <Col N="390" /> come in.  They have got to take in whatever patients come along.  Many broken-down old people float in there. You get old ladies who are, perhaps, somewhat bibulous and, generally, you get the wrecks who are being looked after and the end of whose life is being made comfortable.  In a bed beside somebody of that kind, you see a little child of 12 or 13 years.  That is not right or good and it ought to be stopped, either by sending the children at once to the Children's Hospital or by providing separate wards.  The provision of such wards should be insisted upon very seriously.  Take the men's ward, where you have some pretty difficult old boys whose language is not too sweet and whose manners are not too charming.  In a bed beside them, there may be a farmer's son of 11 or 12 years of age.  He has experience of things and sees and hears things which ought not to come to his notice.  He is brought into contact with a side of life with which there is no need to bring him into contact in the formative years of his life.  I do not labour that point because I am sure it presents itself to the Minister with emphasis.</P>
    <P>May I direct the Minister's attention to another matter in connection with county homes?  I wonder if the Minister saw the London County Council exhibition in connection with the centenary celebrations in that city?  If he did he would see that they have one exhibit there consisting of a half room which is done up something like the old workhouses.  There is another half room which is fitted up as a model hospital.  I think one of the most striking things is to see the old benches and tables and the enamel plates, cups and saucers in the first half room.  Now, that is one of the most disgusting survivals in our county homes.  Against that, this exhibition in London puts the pleasant, model institution with the clean chairs and tables and clean, white china cups, plates and saucers.  I am sure if the Minister and I were in a county home one of the most distressing things to us would be to take our tea from enamelled cups and saucers instead of having it in white, clean <Col N="391" /> china cups and saucers.  This is one of those things that make all the difference in life.  There is, of course, the question of expense.  If you use good, strong china a good deal of it will, undoubtedly, be broken but, after all, the breakages will not be so very considerable and they will not break the backs of the ratepayers. That would make all the difference in the world to the people in these county homes who have not so very long to survive.</P>
    <P>Coming to the question of these remarkably large hospitals that are being erected throughout the provincial centres I want to say that I am not at all so enthusiastic about them. My colleagues and I hear a great deal about the hospital in Roscommon and the hospitals that are being erected in other centres.  I for one am not enthusiastic at all about these hospitals.  We are erecting immense barracks of hospitals all over the country.  We stand back admiring them and they look extremely well. But we seem completely to forget what these central hospitals mean.  I know that they mean immense cost in maintenance in the near future.  If you build a £90,000 hospital and put into it all the equipment of a modern hospital you will have X-ray plants, laboratories, operating theatres, equipment for operations and so forth.  The average board of health thinks that it can then put in one general operating surgeon and invite him to function as pathologist, radiologist, orthopædic surgeon and in five or six other capacities.  If any Deputies have ever been in a big city hospital they will realise that every one of these divisions of the hospital is controlled by a highly paid expert.  Some people think that if you put in an X-ray plant you can see through every patient just as if you were looking in a looking-glass; in fact that all the surgeon has to do is to press a button which rings a bell; that the photograph is taken and that any doctor can read it.  Do these people imagine that the most skilled operating surgeon in the City of Dublin would set himself up to read <Col N="392" /> these X-ray plates taken on all kinds of subjects?  No skilled operating surgeon would set himself up to deal with all these things.  If he found an obscure condition in a patient the surgeon sends him to a radiologist who reports back to the surgeon what in his judgment the X-ray indicates.</P>
    <P>Remember, it is not only the taking of a picture that has to be considered. That is not an easy thing to do well. I could do it myself in a sort of way, but a badly done X-ray plate instead of being a help to the surgeon, is a menace.  The first difficulty is the taking of the picture and when you have got the picture then arises the question of the reading of it.  The reading of an X-ray plate is a life study in itself.  There are men earning large incomes in this city whose greatest source of income is taking pictures by the X-ray method and reading them.  Yet we are putting up X-ray plants all over the country and asking men who have no experience of radiology, and who never said they had, to take X-ray pictures, to study them, and on their findings from these pictures, to perform operations.</P>
    <P>I regard these large new hospitals as more a trap for the sick poor than a blessing.  I do not deny that in the case of some gross conditions it would be a good thing for the provincial doctor to have an X-ray.  I refer to cases where it would be easy to take the photograph of the trouble and where it would be easy to read it.  But in these cases where you are putting in laboratory equipments you are almost making it a command on the surgeon to use his utmost capacity and in a great many cases, perhaps, commanding him to do what he is not competent to do&mdash;to take the X-ray photograph and subsequently to interpret its revelation.</P>
    <P>I have always held the opinion, from the point of view of expense as well as from the point of view of the health of the patients, that what we want and what we ought to have in rural Ireland is a multiplicity of cottage hospitals.  What we want to do is to take the patient out of a feather bed and put him in a surgical <Col N="393" /> bed in an hospital where he could be properly looked after if he were suffering from some temporary but readily curable disease.  If, when the patient is brought into that hospital, the surgeon examines him and says: &ldquo;This is a difficult case; this will require very skilled surgical treatment,&rdquo; I would call an ambulance and take the patient to Dublin or Cork. When the patient is taken to an hospital in one of these cities he will get the services of a highly-qualified surgeon that I myself could not afford to have.  I do not think it would be reasonable to send everybody who wanted attention to a city hospital. If what the patient is suffering from is only a cut or a plain fracture he would be treated all right in the cottage hospital.  Cases in which there were no complications, just simple cases of surgery, could be treated in the cottage hospital, while the others could be sent to Dublin or Cork.  Perhaps it is late in the day now to talk about these things after the Minister is committed to the erection of those immense hospitals in various counties, but I ask him to bear this in mind, that from the point of view of economy and from the point of view of the people's welfare, he ought to go very easy with future applications.  When there is a whisper in any country town that there is a big hospital to be built there immediately arises visions of the spending of a large sum of money in that town. That means that sometimes as much as £90,000 in wages is to be spent there.  No one in that town or district will dare say a word against that hospital being built.  I have said things in this House that induced Deputy Hickey to call me a public enemy.  I expect he will call me a public enemy for mentioning this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Commonsense is sometimes represented as villainy of the deepest dye.  I would venture to think that the Minister has in mind the establishment of a good orthopædic hospital in the country.  To my mind, <Col N="394" /> there is nothing more regrettable than to see children growing up with crooked limbs and other defects and no proper place in which to treat them. If one sees these children in the country and suggests that they should be sent to some place for treatment he is jeered at as an old woman.  If you send a child suffering from an orthopædic defect to the average country hospital or to the average country doctor at the present time he would laugh at you.  What is wrong with us is that we are not orthopædic minded. I say that because, with the exception of some treatment for tubercular limbs, there is nothing done in that direction at present.  Orthopædic defects do afflict people in this country; yet these are not regarded as things we should worry about.  I have one case in mind of a young girl who started in domestic service at the age of 14 years.  I saw that girl sink down to the condition of a cripple simply for want of orthopædic treatment in good time.  Yet, if these people came to me and asked me where could they send the girl I would be at sea.  That girl would require about three years' treatment in an orthopædic hospital.  A long period of muscular treatment and manipulation would have been necessary, and I think no hospital would have taken her. There would have been no place to put her.  That is the difficulty.  There is no hospital which has sufficient spare beds to take in persons for two or three years, which not infrequently is necessary to remedy orthopædic defects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no need to labour that matter, but of the three projects which the Minister has in mind, all of which I have admitted are important, which he said were contingent on no demands being made on him for increased subsidy, I would suggest to him that adequate orthopædic hospitalisation for the country is one of the most urgent necessities, and I would suggest to him that he should consider carefully whether we should not have orthopædic units in Galway, Cork and Dublin.  There is a good deal to be said, in view of the comparative scarcity of this material, for bringing it all into one large hospital. I see the force of that proposal.  On <Col N="395" /> the other hand it must be considered that most of those cases are tedious ones in which the patients are long separated from their families.  Therefore, to remove them a distance from their families, where it is almost impossible for the families to visit them, has a great deal to be said against it too.  Frankly, as yet I have not made up my mind on the matter, so I am not prepared to give the Minister the benefit of my opinion upon it, but there are two aspects of the situation which would need to be carefully considered before the Minister makes up his mind as to the form which the orthopædic programme should take.  I mentioned, and was called to order on a previous occasion, building societies in England.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it was on another occasion, and I think it was suggested that I should postpone it for discussion on the Estimate.  One of the difficulties about carrying out slum clearance in this country is want of money.  That is one point, but there are more ways of solving the slum problem than by building blocks of flats.  You can contribute to the solution of the slum problem by enabling the owner builder to build a house for himself, because, when he moves out of the house in which he is at present, to occupy the house he has built, a move-up takes place throughout the whole house occupying population of the city, which ultimately results in the vacation of a tenement.  I have elaborated on that point before, and do not want to go into it again.  The Minister understands it, I think, very fully.  The building societies in England are immensely wealthy corporations. They have collected enormous sums of money, and they cannot employ them because there is a building slump in England.  They want an outlet for that money.  There are two remedies: one is amending legislation in the British House of Commons, and the other would be some mitigation of their mistrust of the security offered by real estate in Éire.  Would the <Col N="396" /> Minister, therefore, discuss with the British Government now appropriate amending legislation, because there is a Housing Society Bill before the British House of Commons now, and the introduction of one section into it would enable building societies to invest their funds here.</P>
      <P>Would he, at the same time, consider the question of guaranteeing those housing loans?  The building societies have an extremely conservative system of reviewing their loans. They do not dole them out just to anybody. They value the houses at their own values.  They lend money in strict proportion to the value of the house, but their difficulty would be that, if they had to realise the security, Deputy Tom Kelly would be out at the head of a brass band to protest against the eviction, and, unless they had the Minister for Local Government coming down the steps swinging the key, Deputy Tom Kelly would stop the eviction.  But if the Minister for Local Government promised: &ldquo;I will see that the eviction is carried out and that the security is properly realised, or, in the event of failure to carry it out, I will make good the debt,&rdquo; those building societies have accumulated funds which they could release.  In fact, if it were made manifest in two or three cases that those securities must be reliable, there would be no credit difficult in this country at all.  The class of people who borrow money from a building society do not normally default.  Therefore, the contingent liability of a guarantee upon the Exchequer would be practically nothing, and we would get an immense volume of credit at a very low rate of interest, which the holders of the credit want to employ, and which we at the moment particularly want to use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In passing I just mention categorically that representation was made on behalf of certain persons in Greystones who were trying to get their by-roads repaired.  They have no unemployed, and the result is that they cannot get a grant to do it.  The by-roads, not being by-roads for which they are responsible, will not be <Col N="397" /> repaired by the local authority, and a difficulty exists into which the Minister promised to inquire.  I should like to know if he has had time to investigate the matter.</P>
    <P>We spoke about children's medical treatment to-day.  I wonder is it sound medical practice to go around this country whipping the tonsils out of every child you meet?  I heard that procedure very gravely questioned by a highly competent authority.  When I was a child, that was the fashion.  If you went anywhere near a nose and throat doctor he whipped your tonsils out at once, on the broad general principle that you were better without them, but in the last five years or so some very competent authorities have begun to question the prudence of that course, and suggested that it would be much better to set about curing whatever throat condition is present, and trying to clean the tonsils and leave them, rather than tear them out.  I think that is a matter which ought to be examined, because I think it has become a kind of habit in our medical service.  It requires to be reconsidered, and expert advice taken upon it, and a new orientation given to policy.  The next question I want to ask is this: Is there any attempt made to preserve the children's teeth?  There is an immense amount of sickness in old age in this country due to bad teeth. If it be true&mdash;and I think good opinion is to be found for the view&mdash;that a good deal of rheumatism of the arthritic kind, which is only too common as we know in this country, is largely due to foci of infection in the human body, and those not infrequently are rotten teeth, surely it would be an economy to spend money on protecting the teeth of the young. I do not think there is any use in trying to save the teeth of children of 14 years and upwards.  The best thing you can do for them, where they are breaking down, is to take them out, and cut our losses and their losses too. But, for the younger children, I would regard the removal of a permanent tooth as something in the nature of a serious operation on a young child. The resources of dental science ought <Col N="398" /> to be exhausted to preserve the tooth, and only when it becomes manifest that nothing will keep the tooth in the child's head should the dentist be authorised to draw the tooth out.  I suggest that there are a great many Deputies in this House with dressers of crockery in their mouths because they let their own teeth be torn out at one stage or another.  Let them not imagine that they are getting efficient service.  There are about 35 per cent. of the goods their own.  Fortunately, I battled along with my own so far, but I have spent long periods of my life in the dentist's chair fighting a desperate battle to defend each individual tooth.  I see country children, lads of 16 or 17, going around to the dentist and coming back with a scarf round their mouths.  When you ask one of them where he has been, he says: &ldquo;Getting out five teeth.&rdquo;  I would sooner lose £1,000 than lose five teeth, but in the case of these children their teeth are scattered broadcast without the slightest concern.  I put it to the Minister that that is a serious matter.</P>
    <P>I do not think that dentists, as a whole, make any attempt to fill children's teeth.  If it is a bad tooth, they yank it out, and if the child has not bad teeth, they give him a certificate that the teeth are all right.  It is an extremely difficult thing to get a dentist to fill teeth at all.  The tradition is that if you have a bad tooth, yank it out and that is an end of it. That is a very serious error and it must result in a great deal of ill-health amongst our people&mdash;digestive troubles and other troubles which afflict middle age in Ireland.  Because of that, many middle-age people are afflicted with rheumatism and diseases associated with internal affections of a character extremely difficult to identify and, for that reason, extremely difficult to cure.  I believe the learned Parliamentary Secretary would confirm me in the view that many of these affections are due to teeth defects and consequent indigestion.  I suggest that we should take steps at once to see that young children who come within the grasp of the school dentist should have their teeth filled where <Col N="399" /> possible and that the object should be, not to cure toothache, but to preserve the teeth.</P>
    <P>With regard to children's meals, I think the Minister should consider the question of including oranges in these meals.  They are very cheap at the moment.  You can buy Jaffa oranges this year for 9d. a dozen wholesale, and I suppose if you buy in very large quantities you would get them even cheaper.</P>

      <P>I recognise that it might cost too much.  I do not think that it is an urgent necessity or that it must be done, but I think that it is a matter worth considering.  I am not sure that if you were to buy large quantities you would not get them much cheaper.  There is an immense surplus of oranges in Palestine this year.  The Jews have treated orange production on scientific lines, with the result that they have quadrupled or sextupled the production of oranges and, as a consequence, there is an immense glut on the market this year. We have been getting along very nicely so far, but we are now getting into stormy weather.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be glad if the Minister would look into the circumstances under which the lady inspector of boarded-out children was appointed. If he tells the House that he has no responsibility, I am quite prepared to pursue it with another Minister.  It is a matter which I am glad to have an opportunity of raising in the presence of the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
      <P>There is another matter which I am also glad to have the advantage of raising in the presence of the Parliamentary Secretary.  Deputy Brennan said to-day that there was no Department of State in which it was more urgently necessary that there should be no political animus or bias shown in the conduct of its business, than the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary is aware of it, but he has managed to create in the County Monaghan the impression that the political affiliations of a person, if he comes from County Monaghan, who has to transact business with the Department, materially affect the policy of that Department.  It is commonly said in County Monaghan that any file in the Department in which the Parliamentary Secretary is interested, bears upon it the mark &ldquo;Q&rdquo; and when that file has to be brought to his attention and he has reviewed its contents, if any person is named therein against whom he has an animus, he takes the opportunity to give that person an appropriate stab.  That is not good for the public service.  Personally I believe there is some truth in that.  I do not want to escape by passing the allegation on to other shoulders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="402" /> I now accept responsibility for alleging that when any matters are brought to the Department of Local Government and Public Health relating to affairs in County Monaghan they are not dealt with, in so far as the Parliamentary Secretary has anything to do with them, in a strictly impersonal, detached and objective way.  In so far as that is so, I say it reflects on the credit of the service.  In so far as it is true, it creates a situation in the country which is most undesirable.  I fully recognise that the Minister is the responsible person, but I indict the Parliamentary Secretary inasmuch as it is his conduct I now complain of. The Minister is the person responsible to this House for his own Department and in so far as that kind of thing can happen or that impression can be spread abroad about the Department for which he is responsible, it does an injury, not only to the public service of the State, but to the public life of the State as a whole.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret if I have done anything that is wrong.  I took the opportunity because the Parliamentary Secretary is present to hear what I say.  I do not wish to say behind his back what I would not say in his presence.  We are discussing the administration of the Department, and I deliberately reflected on it.  I stated my reasons openly and clearly.  I stated first my own suspicions, and I want now to state a fact of which I have personal knowledge.  Whether my suspicions are true or false, they are widely accepted in County Monaghan, and even the Parliamentary Secretary himself will not deny that it is commonly believed in County Monaghan that he interferes with the normal working of the Department for ulterior political motives.  I want to exchange no compliments with the <Col N="403" /> Parliamentary Secretary, nor do I want to minimise what are definitely allegations of a categorical character that I make against him.  In justice to him, and to the public life to which we belong, I want to make it perfectly plain that it has not been suggested in my presence by any one to whom I spoke, that there was any question of financial corruption or the acceptance by the Parliamentary Secretary of anything of that sort.  That is not the nature of my allegation.  I allege&mdash; and it is a grave allegation, the gravity of which I fully recognise&mdash; that he does interfere with the due consideration of matters brought before the Minister's Department from ulterior motives and, in so far as that happens, it is wrong and bad for the public life of the country, and bad for the administration of the State.</P>
      <P>Now I come to the last point I want to make.  I have adumbrated on more than one occasion on the special difficulties under which poor fathers and mothers with large families labour I am fully aware that the Minister's solicitude for these people is just as great as mine, and that he is just as much moved at their difficulties as I am, but I think the time has come when we should recast our whole system of social services, and I propose that we should recast them within the present legislative framework we have.  I am convinced that it can be done.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It can be done for the purpose of what I want to say now.  I want to make it clear to the Ceann Comhairle that the proposals I make are designed to fit in with the existing framework.  At present we are harassed by the fact that with the multiplicity of social services that exist, there is continual overlapping, with this disadvantage, that in many cases, with the overlapping, the most deserving poor do not know where they are, while, on the other hand, there are cases of &ldquo;chisellers&rdquo; who can get anything, and more than the law intended, and the really honest persons do not know where to look for relief <Col N="404" /> when in distress because they do not know the right way to go about it. That fact is brought into striking relief by the experience of almoners attached to our city hospitals, and if the Minister could consult these almoners he would find how little the poor know about their position.  One of the almoner's principal functions is to look after a woman leaving hospital with a baby, to put her in touch with social services and see that she gets what she requires from what the State or the municipality is glad to give, if she applies for it in the right way.  I do not propose to expand largely on that aspect of the case, but I want to throw it into relief as one way in which this is capable of being done.  I think co-ordination is necessary.  The Minister knows that as well as I do. I do not propose to dwell on that now, but I propose that, in addition to co-ordination, we stand in need of a further social service, which can be made available within the present legislative framework.</P>
      <P>I was talking yesterday to a person from Germany and I was abashed at what I heard.  This person was the first Nazi I met since Nazism has been under way, and I thought it would be easy to expound on the horror and the tyranny under which they were living, while we had liberty and were living in a free country.  I discovered that it was like talking to some one who was sitting behind a plate glass window and could not be reached.  This person was young and had grown up in the Nazi atmosphere, knew nothing about what liberty meant and simply did not use the same language as I used.  She did not understand it.  We were talking on completely different planes, and it was just like trying to reach someone through a plate-glass window.  In the course of the discussion I thought I was on solid ground, and I referred to the fact that the people in Germany were rationed and could not get enough food.  She said to me that that sounded disagreeable, but that it was not really true that her people did not get enough food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;The difference between our people and your people,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is this, that Hitler has no prosperous <Col N="405" /> people to eat all the food they want, but then we have no very poor people who are hungry.  What happens is that instead of some people having too much and others none; we all have half, while in Ireland you have some people well-off and more people who are destitute and poor.  In Germany we are all poor together, but no one is hungry.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Upon my word, when she said that I changed the conversation.  I went on to talk of liberty and freedom of speech but I could not help remembering having seen people coming in and buying margarine because they could not afford butter.  I could not help remembering children that I saw going to school with a slice of bread and mixed fruit jam on it because it was cheaper than butter.</P>
    <P>There is one great danger about democracy, and that is that we are all too well off.  The fellows who get in here are too well off, and we are inclined, not through malice, but because we are well off to think that the present situation can go on.  We do not want a change.  We are very sympathetic.  We are not hardhearted or indifferent to the sufferings of the poor, but have the best intentions of doing something as soon as we can.  Our faces are set against revolution, and we are satisfied that the system we have is the best one.  I am grateful to my Nazi friend.  I think we should ask ourselves: Is this the best system for all?  I think it is, but I do not think it will continue to be the best unless we can demonstrate that it can be used to abolish destitution, as Hitler abolished it, and to preserve liberty at the same time. Though in theory freedom to die a free man is a very precious thing, it will be hard to persuade those who are dying for freedom that it is such a precious thing as we think it is.</P>

      <P>Does the Deputy expect the Minister for Local Government to deal with that under this Estimate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, because, fortunately, I have a plan.  There is never <Col N="406" /> any use in painting a dark picture, if you have not got a plan, and I have a plan.  The way to go about reform, as opposed to revolution, is to tackle your problem bit by bit, and, if you cannot smash the whole thing at first, to break a bit off.  Who are the people who suffer most from poverty to-day?  Are they not the poor parents of a big family?  The person who has really got his back to the wall is the person whose income is only 30/- or 35/- a week and who has ten children.  That is the real difficulty. That is the difficulty which causes the deepest anguish to everybody, be he rich or poor.  Everybody is willing to run and lend a hand when he sees that because he recognises at once that there is an acute problem in respect of those people who are struggling to keep their noses above water and who are continually afflicted with the picture of their children hungry.</P>
      <P>Let us get after that problem now. There is only one way to do it, and that is to take the necessary money from us here in Dáil Eireann and in the rest of the country and give it to those people to feed their children, bluntly and without adornment.  I have adumbrated a plan for a family allowance for all children of persons with an income less than a certain figure.  I freely see that that would require a very large financial provision, and I cannot too strongly emphasise that no reform on these lines that cannot be financed out of revenue is of the slightest use.  If someone, carried away by a humanitarian desire to relieve distress, advocated the granting of family allowances out of borrowed money, far from helping the poor, he would undo them, so that we have to bear in mind that, if it is to be of any benefit, it must be financed out of revenue.  That is the fundamental pivot on which it must turn.  Far from helping the poor, anyone who is carried away by impatience and a desire to expedite the reform by borrowing money, is hurting the poor.</P>

      <P>Never mind about controlling credit.  Bearing this in mind, we have to realise that we cannot bring down the walls of Jericho with one blast.  It took seven blasts, and it may take us seven times seven blasts to bring these walls down, but let us sound the first one now.  If the income-tax payer in this State, the person with an income of over £250 a year, is entitled to go to the Government and say: &ldquo;Because I have a child, you ought to relieve a certain part of my income of income-tax,&rdquo; surely the man who has 27/- a week has a better right to go to the Government and say: &ldquo;Because I have a child, bring me somewhere near the income of the person whom you are excusing from taxation on account of his child.&rdquo;  That is an unanswerable claim, but the answer given to it at present is that the money is not there. But let us show now that we are trying to get there, trying to get to his aid as best we can, and let us go now to the relief of the person whose position is intolerable, the person with more than four children, whose income is below £2 a week, the people who are living on 40/-.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Home help.  We can extend the scales of home help.  I am not saying that that would be the most expeditious way to do it, but that is the way it can be done, within the framework of the present law, and I have no doubt that a resourceful Minister like the Minister for Local Government would, if he found that machinery creaking under this scheme, evolve another plan to which I have no intention whatever of referring. There are 24,877 families in this country with five children under 16 years of age; there are 16,112 families with six children; there are 8,489 <Col N="408" /> families with seven children; there are 4,077 families with eight children; there are 1,518 families with nine children; and there are 863 families with ten children or over.  That represents approximately 55,936 children who are the fifth, or later, children in families of five or more children.  There are to be added to that number the children of widows and widowers.  They would represent perhaps an additional 3,000. The total figure is 59,936, and, with the added widows' and widowers' children, let us say, a total of 60,000 children.  Of course, all those children are not the children of families whose income is less than £2 per week.  I do not know what the proportion is, and I do not think there are any census figures to tell us what proportion of those children are children of families whose income is less than £2 per week, but I think it would be very small. Suppose we allowed 5/- per week in respect of each of those children, 30,000 of them, let us say, would require the assistance.  I think the House will be astonished to find that it would represent practically no taxation at all. We have 30,000 at 5/- a week, which represents £7,500 a week.  Multiply it by 52.  Does it come to £500,000?  If it were for industrial alcohol, or some cod scheme down the country, we would pass it, and would not give a snap of our fingers for it.  The wheat scheme is costing us £2,500,000 a year, the peat scheme £1,000,000 a year, and industrial alcohol, £170,000.</P>

      <P>Of course, that is the reply: Where is the money to come from?  It is a most valuable interruption, because it is a question that is going to spring to the mind of every responsible citizen.  Not the wrecker, not the person who wants to smash the scheme simply because I mention it, but every friend of mine is bound to <Col N="409" /> ask that question, because, as I emphasised at the beginning, unless we can finance it out of revenue, instead of benefiting the poor, we are hurting them.  The money is going to come from the public purse, and I now surrender all claim to financial orthodoxy, if I stand condemned for saying this: if it meant an increase of 2/- in incometax, let it come from the public purse. I say it and I mean it.  Poverty and starvation will destroy our system of government.  Liberty is more precious to me than any material goods I can command, and it was never brought home more definitely to me than when that little girl from Germany replied &ldquo;The difference is that, with you, there are those who have enough and those who are hungry.

      <P>I wish Deputy Kelly would either go to sleep again or else make a speech, but these idiotic interruptions help nobody.  Now, I do not want to be taken as suggesting that there is a deep and dark conspiracy on behalf of Fianna Fáil to withhold that or any other such benefits from the poor.  I do not suggest that.  I give them full credit for being just as anxious as I am or as anybody else is <Col N="410" /> for the welfare of the poor.  I do not deny that for a moment, but I am bringing to this House the experience of what I saw when I was travelling abroad.  I saw it work, not for a week or for six weeks, but I saw it working after 20 years' experience.  I talked to the men who passed it, I talked to the rich men and the poor men.  The rich men did not know it was there.  It never occurred to them to question it. It was passed in their fathers' day and they would no more dream of questioning it now than they would dream of questioning the rates levied to provide sewerage or water supply for poor men's houses.  The poor people, whether employed or unemployed&mdash;and largely the unemployed&mdash;would say: &ldquo;What would become of our children if we did not have it?&rdquo;  Of course, it was there on a very much larger scale than we could contemplate initiating here, but the important thing would be to get it going, and then, as funds became available, always bearing in mind that it must be financed out of revenue, we might be able to extend it until we could definitely say that no married person in this country need ever fear poverty or starvation.  If we could say that, we can deal with the acute problem of unemployment on another occasion.  This is not the appropriate place to deal with it.  I mentioned on another day how that problem could be tackled, but if we could get that ghost of destitution out of our political system, would it not be an inestimable contribution to the preservation of liberty and democracy?  I am not suggesting that it ought to be done to-day or to-morrow or the next day, because it cannot be done without due reflection or without goodwill from everybody.  Is it not worth considering, however?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mention no other aspects of the social services&mdash;although much might be said about other aspects of the question&mdash;because I want to draw that particular aspect into relief, and because I have reason to believe that, in more quarters than one, it is not a welcome proposal.  It is not welcome to those who think that they are already taxed too highly and who would proclaim very loudly that they should not be taxed any higher.  Well, <Col N="411" /> they are welcome to try and suppress these things and to claim freedom for themselves and the right to suppress their neighbours, but they cannot suppress us for ever, and so long as we have this platform to speak from, sooner or later we will reach the people.</P>
    <P>In this position, I should be glad if we Deputies could reach the people together, and not by claiming credit for one side of the House or the other, because I am perfectly certain that, if it were practicable&mdash;as, I am sure, it would prove to be practicable if it were once examined&mdash;it would get just as much of a welcome from the far side of the House as from this side of the House.  The matter is worth consideration, and it certainly would get the most thoughtful consideration from the people if it came from us all here in the House rather than as a sort of political gambit from one political Party or the other.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I must tell Deputy Dillon that I certainly am not disagreeing with what he said to-night, although I do not intend to be as long in speaking as he was.  We were all glad to hear, according to the Minister's statement, that the rate of deaths from notifiable diseases had been reduced.  The Minister gave us some figures in connection with infantile mortality.  I am rather sorry to say that the incidence of the infantile mortality rate in the City of Cork is the highest since 1926.  I am rather inclined to be more definite about that matter than Deputy Dillon, and I am definitely prepared to say that the increase in infantile mortality, not alone in Cork City but in other places, is due to poverty and bad social conditions. My reason for saying that is this: I took the trouble of getting the incomes of 709 families in the City of Cork.  We have, as you know, a differential rent in the City of Cork, and we have a monthly survey of the incomes of the different families.  Out of some 709 families, we found that there were 163 families living on an income between 20/- and 30/- a week; 110 families with incomes between 30/- and 40/- a week; and so on up to a very small number living on incomes <Col N="412" /> of from £3 to £4 10s. a week.  To make it more definite, we were able to ascertain the number of persons in each house, and the average was six persons per house, because they were nearly all drawn from some of the slum clearance areas.  Accordingly, taking from that the differential rates, we discovered that there were over 2,500 persons living on less than 4/- per week with which to feed, clothe and provide themselves with the other necessaries of life.  In view of the facts with regard to these small incomes coming into these families, I am quite satisfied that the increased mortality rate in infants was due to poverty and starvation.</P>
      <P>Having read and taken some interest in the reports of the medical officers of health throughout the country I am quite satisfied that there is a great problem with regard to malnutrition in this country.  I think that your own Medical Officer of Health in Dublin made very special reference to that in his report last year.  Deputy Dillon has made a very fine statement to the effect that a case could be made for increasing the children's allowances, and he instanced what is taking place in New Zealand and Australia.  I have a brother in Australia and I have got information with regard to some of these things, and it would be well for us all to know what they are doing there.  Like Deputy Dillon, I am quite satisfied that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health is as sympathetic towards this problem and has as much humanity as any of us have, but it is well that attention should be drawn to these things.  In Australia they have a family allowance of 5/- per person.  First of all, there is a minimum wage of £4 5s., and then there is an allowance of 5/- per child up to six children.  A man who has £6 5s. does not get the same allowance as the man with £4 5s., but the man with £4 5s. as a minimum wage gets 5/- for each child up to the number of six children.  In view of that, I do not think we can claim to be what we profess to be when we are only providing 1/- a week for a child up to the age of 14 and not providing at all for the sixth, seventh, eighth, or ninth child and so on.</P>

      <Col N="413" /> I believe that the Department of Local Government and Public Health is the most important Department in the State.  I am not saying that the Minister himself is responsible for the smallness of these allowances for the children, but I do say that it is an extraordinary reflection on his Department in view of the fact that that Department is concerned with public health, because we cannot have public health if we have not the nourishing food which is necessary for the people to maintain their health.  The Deputy also told us that the best way&mdash;I think he said&mdash;to abolish that poverty and destitution was to take the money from those who are here.  My view would be that, instead of doing that, we could very well leave what they have with those who have it and give the necessaries of life to those who have not got them.  What I have in mind is that we can produce here in abundance.  There is potential plenty all around us, and why should we take from those who have it when there is plenty for those who have not it yet?  As the Deputy says, the question all the time is: &ldquo;Where is the money to come from?&rdquo; and he says that all these things must come out of revenue.  I agree to a certain extent, but I certainly do not believe that we will become prosperous by trying to borrow ourselves into prosperity.  That is what we are doing. We are trying to bring about prosperity by borrowing, and I want to say here seriously that until such time as this Government&mdash;and I have not any political feeling about this&mdash;has control of the credit and currency of the country, we will never have the problem solved to which Deputy Dillon referred.</P>

      <P>On the Committee Stage I proposed certain amendments to this Bill.  Those amendments were, unfortunately, ruled out by the Chair.  The object of those amendments was that this Bill should not have the death penalty for certain offences for which it was grotesque and absurd that the death penalty should be applied.  In my speech on the Second Reading I suggested to the Prime Minister, who was then in charge of this measure, that he should withdraw the Bill and bring in a new Treason Bill, a Bill which would do away with constructive treason as an offence punishable by death.  I pointed out to the House on that occasion, and I do not wish to point it out to the House again, because I would take up the time of the House by pointing it out again, what is meant by constructive treason.  Unfortunately my amendments, which would leave the death penalty for the real carrying on of genuine warfare against the State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If I may interrupt the Deputy, this is the Fifth Stage of the Bill and the debate on the Fifth Stage of a Bill must be confined to what is in the Bill, and the debate cannot range over amendments which have been ruled out on the Committee Stage.  That has been long laid down as a precedent here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am explaining my reasons why, having voted for this Bill upon the Second Reading in the hopes that it could be amended, I am now asking the House to reject this measure, because it is in its present form, and I wish to make perfectly clear to the House the reasons why I am asking Deputies to reject this measure now.  I had hoped that this Bill would be amended, and that the death penalty should only be applied to genuine acts of treason, to genuine acts of warfare endangering the lives of the citizens of this State. I expressed the view, which I still hold, that if persons engaged in acts of warfare against the State, if they took away the lives of those who uphold the integrity of the State, if they shoot down soldiers defending the State, or Guards defending the State, then those acts, and the conspiracy to do those acts, are matters which are justly subject to a death penalty by the laws of this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But when you come down to constructive treason, I think it is quite different.  We have an ancient, antiquated and barbarous definition of treason in the Constitution, and now we have an antiquated and barbarous statute such as this, putting life into the dead bones of the definition in the Constitution.  It was stated by the Prime Minister, when he spoke here on a previous occasion, that levying war would not be taken in the sense that it has always been taken, in the sense that it has always been construed by the courts, but that it would be taken in some other sense in which he suggested it was meant to be taken.  The rule of construction is perfectly clear and perfectly definite.  It is not what may lie hidden in the back of the mind of any person introducing a Bill that can be taken in the construction of that Bill.  It is one of the clearest things that a court, in construing the Act of Parliament, looks to one thing, and one thing only, and that is to the expressed intention of the person who introduces it.  That must be so.  They must look to the expressed intention, and they cannot go guessing what the intentions may have been behind the persons introducing the measure, different <Col N="416" /> from the intentions which they have expressed on paper.</P>
    <P>Here we have the words &ldquo;levying war&rdquo;, words which have been defined by court after court, and always defined in the same way, not by decisions nearly 200 or 300 years ago, as was suggested here, but decisions running right down to our own time. Levying war has been construed in the prosecutions brought under the Treason Felony Act as including acts of constructive warfare, that is to say, endeavouring to achieve any public purpose by acts of violence.</P>
    <P>I presume my amendments were ruled out of order owing to the Long Title of this Bill.  But I did think that treason could be divided into several parts.  I did think there could be the death penalty for genuine treason and that there could be other penalties for other acts of treason.  I presume&mdash;I do not know&mdash;that the ruling of the Chair was that it was the title of this Bill and not any inherent difficulty in the thing itself that was responsible for ruling my amendments out of order.  Since we are now faced with a Bill which, as I have said, is barbarous in its application of the death sentence to offences in which it would shock the public conscience if the death sentence were carried out or passed by a jury, I consider that this Bill should not pass this House.</P>
    <P>That is not leaving us without a Treason Bill.  It is not leaving us without the offence of treason being punishable if it be committed to-day or to-morrow.  We have a Treason Bill which will be enforced if the House rejects this measure, as I ask the House to do.  I ask the House to reject this measure because, as I have said, it is antiquated and is entirely barbarous in its definition.  The words are used, &ldquo;levying war&rdquo;.  Those words have been construed again and again. They can only be taken in the one particular way in which they always have been construed by the courts and that must have been the intention of the framers of the Constitution.  Why do they use the words &ldquo;levying war&rdquo;? &ldquo;Levying war&rdquo; is archaic English. Whoever talks of &ldquo;levying war&rdquo; in everyday conversation?  Would any <Col N="417" /> member of the Government, talking to another member of the Government, say that Japan is &ldquo;levying war&rdquo; at the present moment on China?  Would you see written in any newspaper, even, at the present day that Japan is &ldquo;levying war&rdquo; upon China?  It is antiquated English.  You would say, &ldquo;Japan is at war with China.&rdquo;  You would say that Japan was committing acts of warfare against China.  A newspaper would write, and possibly persons in conversation would say, &ldquo;Japan is waging war against China.&rdquo; But, I have never heard in ordinary conversation and I have never seen printed in a newspaper the statement that one country was &ldquo;levying war&rdquo; against another.  We have gone back to archaic English.  Why have we gone back to archaic English?  The reason is perfectly plain and definite.  We wish to use that archaic term because its meaning has been made perfectly clear by decision after decision, from generation to generation, of judges.</P>
    <P>I may be told, of course, that, although we have a barbarous code of treason, it is only in cases of real treason that the law will be put in force.  My answer to that is twofold. In the first place, I say that it is a wrong thing for us to have on our Statute Book a statute over the morality of which we cannot stand, even though it never be put in force. I have also got to say that, though persons may not be indicted under Section 1, possibly, for acts of constructive treason, under Section 3, they may be for acts of misprision of treason.  For example, if we take an association, possibly formed for the purpose of having all the grass land of Ireland broken up, that is a public purpose.  If that is followed by cattle driving, and the object is, not to clear one particular farm, but to clear all the farms of the country, that is constructive treason, and that is an offence punishable by death, according to this statute.</P>
    <P>No doubt, no Government would ever indict cattle drivers for treason, and, no doubt, they would not get a jury, and I do not think they would even get a military tribunal, to find cattle drivers guilty of treason and to hang <Col N="418" /> them.  But I do think it is quite possible, especially when I consider certain provisions in another statute which is going through this House, that, under Section 3, every person who, knowing that any act the commission of which would be treason is intended or proposed to be, or is being, or has been committed, does not forthwith disclose the same, together with all particulars thereof known to him, to a justice of the District Court, or an officer of the Gárda Síochána, or some other person lawfully engaged on duties relating to the preservation of peace and order shall be guilty of the felony of misprision of treason and shall be liable on conviction thereof to penal servitude for a term not exceeding five years or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.  So, therefore, if there was a general conspiracy to drive cattle off all the farms in Ireland, which amounts to levying war, according to all the authorities which I read to the House upon the Second Reading, and if, as I say, somebody knows that a cattle drive in pursuance of that general intention is going to be carried out and does not immediately go and tell a district justice or a member of the Gárda, he is liable to imprisonment for five years.</P>
    <P>No doubt, as I have said, indictments for constructive treason would probably never be preferred by a Government, but I do not see that it is at all unlikely that indictments for misprision of treason, under this Section 3, would not be preferred by a Governments and, if people did not give information to the Guards or to district justices if they knew that some act, the commission of which would be treason, was going to take place, I can readily understand their being indicated under Section 3.  And, in the disturbed condition of the country which we must visualise before any charge of that nature would be likely to arise, I can very well understand their being brought before a military tribunal and sentenced under that Section 3.</P>
    <P>But, there are other things.  We proposed an amendment to Section 2 to the effect that, if a doctor finds somebody, who has been guilty of a treasonable offence, dying or in danger of death, that doctor should go to his <Col N="419" /> help, and should alleviate his suffering; should perform an act of Christian charity, and should not be in the eyes of the law thereupon regarded as a felon.  That seemed at any rate to be a very moderate amendment, but, sticking firm to their determination to keep this Bill as it is upon the Statute Book, even that very moderate suggestion was rejected by the Minister, and was rejected by the majority of the House which they have at their command. Therefore, taking this Bill as it stands, I ask the House to reject this Bill.</P>
    <P>I again wish to reiterate the position I am taking up.  It is not because it is a Treason Bill; it is not because it makes the very grave offence of carrying on acts of real, genuine warfare against the State, an offence punishable by death, that I oppose it; but I do oppose it, and I do ask the House to reject it upon the ground that it is a bad Treason Bill; because it is a Bill that goes altogether too far; because it is a Bill which is carrying out, in a very foolish and unnecessary way, that antiquated and unchristian definition of treason which the Constitution contains. It is not because it is a Treason Bill, but because it is a bad, and a very bad Treason Bill, as it stands now, that I ask the House to reject it.</P>
    <P>We accepted it upon the First Reading. We voted for it upon the First Reading because of what I, at least, took to be promises that amendments would be inserted, though they were not definite promises.  I am not putting forward any breach of faith, but, because hopes were aroused in us that this Bill would be amended so as to make it a proper Treason Bill, no more extreme than is necessary, we voted for it upon the Second Reading.  But, because it comes before this House, upon the Fifth Stage, entirely unamended, in all its naked rottenness, I ask the House now to reject it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has been the subject of a good deal of discussion in the House, but, having regard to the relatively short character of the Bill, it is not necessary to say very much. I want to indicate on this stage what <Col N="420" /> I have already indicated on the Second Stage, namely, that this Party is opposed to the passage of the Bill, and considers that there is no set of circumstances existing in this country to-day which justifies the hasty introduction of a Bill of this kind.  No attempt whatever was made by the Minister introducing the Bill, or by the Taoiseach, who has taken an unusual interest in it, to show that the circumstances here to-day justify its introduction.</P>
      <P>The country to-day is more peaceful than it has been for many years, and yet, as if peace was something to be abhorred, the Government present this House and the people with two Bills: one a Treason Bill and the other a Public Safety Bill masquerading under another name, in order to produce as much yeastiness, perturbation and disquietude in the country as it is possible for two such mischievous Bills to create in the public mind.  Instead of the House devoting itself to matters of serious economic concern to the people, devoting its attention to remedying the depressed condition of agriculture or endeavouring to create employment for the 106,000 unemployed people that we have, it is being asked to divert its efforts to dealing with the Treason Bill and a Public Safety Bill.  That is the contribution which the Government makes towards creating stability and order in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said on the Second Stage, and I say now, that this Bill is a much more extreme Treason Bill than the Treasonable Offences Act of 1925, because under this Bill it is possible to prosecute a person for treason on the capital charge when it was not possible to prosecute that person for treason under the Treasonable Offences Act of 1925.  By the introduction of the phrase &ldquo;levying war&rdquo;, and the meanings which have been attached to levying war in the British courts and in the Irish courts, it will be possible to indict a person for treason under this Bill even though the charge which may be levied against him is very far removed from the overt act of levying war.  As I said before&mdash;I think it will bear repetition as showing the wide meaning of levying war&mdash;the <Col N="421" /> British courts one time held that it was levying war against the king if you made love to his eldest daughter and subsequently changed your mind. It will be possible to have various grotesque meanings given to the phrase of &ldquo;levying war&rdquo; in the light of the circumstances existing to-day. It will be possible, by the inclusion of the phrase &ldquo;levying war&rdquo; in this Bill, to prosecute persons and impose the punishment of death for offences which can be brought within the ambit of that phrase &ldquo;levying war&rdquo;.  This Bill, therefore, is much more extreme than the Treasonable Offences Act of 1925 which was bitterly denounced at the time by the Party now in power.</P>
    <P>I object in particular to the introduction of this Bill at this stage.  If there was any case which could be made against the Bill on the ground of its extreme character it was made by an English paper a week ago.  Referring to the fact that certain Irishmen were being charged with offences in Great Britain, and referring to the severity &mdash;what I can only describe as the savagery&mdash;of the sentences imposed upon them, this English paper said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Well, after all, they got off lightly because if they did this in Ireland Mr. de Valera would charge them with high treason on the ground that they were levying war against the State, and they would be sentenced to death.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that the English paper, in justifying the savagery of the sentences on young Irishmen in Britain says, &ldquo;Ah, we are treating them lightly.  If they were in Eire they would be sentenced to death by the Government under the Treason Bill of 1939,&rdquo; which we are now being asked to pass by the Government.</P>
    <P>I think this Bill was unfortunate in its conception, and was introduced at a most inopportune time.  Efforts have been made in Britain to create a scare, to mobilise artificial indignation against Irishmen.  At a time when many of our countrymen have their backs to the wall, with that mob massed opinion artificially mobilised against them, we fan the flames against them by demonstrating, in the <Col N="422" /> peaceful conditions which exist here, that it is necessary that Irishmen should have a Treason Bill and an Offences Against the State Bill, in order to induce them to conduct themselves. The Government has been panicky in introducing a Bill of this kind.  It has been introduced with indecent haste.  It has been introduced without a shadow of justification for its introduction.  Even at this stage the Government ought to realise that it is asking the House to pass a Bill which, in its terms, is much more stringent and much more rigorous than the Bill which it denounced in 1925.  No case has been made for the Bill.  We have no circumstances here justifying the introduction of such a Bill.  I, for one, do not believe that there is a situation which demands that the Government should ask the House to inscribe on its Statute Book a Bill so severe in its terms as this, and particularly at this very inopportune time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this Bill.  I opposed it on the Second Stage because I consider that it is very imprudent to enact a law at the present time which makes treason an offence. My reason for saying that is that for generations in this country treason has been regarded as a virtue.  Because of that, I submit that this is a most inopportune time to enact a law which makes treason an offence subject to the death penalty.  In almost every city in this country you have monuments erected to the memory of men who gave their lives because they were held to have committed the offence of treason.  Treason was then defined as levying war against the King or against Great Britain.  If it is now defined as levying war against the Irish State it will be difficult for the plain people of this country to draw a distinction between the two circumstances. For that reason I hold that many years should be allowed to elapse before we enact a law making treason an offence.  I may be asked how can the Government, or how can State institutions, be protected if there is not in force a law of this kind. Treason, in this Bill, is defined as levying war against the State.  I cannot <Col N="423" /> see how a citizen of this State can do that without violating some of the ordinary laws of the country.</P>
      <P>Therefore, if a person goes out to levy war against the State he must endanger life or property or inflict some injury upon a fellow citizen.  If he commits any of these offences he is guilty of an offence against the ordinary law.  Why, therefore, is there any necessity to introduce and reenact in this State the offence of treason?  Surely out of respect to all those who have suffered for the offence of treason as it was regarded up to the establishment of this State, the legal offence of treason should be left aside for a time.  Anybody who studies the question seriously must admit that it is possible to preserve the democratic institutions of the country without enacting this extremely drastic law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be remembered that this is not emergency legislation.  It is an enactment which is intended to be permanent.  It is an enactment which is intended, I think, to implement one of the clauses of the Constitution. Under one of the clauses of the Constitution treason is defined as levying war against the State.  I do not see that there was any immediate or urgent need to implement that particular clause of the Constitution.  It may be no harm to have that clause in the Constitution giving a definition of treason; but there was no urgent need to follow it up by enacting penalties for that offence.  Everybody who studies the question will admit that there are adequate provisions in the ordinary law of the State for the punishment of any acts which can, under this legislation, be regarded as levying war.  For that reason I think that this Bill is altogether unnecessary. Apart from being unnecessary, I think this Bill is altogether too drastic, that the penalties provided are altogether excessive.  We are told that levying war against the State, or the various offences which may be defined as treason, are equal to the offence of murder.  I hold that there is no offence which can be regarded as equal to the offence of murder.  I hold that, out of respect for the sanctity of human life, the State should not take upon itself <Col N="424" /> the power to execute citizens for any offence except murder in the first degree.  In the past 25 years there have been altogether too many executions, both legal and illegal, both official and unofficial in this little country.  It is time we turned over a new leaf.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not speaking of what might have been; I am speaking of what should be in this Bill.  We should not enact a law which gives the executive Government of the State such drastic power, power which they may be tempted to use against political opponents.  When we consider the extent to which the term &ldquo;levying war&rdquo; could be enlarged; when we consider the number of circumstances which may be regarded as levying war; when we consider how in a time of excitement any political party, agitating perhaps for certain reforms, could by a very slight stretch of imagination on the part of an excited and partisan Government in future&mdash;I am not referring to the present Government&mdash;be regarded as levying war, is it right that the Executive Government should be given this drastic power to inflict the death penalty upon people who may be simply political agitators, or perhaps, agitating for some economic reform?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When every aspect of the question is considered, I think the Government would be well-advised at least to suspend this Bill.  Whatever may be said about the other legislation, they should not enact a law which seeks to justify the infliction of the death penalty for what may be regarded as a political offence.  There is at the present time considerable agitation in this country and other countries for the abolition of the death penalty for murder.  I do not think that that agitation is completely justified.  I can visualise, and I think every Deputy can visualise, circumstances in which the State would be justified in executing for deliberate <Col N="425" /> murder.  But I cannot visualise any circumstances under which the State would be justified in executing for any offence other than murder.</P>
    <P>It may be suggested, of course, that anybody who would be guilty of treason might perhaps cause the death of a number of citizens or considerable loss both of life and property.  The same could be said of a Government that might unwisely involve this country in an international war.  Suppose a Government, without justification, committed this country to war, they might cause a loss of hundreds of thousands of citizens' lives.  You cannot judge the matter from that angle; you must judge the matter from the actual gravity of the offence.  Everybody will acknowledge that there is a natural gravity in the offence of murder. Every right-minded citizen revolts from that offence.  Every right-minded citizen regards a person who commits murder as he would regard a beast of prey.  But there is not in any country the same attitude towards a person who may be involved in some political agitation which may be regarded as levying war against the State.  Because there is a certain vagueness about the offence of treason, I think there should not be such a drastic penalty inflicted. I do not think that public opinion in this country is in favour of such a drastic penalty.  I think that this country can be adequately protected by the existing law.</P>
    <P>It is not legal enactments that protect a State, or the institutions of a State, so much as the vigilance and efficiency of the forces of the State, added to the common sense and loyalty of the general community.  The Irish people have proved themselves to be common-sense people.  They have survived many great difficulties since the establishment of this State, 17 years ago.  It was the common sense of the plain people, and not the wisdom of their leaders, that enabled this nation to survive, and that has resulted in the continuance of this State as a democratically-governed State.  If this State is to continue to survive&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There seems to be a feeling that there is absolutely no power in the hands of the State at present to preserve order or to protect the institutions of the State.  So far as I can see, there is no chance for any person to overthrow the Government or make any attempt seriously to interfere with the administration of the law without violating some existing part of the ordinary law.  Why should we add to the existing law?  Why should we seek a new enactment which provides the same penalty as that for murder for what must be a vague political offence?  It would be wise for the Government to realise that the Constitution as it stands, without further implementation, is quite sufficient. There is in the Constitution a definition of treason, without additions, and I think we should be satisfied with that, for the present.  A certain time must be allowed to elapse before public opinion in this country becomes accustomed to the changed conditions under which we are living.  A certain time must elapse to enable people to distinguish between treason as it existed prior to the establishment of this State and subsequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has, I think, been suggested by some Deputies that those who have opposed this piece of legislation are in some way sympathetic to those against whom it is supposed to be directed&mdash; that those who are opposed to the Bill are in some way sympathetic to those who may be penalised under it.  So far as I am concerned, I have absolutely no sympathy whatever with anybody who might be inclined to overthrow this State or who would be guilty of the offence of treason.  I am as strong a believer as anybody here in the principles of democratic government, and I hold that the Government of this country is the lawfully established and properly constituted Government, and that there is absolutely no <Col N="427" /> reason why any section of the community should seek to overthrow the established Government by unlawful means.  Further than that, I think it has been clearly demonstrated that the Constitution enables any organised section of the community&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the Committee Stage of this Bill, the Taoiseach gave an undertaking that various points raised by the Opposition would be considered before the Report Stage.  These points have been carefully considered <Col N="428" /> and examined and we have come to the conclusion that we could not embody them in the Bill.  This Bill flows naturally from the Constitution and it is based on that Article of the Constitution which defines &ldquo;treason&rdquo;. Looking back on the reports of the debates on that Article, one is surprised, if not amazed, to find that no such hubbub was raised then as has been raised since this Bill was introduced and that the criticism offered on this Bill was not offered then.  That Article gave a new definition of treason if I may so, and it certainly gave it a new relation.  To get away definitely from what might have been in people's minds in this country &mdash;the old definition, the definition I think in which Deputy Cogan seems to have got involved&mdash;when treason in this country was regarded as a virtue, I want to say that this is entirely a new definition.  It is a definition that applies for the first time clearly to this State and to this State alone.  One of the points that have been most emphasised here was the point with regard to this definition of &ldquo;levying war&rdquo;.  I am somewhat surprised&mdash;I do not want now to talk of the slave mind or something of the kind&mdash;why we always have to concentrate on what is the definition in another State, a State in which high treason is there described and in terms which had been enforced against the people of this country in times gone by.  I would have been more interested if when we talk about definitions we would talk about other States and definitions that might arise there.</P>

When the Deputy talks about &ldquo;archaic terms&rdquo; he knows that in 1878, the British Government, anxious to remove the anomalies that existed in the criminal code, appointed Sir James Stephens, who was known as one of the greatest criminal lawyers of his time, on a judicial committee.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not my recollection. &ldquo;Levying war&rdquo; is a phrase that is in the Constitution.  The Taoiseach or any Minister dealing with the Bill would be anxious, so far as possible, to meet the Deputy's views if he had any doubt that there was anything dangerous in that particular phrase or that it might be used or abused in a way that was not intended by the Legislature.  I suggest to the House that in interpreting this Bill, when it becomes an Act, what the judges will have to fall back on is that Article of the Constitution.  They will not look for a decision outside.  If we want to introduce into this Bill some provision for altering the phrasing of that Article of the Constitution, then this Bill would be in conflict with the Constitution.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney appreciates that as well as anybody in this House.  When the Constitution was being enacted perhaps was the time when the Deputy might have dealt with this question of &ldquo;levying war&rdquo;.  We will have to rely on the common sense of the judges here to interpret it in the common sense way. The Deputy knows how words were strained in some old English decisions. He knows of the famous Judge Jeffreys Hallam commenting that words could be made to lose their ordinary meaning. Some judges then strained the ordinary meaning of words.  We rely here on the judges' common-sense as judges of this State, interpreting this Bill in a plain, common-sense way.  So far as levying war is concerned, the Deputy could have got an amendment &mdash;I know it is not in order to refer to it now&mdash;but he could have framed an amendment when that Bill was here for discussion in this House in some such way as this:&mdash;&ldquo;That the act which constituted treason, where it consisted only of (a), (b), (c), (d), and so on, could be punished by a lesser penalty than death.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I beg the Deputy's pardon.  I say there again that there were difficulties.  We have considered this and considered it carefully.  We feel that we would be taking an unreasonable risk in making amendments along those lines as well as feeling that they were unnecessary.  The Deputy complained that an amendment dealing, for example, with the doctors was not accepted.  There, again, one has to rely on the ordinary common sense of the judges and juries to deal with it. But putting in an exception such as leaving out the doctor in the course of his duty comforting a person engaged in treason might be construed afterwards in some other case in a way that was not considered at the time the Act was passed.  It might be made out that those others were intended to be dealt with as&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can put it anyway he likes in that sense.  I could talk on a number of exceptions that could be made.  I do not think that any jury or judge would, for example, convict the mother who harbours her son in certain circumstances or would convict other people who are related in some capacity of that sort. There was no mention of the clergy. To put an exception like that in would show that we were not a civilised country at all, that we were living in a barbaric age.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason we have not made these exceptions is simply and solely because we feel that other cases might arise which would happen in the future and for which provision had not now been made; it would call the attention of the judges or the juries who were dealing with it that these were deliberately left out.  In all this matter we have to rely on the common sense of our courts to deal with it. <Col N="432" /> You have the position that, first of all, the Attorney-General must indict any person who is guilty of treason or misprision of treason.</P>
      <P>Nobody of common sense would say that any common-sense Attorney-General is going to indict for treason a person who is guilty of cattle driving or something of that sort.  You have a judge and jury trying cases arising under this Bill, and I think it would be an unfair strain to put on a judge that in certain circumstances he should have to decide whether in a particular case the extreme penalty or a lesser penalty should be imposed.  We will have here an Executive responsible to the people, which has the power of mitigation, the power of remission or otherwise of any sentence which may be imposed, and I think that, being in touch with the people and knowing the circumstances in which those offences may be committed, they will be in a much better position to deal with the matter than if it were left in the hands of the judge, of having to say whether in certain circumstances the death penalty or a lesser penalty should be imposed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton talks about the necessity for the Bill at this time.  It was pointed out by the Taoiseach in introducing this Bill that provision was made in the Constitution for such a Bill.  The offence was defined there, and all that is being done now under this Bill is that we are stating what is the punishment for the offence which was at that time defined.  It is implementing the Constitution.  Instructions were given for its preparation when the Constitution was enacted by the people.  It is not brought in here in any hasty manner.  Deputies had been informed of it already.  I stated on another Bill that anything being done here is not being done either by suggestion or dictation from outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Deputy Cogan's remarks, I am not in a position to translate most of what he has been trying to put before the House, but I certainly cannot follow the argument that it seems to be all right to kill people in the name of treason, but it is a different thing if somebody commits <Col N="433" /> murder in some other way not related to treason.  That is not an argument that I can follow.  It is an argument that is based on the outlook of somebody who does not understand what the position here is.  It is the argument of somebody who does not realise that there is a Constitution here made by the Irish people themselves.  I think if the Deputy could get that idea into <Col N="434" /> his mind or if somebody could help him to get it into his mind, he would not be putting forward those ridiculous arguments&mdash;if one may give them a higher description than they deserve by calling them arguments&mdash;which he has been putting forward here in this House.</P>

      <P>When the debate was interrupted, I was speaking on the question of hospitals.  I should like to say that from my experience of the hospitalisation of the City of Cork at the moment there does seem to be a lack of co-ordination in the Department. Bearing in mind that there are something like four hospitals to be built in Cork at a very big expenditure, we feel that there is great need of having some executive authority within the Department to deal with hospitals. For the past two or three years we have been acquiring sites and looking for the sanction of the Department for these sites.  Then somebody else comes along and condemns the site selected, with the result that we are still without the two hospitals which we feel should have been started in Cork within the past two years.  Personally I believe, seeing that the Department have the spending of anything up to £8,000,000, that they should have architects of their own, working from the Department, to plan hospitals for the respective areas.  We also feel that in planning these hospitals architects are sometimes inclined to go in for very elaborate plans and for expensive hospitals.  In Cork, where we have had two architects to plan a hospital, our experience is that architects are inclined to plan hospitals on a most extensive scale.  They do not always consider the cost of maintaining these hospitals afterwards, a matter to which Deputy Dillon referred, so that there is great need for some responsible officer in the Department or for some section dealing with hospitalisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have discussed the matter of the hospitals in Cork with the Minister and I would suggest to him that it is necessary to have some responsible officer in the Department to plan hospitals and also that in planning hospitals there should be more consultation with the local authority.  We have suggested to the Department on a few occasions that when officers of the Department come to Cork to deal with plans, they should consult with the local authorities.  I am now repeating <Col N="436" /> that suggestion.  When architects or officers of the Department go to local areas we would expect them to get into closer contact with members of the board or with executive officers of the board before returning to Dublin and coming to a decision.</P>
    <P>I have in mind a matter dealing with a hospital in the City of Cork, where a certain thing was decided upon and the building completed.  A suggestion was then put up for another hospital, and we had a letter from the Department stating that there should be a central building to cover the requirements of the South Cork area. That was done without consultation with the board of health or with the officials responsible.  I feel that there is great need to have some man with executive authority to deal with the hospitalisation of the country.  In connection with relief grants, we have from time to time been given large sums for such work and, in addition, we supplemented it by money from the rates.  As it looks as if these demands will be recurring it is too much to be asking local authorities to subscribe the second time.  In the City of Cork we are paying 1/8 in the £ towards the unemployment relief fund.  When we got a grant of £38,000 we had to supplement it by raising £7,500 in rates, and the worst feature about the matter was that we were asked to expend that £45,000 on roads and footpaths.  I maintain that a local authority, such as Cork Corporation, has many more pressing problems than the making of roads and footpaths.  For instance, as a water reservoir and sewerage work are badly needed, the members of a local authority should have some say as to how money could be spent to the best advantage.  I know that the Department is anxious that the money should be spent in a way that would give the greatest amount of employment, but I consider that the making of a reservoir and the improvement of the sewerage of the city, which has been planned for years, and which is likely to cost £500,000, is the class of work upon which the £45,000 should be spent, and that it should not be confined to the making of roads.  I wish that the Department would reconsider its attitude in that respect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="437" /> The Minister, and also Deputy Dillon, referred to the question of housing.  I am not going to minimise what has been done by the Department about housing since 1932, but unfortunately in Cork we are held up for the last four or five months by lack of money.  We asked for money at 4 per cent., but because of certain circumstances we were unable to get the amount we required.  We have asked the Minister to meet a deputation in order to discuss the best means of getting out of the difficulty, but we have not yet got the opportunity of doing so.  We have acquired land, plans are prepared and the men are ready to commence work, but the fact is that schemes of work are held up for want of money.  I am afraid that this Government or any other Government will only govern normally as long as they can be dictated to by those who control the money.  I impress upon the Government of the day that until we face up to the reality of that situation we will have the housing problem with us for many years.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Rourke called attention to a case where a number of cottages were built by a board of health in corners of fields.  I agree with the Deputy's views.  It is wrong that that should be done.  On Sunday last I saw eight cottages crowded into a field in the midst of open country, where plenty of latitude could be given. It is an awful thing in 1939 to build eight or ten cottages on an acre of land in an outlying area of the country. These cottages should have been put in different parts and an acre of land should be attached to each one. Having to deal with social services in the City of Cork, I consider there is a great lack of co-ordination in the Department. I feel that there is a need for two Ministers, one to concern himself with social services and the other with the administration of local government. It is impossible, in view of the growth of our social services, for one <Col N="438" /> Minister to deal with all of them. Having gone to the Department from time to time, I must say this of the officials: that I always met with courtesy there, and that the Minister was always inclined to be helpful.  At the same time, I feel that there is not co-ordination in the Department, because if you go to one part you are sent some place else, while from correspondence that comes before public boards it is apparent there is not co-ordination.  I do not want to elaborate that point, but I should like to see the executive officials in the different sections getting together and having some helpful suggestions for the Minister with a view to co-ordination of the various services.  I do not want to see sections dealing with home help, old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, child welfare and other matters overlapping, because that would mean waste.</P>
      <P>As far as organisation goes, I am sure the Minister must have had experience of the fact that something is lacking, when we have so many decisions about plans and specifications of buildings.  I have in mind two cases that occurred in Cork, where the provision of hospitals is under way since 1932.  The sites were acquired, paid for and then scrapped.  That was a clear indication that there is no co-ordination in the Department, and, for that reason, I suggest that it would be advisable to have one Minister dealing with social services, and another Minister concerning himself with the other side of the public health services. As far as Cork is concerned, the fact is that we have an appalling housing situation there.  We have over 3,000 applications for houses.  Some of these people are homeless.  Others are living in rooms and hovels that have been condemned by dispensary doctors, who have asked me if something could not be done to remedy the position.</P>

I am not suggesting that any Government could be expected to remedy the position at once, but the problem is there, and we should not be afraid to face up to it.  As Deputy Dillon pointed out, there is a fearful danger in such poverty.  The men are there to do the work, the materials are there, and the ground prepared, but the schemes cannot be gone on with, because a group of people control the money.  That matter should be looked into.</P>

      <P>In a Vote such as this, there are many subjects which might be touched upon, but I merely wish to refer to the housing question.  The housing question is many-sided and it requires a certain amount of knowledge, in approaching it, to see that people do not make suggestions which, in the light of future experience, turn out to be absurd.  It is only a short time ago that we were told there were not sufficient building operatives to go round and that certain classes of building in the city would have to stop in order that housing for the working classes might go on.  The present situation in the city, as I understand it, is that there are nearly 4,000 operatives out of employment. There are somewhere about 3,000 on the live register, and a number who have fallen out of benefit and who are not on the register at the moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly, I am.  However, the point I wish to make is that while housing is a tremendous problem <Col N="440" /> and everybody will agree that the housing of the working classes is most important, the problem requires to be divided into sections in order that we may get a correct perspective.  You have the problem of housing for the working classes which the corporation are doing their best to solve and you have the wealthier classes who can get houses put up as they require them and pay for them.  Between those two classes of the community, there is an enormous field for houses for people who cannot put up the money for a house.  They require help of some sort.</P>
      <P>I remember saying on a Vote here some time ago that anybody in the City of Dublin who put up a cottage or a palace was contributing to the solution of the problem because it moved people up.  I want to enlarge on that, and, to prove that, I would cite the position here as against the position across the water in respect of houses.  Houses here which are put up for the working classes are roughly 40 per cent. dearer than similar houses across the water, but there is an intermediate type of house, namely, pre-war or basement house.  It has played its temporary part in this city in providing a shelter for the people who had nowhere else to go, and as a proof of how vitally important that was and how great the scarcity was here, I think that most experts on the value of houses would agree that while the house just put up here is 40 per cent. dearer than a similar house across the water, the pre-war house with a basement is twice as dear.  What does that prove?  It proves that while the house here has more than held its value, due to an artificial shortage, because of the operation of the law of supply and demand, the less useful house across the water has slumped.  I think the Minister should be able to read the signs aright and to see that that means that every kind of shelter that can be used temporarily will be pressed into service and that when houses, no matter of what kind or description, are put up, people move up and others move into them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all familiar with what has happened in this city in certain parts of the north side, where houses were occupied by the nobility in one generation, <Col N="441" /> by the middle classes in the next and by a humbler set of citizens later on.  I am not advocating that as the ideal solution, but it is ideal compared with either leaving people in the street or leaving them in insanitary basement houses.  That being so, one would have thought that the Minister and the Government would have concentrated their attention on housing in the City of Dublin.  I am not going to accuse the Minister of having a spite against the City of Dublin, or against the builders here, but certainly he has dissembled his love for them with great care.  There is no money available under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, and, so far as other grants are concerned, I think they have been withdrawn from the City of Dublin, although they are continued in the country districts and given to approved societies, although they are not given to the builders who put up these houses. I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that the Minister is as keen as anybody else to see houses built, but I should like to suggest to him that some means must be found to assist the people who cannot purchase their own houses.  I understand that there is legislation promised for the autumn, but by the time the autumn arrives and the trade are able to digest that legislation, a year will have gone by, and I do not think that anybody could say but that the signs of the impasse that was arising have been apparent for many months, if not for some years.</P>
    <P>I am not going to talk about the relief of unemployment on this Vote, but it seems to leak into this question of houses.  I understand it has always vexed the Government, in making unemployment grants, to find the type of grant which would have an enormous amount of unskilled labour in it and yet give some return to the community. I think that has pressed the Government so hard that, at times, one could recognise the job on which relief was given by the way it was worked.  I am not reproaching the Government for that.</P>
    <P>I am suggesting, however, that they do not take a wide enough view: that there are some cases where, probably, the content of other labour is possibly high compared with what they would <Col N="442" /> like.  At the same time, there is a very great difference between unemployment relief that will give a return to the community and pay for itself and what is merely a drag on the pockets of those who provide the money.  From that point of view, I should like to reinforce what has been often put up to the Minister, namely, that a certain amount of consideration should be given to some way in which the gap, between what people can provide and the paying for their houses, could be bridged over.</P>
    <P>I think the experience of the corporation, where they advanced money under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act, was that in a few, a very few, cases&mdash;and I think they involved two coincidences, namely, that the house had been badly built and the tenant insolvent&mdash;the corporation were stuck with a small amount of money; but that amount of money was infinitesimal when it was spread over the millions that it enabled to be handed out and the houses it enabled to be peopled.  Now, I do not know where the working class ends and the middle class begins, but there is no doubt about it: there are many people scrambling for houses for the working classes, who can quite legitimately contend that they are workers and belong to the working class, who, given an opportunity to purchase a house, would, with assistance, enter into the other ranks and so relieve the pressure on the ranks of their poorer-paid brethren in the working classes.</P>
    <P>I would like to appeal to the Minister to make an effort at the earliest possible moment to solve this housing question in a broad and generous spirit.  Of course, there is no doubt that funds will have to be provided. At the same time, it is to bridge a gap. It is not a question of providing the whole sum of money.  I would like to suggest to the Minister that that can be done, and that, if there were losses &mdash;and, like everything else, I suppose there would be losses&mdash;they would be infinitesimal compared with the number of houses that would be built, the employment that would be given, and the numbers, who are seeking houses, that would be taken out of the ranks and who are at present really scrambling <Col N="443" /> for corporation houses.  I would urge on the Minister to go on with his Bill and produce it at the earliest possible moment because, as far as I can see, if the Bill is produced in the autumn, it will take the trade another six months; the winter will be coming along and they are not going to start cutting foundations in the winter, and it will take a 12-month, as we look at it, before any real attempt will be made to face this question.</P>

      <P>It is not my intention to take up the time of the House for a very long period.  I deeply regret that I was not present for the Minister's speech when he was introducing this Estimate, because I was intensely interested to know what were the most recent views of the Minister on the operation of the voluntary hospitals system in Dublin.  It seems to be the practice that, when Ministers are introducing their Estimates, or the Estimates of their respective Departments, and reviewing the Ministerial sphere of activities of the preceding year, they don the rose-tinted spectacles, and always report progress, and practically never refer to any slight retrogression in the Department. I am satisfied, however, from the views which the Minister for Local Government and Public Health has expressed in recent months in the Press, in relation to the hospitals system, that he takes a very realistic view of matters, and that he sees things in their true perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operation of this system in the City of Dublin, in so far as it concerns the provision of beds for the working classes and the sick poor, is most unsatisfactory.  Now, that is the case in spite of the fact that there is a continuous upward trend in maintenance charges and in expenditure generally. I am not one of that magic circle of medicos who so magnanimously and so gratuitously staff the voluntary hospitals in Dublin.  I am only an ordinary general practitioner, practising for a working class district, and I repeat that the provision of beds in the voluntary hospitals for the working classes and the sick poor is as bad now as it was five years ago.  In connection <Col N="444" /> with this matter, there is a paragraph from the recent Report of the Hospitals Commission, which I should like to read.  It is only a short paragraph, and it is on page 4 of the report.  The heading is &ldquo;Hospital Development during 1937,&rdquo; and it reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There has been considerable activity during the year in an effort to find a satisfactory solution of the Dublin general hospital problem. The Commission's recommendations (<i>vide</i> First General Report) envisaged transferring the responsibility for the hospital treatment of all acute cases in the Dublin area from the Board of Assistance to the voluntary hospitals, or alternatively the erection of a municipal hospital. The adoption of the former requires certain essential safeguards to ensure that the statutory obligations of the Board of Assistance to provide hospital treatment for all poor persons within its jurisdiction will be adequately discharged by the voluntary hospitals, in so far as the type of case ordinarily treated in general hospitals is concerned; namely, acute illness.  The Commission has recommended that these safeguards can be provided by, firstly, suitable agreements between the voluntary hospitals and the local authorities concerned, and secondly, the provision of a Hospital Information Bureau, which would facilitate as ready admission to the wards of the voluntary hospitals as would exist in the case of a municipal hospital directly under the control of the local authority.  Negotiations are in progress between the Minister and the chief interests concerned, to ascertain how far the voluntary hospitals can discharge the local authorities' responsibilities in respect of the type of sick poor referred to.  The ultimate outcome of these efforts to find a satisfactory solution to the problem will have an important bearing on the general hospital development in the Dublin area.  It is much to be desired that both the voluntary hospitals and the local authorities will recognise fully the complementary part they each play in the hospital sphere and, acting in this <Col N="445" /> spirit, will develop a hospital scheme which will be rational, economic and mutually satisfactory.</P>
    <P>In connection with that statement, so far as I know, no satisfactory arrangement as yet has been arrived at for the establishment of such a general hospital scheme.  I should like, in the event of a satisfactory conclusion not being arrived at, following the negotiations between the Minister's Department and the interested parties, if the Minister would indicate whether or not he would be prepared to take immediate steps to establish a State or municipal hospital.</P>
    <P>I do not want to dwell too much on this matter of the unsatisfactory provision of beds, but there really is not equality of opportunity with regard to rich patients and poor patients.  There is only the type of opportunity which Anatole France referred to when he said that millionaires and hawkers alike were forbidden by law to sleep under the bridges in Paris.</P>
    <P>There is another point which I would like to make: it is in connection with public health, and has relation to school children.  So far as I am aware, there is not included in the curricula in the primary schools the teaching of physical culture.  I do not want to be misunderstood in this matter.  I am not suggesting that this subject of physical culture should be taught by the primary teachers.  I suggest that the Minister might very usefully experiment by employing a small number of physical culture specialists who would work under the supervision of the school medical inspectors.  I believe that would be a step in the right direction, and would tremendously improve the standard of health of our school children.</P>
    <P>There is one further point I wish to raise.  I note with regret that, so far, the Minister has not taken serious notice of the claims of the nursing profession for the establishment of a pension fund.  I am sure that nobody better than the Minister realises the tremendously valuable work done by the members of that profession.  They are not overpaid and, surely, they should be able to look forward to the retiring <Col N="446" /> years of their lives with the prospect of a little frugal comfort.  I trust the Minister will find time to deal with the few points I have made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>My criticism on this Estimate will be as helpful as I can possibly make it, but there are some complaints which I have to submit. We have here a huge Estimate, which has increased from £481,000 in 1931 to £1,349,000 at the present day.  In dealing with the matter of housing, so far as I am aware of the activities of the Housing Department under the Minister's control, I must say they are doing their work very well.  Throughout the country, however, there are complaints being made to local authorities, such as boards of health.  I must say that there are not very many of these complaints.  They are to the effect that the houses are not erected as they ought to be erected, and a good deal of the money expended is really wasted.  The houses that are expected to stand up according to their specifications are not as well built as they might be.  I have heard of several complaints made to boards of health.  I am very pleased to say that it is not often we hear those complaints, but there should not be a case of that sort at all.</P>
      <P>I do not blame the Minister or his Department.  I believe the local authorities are not exercising their supervision over the men who should see that these houses are properly constructed. There are many men appointed as clerks of works and I may state, for the Minister's benefit, that these men were appointed for political reasons and because of their political affiliations.  That is why these men were appointed by boards of health and, in the majority of cases, they have no experience of the work they are asked to do.  I think the Minister should see to it that the inspectors from his Department should make sure that if these men are not fit to carry out their work they should be dismissed at once from the service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister and his Department are doing their best to get good work done.  It is quite possible that the Government went too fast with their housing policy and that they did not give it sufficient consideration.  I am one of those who will say that it did go too fast and, if it got more consideration, and if the building programme was more prolonged, you would have had much better building done throughout the country and you would have helped the people who were in bad houses much more.  There was one particular phase of it when everyone was shouting for new houses.  If we go back 15 years and think of what the Congested Districts Board did in areas even adjacent to towns, we can better realise what <Col N="448" /> could be done.  I am sure we all remember the small thatched houses, and they were very nice houses.  The Congested Districts Board, in years gone by, where a house could be made habitable for £30, would spend that money on increasing the window space, renewing the thatch on the roof, raising the floors, and putting in new doors.  That made them very nice houses.  What we have done to-day is knocked all those houses down to about six feet and now they are the dumping ground for the refuse of the towns to which they are adjacent.  I thought when those small houses were knocked down that the board of health would at once build on them.  Most of them have small gardens attached and I know that in several areas the small gardens are much more suitable for working men living close to towns than an acre of ground.  They can attend to the small garden.  It is all right to say that every man is entitled to an acre of ground.  I would say the agricultural labourer, who is continually engaged in agriculture and who lives away from a town, who has more or less his own time, is entitled to an acre of ground.  I would say the man in the town is entitled to it, if he could work it, but he is not able to work it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The man who lives adjacent to a town, let him be working on a building scheme or a carpenter, whatever he may be, has to work from eight in the morning until six o'clock in the evening, and by the time he is finished at six in the evening he is not fit to work an acre of ground.  I think the plots should be made smaller.  I think it was Deputy Hickey who said they were too small in Cork.  What I find about the small towns in the West of Ireland is that an acre of ground is too much and I would be glad if the Minister could see his way to suggest to the board of health to make the plots smaller.  Reports are heard that there is a shortage of land and that land is too dear.  If you gave a half acre of ground instead of the acre you would find that the town workers who live within a mile or a mile and a half of a town will be very satisfied to get a cottage with that amount of land. I know houses in my own district adjacent <Col N="449" /> to towns which were built within the last two years and I feel that the acre of ground attached to those houses will never be tilled.  Therefore, I would ask the Minister, in considering other schemes, to substitute the half acre.  Then it would be possible to get land.</P>
    <P>There is another drawback which I see down the country in regard to the purchase of land for labourers' cottages.  You will get land adjacent to the towns which carries a much higher valuation than land out in the country.  You will get land near towns, what they call &ldquo;cow parks&rdquo; and so forth, and the board of health are anxious to acquire them for cottages. These lands usually carry from £1 to £1 10s. valuation per acre.  The price of that acre of land is £50.  Three miles further out, in the country, you will find that the same or worse type of land carrying 2/- or 3/- per acre valuation, gets the same price.  I think it is most unfair that the same price should rule.</P>
    <P>We also learn that the Minister has refused sanction for a loan to erect 300 extra cottages in County Galway. At least, I have seen it on the paper. He gave a sound reason, I admit&mdash;that the whole matter will have to be investigated by the county medical officer of health and the local engineers. That is quite right.  But that survey was made some years ago and my point is that we have not the number of houses in County Galway that that survey carried with it.  If we had, I would agree with the Minister in having another survey.  Certainly, there is one thing that has happened in Galway; in places where cottages were not needed at all they have been erected and there are other places that are really slums where you have, in a country district, miles away from the town, eight houses all in a line.</P>
    <P>There was no work for the ordinary labourers there.  They were without means of livelihood.  They took them over.  They have little shops in them. while there are people with motor-cars and so forth getting a house at half-a-crown a week.  That has happened down there.  Without a survey at all. I think the county medical officer of <Col N="450" /> health has gone through the county often enough and should be able to give the Minister sufficient information as to the number of houses still required there.</P>
    <P>In all my criticism I would like to be helpful and, as far as I can see, in most areas the houses have been well built, but in some instances you have people appointed as clerks of works who do not know their job, and there is not sufficient supervision in some areas.  In the urban area of Galway you will find 19 houses half-built, and neither the Galway Corporation nor anyone else knows who has got to complete them.  I would say that the corporation were not responsible for the position.  It was the urban council of two years ago that was responsible for it.  The houses are there and most of them are roofed, but they are all boarded up by the corporation.  There is neither water nor sewage schemes connected to them.  No one knows who is to finish them.</P>
    <P>In connection with engineering in Galway, which I brought to the notice of the Minister before, I learn now that some co-ordination scheme is about to come into operation down there.  All I am sorry for is that some attempt was not made long before this, because a number of Deputies here know that, not alone is there overlapping in the Department but there is also overlapping in the local offices, just the same as you have a man doing road work in one area and another man coming over that same road work and building houses, under the board of health.  I learn now that the Department are anxious to have one county surveyor there with one engineer in charges of the board of health work, and two chief assistant surveyors.  All I hope is that they will put the scheme into operation as soon as they possibly can.</P>
    <P>On the question of roads, I find, going through the country, that there is no standard at all for any of the counties.  I would be glad if the Roads Department could see their way to have a standard for the main roads. There are some counties where the roads cost £1,600 a mile, and then you run into a county where the cost of <Col N="451" /> the roads is £500 a mile, where the surface is bad and where you are not safe at all in travelling on them.  It is only recently, I think, that engineers have got really some system.  In some counties you will see saddle-backed roads and in other counties they are pretty flat.  I would ask the Minister, where so much money is being spent, that there should be at least a standard specification for all main roads.  There is no use in one county expending, say, £40,000 or £50,000 on its roads and looking for grants every other day and another county spending, say, £20,000, and, by some means or other, showing that they have a register of unemployed of so many and must get increased moneys.  I think the Minister or the Roads Department should go as far as they possibly can in connection with the standardising of the roads.</P>
    <P>I think also that we should expend something more on the district roads. There is plenty of work to be done on them.  There is a good deal of work being done on the main roads in straightening them out and taking off corners and I must say it is very useful work and it is being very well done. In the west, great attention is being paid to it, and the only drawback I see is that we have not given enough attention to the district roads.</P>
    <P>With regard to tourist development and tourist routes, it will be found, I think, that the Irish Tourist Association and the county surveyors seem to be directing their minds to the one end. The ratepayers in the County Galway are contributing something like £1,000 a year to Irish tourist development, but so far as I can observe no attempt is being made by the Department, which gives grants, or by any other authority to see that new beauty spots and places of historic interest off the usual routes are developed as they ought to be, and brought to the notice of tourists. All tourists seem to make for the one end&mdash;Killarney, West Cork, Donegal, etc.</P>
    <P>This Estimate deals with the provision of sanatoriums.  About 17 years ago a site for a santorium was selected in the County Galway, at Woodlands, which is beside the sea.  The site was <Col N="452" /> condemned by the local people, but the Department and the county medical officer of health had to get their way. Thousands of pounds were spent on that particular site.  Within the last four or five years the site at Woodlands was found not to be suitable.  I am sorry that the Chairman of the Galway Board of Health is not here to hear me out on this.  On the recommendation of the Department's engineer and of the county medical officer of health another site was selected at Kilcolgan on which additional thousands of pounds were spent.  I do not know what has happened in connection with this site.  Perhaps the county medical officer of health disliked having to go out so far from Galway City.  At any rate, a request has come from the Department of Local Government to look for another site and dispose of Kilcolgan.</P>
    <P>That is the position in the County Galway with regard to the selection of a site for a sanatorium.  Two sites on which thousands of pounds have been spent have been turned down.  That is not fair to the board of health.  I do not know whether he meant it by way of joke or not, but in connection with Kilcolgan the secretary to the board of health said : &ldquo;The only thing you can do with it now is to sell it as a dance hall.&rdquo;  The Department should not be a party to the waste of public money in that fashion.  They should send down inspectors who know their work and get them to select a suitable site, and not have the ratepayers' money wasted, as it has been, on these two sites.</P>
    <P>I now wish to deal with the question of contracts for free milk down the country.  I propose to refer to a number of documents which I can let the Minister have if he wants to see them. I have tenders here for the supply of free milk for 1938 and 1939.  The tenders for 1938 went before the home assistance committee.  It accepted a tender for free milk to a particular district.  I may say that two tenders were received, both proposing to supply milk at the same price.  Both were sent on to the Department, and the Department, quite rightly I admit, recommended that the contract be given to the former supplier who owned a number of cows.  That was all <Col N="453" /> right.  Where the snag comes in is this: that the home assistance officer went to the other man whose tender was accepted by the local body and said &ldquo;You can supply from October to March at the same price as the man who is supplying from March to October.&rdquo;  What happened in 1939? Two tenders were received, one at 1/4 a gallon and the other at 1/3½ a gallon. The premises of the two people tendering complied in every respect with the requirements of the Cowsheds and Dairies Order.  Both were inspected and approved by the Department's inspector, the county surveyor and the veterinary surgeon for the area.  The person who tendered at 1/3½ received this notification, dated the 18th March, 1939: &ldquo;I beg to inform you that the county homes assistance committee accepted at their meeting on the 18th inst., your tender for the supply of milk&rdquo;&mdash;in so-and-so area&mdash;&ldquo;for the year commencing the 1st of April, 1939, subject to the approval of the Local Government Department.&rdquo;  The secretary wrote to say that he had forwarded a list of the tenders received to the Department.  A reply was received from the Department stating: &ldquo;Tenders approved in accordance with list of contractors accepted&rdquo;&mdash;at so-and-so for so-and-so place&mdash;&ldquo;which accompanied the above-mentioned letter.  The Department is in communication with the county medical officer of health in regard to the tenders received for the supply of milk&rdquo;&mdash;to such-and-such a place&mdash;&ldquo;and a further letter will be addressed to you in due course.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That refers to the tender accepted by the local committee, the members of which knew the two people who tendered.  They knew that one was tendering at ½d. a gallon less than the other, and knew them the year before. Yet the Minister's Department thought fit to send down the tenders to the county medical officer of health.  I would like to know what was at the back of that, especially in view of the fact that the two people tendering had complied with all the requirements of the Cowsheds and Dairies Order.  I do not think it was fair of the Department to do that.  It is certainly not fair to public boards.  It was not fair <Col N="454" /> to the board in this case which accepted a tender from a man who was prepared to supply milk at a lower price than the other.  I do not think it is fair to have public boards treated in that manner.  If the Minister wants to see these documents he can have them.</P>
    <P>Some Deputy, speaking earlier, referred to the amount of work that now falls on boards of health to do.  I submit that it is impossible for a board of health to get through all its work by meeting on one Saturday in the month.  Quite a number of Deputies are members of boards of health.  I am acquainted with one board of health, and I can say that before Christmas it actually had to meet on three Saturdays in succession in order to dispose of the agenda that was put before it.  Men cannot continue to do that.  The day will come when the business will be done in a slipshod way. Some of the duties should be taken off these boards.  There is too much work piled on to them at present.  Some means will have to be taken to relieve them of some of that work.</P>

      <P>Something will have to be done.  There are, for instance, the free meals schemes.  Urban councils and town commissioners administer these schemes in their own areas.  The boards of health also have to administer them. How can these boards administer these schemes properly?  I say they cannot. The Minister should consider some means by which the work would be made easier for them, so that they can do it in a thorough fashion.  Unless that is done something will turn up some day for which we will all be very sorry, because the work cannot continue to be done in the way in which it is done at present.  In small towns with a population of from 600 to 1,000, which have not town commissioners, there should be some kind of small committees set up which would be of help to the boards of health.  By having recommendations made to them by these committees, the work would probably be made easier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the work of the Department generally, as I said in the beginning, <Col N="455" /> I criticise the Department but I wish to be helpful.  As regards their housing policy, I can say from what I know of housing that they have done very well.  It is quite possible that we may have gone a little too fast.  If we had gone a little slower we might possibly have got better work done.  However, it had to be done.  There were a number of houses to be built each year and we have had them built.  I hope the Minister will see his way to continue to help local authorities and, where he has refused to sanction a loan, I hope that a survey will be made at as early a date as possible, because I know that local authorities are anxious to build more cottages.  There are some places certainly where they are needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is gratifying to hear the appreciation from all sides of the House for the work done by the Department of Local Government and for the progress made by the various sections of the Department.  That is only as it should be.  No Department of State enters more intimately into the lives of the citizens than the Department of Local Government.  There are a few points on which I am anxious to express an opinion.  I do not approve, for instance, of the wholesale centralisation of hospitals.  Like Deputy Morrissey, I believe that there should be hospitals left in certain districts to accommodate certain types of cases which do not really require expert medical treatment and where certain patients can find a place of rest until they get back their health.</P>
      <P>Of course I may be met by the argument that, with modern transport, up-to-date ambulances, etc., distance is of no account these days.  To a certain extent that is true.  But for the man who cannot afford to travel by means of modern transport, 20 miles is as long a distance as it was 20 years ago.  The man who has to travel in a donkey cart, or who has to walk, will take just as long to cover the distance. These are the people for whom we should cater.  It is on their behalf that I ask the Minister to retain the local cottage hospitals throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Coming to the question of county <Col N="456" /> homes, I come from a constituency in which the county home system was abolished in 1930 or 1931.  Having personal knowledge of the change for the better that has taken place, I recommend the Minister to think out a scheme for transferring the inmates in all the other county homes in the country to institutions similar to the one in North Cork.  One thing that the Irish people always took exception to was to be branded as paupers. Although I agree that the lot of the inmates in county homes has improved very much since the old workhouse days, still I hold that there is some taint of pauperism still attached to the people who have to reside in county homes.  I believe that very good humanitarian work would be done if these homes were abolished altogether and replaced by institutions where the inmates could be paid for by the local boards on a capitation basis&mdash;institutions controlled by a religious order like the one we have in North Cork.</P>
    <P>As to the maintenance of the main roads of the country, I might not go altogether as far as Deputy Broderick, but I ask the Minister to consider giving a substantially increased grant for the maintenance of county roads. There is a growing demand for that through the country and I believe there is justice in that demand.  I also ask the Minister to consider giving a substantially increased contribution to mental hospitals throughout the country.  We are all happy to know that the hospital programme of the Department has made considerable strides in the past few years.  One thing I personally disapprove of, in the rural towns at any rate, is the building of workers' houses in one block at one end of a town.  It is not fair to the workers, to the traders, or to the general public.  If, for instance, 40 houses are to be built in a rural town, I suggest that they should be built, if possible, in four different sections&mdash; one section at each point of the compass around the town.  I think that would be a better plan than bulking them all together.  Of course I understand that for engineering purposes it is easier to build them all together, and also from the point of view of the water supply and sanitation.  But, <Col N="457" /> after all, in building these houses we are catering for people who must work for a living and who, in order to get work, often have to travel a certain distance from their homes.  If you bulk them all together you are reducing the chance of all of them getting work in the district.</P>
    <P>As I said, I appreciate the progress that has been made with the Department's housing programme, but I am not fully satisfied that the local board in North Cork have gone as far as they could have gone in regard to the housing problem.  I do not want in any way to underestimate or belittle the amount of housing they have done, as they have carried out some housing schemes.</P>
    <P>There is one type of people for whom they have not catered yet.  I refer to a large number of workers in a certain number of towns and villages in the North Cork area.  In some of these towns and villages you have a real slum problem.  A certain number of people are living under very unsanitary conditions.  I need not impress that on the Minister, as he was good enough to inspect that area some years ago and see for himself the conditions under which the people live.  But I appeal to him to see that the local board puts its housing policy into force immediately so far as these towns are concerned.  To my mind, this board has not its heart in its work so far as the building of town houses for workers is concerned.  So far as I can gather, their chief objection is to taking compulsory powers to acquire the sites needed for these houses.  I have heard of an instance in which they proposed recently, in the case of a certain village in North Cork, to take compulsory powers to acquire a site.  Bordering on that village there are four fairly substantial farms with an acreage of 60 to 160, and one plot of five acres. It happened that within the past week the board's engineers, or some engineers, went out to inspect the sites and, of all places, they pitched on this site of five acres.  Worse than that, this plot of five acres is not at present in the possession of anybody, as the receivers of an unfortunate bankrupt are in charge of it, and the matter is in dispute.  My opinion is <Col N="458" /> that the inspection of this plot, with a view to acquiring it, is only a pretence, because they know very well there will be serious local objection to the acquisition of these five acres.</P>
    <P>I raised this matter last year, and I think the Minister should take his courage in his hands, and, if the boards of health in any area are not availing of the facilities provided for them under the Housing Acts, he should himself put somebody into the district who will do the job and house the unfortunate people.  That is the biggest fault I have to find with the work of the Department, or, in other words, with the neglect of the Department.  The board blames the Department, and the Department blames the board.  The Minister is master in his own house, and I appeal to him to put these housing schemes in operation in the coming year, and make provision for the workers of that area in North Cork.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention.  Under the Medical Charities Act, labourers are entitled to free medical treatment.  I do not know whether or not I am trespassing on forbidden ground, but I would like to suggest that the benefits of the Medical Charities Act should be extended to a type of people who are neither labourers nor people with an independent living.  I refer to people of the small farming type.  I suggest that the Minister should seriously consider extending the benefits of the Medical Charities Act to these people, as many of them, when they fall ill, suffer as no other section of the community suffers because of absence of medical treatment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this is a Vote which we should consider more in sorrow than in anger&mdash;sorrow, that a Department which touches the average man, as the last Deputy who spoke has said, more than any other Department of State, should be in such a position that it seems to be incapable of keeping up to date in matters appertaining to the local authorities.  I am perfectly sure there is not a member of a local authority in this House who is not aware of matters in his own neighbourhood which have been outstanding <Col N="459" /> with the Department for months&mdash;and years, in many cases.  In many of these cases, not only is the matter not dealt with, but letters sent by the local authority to the Department are not even acknowledged.</P>
      <P>I would I were an orator that I might lash the Minister with my tongue&mdash;not with a whip, which is his weapon&mdash;into some form of activity which would clear up the vast amount of arrears which must exist in his Department.  The Minister may say that he has more work than he has staff to deal with it.  If that be so, surely he himself is largely responsible because, by degrees, the autonomy of the local authorities is being taken from them.  Very soon, if things progress as they are progressing, the local authorities will not be allowed to sneeze without the Minister's permission.  If the Minister considers that the local authorities are not competent to carry out their duties in relation to many of the minor matters which now require his sanction, he should abolish them completely, centralise local government in the Department and have the responsibility fixed there exclusively. At present, the people blame their local authority for not doing this, that and the other thing, whereas, in fact, the local authority is not at fault at all but is hampered in its operations by the inaction of the Department of Local Government and Public Health.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon referred to the position of children in hospitals.  I want to refer to that matter from a different aspect and I think a worse aspect&mdash;that is, the question of children in mental hospitals.  So far as my knowledge goes, there is no institution in this country primarily designed for the care of children suffering from mental disease.  The consequence is that those children have to be kept in the mental hospitals with adults.  All the remarks that Deputy Dillon applied to the situation with regard to the ordinary hospital apply with tenfold force to the situation in regard to the mental hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another question with regard to mental patients which the Minister might well consider is that of more <Col N="460" /> segregation than is permissible at the moment so that the severe cases may be kept more apart from the milder and possibly less dangerous forms than they are at present.  Contact of this description has a bad effect on the milder forms.  Perhaps some such system could be devised as exists in Northern Ireland.  It is possible that if the Northern Ireland system were extended to this country it would be helpful and tend to a greater number of cures than we have at the present moment.</P>
    <P>The hospital position generally has been referred to by many speakers. One aspect of it that I would like to mention and one suggestion I would like to make is that the Minister should urge the speeding up of the decision with regard to the position in Dublin in this connection.  That question has been talked of for many years. Where the cause of the delay lies I do not know&mdash;whether with the hospitals or with the Department.  I am particularly interested in this matter of the hospitals because of its bearing on town planning.  The site of these hospitals must be a matter of great importance to the consultants who are preparing their town-planning scheme. A number of sites have been suggested some of which are suitable from one point of view and some from another point of view.  I do feel that this is a matter that should be speeded forward as quickly as possible so that the town-planning committee may be encouraged in going ahead quickly with their plans.</P>

      <P>Like a good many of the Deputies who have already spoken, I also wish to pay a tribute to the Minister for the good things done by his Department and for the work generally of the officials of the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  At the same time I have in my county many things to complain of, and I would like if the Minister could see his way to rectify, at as early a stage as possible, what is wrong.  My side of the House is denied representation on many important public bodies in the County Meath.  They are denied representation on the agricultural committee, on the library committee, <Col N="461" /> and on the hospitals committee.  It is only by statute that we were able to secure two members on the board of health.  At the present time, with the different schemes that are being put through and with the rates being increased from day to day, I think it is only fair that the farming community, whom we represent in this House, should have some say in the spending of these rates to which they are the principal contributors.  I think it is only fair, now that political passions have died out, that the Minister might see that we should get fair representation on those bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I think he could get the goodwill of his people down the country.  One of the principal things that confront us at the present time is the question of the building of houses. Many building schemes have been put through in the County Meath in the past four or five years and I am not at all satisfied with the way in which they have been carried out.  Now that we are embarking on a compulsory scheme in the coming year, I would ask the Minister definitely to keep an eye on Meath.  In the case of the schemes carried out in the past few years, I am aware that the foundations of some of the cottages were laid over two years ago but most of the contractors have gone burst, and the cottages are not yet finished.  In fact the people building the cottages in Meath now are the shopkeepers and they are going on with the building simply because they want to get some of their own back.  Their only hope of doing so is by completing the building of those houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should very definitely say that no <Col N="462" /> one should be allowed to build a cottage or to get a contract for a cottage but some decent well-qualified contractor and he should have some resources behind him.  It is not fair to see men without two pence in their pockets, with their bondsmen in the same position, getting contracts for building cottages.  They start building and continue until they get the first part of the grant for one house.</P>
    <P>With that money they hope to build the second cottage and with the grant for the second cottage they try to complete the first.  The whole thing is a laughing-stock.  I am satisfied that this should be remedied by insisting on giving contracts only to qualified contractors. The men who got contracts a few years ago built cottages that were a credit to them.  The cottages now being built will not last 20 years.  The occupiers of these cottages built less than a year or two ago have to provide themselves with buckets and tubs to keep the rain coming down from spilling all through the floors.  The people should have decent, healthy homes; otherwise there is the danger of sickness and ill-health owing to the bad condition of these cottages.  It is entirely wrong to start with a scheme of 500 or 600 cottages and to advertise then for contractors for the lot. Instead of that, the board of health should take what might be called a five-year plan.  I do not like to talk of a five-year plan because of its Russian associations but if the board of health decided on building, say, 200 cottages per year and advertise that number they would get tenders from contractors of some standing and things would run smoothly instead of being in the position they now are.</P>

      <P>I am, and my tongue is heard there as well as here, but I am dealing with wooden heads.  One of our most important things after cottage building is a sewerage scheme. This is an important item in our social life.  Any large town should have a good sewerage system.  We have carried out a good sewerage scheme and a rather expensive one. We put in that sewerage work and then we went around asking 400 or 500 of the residents of the town to connect up, but only 20 residents connected and the scheme is running idle.</P>

      <P>No, it is the wooden heads again.  Before these schemes were embarked on we should have taken a census of the people who were to take in the water, and then we could go on with it.  At the present moment the works, after costing from £10,000 to £15,000, are lying idle. That is unfair to the ratepayers, and there are very few ratepayers outside the town getting the benefit.  The scheme has mainly been paid for by the farmers, and that, too, is not fair.</P>

We fired out one secretary because she had not the right pull, and we gave her a pension of £400 a year for life.  That lady was fully qualified in every way, and was able to do the work of the board of health in a satisfactory way. We brought in a new secretary then at £400 a year.  We were told that he would be paid only £400 a year, but now he is getting 2½ per cent. on every cottage built.</P>

We were told that we were to economise, but instead of saving we are paying £450 to one person to stay at home and have a good old time, while to another person who was to get £400 a year we are paying £700 or £800.  In fact, we do not know what we are giving him, because the more cottages that are built the more he will get.  When the first secretary was there she had to pay her own staff, but now they can get in any officials they like, both permanent and temporary, to carry on the work there. We have engineers galore, assistant surveyors under the county council, going all over the county, and there is no reason why they should not be engineers to the board of health also. We have two sets of engineers getting big salaries.  I quite agree that they are efficient, but I think one set of engineers should cover the two schemes.  I am not at all satisfied with anything connected with the board of health in Meath.  It started on political lines, and has been going round in a vicious circle ever since&mdash;and that is taking place in a county which used to be the premier county in Ireland. Not alone was the Meath County Council a credit to Meath, but a credit to Ireland; at one time it was a credit to the United Kingdom.  Now we are in the unfortunate position that to-day we have a chairman who, although in his own way he is a decent man&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They are there, and the ratepayers are suffering for it.  In one area in my constituency, the Dun-shaughlin area, we took a census of the people who owed cottage rent.

In another area an unfortunate devil happened to fall off a tree; he was not working for his employer at the time, with the result that he never got a penny compensation, and he is paralysed to-day.</P>
      <P>That man owed, I think, £4 or £5. He has a wife and eight children.  He was thrown out on the side of the road, and was left to die in a shed for four or five days until the parish priest and the local people paid the arrears for him.  But those political partisans in Dunshaughlin, who owed £18 and are constantly on the road getting 35/- a week, are not interfered with.  They get off, but the other unfortunate devil is thrown out on the road.  That is a very grave injustice, and, whether it is the Minister's responsibility or not, I want to let this House know what is going on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have down there an item called &ldquo;cow plots.&rdquo;  We have about 15 to 18 of them in different parts of the country.  Those were originated for the purpose of giving grazing to the poor man's cow, but it seems that the day has gone when the poor man can put his cow on them, because on 90 per cent. of them we have the graziers' cattle.  There is neither supervision nor anything else, and it has been decided that we must get rid of those plots; <Col N="466" /> so I would ask the Minister to make provision as quickly as possible to get them out of our hands.  One of them owes £500, another £60, and another £100, and all the time the graziers' cattle are on the land; so in God's name I would ask the Minister to relieve us of that burden, and not to surcharge us with any of those debts, because they are not our fault.  Those are a few of the items to which I want to refer.  I think what we want is a permanent auditor down at Navan watching the flood of cars with surveyors and engineers going in there at the expense of the ratepayers, and giving us very little service.</P>

      <P>In connection with cottage building in my county, the ranches are being divided up and most of the people are applying to get cottages on the best part of the land. I think that is a mistake, because when those lands have been divided and new cottages built there will not be any employment.  The small uneconomic holders will get the land, and we will have chronic unemployment. In a few years we will have the crows building nests in those cottages.  I have already said here that even at the present moment, with a thousand people looking for cottages in County Meath, we cannot get anybody to take one cottage which we built last year and which has a nice plot, although we advertised it four or five times.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few matters to which I should like to refer on this Vote.  In the first place, I wish to give every credit to the Minister for the manner in which he has dealt with housing schemes throughout the country, but I have one grievance, and now is the time to ventilate it.  In 1934, representations were made to the Minister in connection with houses in the immediate vicinity of Cork City, which are outside the borough boundary.  The people living in this area are people who were unable, for one reason or another, to pay the rent of one room in the slums of Cork.  They were evicted out of the room and shifted into these shacks outside.  The county medical officer of health, when asked to report on the condition of the houses, stated that he would be afraid to put his dog to sleep in them.  The Minister has that report at present.  We had to wait until the county board of health was abolished and until we had three separate boards of health set up for the county before we were able to get this scheme through.  We did get it through.  At that time you could get a fairly good house built for about £300 to £350.  Those houses are now costing £460 each.  They are situated nearer to Cork City than the houses being built by the Cork Corporation, which are being built outside the borough boundary.  I should like the Dáil to bear in mind that those people were evicted because they were unable to pay rents of from 4/- to 5/- a week for one room in the city.  That is their financial position.  If the board of health now builds houses for them, the economic rent will be between 7/6 and 8/-, owing to this position&mdash;that the board of health will get only three-fifths of £300.  The Cork Corporation, who built further out than we are going to build these houses, got two-thirds of £400.  In plain language, the Cork Corporation <Col N="468" /> got £86 per house more than the board of health got.</P>
      <P>We now find the position that, after you might say five years of hard work, getting these schemes prepared, the tenants we put into these houses will be unable to pay the rent.  Repeated appeals have been made to the Minister in this matter and I think it is a matter that should engage his attention at once.  No legislation is needed to change the conditions; they can be changed by rule.  I do not care what statement Deputy Dillon may make, but in my opinion when you have 130 families living in hovels of that kind and when the conditions are such that the people cannot pay any rent for a considerable period, some drastic remedy is called for.  When they were summoned before the District Justice to recover arrears of rent, the District Justice went out to see these homes and refused to give a decree for, he said, any landlord who kept houses in that condition should not get rent for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>That was Judge O'Donnell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The houses are in such a condition that they would be unable to support a new roof and water is pouring down on the unfortunate occupants. If this country can afford £4,000 or £5,000 for a new gateway for the Phoenix Park, if it can afford to spend thousands of pounds on &ldquo;fallals&rdquo; of that description, surely to goodness, where 130 families are living in these conditions, their needs should come first.  I would not have brought this matter before the Dáil at all were it not that I have made repeated appeals on the subject.  The position at the moment is that unless this matter is rectified now, the scheme will fall through and these unfortunate families will remain in the hovels i have described.  I know the Minister has proved himself more than sympathetic in regard to housing for the poor and I am sure it only requires that this matter should be brought before him her to have it rectified. The time has arrived when you cannot continue the farce of pretending to build houses for the poor when the <Col N="469" /> poor cannot pay for them.  If you are going to build houses for that particular class of people, they must be built under such conditions that they will be able to pay rent for them. There is very little use in putting a man into a house if you have the board of health having to evict him two or three months afterwards.  I cannot imagine any way in which State money could be put to better use than by providing decent dwellings for these people.</P>
      <P>I should like to say that in my opinion there are at least 50 per cent. too many inspectors attached to the Local Government Department.  Officials over there seem to be cutting across one another&mdash;one official doing one job to-day and another official coming along and undoing it to-morrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>And an inspector for both.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>You have two different inspectors going over the one job. Take for instance the case of the little cottage hospital in Middleton.  The Local Government Department insisted that the plan of the cottage hospital was not complete unless it provided for the building of a laundry to do the laundry work of the hospital. The plans were sent up here with the necessary provision for the laundry, and were duly sanctioned.  After the sanction of the plans, lo and behold, we got a letter down from the Local Government Department again telling us that we were not to carry the matter any further.  This was after the laundry had been built, and after the ratepayers money had been spent on it.  We were told that the soiled clothes from Midleton should be sent to Cork.  If there is anything more ridiculous than that kind of red tape, I do not know what it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have again an instance in which repeated instructions were sent down from the Local Government Department to prepare plans and specifications for different hospitals.  In the first place there was a question of a fever hospital for Midleton.  Instructions were sent down to South Cork <Col N="470" /> Board of Assistance to prepare plans and specifications for that hospital. The plans and specifications were duly prepared, and after they had been sent up here, another notification came down that the hospital was not to be built at all.  The engineer to the Board of Assistance drew his £500 and put it into his pocket for preparing these plans and specifications.</P>
    <P>Again, there was a question of plans and specifications for a central hospital in Cork to be built beside the old hospital on Douglas Road.  These plans and specifications were prepared on the instructions of the Local Government Department, sent up here to Dublin, sanctioned, and then a notification came down a few months afterwards that we were not to proceed with the scheme.  In that case the engineer got another £1,000 and put it into his pocket.  As a matter of fact, I think it was £2,000 this time.  I think that kind of conduct on the part of officials of the Department is carrying things a little too far.  We are dealing with the ratepayers' money.  The ratepayers' money is hard-earned money. There are very few of these unfortunate ratepayers who could earn in half a lifetime as much as these officials get for abortive schemes of this kind, and it is time this system ended.</P>
    <P>Then we have a third scandal, a case in which an official came down to Cork, picked a site for a hospital, and said: &ldquo;You are to build it here; buy that site.&rdquo;  The city manager came along and bought the site.  I do not believe he even consulted the representatives of the city, and £3,000 odd of the ratepayers' money was paid for 20 or 25 acres.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>£3,800.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>£3,800, on the instructions of an official of the Local Government Department.  Another official came down a few months afterwards and said: &ldquo;I do not like the view from this particular site; we shall have to get another one.&rdquo;  He picks one way, and before a start is made to build, about £30,000 has to be spent, because a bridge must be built.  It cannot be reached without a bridge, and then, when a start is made, they find that it <Col N="471" /> is a bog, and they have to go down about 40 feet to get a foundation, and to reinforce that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be very little harm if some of the inspectors were thrown in there.  That is the condition of affairs I find prevailing in the Department, one inspector tripping up another.  One man comes down to-day and says, &ldquo;Do this,&rdquo; and when the ratepayers' money is spent, another inspector comes down and says, &ldquo;That is wrong, you must do something else.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the inspectors or the architects?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>One is as bad as the other.  There are too many of them. Hang both of them.  It is little wonder with that position prevailing that we have large numbers of ratepayers in the city and county of Cork howling over the amount of rates they have to pay.  It is also little wonder that we cannot get a couple of thousand pounds to put the people into decent houses.  It is time the position was cured, and, in my opinion, there is only one cure.  If that position prevailed in a business establishment, and if an official did what these inspectors have done, he would get a cheque on Saturday night and the road on Monday morning.  There would be no bones about it, and no consultation about a pension.  What I want to know from the Minister is, which of the inspectors was wrong?  Are these inspectors still connected with the Department, and if so, why?  We are sick of this kind of humbug.  This country is being ruined and ridden by civil servants, who are not even civil. Could any Deputy stand up to justify the expenditure of £1,500 or £2,500 in this way in connection with a hospital that was never built, and, as far as I <Col N="472" /> can find out, there was no intention of building?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>The civil servants were not responsible for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The responsibility for this Vote is on the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Then the Minister can explain why one official should select a site for a hospital, on which the ratepayers of Cork had to expend £3,800 of their hard-earned money.  We want an explanation of that, and this is the place and the time to get it.  I also want to know if we are going to get the money in order that 130 families may be placed in comfortable houses, and taken out of places that the medical officer of health said he would not put a dog to sleep in.  Are we going to have someone in charge of the inspectors so that, at least, only one will be sent down every 12 months, and that we will not have one man galloping down to-day, and getting first-class expenses, and a second official coming along later and undoing what the other man did?  This is a state of affairs that no one can swallow.  Deputy Broderick referred to the position regarding mental hospitals, and the grants given them.  I invite Deputies to read the Local Government Act of 1898, by which 50 per cent. of the cost was contributed at a time when patients were only costing 7/8 per head.  These patients are now costing 17/- per head, but the mental hospitals are still only receiving the 50 per cent. grant, amounting to 3/10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to main roads, my opinion is that the unfortunate ratepayers have kept these roads in condition long enough.  They had, in the first instance, to build the roads, and as they are now in first-class condition it is time that motorists paid for them. As I understand it, motorists are contributing enough money, between petrol and road taxes, to maintain main roads.  As far as farmers are concerned, I suggest they do not use these roads.  If they want to take a beast to the market they have to hire a lorry to do so.  These roads are <Col N="473" /> practically impassable for farmers who want to use them for their work.  The main roads are constantly used by motor-lorries and by motor-cars, and that traffic is paying sufficient money in licence duties and taxes to keep them in order.  It is time they were taken off the unfortunate farmers' backs.  When he is concluding, I hope the Minister will give a definite reply to the points I have raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure there will be general agreement with Deputies who stated that this Department is the one that is most associated with the general life of the country.  No other Department has as close touch with the people as that concerned with local government and public health. The work of the Department, to a great extent, is routine, and the added work in connection with housing is a special work in itself.  It is on that aspect I wish to make some remarks. I agree with Deputy Corry and other speakers who touched upon the question, that we are over-inspected in every department.  No man can do anything without having a host of inspectors about him.  Every official is on wheels now, and I wonder how, before the advent of motor-cars, local authorities were supervised at all. This is a very serious matter for this country.  Only the few people who are producing can keep a country going. If there are too many drones, and too few workers, there will be no honey in the hive.  It is time we gave some attention to that side of the question. The Minister is concerned with many classes of inspectors, with inspectors under the Milk and Dairies Act, Bovine Tuberculosis, and the Dairies and Cowsheds Acts and, as a result, a farmer who is doing mixed farming in the County Dublin, at any rate, is hardly ever without an inspector knocking at the door.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is time a man was allowed to produce, without being annoyed by an army of inspectors, not all of whom are badly paid, either.  It is impossible to have a proper standard of wages for the worker and to produce food at a reasonable cost when there are so many inspectors and inspections, all of whom and all of which <Col N="474" /> must be paid out of the article produced, which all adds to the cost of the article.</P>
    <P>Deputy Giles touched on a matter the relevancy of which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle doubted, that is, the building of cottages in Meath.  The Minister, of course, has no direct touch with the building of cottages, or the placing of cottage contracts in any board of health area.  The Minister insists, and, on the broad principle, rightfully insists, that the lowest tenderer should get the contract.  On the broad principle, nobody can cavil at that, but it should be subject to the qualification that the contractor is able to do the job.  I suggest that there should be a black list of contractors and that when a man fails in doing a job, his tender will not be considered in future, and, where it is a matter of inviting certain contractors to tender by letter, that he be passed over and not so invited.  An important reason for that is the trouble and disappointment occassioned when a contractor fails in his contract.  He not only disappoints the local authority who placed the contract with him, but he brings down the merchant, the builder's provider, as well, with the result that when the provider, who normally gives credit to the honest, enterprising contractors, gets a few stabs from bad contractors, he will hesitate to give credit to others who might be all right if they got the chance. Consequently, the number of contractors will become less and we might finally reach a stage at which only the very big contractors would contract for a job and the chances of placing a contract at a reasonable price would then depend on whether the big contractors were short of work or not.</P>
    <P>In the matter of contracts, the Minister should not be too rigid, or at least, if a case is put to him by a local authority, he should consider it.  We, in County Dublin, have had great trouble in this respect and while we unanimously stand for the lowest tenderer getting the job, we also stand for considering the type of man who may be the lowest tenderer.  If I were in the Minister's place.  I could not say that I could do anything more than consider the type of contractor who <Col N="475" /> sends in the lowest tender and ask myself if the man has sufficient resources to carry out the work according to schedule.</P>
    <P>The Lord Mayor of Cork, Deputy Hickey, and others have advocated the scattering of cottages, so to speak, over wider areas.  It is good to give the Minister on occasions such as these the local viewpoints on these matters.  I will give mine, and I think it is the unanimous opinion of the County Dublin Board of Health.  If we have one trouble in County Dublin, it is the provision of water for cottages by means of pumps.  It becomes an uneconomic proposition to sink pumps for one or a few cottages and we find, consequently, that the only way of attending to sanitation, or providing a decent water supply and general modern arrangements in cottages, is to keep the cottages together.  Even if we have to sink a pump or two, we are prepared to go any distance to connect with a water supply which will be under the direct control of the county medical officer of health.  The job of laying a pipe one mile or two miles, if you have 30 or 40 cottages in a colony, is comparatively negligible per cottage, and if you are near a running stream or a sewer, you can provide full sanitary accommodation for these cottages. While I have no doubt that the <Col N="476" /> Deputies who spoke for their respective areas had good reason for speaking as they did, if the Minister should consider the point and adopt a uniform policy or exert his influence in respect of a uniform policy, as suggested by them, it would not fit in with the wishes of County Dublin and would not tally with our practical experience there.</P>
    <P>The question of hospitals in County Dublin is also a burning question.  An area has been chosen provisionally for sites in Lucan district, and I think the same thing has happened there.  The Dublin City Manager was the party concerned.  We, the council, have to find the money, but that is not a matter I am going to raise here.  He would not have done it, if the law had not invested him with the power to do it, so that this is not the time to raise that matter.  What the public are concerned with, and what I want to put before the Minister now, is the need for more expedition.  Let us have those hospitals. We have heard a lot about them.  We have heard of trips to foreign lands in connection with them, but what we want is expedition.  We want to see those hospitals.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; Committee to sit again to-morrow.</P>
