      <P>A Chinn Comhairle, as I said, this whole debate is, in fact, an examination of our whole economic and financial position.  The trouble is that the subject is so wide that stress is laid, now on one aspect, and now on another aspect, without any comprehensive view of the whole, and unless we do take a comprehensive view of the whole, we are bound to arrive at wrong conclusions.  In speaking last night about external assets and their value, and the inferences that might be drawn from an apparent reduction in them; about the policy of trying to produce for the foreign market and policy of production at home for home consumption, I pointed out that as far as the Government were concerned, at any rate, we are unrepentant advocates of the pursuit of the policy we have been adopting and which was the old policy of Sinn Féin.  We are trying to develop the resources of this country for the benefit of the people in this country: to employ the natural resources we have, and to employ, amongst these resources, the brains and brawn of our people to produce the material necessities of life and to provide for our people the amenities which are, as I said, necessary for decent living.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, there has been a good deal of sneers at &ldquo;a plan,&rdquo; and people have been asking where is the plan.  There has been pursued constantly a definite plan, and it is only in relation to that plan that you can estimate whether we are going on the right road or not. The plan has been this: We tried to catalogue the material necessities of our lives here.  We took the fundamental necessities&mdash;of food, clothing, shelter, fuel both for domestic purposes and for power, and so on&mdash;and we saw, in the statistics of our imports, the import of large quantities of materials to meet these needs, materials that we believed we could produce here at home.  We took the biggest items&mdash;I am talking in general now, because there have been exceptions to this general statement&mdash;we took the biggest items in our imports, and if possible the most unnatural items in them, and we set out definitely to cut these out.  The biggest ones, <Col N="2119" /> and the most unnatural ones, were the ones which related to the most fundamental of our necessities.  We started with food and said that, since we were an agricultural country it was ridiculous that we should not avail of the home market to the full for the produce of our farms, and that we should not be importing American bacon or a number of other things that we could produce here ourselves.</P>
    <P>We set out, therefore, to produce these things and to limit the imports of things such as agricultural products which we could get here, such as bacon, and we said that that need not prevent us, in general, from taking any advantage we could of any external market which was open to us.  You can see the result of that policy in what is happening in agriculture.  We took one of the most fundamental necessaries, wheat.  We said: &ldquo;Though it is true that you can get wheat from the prairie lands of Canada, the United States and elsewhere, and dump it here at lower prices than our farmers can produce it, nevertheless it is good economy to produce as much of our own wheat as we can.&rdquo;  If there is a crisis&mdash;a war, or anything else of that nature&mdash;we shall have, at least, a substantial element of our food here at home.  To the extent that our farmers are producing wheat, and to the extent that we can give them an assured market here, we are giving them a thing which is safer than an external market, of which they may be deprived at any moment.  We pursued that policy, and the result of pursuing it in respect of that single item has been to increase the area under wheat tenfold. There is still considerable room for improvement, and, in my opinion, we should move along the line we have been moving on in regard to the production of wheat.  About three times the amount we are producing at present would be required to satisfy all our needs.  We should not be content until we have got, at least, half-way, and when we have got half-way, I think the argument I am now using will still hold in respect of a considerable portion of the remainder. <Col N="2120" /> There is no doubt that we have a sufficiency of suitable wheat land for our purposes.</P>
    <P>Then, there is the question of cereal foodstuffs for animals.  We are in a certain difficulty there.  The difficulty arises, perhaps, in more intensified form in that case than it does in regard to wheat and other things because, undoubtedly, we cannot produce these cereals at the price at which we can get them from outside. We must try to strike a balance.  We cannot produce our wheat exactly at the price at which we can obtain it from outside.  At certain stages, we may produce it just as cheaply as they do outside.  I think that there was a period when we were able to produce it almost as cheaply as it could have been obtained from outside.  If there is a war, we shall be able to produce it more cheaply than it can be purchased in the world market.  However, I think it is true in general that we shall be able to purchase more cheaply outside than we can produce these foodstuffs and, if we are going to lose a certain amount in that way, will there, on balance, be a gain or a loss?  Free traders will say that there is a loss, that we should concentrate on the particular products we can best produce, sell them in an external market and, with the produce of their sale, buy the things we need.  That policy has been tried over a long period in Ireland and it was, obviously, a disastrous policy. The more there is increased production in other countries of agricultural produce for the English market, the worse it will be for our producers.  The British market is really the principal market, if not the only market.  The English might endeavour to protect their own industry and they might discriminate as regards supplies.  They are as much at liberty to discriminate against Canada, Australia and these other countries as they are to discriminate against us.  That will be the case no matter what position we may occupy in their regard politically. They are quite free to put up tariffs against us if they want to develop their own agriculture or to let in other countries.  They can, in that way, make <Col N="2121" /> production here unprofitable unless we approximate somewhat to the prairie areas where they are able, with a very small population and by the use of mechanical methods, to produce food. That is the fundamental difference between free trade and the economy of self-sufficiency or protection.</P>
    <P>We know that we cannot have it both ways.  We cannot have the advantage of imported cheap food if we want to develop our industries and protect our own agriculture.  Which is it to be?  I know that economists have been divided on these things.  If the world were one unit, if there were free passage not only of goods and capital, but of persons between all nations, then, in all probability, the free trade policy, as a world policy, would be the best policy.  But that is not the world in which we are living.  For that reason, whether wise or unwise, we are convinced that the policy of protecting our industries, in order to produce for ourselves the things we require, is good national policy.  We have fought elections on that basis, and we have been returned.  We are as convinced of that to-day&mdash;at least, I am and I think the other members of the Government&mdash;as we were at any time.  I am not for a moment trying to pretend that, if we adopt a policy of that kind, we can give the farmer his bread at as low a price as if we were to import the flour from outside, but the community as a whole, which is our interest and not one section, is benefiting by the general plan we have pursued.  When we talk about foodstuffs, we must not lose sight of the critical aspect.  It is true that bread, clothes and boots must be regarded as items in the farmer's cost of production. To the extent that we protect our industries, it is quite true&mdash;I have to admit this&mdash;that we shall, in all probability, have some increase in price until we are able to produce as efficiently here as they produce elsewhere. I believe that we ought to set out to produce as efficiently here as they can produce elsewhere&mdash;with one limitation, that whereas we have only 3,000,000 of a population, other countries have a population of 30,000,000 <Col N="2122" /> or 80,000,000.  That is the only limit there should be to our efficiency as compared with the efficiency of people outside.  I am willing to admit to the farmer that his costs of production go up in regard to the things he has to buy.  We try to give him a balance and, if he is dissatisfied, we have to say: &ldquo;Though you are a most important section of the community, you are not the community as a whole, and you are going to benefit by the existence, side by side with you, of an industrial community.&rdquo;  I am trying to argue these things as objectively as I can, without making Party capital out of them.  I am endeavouring to argue them as if I were examining them quietly in my own room.  The question becomes one of balance.</P>
    <P>A critical point arises when the commodities are not food, clothes or boots, but the raw materials of the things which the farmer is producing and selling.  Take, for example, the question of cereals&mdash;whether we should import maize or not.  You have a really difficult question there, and one of your difficulties arises from the fact that our country&mdash;small as it is, relatively&mdash; is not uniform, that there are certain areas suitable for the production of cereals and certain areas that are not suitable.  We have to consider the economic needs of the places that are not suitable.  The ideal thing would be for our farmers, as far as possible, to produce the raw materials for themselves and not buy them from outside. But that question at the moment is a serious one.  We recognised always that it was an important and serious question.  It is engaging the attention of the Minister for Agriculture at the moment.  There is a Bill to enable him to suspend the present arrangement.  I will be greatly dissatisfied personally if it is not possible to find some method by which we will not have to import for the raw material things which we can substitute at home.  I would regard it as a great loss.  I recognise the vital part that animal food stuffs play in our economy, in view of the fact that agriculture is our principal industry.  We are trying to produce food at home.  I have mentioned wheat.  Take sugar: sugar is a food necessity.  Deputy <Col N="2123" /> Dillon will say you cannot produce it at the cost at which you could get it formerly from outside countries.  I agree that you probably cannot get it at the cost at which it was being dumped formerly, at any rate when they were trying to get rid of agricultural produce at any time.  I say that the growing of beet and the manufacture of it in our factories into sugar is a useful thing from the point of view of general economy.  It gives work to the farmer; it gives him alternative crops.  It is much better in any case not to have all our eggs in one basket. The farmer is getting fixed prices that he knows in advance, practically with certainty, except in so far as weather conditions may upset things completely. All agriculture is subject to vicissitudes arising from the weather, and I think much of the talk that we hear about the state of agriculture is mainly due to the bad harvest last year which was owing to weather conditions.  You see what we are doing in regard to food. We are trying to produce the raw material from the land, whether it be wheat or sugar beet.  We have been pursuing that policy definitely.  We are trying to manufacture our requirements here at home.  Our flour mills, before we came into office, were only half employed, and some of them were closed down.  We were producing only about 50 per cent. of our requirements. Now, we are producing the whole of our requirements, and if we had the raw material in wheat, as far as that principal food is concerned, we could say that we do not care, in that regard, as far as war is concerned; we are not going to be short.</P>
    <P>The same applies to sugar.  We are in a position that if there were some crisis we need not go short.  In regard to sugar there are two elements to be considered, the price which the farmer gets and the price which the consumer has to pay.  It is a balance between those two.  The farmer very naturally wants to get the most he can for his labour.  The Government, looking after the interests of the community as a whole, has to ask what is the price which the community ought to give the farmer for the service which he is <Col N="2124" /> rendering the community in producing that food.  There will always be a certain amount of conflict between the two, but they will settle themselves, on the one hand, by the desire of the community to get its sugar and, on the other, by the desire of the farmer to grow a profitable crop.  If there was an attempt on the part of one section to profiteer at the expense of the other, then the Government would have to seek a remedy, and the remedy it would seek in a case like that would be to say to the farmer: &ldquo;Very well; you have been given an opportunity of producing at a reasonable price.  You want to exceed that price.  We will open the door and allow sugar to be imported.&rdquo;  That is the only weapon that the Government ultimately has at its disposal in order to prevent one section of the community from getting undue profit and undue reward for its service at the expense of the rest.  I say that generally we could do that and that we are in a position to exercise control generally if we wanted to do so.  I have shown that we are pursuing a definite plan in trying to get our food produced at home.</P>
    <P>Let us consider clothing.  A large quantity of clothing was being imported which we felt could be produced at home.  If you look at the reduction in imports of wearing apparel and the increase in our industrial production you will see at once that we have made very rapid progress along that line.  I think the Minister for Industry and Commerce, speaking some time ago, indicated that there was some £20,000,000 worth of imports which he felt could be substituted by home-made goods.  Our progress along that line can be shown by the fact that there are 900 workshops and factories employing some tens of thousands of people producing goods which were formerly coming in from outside.  I think last night I gave the figure as 800.  It is really 900.  It was an older figure I gave last night.  Some people will say that these are foolish, mushroom industries.  They are not mushroom industries.  Do not tell me that the production of boots and of clothing are mushroom industries.  There is always a demand here for these things.  We <Col N="2125" /> cannot produce some of them at the rate at which they could be produced in Japan or at the price at which they could be obtained if we opened the ports and let in Japanese goods or goods from other countries.  If we let goods in from other countries, undoubtedly our own industries would become mushroom industries, but there is no reason whatever for thinking that industries established for the purpose of meeting fundamental needs are mushroom industries.</P>
    <P>We were told that the promoters of these industries are making undue profits, that the Government is not exercising proper care.  The very people who are talking about undue profits talk about the agreement which we made and say that is going to cause our industries to close down.  We made an agreement to take in on certain conditions industrial goods that we require, in return for the export to Britain of our agricultural produce. But we safeguarded our industries.  We made it clear that a Prices Commission of Irishmen would look into the matter, would consider the relative costings here and abroad, and would fix the tariffs at such a level as would allow our home industries, having regard to our circumstances, our smaller numbers, and so on, to be carried on at a reasonable profit.  We knew in accepting that that we were only accepting a certain check on profits, so that they would be examined. When we originally accepted the general plan of protection, we knew that when industries were established it would be necessary to have some machinery for examining prices and seeing that undue profits were not made under the shelter which we were providing.  People have been talking about tariffs.  We do not regard tariffs as of any value except as a shelter to enable our industries to carry on behind them and be saved from the attack of unfair competition from outside.  We do not recognise any other particular virtue in tariffs. They do help the Minister for Finance, indirectly, to help the Exchequer, but that is not our purpose in it.  That is not the aim of our tariffs, and the lower these tariffs are the better, we <Col N="2126" /> know, for the community.  When I say the lower they are I mean whilst they are effective, because there is no point in putting up a wall if the wall is not high enough to afford the protection required.  There is a difference of view as to what exactly is the height that is necessary in order to afford adequate protection.</P>
    <P>As long as we have an individualistic economy, as long as we recognise the rights of private property, we must give the individual incentive to produce. The individual's incentive to produce is reasonable profit or return for what he is doing.  It should be reasonable, and the business of the Government, in the matter of safeguarding the general welfare, is to see in so far as it can that that particular incentive is not contrary to the general welfare or to the common good.</P>
    <P>We have got to watch over it from that point of view, but our views about private property are the views which are expressed in our Constitution.  We acknowledge and recognise the right of private property, but we also recognise the right of the Government, as the guardian of the common good, to regulate the use that is to be made of that private property so that it will be in the general interest.</P>
    <P>Now, I have referred to food and clothing.  You have to look at the results, and you can see the progress that has been made in accordance with that plan.  I repeat there is a plan, and that it has been pursued.  The next thing of fundamental importance is that our people should be properly housed. We came in here and saw a terrible situation facing the people.  In this city we saw one quarter of the people, roughly, housed with only one room as a home.  That was a disgraceful condition from the human point of view, and from the economic point of view a completely unsatisfactory situation.  We set out to try to remedy it.  The result of our work in trying to remedy the situation about housing through the country as a whole has been that in our time some 100,000 houses have been either reconstructed or erected.  You have only to go for a short motor drive <Col N="2127" /> through the country to see the results of that policy.  We have not finished the job by any means.  It is a fundamental job which we set ourselves to accomplish, and we are, by hook or by crook, going to see it pursued and finished, if possible.  There is a rate of progress beyond which you cannot go. We have here our cement factories to produce the material required both for housing and for road construction.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, we have not one fundamental material, namely, timber. In the pursuit of our general economic ideal, it is our purpose to try to produce timber, to see that those generations which come after us&mdash;because unfortunately, timber cannot be produced overnight&mdash;will, at any rate, have that fundamental material here at home: that they will have their own home-grown timber.  We have people who think that there is some special virtue in that particular line of afforestation.  There is not, except in producing what we require&mdash;a fundamental raw material. Look at the progress that has been made.  We have now gone up to the point at which about 8,000 acres are being planted every year.  It is estimated that the planting of about 20,000 acres would meet our needs.  We expect in a very short time to get up to 10,000 acres.  There is a lot of fallacy talked about this whole question of afforestation.</P>

      <P>There is a lot of nonsense talked about it.  I think nobody could have pressed harder than I have for the speeding up of afforestation.  I pressed every successive Minister who has been in charge of that Department to speed it up for the simple reason that it is fundamental in the pursuit of this general plan which I have indicated. It was said that some officials were totally opposed to it: that they had some bias, and so on.  I said, if that is so, then you are to try to get other people.  I said that we should get the best advice&mdash;to go through the world for experts and get them.  They have got an expert.  I have asked him to make a survey: to give me his views <Col N="2128" /> as to the total amount of plantable land.  When I say plantable land I do not mean that you are going to go into the lands of Meath and plant forests in them.  What I mean by plantable land is land that, in his opinion, would be useful, and that is available for afforestation.  He has given me an estimate.  I want that estimate checked. I want to check the land that is good for afforestation and that would also be good for agricultural purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to ask ourselves a very common-sense question, keeping in mind that we are trying to be as self-sufficient as we can&mdash;because here, as in other things, it is again a question of balance&mdash;what should we do, for instance, about some mountain side?  It is a sheep range at the moment.  What is the annual value of it as a sheep range?  How many people does it give a living to?  If you put it under forestry what is going to be the return from it, estimate it any way you like?  It has a certain economic value at the present time.  What economic value will that land have if it is put under afforestation?  How do the two figures compare?  I am not going to give you the figures at the moment, because I want those things checked. They are not by any means easy figures to arrive at, but I can say that, looking at this from the cold economic point of view, afforestation is not nearly as attractive per acre as the devotees of afforestation will claim.  I have seen absolutely absurd figures given about the value of afforestation. I want to be understood correctly on this, because I believe that every acre that can be more profitably used for planting should be so used.  Timber is a fundamental product, and by hook or by crook we ought to try to plant as much as will supply our own internal needs and save us from the risk which we are facing at the moment if there should be war: the risk of being cut short of a fundamental material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any case, what we are doing there is in accordance with the whole general line of our policy, and so I want to tell the advocates of more <Col N="2129" /> afforestation that we are going ahead with it as rapidly as we can.  In the matter of afforestation you cannot have that rapid development and production which you can look for, say, in the case of the pig industry.  It takes time and there has to be a good deal of preparation.  The preparation is slow.  We are developing it as quickly as we can.  If we go too fast there is bound to be more loss than if we go at a reasonable rate.</P>
    <P>Someone may ask me &ldquo;Are you satisfied with the present rate&rdquo;?  I am not satisfied.  I am not satisfied about any of these things.  I am anxious to push them faster.  I suppose that, as human beings, we are not ever going to be satisfied.  We all think that things could be done better, and we are all striving to perfect and improve as far as it is possible.  I have dealt with food, clothing and shelter. I have spoken of the cement factories. Another very important thing is steel. There has been a considerable disappointment with regard to some of our explorations.  We had hopes at one time with regard to Arigna.  Employment was very badly needed there.  We have had it examined and we find that there is no possibility of developing either coal or iron products.  We would be very glad to develop them if there was any possibility of doing so.  If we cannot get the primary, we hope at least to develop some secondary steel industries, and we are making a start in a certain sense at the moment.</P>
    <P>The next fundamental thing that we come to is fuel.  We are trying at the moment to make use of the native fuel supplies as quickly as possible.  There is a difficulty about certain coal deposits.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has been for a long time anxious to get some of those deposits used.  There has been difficulty at the moment but I hope that difficulty will soon be removed.</P>
    <P>It is mainly in our bogs that we have a great fuel supply.  We are developing those bogs and that raw material as quickly and as economically as we can without great losses. Take Clonsast bog, for instance: in <Col N="2130" /> about two years' time we will be capable of turning out 150,000 tons of fuel from that bog, and we hope to see an electrical power plant erected on that bog.  We are developing these resources according to a definite plan, and we are trying to get these fundamental native fuels used at home.</P>
    <P>I have heard talk about reclamation. When the fuel is cut off these big bog lands, there will be land left.  The land can be reclaimed and, in all probability, will be useful for certain agricultural purposes.  We have seen reclaimed bog used all over the country.  There may be a quantity of land like that which can be brought into cultivation, and we are seeking it. The Department of Agriculture and the Department of Industry and Commerce will try between them to deal with that, and try to get it brought into cultivation.  We have, of course, to consider costs and the relative value of the final result.</P>
    <P>We have been told about drainage. Now, we are pursuing a plan in regard to drainage.  We have seen absurd drainage schemes pursued in the past, we have seen the upper reaches of rivers drained without any consideration as to whether the main channel could carry the extra water or not, where the draining of one part means the flooding of another part.  Clearly we should not pursue a plan in that particular way.  Apart from the legal entanglements with regard to maintenance and the burden of cost falling upon the people who are benefiting, there is also the question of a proper engineering survey.  A commission has been set up in order to deal with drainage, so that we may start on the work in a comprehensive fashion.  I hope that, in a short time, we will have ready a scheme which will enable us to proceed systematically with the drainage of the country and, by draining, the making of the land more profitable for our people.</P>
    <P>Let people then not sneer when they talk about a plan.  We are pursuing that definite plan which I am outlining and doing it &ldquo;within the system&rdquo; (to use a phrase which I have used already).  The criticism we are receiving <Col N="2131" /> from the Opposition is, that the pursuit of this plan does not lead ultimately to the welfare of our people. There we divide with them: the issue is knit between us on that point.  We believe the plan does lead ultimately to prosperity.  If the country thinks otherwise, they can take the Opposition and put them in as a Government, to pursue whatever plan they put before the people.  As far as we are concerned, we believe in this: we believe in it, even if we were to go out to-morrow.  The position even then would be that the evils resulting from the Opposition policy would be so great and so apparent that the country would revert back to this policy of ours.</P>
    <P>No policy is going to give perfection: there is going to be a certain amount of evil attached to every policy and it is a question of the balance of advantages and evils and the taking of the best from the national point of view.  As I have said, the criticism is that it is costing too much.  It is said that our principal industry, agriculture, is not going to be as flourishing as it would be if the Opposition ideas of economy were in operation. As far as the requirements of the farmer are concerned, his requirements are not very much different from the requirements of the people in the urban areas.  The Opposition say it will not be as profitable for him if those requirements are met from inside, as if we open the ports and allow his requirements to be met from outside. I can only say to the farmer: &ldquo;It is true you may have to pay for certain things a little more, but the people who are producing those things for you are a better market for you.&rdquo; They said they wanted to make a market for Pat Murphy.  The idea, I take it, was that they wanted to make here at home a market for our own people, a market for the produce of our own people's labour.  The farmer has a market in the men who produce his industrial goods, his clothes, boots, and so on.  The industrialist is a market for the man who produces the fuel&mdash;if he is not in a position where he can use all the turbary on his own farm.  The industrialist or urban <Col N="2132" /> dweller is a market for the farmer, and a better and surer market than the industrialist who is working in England and who is a market for the food which is being exported by us.</P>

      <P>Money is got by production. Money is only a claim on goods or on services, and it is the goods and the services that mean money. The man who is able to perform services&mdash;if he is let&mdash;for his neighbours, has money.  If he is able to perform services for his neighbour, that neighbour must give him in return something for it.  I will come to that subject, I hope, in the course of this talk.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at the moment only in indicating the general economic policy pursued by the Government.  I am admitting that one cannot have it both ways: if we go in for efficient production, the principal drawback is that we have not as big a market as people in other countries and therefore we cannot produce per unit as efficiently as they can.  However, we have the brains and the skill to produce for ourselves.  I remember a former Minister for Industry and Commerce, speaking from one of these benches, said that because we had not got efficient management we could not produce boots.  That is utter nonsense. We have the brain and the skill, and I do hope that we will be able to get here the desire for work, the desire to produce and to do things actively to keep ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not touching on the Labour Party motion yet, but I will come to it in due time.  At the moment I am concerned rather with the difference between ourselves and the Opposition. Fundamentally the Opposition policy is a free trade policy, whilst ours is not.  Theirs, if you like, is one that leans in that direction: it can neither be said to be completely free trade nor completely protectionist.  The Opposition policy leans on the free trade side whilst our policy leans on the side of self-sufficiency.  We believe that we are right and that that will be proved.  If there should be a change of Government the principal <Col N="2133" /> thing about it is that it would be a test.  We believe that there has been a test over a long period of years and it has shown results.  We are pursuing a policy which is producing the results which we said it would of necessity produce.  We have never denied that.  We saw the disadvantages and yet we said that the disadvantages were worth while for the sake of the advantages.  We do not mind if the commission reveals those disadvantages: we knew that they would exist.  What we say is that the commission was only set up to examine the situation existing at the time at which the examination was made.  We say that if we want to have a comparison, there must be an examination of what the results might have been under the other system.</P>
    <P>It is a comparison of the two systems, and not merely revealing the evils, that matters.  By all means, let us try to correct these evils, if we can, and I will come to some of them later, but, again, I say that the Opposition attitude is that these things are costing too much.</P>
    <P>We went out also on the general principles that we had a duty to a section of the community, those who, under the existing system and in the existing circumstances, were not able to work and to maintain themselves, and we developed certain social services for that reason.  These services have added to the cost.  They have to be paid for.  From what? From the wealth that exists, from the pockets of those who have and who are able to make that contribution to the welfare of the community as a whole. These things have to be met, but we still believe that these social services, notwithstanding the fact that they are, to the extent to which contributions have to be made by the individual in the way of taxes and so on, a burden&mdash; and they are a certain burden&mdash;constitute a burden which we ought to carry, which I believe we can carry and which I believe it is our duty to carry.  Certain of the costs then&mdash;in fact, all of them&mdash;are due to the fact that we are to a certain extent interfering in the economic life of the country.  We have to interfere in it <Col N="2134" /> because, if you adopt the old laissez faire policy, it is only certain sections who will be able to survive.  The laissez faire policy, the free trade policy, and so on, are all of a part, and we have definitely turned our backs on them.  In doing so, I know that we are sacrificing certain advantages and undertaking certain burdens.</P>
    <P>By all means, it is the duty of the Opposition to examine expenditure, to criticise it, to try to keep it down.  We do that, too.  Let nobody think that we undertake new expenditure without a certain amount of heartburning, because we know that that expenditure is going to reveal itself ultimately, even from the narrow political point of view, in the imposition of burdens which the people will resent to a certain extent.  No expenditure is decided on by the Government, or proposed to the Dáil after consideration by the Government, without the most careful examination to see whether it is worth while.  Are we paying too much for our whistle at any particular stage, is a question which is naturally asked.  The Minister for Finance, with his Department, is the principal watchdog in that regard.</P>
    <P>As I am talking about this planning in general to those members of the House who may not understand the machinery, who have not had the advantage of being in a former Government, I want to point out to them that it is a mistake to think that one Department goes off on one road, while another Department goes off on another, and that there is no centralisation or no plan being followed.  That is not true.  When a proposal is put forward by one Department, the proposal, and the reasons for it, are circulated to all Departments concerned, and, if any Department is affected, the proposal is criticised from the point of view of that Department, and always before proposals of that sort are originated, the Government, as a whole, considers whether such a project can be undertaken, whether it is in the national interest that it should be undertaken, what is it going to cost and so on, and then there is a sort of general agreement.  We will let that go ahead.  The moment the general idea <Col N="2135" /> is agreed, the originating Department puts down its proposals, which are criticised from the point of view of their effect on the other Departments.</P>
    <P>Every single proposal is examined carefully and minutely by the Department of Finance.  Every other Department, naturally is, then, more or less antagonistic to the Department of Finance, because there is a desire, on the one hand, to do something, while, on the other, there is the check of what it is going to cost.  One Department leans unduly on one side and the other Department unduly on the other, and sometimes it is very hard to know who is right and whether, in fact, the service is going to be worth the price, and at a time like the present, if there is any doubt, it simply is dropped.  If there is, in fact, a doubt that it is really worth while, that the cost is worth while, it will not be proceeded with.  There are hundreds or thousands of projects upon which we could to-morrow embark, were it not for the consideration of what it is going to cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  That is the trouble with everybody, and, in the long run, public finance is not very much different from private finance, and the welfare of the community as a whole, and how its welfare is to be brought about, is not very much different, except that it is on a larger scale, from a very big family with a reasonably good estate to manage.  The fundamental principles are not very much different, in my opinion, and perhaps when we come to consider questions of credit, illustrations of that kind may help us.  It is a question of whether it is worth it, whether the benefit you think you are going to confer on the community represents value for the burden which that benefit is going to impose on any section of the community.  As a rule, that is what it all works down to.  Yesterday, for example, Deputy Dillon, notwithstanding that we are &ldquo;burst,&rdquo; without hesitation, voted here for an increase&mdash;I <Col N="2136" /> think it is going to mean about £5,000 ultimately on public funds&mdash;in respect of the cost of representation in Canada.

      <P>when I introduced a proposal for expenditure here, because he likes it and thinks it would be good, he says it is worth while.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have every chance.  Deputy Dillon proclaimed that he was not an obscurantist when it came to a question of expenditure in the neighbourhood of £5,000.  Why?  Because he thought it was going to be in the national interest that that expenditure should be incurred.  I say that when the Government, <Col N="2137" /> notwithstanding the objections which will always be raised by Finance, because of the burdens which any new project is going to put on the country, decide that it is going to be undertaken, the Government have done what Deputy Dillon did in that precise instance to which I am referring&mdash;they have said that it is worth while.  The country as a whole is going to benefit by it.</P>
      <P>The social services which we have increased, the expenditure which we have urged upon Parliament to undertake and to place upon the country have been decided on and carried out after due deliberation and after due balancing of the advantages and disadvantages. We are only human.  It may happen that our estimate is wrong.  It may happen that Deputy Dillon and myself may be quite wrong in thinking that that expenditure of £5,000 is for the benefit of the country. We may be quite wrong in that.  I am sure that I could find Deputies in all parts of the House who would tell me, if I had them out in the corridor, that that expenditure was quite foolish. There are Deputies on all sides of the House who would say that it was foolish.  Yet Deputy Dillon and I, in our judgment, consider that it is worth while to put that burden upon the people in order to get the advantages, not immediately material advantages, but other advantages which if we come to examine them we would find would have material significance too.  In the same way, we had a Vote on the League of Nations.  There are people in this House who would say, &ldquo;What is the use of Geneva now?&rdquo;  I see Deputy Belton over there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are using it.  I will get my time at the Labour side in a minute.  At the moment I am only interested in the issue between ourselves and the main Opposition, and I think I am saying what is fair when I say that we, supervising these things, are as anxious about this expenditure as is the main Opposition.</P>
      <P>We say that the services on which the money is expended are worth while. Does the Opposition want to cut down the cost of the services or to get the services more efficiently managed?  If the Opposition says: &ldquo;We want to get the services more efficiently managed&rdquo;, I am at one with them in that.  If there are three people in an office and two could do the work as efficiently as three, by all means cut the office down to two. There is nobody who has been more anxious about the growth in the numbers in the public service than I have been.  I believe it is possible to get the work done with fewer people.  It is one thing to believe that but it is quite another thing to be able to effect it and to get the work done by fewer people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We wanted to increase the rate at which land was being divided.  In order to do that we had to get extra inspectors.  The training of these inspectors slowed down the work for a time.  We have asked ourselves whether we will increase the rate at which the work is to be done or not.  Somebody asked the other day what about the cost of the administration of the Land Commission. It is very high.  It is so high that I would think myself that one of the things we ought to aim at is to try <Col N="2140" /> as soon as possible to get the work done more quickly so as to reduce the cost of administration.</P>
    <P>The remarks that have been made lead Deputies on to side issues; there is the danger of getting away from the main facts.  There is first of all this question of the credit of farmers. There is this statement that the farmer's credit is impaired through the danger that his property may be taken from him.  Now, there is no property taken from the farmer without compensation and without a definite public reason for the taking of that property. The people who are likely to be interfered with know perfectly well the reason why land may be taken from them.  No person who is attending to and working his land properly is in any danger of his land being taken from him.  We have, however, the duty of seeing that the land should be properly employed and used to the best advantage for the country.  When there is no other land for the relief of congestion and to repair that condition which has been the result of the past social economic system&mdash;a system which mainly persisted because of the existence of a foreign Government&mdash;then, in order to remedy that position, land that is not properly used must be taken. We have to relieve congestion and to do that we try to induce people with large holdings in congested areas to leave. It is as much a question of inducing them to leave as of compelling them to leave.  But, ultimately, we want the power of compulsion.  The Land Commission in these matters is proceeding with all due care.</P>
    <P>If I were asked why the farmer's credit is not as good as it was, I would say that the farmers are a large section of the community, and there is the feeling that the farmer is not to be sold out because he cannot pay his debts.  It is because the land cannot be sold in the public market for the mortgagee that the credit of the farmer from that point of view is diminishing. If you give your house as security for a loan, you give it on the understanding that if the loan is not paid, then the property which is given in pledge against that loan would be available to the lender.  That is not so in the <Col N="2141" /> case of land.  It is mainly because of that difficulty, and not because of the reasons stated in the debate, that it is difficult for some farmers to get credit.  But, on the whole, that matter is exaggerated, just as other things are exaggerated.  On the whole farmers are getting a reasonable amount of credit, and, perhaps, it is just as well for particular farmers that they cannot get credit too easily.  Getting into debt and borrowing is not a thing that anybody should undertake too easily, because it is going to be a terrible burden to the farmer later on.  If a farmer mortgages his land, it is no longer his own.  The less the farmer mortgages and pledges his land, the better.  Now, lest I be regarded as an obscurantist by the Labour Party, I just want to speak of that in passing. Most of these statements by the Opposition are only partial statements of certain things.</P>
    <P>Well then, I say to the Opposition, we are doing as well as we can.  We are doing the things that you want to have done, namely, the curtailment of unnecessary expenditure, the curtailment of unprofitable expenditure and we are attempting to get the administration of whatever public services we have carried out as economically as possible.  That is our business.  If you can prove to the country that we have failed, the country can have its alternative, but, if the country wants an alternative, I tell the people of the country that they will find that, while people may say it is easy to cut down expenditure, you can only cut it down substantially by cutting out important services.  The Opposition were very eloquent in pointing out that some of the burdens entailed by these services would fall on the weaker sections of the community.</P>
    <P>I say that these curtailments which the Opposition have called for will inevitably affect mostly the weaker sections of the community.  The only way I can see to bring about a diminution of expenses is to get after the administration and to have the administration made more economic.  When I say &ldquo;administration&rdquo; I mean administration in its narrow sense, the actual doing of the services.  We can try to <Col N="2142" /> have these done as economically and efficiently as possible.  I have been urging that on various Departments and Ministers, and if anything can be done in that direction we shall have it done, but these economies are not going to make very significant changes in the present position.</P>
    <P>With regard to defence, we had statements in regard to the cost of defence, and if I were to go into them, again they would take me on a side issue.  What I say in regard to defence is that it is very little use for us to be doing other things now if we are not going to put ourselves in a position in which we shall be able to maintain whatever liberties we have got.  It is ridiculous for people to talk about &ldquo;bombers&rdquo; as if they were to be used for attack alone.  They know perfectly well that they are not used for attack alone.  They can be used for other purposes.  Bombing machines can also be used as reconnaissance machines and they can be used for defensive purposes. To try to make out that we have some ideas about advancing to attack other people with those machines is all nonsense.  Of course, weapons that are capable of being used in defence can also be used for attack.  They would be very little use in defence if they were not equally available for attack.  The sums we are spending compared with the sums other nations are spending on these services are very small.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of it.  All of it in the sense that it has to be repaid. We are getting it from sections of the community who are in possession of most of the existing wealth of the nation.  We are getting it because we have the credit of the nation behind us, the power of taxation behind us, the power to get from those who have, <Col N="2143" /> some of what they have.  That is where we are getting it.  As we go along, we can see whether there is any other way in which we can get it.  However, I shall leave the Opposition side of the question.  The issue is knit between us.  We say we are doing the things that they want to do.  We are not going to change our policy.  The pursuit of that policy involves certain consequences.  We think, on balance, that the consequences of that policy are better than would be the consequences of the opposite policy.</P>
      <P>Before I leave that matter, I want to say that it is nonsense to suggest that we are facing an immediate catastrophe from the economic point of view. There may be a catastrophe but it will not be caused by our economic situation.  There may be a catastrophe caused by a world war, a catastrophe which will bring danger and burdens to our people far beyond anything that was ever spoken of at the time of the economic war, but that is another matter.  That is not the matter we are discussing in this motion.  We are discussing the question on this motion as to whether the economic position of the country is such as Deputy Dillon describes it&mdash;I forget whether he used the remark himself but I heard it imputed to him&mdash;that we are &ldquo;bust&rdquo;.  We are nothing of the kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I only heard somebody impute it to the Deputy.  We are not, in fact, facing a catastrophe in the economic sense.  We are not facing a crisis.  There are difficulties no doubt.  We do not fight a war, even an economic war, without losses but, again, there were losses and gains.  There was a demand for £5,000,000 a year which would continue for another generation at least. You would have to be sending out £5,000,000 worth of cattle and other native products annually in order to pay that money.  We felt that it was not due.  We fought to retain it and the settlement, leaving out the items, <Col N="2144" /> meant that we settled at £10,000,000 a claim of £100,000,000.  That is what the economic war ended in.</P>
      <P>There have been losses, and no doubt, these losses added to the losses which the farmers were suffering as a result of the depression in agriculture.  It is true to say that to the extent to which our farmers suffered losses during this period we did our best to recoup them in other ways.  I think if you look at what was done you will find that it was not a question of all losses and no gains whatever.  There was a gain in the stabilisation of butter prices far above the world market price, in the halving of the annuities and in our schemes for wheat and beet.  These did give back something to the farmer in return for what he was losing, but he did lose.  I am not going to say that he did not lose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to attack the general proposition made here that it was the poorer sections of the community suffered most, but I do say that there has been an exaggeration of the whole thing.  It is true to say that the farmers would be able to take advantage of the improvement which has taken place if their farms were better stocked and if they got more capital.  There is a commission sitting at the moment to inquire into the whole agricultural position and with a view to making recommendations which may benefit that particular industry, having in view all the time the general welfare of the country as a whole.  When that commission reports, and when we have examined their recommendations, we shall see in fact whether we can agree with them and whether their recommendations will benefit that particular section of the community or will benefit the community as a whole.  People have been talking about derating and about providing unlimited credit at low rates of interest.  The members of the commission are doing work which could not be done in any Department.  They may not have power to initiate a proposal as the Department of Agriculture would have, but they have power at least to consider something about the the cost of these schemes.  We believed that, in making available the assistance <Col N="2145" /> that we promised, it would be very much better to have that made available by way of halving the annuities than by simple derating.</P>
    <P>However, as I have said, there is a commission inquiring into the agricultural situation.  I hope they will be able to bring forward proposals which it will be possible for us to accept, having regard to the general state of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite willing to admit that, after the severe situation through which agriculture has passed, if we are to take full advantage of the situation we would want to have our farms somewhat better stocked.  But again, people are inclined to think of the easy way for doing those things&mdash; get it from somebody else, or something of that sort.  A person may not be able to do it in a year; he may have to forego the profits of a year, but, as I <Col N="2146" /> said a few moments ago, you can begin small and grow up.  In the case of recouping oneself for losses, the best way to proceed may be to go carefully and slowly.  Before I finish with that, I want to examine&mdash;the Minister for Finance has done it, but it may be no harm to examine it a bit further&mdash;what is the evidence of this catastrophe, this crisis, which Deputy Dillon seemed to suggest was in the offing.  I cannot see any, except the catastrophe of war, which I take it this discussion is not about.  In 1934, from the agricultural point of view, even in outside countries, we had come to the bottom of the agricultural depression.  That coincided with the economic war.  But from 1934 or 1935 there has been evidence of a constant increase, so it is not into a depression we are going, leaving out again the question of war.  There is obviously an upward trend.  We hear a good deal about increased production. The increased production is there.  It is obvious from the statistics.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that, taking our agricultural and our industrial output as a whole, there is an increase.  There is a steady increase as far as I can see, from 1934-35 on, taking it as a whole.  If you want to talk about beet, you are up against the question as to whether or not one section of the community is going to give its services to the community as a whole at the price which the community is prepared to pay.  I would be very glad to eliminate strikes of all kinds&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but if there is a strike on the part of the beet growers I cannot help it.  It is a strike between the producers who are giving a certain service to the community, and the community who want to buy.  That will have to regulate itself in that particular way.  We tried to regulate it.  I think the Minister for Agriculture intervened at some stage, and I think there was an arbitrator appointed to settle the price.  The price which was agreed upon was given, and as far as I know they agreed to grow the beet. If they do not grow it, then the farmers are going deliberately to forego a profitable crop.  It may be a difficult crop. There may be hard work with it, but on the whole it is profitable use for their land, and it is a general public service.  Are we going to compel the growing of it?  Are we going to take over an area, and put in people to grow beet on it?  Are we going to adopt a collectivist economy or not?  I do not know whether the Labour Party are interested in having a collectivist economy?</P>

I will come to the Labour Party's programme in a moment.  Let me finish by saying that there is no indication that we are going into a crisis.  We are coming out of a crisis, obviously.  All the indications show that, and we are having increased production.

      <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce will deal with the 1938 figures.  I got these figures; I did not ask them to supply special ones.  I have here those figures for 1931 and 1937, and I find that the gross industrial output was nearly £54.9 millions in 1931; it had gone to £87.3 millions in 1937, so there was an increase of £32.4 millions in the gross output.</P>

      <P>I think this debate is regarded by the whole House as of major importance, and it should be conducted with the calm deliberation that it merits.  Interruptions and the raising of side issues disturb the theme of the debate, and will not make for a debate worthy of the motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The net figure was £25.6 millions in 1931, while in 1937 it was nearly £34.4 millions&mdash;an increase of £8.8 millions.  In those figures there is no evidence of a diminution in production. There is increased production. I am not saying it is as much as we could get.  By all means, press forward for more.  Good luck to everybody who presses on for more production. I am delighted to see it.  If people press on for more and harder work I will not object to it.  Unfortunately, I think there is not enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2149" /> I am talking of those who are in a position to produce more.  I am not satisfied by any means that any of us is working half as hard as it would be good for us to work.  With regard to agriculture, I have here the figures of production for 1936-37 and for 1934-35. In 1934-35 it was nearly £39,000,000&mdash; it was £38.9 millions&mdash;and in 1936-37 it was £47.3 millions.  There is, again, a substantial increase in agricultural production.  If you take our exports &mdash;I think the Minister for Finance pointed to this&mdash;in 1935, when we were obviously at the bottom of the depression, the agricultural exports were £13.8 millions.  In 1938 they were £19.6 millions.  Those who are interested in our exports, therefore, will see that there is an increase in exports.</P>
    <P>The trade balance has been spoken of.  The adverse trade balance at the bottom of the depression was £21,000,000&mdash;that was about 1934.  In 1938, it was £17,000,000, and up to 31st March this year was £15.9 millions.  So that, as far as external trade is concerned, we have an improvement in the adverse balance.  Of course, we are always likely to have an adverse balance of trade as long as we are a creditor country, unless in exceptional circumstances&mdash;I am taking it over a very long period.  There is no decrease in our live stock population&mdash;it is going up.  There was an increase on the 1st June, 1938, as compared with 1937.  The Minister gave these figures.  He pointed out that cattle had gone up by 2.6 per cent., sheep 6.6, pigs 2.6, and horses 2.9; so that our live stock has increased.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach making a comparison with 1931?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am pointing out that there is no indication that we are faced with a crisis.  I am pointing out that we are coming obviously out of a crisis, that there is an upward trend which ought to inspire confidence and optimism, leaving out a world war situation, and not a depression.  I do not see why people should try to cause depression when they must know perfectly well, they have the interests of the country as a whole at heart, that <Col N="2150" /> all attempts to do that are going to have the effects they are pretending to deplore, or which they are deploring, if they think the thing is true.  I am trying to get them out of that mood of pessimism by pointing out that all the indications show an improvement. So far as the acreage under crops is concerned there was an increase between 1931 and 1938.  With regard to the index of prices, it has gone up.  At the bottom of the period it was 83.4; it has gone up to 111.9, practically 112. So far as agricultural wages are concerned, the average wage has gone up from 24/3 to 27/3.  I am asking where are the indications that we are going into a catastrophic depression or crisis?  I cannot see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>People will produce figures from some volumes, and when we produce them from official publications, which are not cooked, and ask you to draw your conclusions from them, of course they are said to be all wrong.  In savings certificates and savings banks returns there is no indication of any decrease.  The amount has gone up from £17,000,000 in 1934-35 to £22.7 millions.  If you look for other indications, either in the traffic on the railways or the bank clearances &mdash;I will not weary you with them&mdash;or any other of the usual indices by which one judges what is the trend, there is nothing that I can see to indicate that we are facing a catastrophic crisis&mdash; there is nothing of the sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, undoubtedly, evils which we would like to remedy&mdash;many of them.  I should like to see if it were possible to come to the help of the agricultural industry immediately by trying to put all farmers in a position to have the necessary capital to carry out their undertakings and to produce more.  I am as appreciative as anybody on the Opposition Benches of the retarding effect of increasing overhead charges on the farmers.  But, again, we have to balance that with the good of the community as a whole and the need there is for looking after other sections of the community.  The principal <Col N="2151" /> evil we have to face is that we have got a considerable unemployment problem.  We set out to try to remedy that by providing profitable employment&mdash;and when I say profitable, I mean productive employment; profitable in itself and profitable to the community, so that they would be able to produce more than they consumed, if at all possible.  We did that by finding industrial employment.  It is said by the Opposition: &ldquo;You have increased industrial employment; we do not deny that&rdquo;&mdash;it cannot be denied that there are 47,000 more employed in protected industries&mdash;&ldquo;but you are doing that at the expense of employment on the land.&rdquo;  That is a thing we deny.  We do not agree that it was at the expense of employment on the land.  We believe that if that employment was not given there would not be employment for those people at all.  We deny that our policy is of the type that it gives employment at one end and causes unemployment at the other.  I do not think it does.</P>
    <P>Whatever truth there is in what is called the flight from the country, whether it be from the rural parts to the towns, or from our country to neighbouring countries, I think that that is something that would have occurred very much more definitely and certainly if the policy of our opponents had been continued.  That is a matter nobody can prove; it is a matter of opinion between us.  I believe that the past is proof of it, because, in my opinion, the policy of the Opposition is not very much different from the policy that had been tried under the old British régime and by themselves over a period of ten years in which they had an opportunity of working to the full their own policy.  I think there was during that time a change from country to town&mdash;it is world wide&mdash;and that there was also emigration.  That emigration stopped, not because of the circumstances here, but because of conditions which prevented emigration to America at the time.  There is emigration of another sort taking place now, but I think it is only temporary.  I think it is mainly due to the fact that there are very attractive wages being <Col N="2152" /> paid across the water, because of the special situation there, due to the rush to rearm.  With regard to the flight from the land, that is a more fundamental matter, and is much harder to deal with in reality.  If anybody is able to stem that flood we would be very glad to hear of it.</P>

      <P>Can the Deputy not wait?  Give us a little time and do not destroy the satisfaction that is in anticipation. Unfortunately the flight from the land is a fact.  It is from the rural areas, and it is very difficult to see how people can be kept on the farm. As a matter of fact, there are not many farmers leaving, because if there were, numbers would be willing to take their places.  We are putting more people on the land and increasing the number of farms.  Certainly that is an attempt to keep people there.  We want to see as many people as possible on the land.  It is said agricultural labourers are not taking as kindly to that work now, and that we have not as many agricultural labourers employed on the land.  Of course, if you are going to have people working on small farms, and doing the labour themselves, with the help of their families, there would not be so many agricultural labourers.  They will not be needed.  A big holding employs a large number of agricultural labourers, but if a large farm is made into independent holdings, there will not be as many agricultural labourers needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2153" /> They will be replaced by the people on these holdings, the farmers, that we are planting on the land.  When there is talk of the flight from the country, and that the people are being taken from the land, that requires much closer examination than has been given to it, to see how many people are leaving.  That would be very difficult, but it can be examined.</P>

      <P>There is a big flow from villages, small towns and urban areas into the bigger centres.  The smaller centres are diminishing.  They carried on under a different system in the past.  There was not the opening up of the country that has taken place in recent years by modern methods of transport and other things, which have tended to bring the people to work and to business in larger centres.  There was a time when you had in a village beside a town or a farm&mdash;and I am thinking of a small village that I knew &mdash;two or three tailors, a couple of bootmakers, and harness-makers.  Going back to an earlier period I remember that we had mills, stone dressers, a blacksmith and people employed in services which were more or less ancillary to farming.  These people are no longer there, and the work is done in a different way.  That is a tendency for which I am sorry, but there is no use in hoping that we can put back the clock.  From the purely philosophical point of view that might have been a better existence, because when all is said and done contentment is the thing that matters most.  If we are content we are happy, and we feel that we are living a reasonable existence. No matter what wealth or conditions we have if we are discontented we are unhappy.  If a person is unhappy he is unhappy.  That is all there is about it. Material things will not help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the things the Government has to examine is, as to what method could be employed by which country life would be made more attractive for our own people.  We want to make it attractive.  It is difficult to see how these things will work out.  At one <Col N="2154" /> time I had the idea that it would help to make country life more enjoyable if we had radio sets made available cheaply for the people.  I said that to someone and his remark was that that was the curse of the country, because it was giving the people there ideas about town life, and painting visions of town life.  He said that was the principal cause of the attraction that was pulling people away from the country.  There was the opposite point of view.  It is not easy, sometimes, to be quite sure of the effect of a policy that may be tried in that regard.  To make country life more attractive, as far as the Government can do it, is the aim they have in mind, if they can achieve it by any means.</P>
    <P>We are considering how country life can be made more attractive, and we have, at some loss, brought industries as near to the land as possible.  We have tried to prevent the overgrowth of large towns, by doing everything we could to get industries established outside larger centres, where they would naturally grow, because if there was an economic urge people would go to the larger centres.  We try to keep them in the country.  We admit that the departure from the country areas, which is common to us and to other countries is, from our point of view, a national evil and a social loss, and if anyone can suggest anything effective that can be done about it, I am sure the Government will give it consideration, and, even if it put a little burden on the community, we would be glad to undertake that burden.  A still more serious question is the late marriage rate.  I regard that as the most serious of all.</P>

      <P>At any rate, it is an evil.  It is a great pity that such are the conditions.  I think it is a matter <Col N="2155" /> of mind more than material conditions, and I would like to put a thumping good tax on bachelors, and to let them carry more of the burden than they are carrying at present.  I am afraid there would be difficulties about that. I do know what the Minister for Finance would have to say about the general effects of it.  I do not know if it would induce them to marry if a tax were put on.  It is more a psychological matter.  To tell the truth, I think people are a bit too careful in these matters.  They want to be too well off.  If we could get the idea of having a little more courage into the minds of our people, if they felt that they would be much better off if they got married&mdash;and I tell them that they would be much better off&mdash;and if we got the proper outlook there, we might be able to remedy the position.  I do not think it is due absolutely, as the Labour Party suggested, to the economic position.</P>

      <P>It may be, to a certain extent, but I do not think it is the thing that is fundamentally responsible. It is very hard to find out why it is so with us.  I thought of the farmers, the farming position, and of those who are going to get the farms afterwards.  I thought of the position where the old man or woman would stay too long in control and there is no opportunity given to the man who is going to succeed them in the possession of the farm, to get married.  I was wondering was there any way in which that position might be remedied.  I was told by somebody who has watched conditions in Canada that they had a <Col N="2156" /> system in one province there by which the farm is given to the youngest son. The others were to leave as quickly as possible, those of them who had to leave the farm.  There was only one man to continue on the farm.  The idea was that they got rid of the older children by sending them to professions, to business, and so on.  They got away and they left the farm to the youngest son and that enabled the old pair to continue longer on the farm, and it did not prevent the young man from marrying at a reasonable age.</P>
      <P>There are difficulties of various kinds in regard to that.  They had the idea that when the young man came into possession of the land the old pair repaired to the neighbouring village, near the Chapel, and they got their vegetables, and so on, every Sunday, brought to them by the young man who succeeded to the farm.  A single example like that shows how certain things are operating.  Whether that was a complete picture or not, I do not know, but I do know that there would be difficulties in getting into a practice of that kind here.  We have these evils in regard to the land, we have certain hardships, we have a low marriage rate, and we have the problem of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To my mind, the question to which we should primarily address ourselves, as one which we ought to remedy, is the question of unemployment.  It is the most baffling problem with which we have to deal.  So far as I am concerned, I can say that I had hopes that the development of our industries would absorb most of the people who were unemployed and were prepared to work.  I do not think we have got a true picture of the unemployment situation as it is.  The Labour Party would say to us, &ldquo;You do not know it; you have not got a true picture; your picture is not as bad as the reality.&rdquo;  On the other hand, I am told that our figure, our picture, is worse than the reality; that the reality is not so bad as is represented by our statistics.  I am just giving you what I am told by people who have gone into the matter, that our statistics include a large number of people who are not unemployed <Col N="2157" /> in the ordinary sense, that they are people who, like most people in business, could be employed to a fuller extent.</P>
    <P>I am told that the unemployed, in the proper sense, do not form as large a number as is given in our statistics and that the statistics exaggerate the situation.  Even making deductions for that, it is still a position which we ought to try to remedy.  We had hopes that we would get a remedy through industrial production, through a better market for the farmers.  We had hopes that there would be more employment on the land to supply our industrial population and that there would be more work for our industrial population in supplying the rest of the community with commodities formerly brought from outside countries.  That was a reasonable hope and our figures have not proved, in effect, to be far wrong.  The number in increased employment does correspond to the number who were stated to be unemployed when we came into office.</P>
    <P>But other things have gone on at the same time, and we have still with us an unemployment problem.  I do not think that even the Labour Party will say it is relatively worse with us than it is in other countries, but at the same time I admit it is a serious problem which we ought to try to solve. Mind you, if I could see a real solution for it, I would not mind saying to the rest of the community that they should bear the burdens which would enable us to get the solution within a reasonable time.  The moment these people are put into productive employment, if we can find it for them, they will be the makers of wealth and not merely the consumers of it.</P>
    <P>As far as our social aims are concerned, we are at one with the Labour Party.  When I say our social aims, or our social objectives, I mean our effort to find for every member of the community as high a standard of material comfort as it is possible for us to get, as it is possible for the resources of our country to give.  I said some time ago that I believed in the social principles, or the social objectives, which were indicated in some of the minority reports, and I <Col N="2158" /> mentioned particularly the Third Minority Report.</P>
    <P>I read that report carefully, so far as the social objectives are concerned, and I think I could subscribe to practically everyone of them.  In fact, I think in every speech which I have made in regard to the aims of Fianna Fáil and the purposes we have in mind, you will find them almost parallel in that report.  Ours may not be so elegantly phrased, or so definitely expressed, but if you read over the speeches we made as to our economic policy you will find that the social objectives were practically the same as those contained in that report.</P>
    <P>A difficulty arises in regard to how we are trying to achieve these objectives. We have been trying to achieve our aims by using the national credit &mdash;and when I call it the national credit I mean the resources of the country&mdash; in order to bring about the conditions that we require.  We have been doing it in the social services and the development services&mdash;and we have been developing, in many directions. If there are large schemes of productive work that can be done&mdash;and by productive work I mean that what comes out as a result of the labour is more than goes in, and even if it came out equal we would be happy-we will endeavour to undertake them. But if you are putting into work more than comes out of it, if the value of the goods consumed by the workers in doing the work is more than the value of what is produced, then it is not productive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say pensions were productive and I did not say defence was, and neither did the Minister for Finance.  I think there was a misrepresentation or a misunderstanding of what he said, so far as I <Col N="2159" /> could read in the report.  We are talking about productive work.  If there is productive work to be got, that is, work the fruits of which will be greater than the amount of existing wealth consumed in the production, we will undertake it.  If the results are equal to what has been put into it, it is not unproductive, but if they are less, then it seems to me the existing wealth of the community is being diminished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have accepted it as a duty to the community to see that no member of the community will starve.  We have accepted the responsibility of preventing that, and there is no question that that would be voluntarily and regularly borne by our people if you could separate the sheep from the goats.  The trouble that imposes itself on our social services is that it is impossible to separate the sheep from the goats. When there is a question of important work to be done, we have to proceed in the same way as when we see the cockle growing up amongst the wheat &mdash;we have got to let it grow and try to deal with it otherwise.  The difficulty in our social services is that there are people availing of them who should not avail of them, and for whom they were not intended, and by administrative methods you are not able properly to eliminate them.  There is nobody in the community who would not willingly bear the burden, and sacrifice some of his individual wealth&mdash;and the wealth of the community as a whole can be classified into two parts, that of individuals and whatever community wealth we have&mdash;there is nobody, either the State regarded as the community as a whole, or the individuals in it, who would hesitate to sacrifice that, in order to help those who are genuinely in need of it and to provide work for those who are willing to work.  I have been informed&mdash;I do not know whether it is true, and I have asked for further examination of the matter&mdash;that there were 110 men required for a particular job, that 103 reported for it and seven others, supposed to be unemployed, did not report, and that a number of others left the job after a very short time, <Col N="2160" /> although the rate of pay, I think, was about 35/-.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only saying if it is true.  I asked somebody&mdash;an official&mdash;the question and I got this answer, and I am having it examined, but I do say that I have heard reports of all sorts about the same kind of thing, and I have heard reports even from farmers to the effect that people will not work for the farmers if they can get money from the State, and that even though the money is relatively small they prefer to do other work rather than work on the farms, or to take whatever they can get on what is called the dole.  As I say, the trouble there is to separate the sheep from the goats.  I know that the Labour Party does not want, and that no Party wants, to help those who do not want to work if they can get out of it.  Of course, I know that the Labour Party may not agree with us on the question of whether a wage is remunerative of not, just as&mdash;Deputy Davin mentioned &mdash;the farmers may differ with us about the price of beet.  That is natural, but there is one thing that the community does not want to do, and that we as a Government do not want to force the community to do, and that is to support people, for whom work is available, and who will not work, if there are any such people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the ideal type of work within our economy&mdash;I am talking now of individual economy and not purely collectivist economy&mdash;is work in which a person gives labour in return for the <Col N="2161" /> services and goods which he gets back. If we could achieve that, that is the ideal type of work, and our industries are valuable in helping to provide that type of work.  If you could provide that, the difficulties would regulate themselves, but in providing State work you have to consider whether you are making the community richer in terms of wealth or whether, by giving that work, you are only providing amenities and luxuries and leading to a situation in which we may be living beyond our means.</P>
    <P>Now, I may be wrong in regard to my way of looking at certain economic questions.  I have been in the habit of eliminating money in my economic speculations.  I know, of course, that you cannot do that, and that it is a partial view, but no matter what view you take, I can only see this ultimately in it: that money is an equivalent for what it can get, namely, an equivalent for goods and services.  Therefore, if you eliminate money for the moment and think in terms of goods and services, no matter what money you have or what you do with it, in the long run, it is only to be regarded from the point of view of its effect on the volume of goods and services.  The limits of our resources are the existing wealth of the community.  That wealth is in various forms, and includes, for instance, our external assets&mdash;that is, their equivalent in goods.</P>
    <P>When you say: &ldquo;Pledge the nation's credit to do this, that or the other thing&rdquo;, what you mean is: &ldquo;Make all the existing resources of the country available for these purposes.&rdquo; In so far as they are used up, there is a diminution of the wealth, but if there is an adequate return in increased production then you have increased the total wealth, and whenever you are able to do that, in my opinion, you can get the money and the resources will be made available for you.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If it should happen at any time that the control of the <Col N="2162" /> use of wealth, which we are by right enabled to exercise, should be denied, we would not hesitate to use our fundamental right to control it and to see that it was made available, but we will have to be reasonable in regard to it, and we cannot ask that wealth should be lost; we cannot ask that it should be put into things that are unprofitable and that will diminish our resources instead of increasing them. That is the test, and if there is, in any direction, one in which you can show that there is going to be more wealth for the community produced from the expenditure of the existing wealth, then I am all for it and I do not think you will have any difficulty whatever in getting resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Because building, according to the cost of production, and so on, is not productive in that sense.  It is not productive in that sense, and we are undertaking, to a certain extent, to assume it as a State burden and pay for it, to some extent, because it is not productive of itself, just the same as we are paying old age pensions.  We are paying for old age pensions because we are taking from a section of the community who have wealth and handing it over to people who have not got it, because we regard it as a social obligation on us to maintain these people.  As I say, you will get money if you are able to show that the purposes for which it is going to be employed are going to be productive.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not adopt Deputy Gorey's view at all.  I say that we have a social obligation to see that houses are built, but we must endeavour to carry that out with the least possible burden on the rest of the community.  We are undertaking it, not in the ordinary sense as an economic service, but as a social service, and we are paying for it, and paying fairly severely.  We ought to try to make building economic, if we can.  It was for that reason that I had an informal meeting of labour and other sections involved in the building trade.  I said: &ldquo;Cannot you come together so as to make the burden on the community less than it is and make it possible for the individuals who occupy these houses to pay the rents and give a return for the cost involved in the building of the houses?&rdquo;  That was an attempt to bring down the social burden which we are carrying, but I have tried during all my time to keep an open mind on this matter and to see if there was any way in which this work could be done more effectively, more justly and more economically than it has been done.  I have not found any way by which that can be done yet. I think that there is a fundamental fallacy in the belief that you can do this by creation of credit.  To me, it comes down to a demand on existing goods and services.  If you do not get more in return than you expend in producing or building, you are diminishing the wealth of the community. When you do that with your eyes open, as we are doing in the case of housing, well and good.  You can balance the advantages and disadvantages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Though I have tried to understand it, I have not been satisfied that those who talk about the creation of credit are on the right lines.  I am not going to talk about what has been done elsewhere. <Col N="2164" /> I do not want to talk about New Zealand.  I should like very much if New Zealand were successful in trying out a certain principle.  However, I should like to see it tried by other countries than ourselves before adopting it.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to be led, by any interruption, into discussing that question.  What I say is that there has been no experiment yet which has proved the contention of those who say that you can, by the creation of credit, get rid of all these problems.  <i>A priori,</i> I approach the matter in the way which has been mentioned by Deputy O'Sullivan&mdash;that it is just a little bit too easy.  If you could do this, you could do all sorts of things and reduce the position to an absurdity.  However, it is right in principle that the State should have control of the use of wealth&mdash;in other words that it should be in a position to say that wealth should not be used in a particular way if it is to the public detriment.  If it is to the public interest that it should be used in a particular way, it should be capable of regulating it in that way.  We shall have to come to decisions on these proposals. At the moment, I am giving a personal view.  My own belief is that we have at present the right of control. We can pass a law at any time to control the banks or to sever parity with sterling.  We can do all these things. It is merely a question of whether it is wise or unwise to do them.  We have the power.  There is no question whatever about that.  To that extent, it is all nonsense to say we are merely the creatures of the banks.  If we saw good reason for it, we could exercise the sovereign rights which we possess. In the past, we have, I think, shown that we were ready to face any obligations of that sort when we saw our way clear to do so.  But before you embark on projects such as this, you want to see your way very clearly.</P>

      <P>The finest work of <Col N="2165" /> art can be smashed with a hammer or a hatchet in a moment although it may have taken a very long time to produce.  I do not say that our economic system is, by any means, a work of art, but its development has taken a long time.  I should have more admiration for it if there were not so many evils attaching to it, but my fear is that we may go from one set of evils into another of a much more dangerous kind&mdash;evils which we shall not be able to remedy and which would impose far greater burdens and sacrifices upon us than would the remedying of the unemployment problem.  It would be a heavy burden and it would reduce the standard of living of many of us but, if we wanted to do it, we could take the thousands of people who are out of work and give them a couple of pounds a week.  That would involve a very heavy cost.  The Labour Party say that we should do it the other way&mdash; by putting the people to work.  I say &ldquo;Show us the productive work and we will do it.  Give us an indication as to where productive work is to be got.&rdquo; We are told about afforestation.  We have examined that and are going ahead with it but Deputies should examine it as coldly as we have to do. It would add to our prestige to do these things.  We should gain by solving these problems.  Why do we hesitate? Is it suggested that I am or that other members of the Government are creatures of the banks or have an interest in them?  Nothing of the kind. We are anxious to get these things done and we will not be happy until they are done.</P>

I can assure Deputies that I am trying with my whole heart and soul to solve these problems in the best possible way and that I am not tied to any system. I think that the same is true of the other members of the Government.  The point is that, in the existing system, you see where you are, you know its methods and you know its evils.  You <Col N="2166" /> can try to cut off these evils or remedy them.  I believe that, at the moment, heavy as the burden would be, great as the economic strain would be, it would be possible to give these unemployed people the wherewith to live and that it would be better to do that than to adopt a system which might produce evils of another kind&mdash;evils which Deputies on the Labour Benches will not face up to.  I am merely asking them to try to meet the arguments put up as to the consequences that would follow from this plan for the creation of credit.  Let them think of the increase of prices which would result.</P>

The Minister for Finance, any more than I, is not tied to any system but he and I and every member of the Government have to face the situation and try to reason and we cannot blink facts as some of the people on the opposite benches are trying to do.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  Let us examine it and see whether we are able to do it and to what extent we are able to do it.  We hear the expression &ldquo;productive work&rdquo; used constantly by the people who are in favour of social credit.  I say, show us in what direction the productive work is to be done.  They will tell us that it is to be found in afforestation.  Yes, but production in afforestation does not begin for a certain period.  It is not productive at the moment.  At the moment the existing wealth has to be utilised in order to get it going.  We will not get return from that work for many years, and although it may be productive and although it may be in the interests of the nation, the nation existing over a long time, and not the <Col N="2168" /> individual, it is not productive at the moment.  I believe it may be in the nation's interest to live within its income at the moment or to tighten its belt to enable these future assets to be built up but I would not call it productive in that sense at the moment.  It will ultimately be productive but, &ldquo;live horse and you will get grass&rdquo; is a very old proverb.  The nation can do it as a whole and we are doing it to a certain extent, but there is a limit to that also.</P>
      <P>We were told we could develop in other directions, for instance, in the reclamation of land.  We are doing it, but the trouble at the moment is that we are not using even the land we have got to the fullest advantage. There is probably more productive work in ordinary industry than there would be in afforestation, speaking from the point of view of strict productivity.  If we can get plans we will have no hesitation in embarking upon them.  We are developing our forests.  There is an examination of any mineral resources we have in order to try to develop them and in so far as these can be developed at all and are found to be productive we pursue it, but the moment we pass from productive to unproductive work we, ultimately, have either the production of goods in one form or another or our effort is passed on to the production of amenities.  We are willing to pay a good deal and to give a good deal of labour in order to get these amenities and services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are prepared to provide water supplies.  Our people are prepared to give the other services which are represented by money and to give of their wealth in order to get water supplies and amenities of various kinds such as better roads.  Good roads to a certain extent are obviously and definitely economic because they lighten in one form or another the cost of transport and in that sense may be regarded as enabling production to be carried on.  But there are other things which are not of that character and the moment we go into that sort of production we are somewhat in the position (though this may not be a good analogy) of a family with a large <Col N="2169" /> estate where some members would be employed on the estate making fish ponds or something of that sort. They might say that this would be a finer estate if this thing is done.  We have a choice of either to give those members their material needs from the community resources or put them to work, but the moment we put them to work there is something else: we have got to get materials for them and these materials have to be secured from existing wealth.  Therefore we are putting into whatever we are doing other materials as well as labour.</P>
    <P>I say then that we have a certain amount of resources.  If these resources can be turned, by any method, into more productive channels, all right.  If they cannot, let us face the loss with the knowledge that the things we are doing are worth the loss but let us remember that we are producing amenities and that we are losing some of the existing wealth.  I was trying to talk not in terms of money but in terms of concrete wealth other than money, but when we talk about money, what is it?  If I have money it is no good to me unless it is a claim on a certain amount of goods or services or the things that we ordinarily can secure by means of money. In so far as it secures these it is the equivalent of them, and in so far as credit is used for productive purposes it is of two kinds, first for private enterprise and secondly, for public works.  If we use it for private enterprise, even if we have control of it, if we set up a State machinery to do what the commercial banks are doing, we have to operate in practically the same way as the commercial banks are operating.</P>
    <P>We have set up the Industrial Credit Company and we have got the Agricultural Credit Corporation.  The complaint is that these are operating exactly as the others.  Yet, they are not out for gain in the ordinary sense; they are not merely a trading firm simply out to make profits as such. They are there for a public purpose and a public utility.  Yet they have to operate in the main, if they are going to continue without losing the wealth <Col N="2170" /> which they control at the moment, very largely on the same principles as those on which commercial banks are operating.  One of the things which I think the Labour Party will admit is that the commercial banks as such, dealing with commercial transactions and the ordinary commercial business of the country, have no very grave complaints against them.  I do not think they have.  Certainly there is no complaint against them in any of the reports I have seen.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  If the State had control of credit for the stimulation of production that is carried out by private individuals, private corporations, and so on, I think it would have to operate on, roughly, the same principles as the commercial banks and probably would not operate any better because the principle on which it would have to work would be the same&mdash;that what it gave it would expect to get at least that amount back&mdash;that it would cover its losses. I do not know what the Labour Party may mean by credit.  I know the general derivation of the word and its general connotation mean belief, trust, confidence in repayment&mdash;repayment by getting back at least as much as is taken away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Why should not the State or the Government have control of that credit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to that in due time.  I am just trying to see that there is agreement as to what we are talking about.  When credit is given by a bank, whether it is a State bank or an ordinary commercial bank, something is given to the person who gets it, which he can utilise in procuring material things he may need or amenities.  When it is given there is an expectation of repayment.  That is what credit means.  It is trust that you will get back again what you give. If the State does that, then the State <Col N="2171" /> has a trust in so far as it is utilising the credit of the nation or of the community.  What I understand by it is that it is directing a certain portion of the community's wealth and handing it over to an individual, if you are thinking of private individuals, to be used. When I say a portion of the nation's wealth I do not mean to say that I am not thinking collectively, because the State has the power of direction.  For instance, if it were good in the national interest to say that we were not going to put money into the building of picture houses, I think the State would have the right, if it considered that to be a social evil and that it was wrong that individual wealth should be used in that way, to say that it should not be done.  We are exercising control like that every other day, not quite of course in that way, but sovereign control over say the use of private property for the general welfare.  But whether we do it, or whether the banks do it, there is a diversion, a giving over of a portion of the nation's wealth, in the expectation that more is coming back to the pool.  If that expectation is there, then, whether this is done by the State or in the other way that I have been speaking of, you have to ask: &ldquo;If I give this individual or this corporation this thing to be used, will I get it back?  It belongs to me and to other individuals, and will it be returned to the pool?&rdquo;  If it is returned there is no diminution of it, but the people who give it may well say: &ldquo;If I had not given it I could have used it otherwise, and could have got more interest on it.&rdquo;  The State, or the banks, taking other people's wealth may well ask, if compelled to use it in a particular way, what return should they get.  They expect to get a certain thing back, but may say that if they used it otherwise they could have got more back.  Therefore, when you consider all this you cannot eliminate the question of reasonable interest.  What is reasonable interest is another question.  Suppose you were to set up a State bank, in my opinion you would have to operate it on practically the same lines as the commercial banks.  The argument is made <Col N="2172" /> that you will stimulate production by lending money or advancing credit to private individuals or private corporations. I think the advocates of social credit are thinking of what they call public work: something that would not ordinarily be done by private corporations.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to get some clarification of it now.  So far as public control is concerned, we have the right to have that at the moment.  Take the question of a central bank which has been recommended in the report. We could take over the control of the volume of credit that is generally exercised by central banks, but the question is how are we going to use it. There is no question at all about our right to do that.  We could set up a central bank to-morrow.  This House could meet and, within a week, if we had our plans ready, we could do here everything that was necessary to be done in the matter of setting up a central bank.  We could arrange it so that the control would be exercised at our own will, as we thought best in our interests, and not because of any compulsion exercised by any other machine under which we were operating.  The trouble comes when you try to operate it.  You have to ask yourselves, what is the best way to operate it in the interests of the community.  I say that we ought to have here people who would be expert enough to manage a <Col N="2173" /> central bank if there was occasion for exercising control in a manner different from that in which it is being exercised at present.</P>
      <P>Deputies on all sides will agree, I think, that if we wanted to do that we have the power to do it.  They would probably agree with the report that it would be wise to set it up, but there might be differences of opinion between the Parties in the House when we came to consider the powers and the constitution of a central bank.  As regards our right to set it up, nobody would question that.  Whether we will do so or not is a matter that is under consideration by the Government; the manner in which it will be composed, the powers that will be given to it, and so on.  All that naturally will have to be considered by the Government in connection with this report.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that it is one of the things that will have to be dealt with immediately in connection with the report.  Our relation with sterling will also naturally have to be considered. There have been some arguments given for keeping parity with sterling and some arguments against it.  We will have to weigh up all those arguments and come here with our recommendations to the Dáil.  There is no use, in matters of this kind, in going blindly along and refusing to see dangers&mdash; what the advantages are as well as the disadvantages.  There is no use in going blindly in one direction because there seems to be a certain amount of propaganda in one direction or the other.  These are very serious matters that require serious consideration. What I want to say at the moment is this: that I am not convinced by anything that I have read or seen so far that the method of the expansion of credit, which is suggested by Deputies, would achieve the results which they have in mind, or that they would achieve those results without danger and damage which they are not prepared to face or to contemplate.  Surely with our responsibilities, we should not be asked to embark on schemes of that sort unless the arguments and the plans were certain, unless we were able to see fairly clearly how to meet the difficulties which we apprehend.</P>

I have tried to look at the matter with an open mind, and I am not satisfied that what has been suggested by the Labour Party would do the job or do it without evils which would have a far greater effect.  There are people who think money will organise automatically for them; I think it will not. That is a fundamental assumption, that money will automatically organise, that if work is available somewhere people will go after that work.</P>
      <P>I do not think so.  I think that Clonsast bog can be developed and employment given on it, but there will still be workers here in the towns who are not fit for and would not do that type of work.  You have people here who have been trained in one particular business, and if that business disappears they are not going to be found fit for any work that is much different.  It may be said that that will be only a casual, an incidental, an intermittent stage, and cannot be prevented.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Labour Party&mdash;who are thinking of the chronic unemployment&mdash;that there is no one feeling as keenly as I do about that problem, seeing the young men of 17 to 21 years of age going about without having an opportunity of earning their own livelihood.</P>

I only differ in this respect from the Labour Party's view in that I believe the remedy which they think they have is not a remedy.  I do not believe that they have tried to examine all the consequences, or that they have kept an open mind in examining the consequences that may flow from that policy.  If I am wrong, I would be one of the first here&mdash;as I wish well to New Zealand&mdash;to try to see the evils in the present economic system and have them removed.  If there is available anywhere, in any part of the world, information that that problem is solved, I assure them that we will look with anxiety to see how it has been done.  I wish well, and so does any member of the Government, to the New Zealand Government and to the people of New Zealand in their efforts.  We are not to be asked, however, to accept that as having been a success.  I do not think that it has been proved to be a success, though I do not want to say that it is a failure.</P>

      <P>There are people who are looking ahead, who are convinced and who say that it is a failure.  We cannot deny them the right to do that. I am trying to preserve an open mind with regard to any solutions there may be for the evils from which we are suffering here.  They are suffering also in the United States, in England and elsewhere.  It is a terrible thing that there are people prepared to work at suitable work, who want to get the reward of their labour, and who, somehow or other, are not able to get the opportunity.  We ought not to be content until we get some sort of solution. My anxiety, however, is to get a real solution.  I would ask the Labour Party particularly to examine this question, not to go wildly about it, to see whether the consequences which I suggest would flow from the course they propose would, in fact, flow or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was talking about credit for private <Col N="2176" /> and public purposes.  We have used it in the case of housing and we know that we are putting a burden on the community.  We are doing that with our eyes open and we intend to go on doing it.  It is, however, our duty to see that the burden on the community, as a whole, is as light as possible, to see that building costs are cut down, to see that, by planning, houses are built at the cheapest possible rate so long as they are good and suitable houses.  We want to get the workers, the building contractors, the builders' providers, the banks and any others concerned in the supply of credit, to come together and see to what extent their advantage will lie in, for example, having a continuous building programme for, say, five years.</P>
    <P>Here in the City of Dublin houses are badly needed.  Can they not, by seeing there are at least 2,000 houses produced every year, recognise an advantage to the workers in giving them continuous employment, an advantage to the contractors in that there will be a number of workers regularly employed at a definite task for which they will be able to equip themselves in advance, and an advantage to the builders' providers, too, who will know that they will have to supply material for regular periods and that they will not be either over-stocked or understocked?</P>
    <P>We ask these sections of the community to get together and, in their own interest and in the common interest, to direct their efforts towards the provision of houses at prices which may not be as severe and as uneconomic as they are at the present time. To the extent to which they are uneconomic the community as a whole is bearing the burden; and the Banking Commission says we should not bear that burden or burdens of that sort. I say that we have the choice&mdash;either to allow the evil to continue or to use the whole national resources to remedy it.  I am for using those resources, but I want it remedied with the least burden on the community. That is our duty.  We are not going to stop doing it, but we are going to see that the work will be carried out as economically as possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2177" /> There is a social duty devolving upon us to undertake that work and we are not hesitating to undertake it. We are adding to the rents that will be paid by the occupiers of these houses with a view to trying to make them economic.  If we could make them economic through the rents alone, without addition, that would be the ideal situation, but we have to choose between not building these houses and using our national resources to build them.  We have chosen to build and we do not propose to stop doing it&mdash;no more than we propose to stop land division or such other things, until we have finished the job. We are not going to blind the public and pretend that we are doing that without cost.  We know that it is costly and the Banking Commission reveals that cost.  We say, notwithstanding that fact, we will continue. We will do our best to make those costs as light as possible, but that is not going to deter us from continuing.</P>
    <P>I am sure I have wearied the House, but this subject is so full of side issues that it is almost impossible to speak without referring to them.  However, as regards the resolution, which really is a vote of censure on the Government, we are going to deal with it as we would deal with a vote of censure: we are going to oppose it.  With regard to the amendment by the Labour Party, I am only able to guess at what they mean.  I can only say that I see consequences at the moment which would follow upon the adoption of that amendment, which I would not be justified&mdash;and the Government would not be justified&mdash;in accepting.  What they are trying to do by a particular method we are trying to do by other methods.  I would, therefore, ask the House to reject the principal motion as being really a vote of censure on the Government.  I ask them to reject the amendment as proposing a solution which, as far as we can see, we are not satisfied is a solution at all.</P>
    <P>The more I hear these matters discussed the more confident am I that the policy which the Government has adopted is right in general.  Undoubtedly, a great deal of tightening can be done in any organisation or in any</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2178" /> Government.  As far as the Government can reduce the burdens on the community and reduce the overhead charges, which add to the cost of all producers, we are going to reduce them.  As far as we can do that, without giving up the social services which are benefiting the country as a whole we shall do it.</P>

      <P>I hope that Deputies generally will realise that they are not muzzled when they leave the precincts of this House, and that there is many a spot in the country where the things that are said here should be re-echoed time and time again.  I sympathise with Deputy Alderman Byrne on the question of the length of speeches, but I only sympathise with him from one particular point of view.  I welcome, from another point of view, the length of the speeches that we have had on this subject; and I would welcome longer time to be able to discuss it, if that were possible.  The type of speech that has <Col N="2179" /> been made on this debate from the Government Benches indicates to me that nothing very serious will be lost if this debate does conclude to-day.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach says that the motion on the Order Paper by Deputy Dillon and myself is a motion of want of confidence in the Government.  The motion was put down on the offer of the Taoiseach that Government time would be made available to discuss certain aspects of the Banking Commission Report.  The motion was put down for nothing but to provide the opportunity which the Taoiseach indicated he was ready to make available.  The debate was opened on Wednesday, and no Government spokesman got into the debate until the last speaker at night.  The contribution made by the one Government speaker to the debate on Wednesday was such that he had two hours more of his contribution to carry over until the next day, and, in so far as a reasonable, systematic and thoughtful discussion of the points raised in the motion is concerned, the Minister for Finance, and now the Taoiseach, have made it utterly impossible for the House to face up systematically to it.  The motion was put down to have a reasonable and closely-argued discussion, and for no other reason.  In the circumstances disclosed by the Minister for Finance and by the Taoiseach, certainly so far as I am concerned, this motion is, and the division which will be taken on this motion will be intended to be, a vote of very definite want of confidence in the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What did we hear from the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach?  The Minister for Finance, in discussing the report and the indications of conditions generally in the country found in some of the facts recorded there, said, &ldquo;The condition is not so grave as it may have appeared,&rdquo; that is, to the members of the Banking Commission, and that the situation had changed. The Taoiseach said: &ldquo;There is nothing worse in the position than is in these reports.&rdquo;  The Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach implied that, when, in this month of 1939, we are discussing the effect of overtaxation, <Col N="2180" /> the effect of debt, the want of suitable productivity in the country, and the creation of poverty and unemployment and of a lowering standard of living here, the situation is not worse now than it was when the Banking Commission reviewed the situation and made their report.  It is a very astonishing comment.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach indicated that what is wanted is the broad view, a fundamental consideration of the whole situation and he indicated that, very often, these things are done in the quiet of his own room.  That is just what is wrong apparently.  The Taoiseach may have his fundamental consideration, he may have his broad plan, but, inevitably, the broad plan operates on the individual man and woman trying to earn a livelihood here and trying to bring up their families. There obviously has been too much of the retiring to the quiet of Ministers rooms to consider the situation.  So far from the situation being no worse, to say the least of it, than it was in 1937, the situation in nearly every respect of economic life that one can review here is substantially worse.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, for the purpose of pointing his argument, indicated that there was a substantial improvement within the last few years, that the Banking Commission Report showed the worst of the picture, and he was apparently consoling himself, that the economic war having passed, a position had been established now in which we have access to the British market&mdash;as a matter of fact, it is now boasted that we have a better position in the British market than we ever had before&mdash;and in which agricultural exports are rising.  The Couéism which the Government have brought to bear on their own actions, and which they try to bring to bear on the people, is still operating on them, and they think that because they quote a few figures showing that agricultural exports have improved, everything else is all right.  In some instances, the Taoiseach compares 1931 with the present day.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Both the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach apparently adopt the attitude that because the futilities of the Government in the last few years have been stopped, in regard to a dispute over moneys with Great Britain, a dispute in the settlement of which it is very questionable on whose side the financial advantage lies, and a little more money is coming in now for agricultural produce, everything is bound to be all right. They have carried Couéism which has been one of their principal arms of construction in the country to the extent of saying that the situation is no worse now than it was two years ago.  I wonder what do they mean?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach boasted, as one of the signs that things were bound to be better in the future, that we had a greater increase in crops than in 1931. But during the last two years the ploughed land in this country has declined by 52,000 acres.  During the last two years the number of men, 18 years of age and over, employed on the land has fallen by 23,000; and in an attempted glossing over of the fact that there was a fall in the number of agricultural labourers, the Taoiseach indicated that we were dividing the land at a very substantial rate and more people were employed necessarily as farmers because of that division. But the facts during the last two years are that the number of farmers and the number of farmers' families employed on the land has decreased by 6,767; the number of permanent agricultural labourers has decreased by 8,874 and the number of temporary agricultural labourers by 6,626.  That is the improvement that is supposed to be going on in the country so far as agriculture is concerned.  There was a fall of 52,000 acres in the area under the plough and 22,267 less male adult people were employed on the land during the last two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During these two years hundreds of thousands of pounds were spent on dividing the land and this is the result. We complain of the huge taxation both direct and private that is creating that position on the land.  While the Executive Council tell us through their spokesmen that things are better here, <Col N="2182" /> emigration in the last two years was up by 61,000 persons.  The population fell by 30,000 in the last two years.  During these two years the home assistance authorities throughout the country, not to talk of the unemployment assistance authorities, have been catering for an increasing number of unemployed men. Let us take the City of Dublin.  During every single month this year there was a substantial number of persons unemployed over the number unemployed last year and over the number of persons unemployed the previous year. There is a substantial number of men receiving unemployment assistance over the number receiving unemployment assistance last year and very much more than the year before.  The figures for May show that 4,964 more men had to be paid unemployment assistance than in the year 1937, and that 2,981 had to get unemployment assistance more than in the year 1938.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach indicated that things had developed in industry and he compared 1937 with 1931.  I suggest to him that the figures in the <i>Trade Journal</i> for June which is now available to Deputies are worth examination.  In the year 1938 there were eight different industries showing a substantial decline in their net output.  But the total increase in the net output between 1931 and 1937 was £8,780,000 in the eight industries of which I spoke.  There was a fall of £809,000 in the value of the net output in 1938 as compared with 1937.  In all 16 industries had been reported on in the <i>Trade Journal.</i>  We have the figures of their production for 1938.  In some of them there have been increases and in some decreases but the net reduction in output in the whole 16 industries is £643,000.  The net reduction in employment in the 16 industries is 2,301 persons.  When the Taoiseach speaks of increased industrial production here, he speaks of the gross increase in industrial production between 1931 and 1937 of £33,000,000, but the actual working out which is the real definite production in the country on which wages arise, is £8,780,000. More than £600,000 of that figure disappeared last year.</P>
    <P>The £33,000,000 means nothing but the accumulated raw materials that <Col N="2183" /> have been imported from outside and have been used here and the duplication of raw materials that have been supplied within the country.  Every scrap of additional taxation as affecting raw materials is included in it.  A million pounds worth of tobacco, and the excise duties on it, are wrapped up in the £33,000,000 the Taoiseach speaks about and which is used simply as a part of the Coué system.</P>
    <P>When we were recording that in 1937 there was a net increase of £8,787,000 in industrial production here, the farmers were recording that £14,000,000 was the decrease in the value of agricultural production.  Not only during this last year has there been recorded a substantial fall in the acreage under the plough, a substantial fall in the number of men employed in the area under agriculture, but there has been an increase in the number of men receiving home assistance and a substantial increase&mdash;in Dublin particularly, but Dublin conditions are only a reflex of the conditions in the country&mdash;in the number of persons unemployed and in receipt of unemployment assistance.  There has been a substantial reduction within the past year in the numbers employed in industries here and a substantial decrease in the amount of our industrial output.  There has been a reduction in the number employed in the brewing industry of 201, in bacon curing of 95, in shirt-making of 101, in hosiery of 280, in woollen and worsteds of 423, in boots and shoes of 183, in assembly and construction of motor vehicles of 476, and in railways and tramways of 487.</P>
    <P>Some of the industries which deal with the necessaries of life, the natural industries for this country that the Taoiseach speaks about, also show a fall in the employment given.  Not only has there been a fall in industries of a general character but also in the industries which the Taoiseach said he desired should produce things for the ordinary consumption of the people, such as the necessaries of life.  He instanced bacon and bread.  He wanted to develop the bacon industry, the production of pigs and the production of wheat.  Bacon consumption, as already <Col N="2184" /> indicated, has been substantially reduced as the result of the price of bacon here.</P>
    <P>The consumption of bacon had gone down by 255,000 cwts. in 1937 and, for the smaller amount of bacon consumed, the people had to pay £1,000,000 more than they had to pay for the larger quantity.  In 1938 there was a further substantial reduction in the amount of bacon consumed by our people.  To the 255,000 cwts. taken out of the mouths of the people as the result of overtaxation, there was an addition of 38,000 cwts. in the fall in bacon consumption last year.  As regards bread, the people at the present time are consuming 13,000,000 2 lb. loaves less than they were getting before the Fianna Fáil Party started to look after the provision of bread for the people. In every aspect of life, there are indications to-day that the situation is worse than it was 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>Our complaint is that down on top of that situation, a huge additional burden of taxation is being imposed. At a time when taxation should be lightened in order to give the people a chance of more profitably expending the moneys they are earning, a substantial increase in taxation is being imposed upon them.  We had some very wide flung social and economic discussions in the four hours' talk by the Minister for Finance and the three and a half hours' talk by the Taoiseach. Out of the remarks of the Minister for Finance and of the Taoiseach, there does come the idea that they do now regard the amount that this country can get from exporting its agricultural produce as a matter of very vital concern to the people of the country.  That is something, but they are not doing anything that would show that they realise the importance of it.  In every part of the world, quickening steps are being taken to improve the technique of agricultural production and to improve the methods of marketing agricultural produce.  Members of the Government know that during the last seven years, not only has every opportunity that offered to increase our agricultural exports been lost, but a situation has been created here under which nothing could be done to improve <Col N="2185" /> either the technique of our agricultural production or the organisation of our agricultural marketing.  Everything that should have been done to maintain the market in Great Britain, in which, traditionally, and because of circumstances of the past, we had a right to expect preferential treatment, was simply left undone.</P>
    <P>One would imagine, having regard to the claim of the Government, that we have now a better position in the British market than we ever had before, that something would be done to help our farming community to struggle out of the unfortunate position into which they have been forced during the last seven years and that some attempt would have been made to take advantage of the alleged better condition in which we are on that market.</P>
    <P>What is the position?  The farmers have been crippled.  Their production has been interfered with.  They were told that their type of production should be changed.  Now, the British market has to be sought for exactly the same type of production as that for which our farmers organised themselves in the past, because they found it was the best paying type of production. There is no change in the views of the Government as to the type of agricultural produce should go into the British market.  No attempt is being made to enable our farmers to take advantage of the condition of affairs that exists there.  Why?  Because the great majority of the people running individual farms in this country are reduced to a position in which they cannot run them on an efficient scale. Agricultural credit has been sought in order that, in the changed circumstances now, the farmers may put themselves in a position to send again to the British market the quantity and the type of products which they sent there in the past.</P>
    <P>While we are told here and in the Seanad that nothing can be done to give the farmers special credit at the present time, there is money available for representation in Canada, which would have been more valuable if it could have been got in 1934; there is <Col N="2186" /> money to be made available for a school of theoretical physics, when what is wanted in this country is a school which would make it possible for political and economic arithmetic to be understood without being twisted in one way or another by the political Couéism of any particular Party in the country; there is money available to make it possible to promise us that our peat will be turned into electricity; there is money available for tourist development, but there is no consideration at all as to what credit could be given to the farmers to-day either without loss to the State, or, if there were any problematical loss possible in it, at a loss that would be no greater than the amount of money which had been scattered on schemes that certainly are most unproductive.  Additional money has been promised to-day.</P>
    <P>During the last few years £504,000 have been spent on turf.  What is the result of it?  The only result is that about 1 per cent.&mdash;not even 1 per cent. &mdash;more turf has been cut in the country than there was in 1931.  But, after spending on turf in the last three or four years the sum of £504,000, none of which will in my opinion ever come back, the last two years have shown us a fall in the amount of turf that has been provided, but an increase in the alleged value of it.  One of the economic circumstances is that in 1935 there were 3,659,000 tons of turf cut in the country, and the value placed on it was 17/- a ton.  In the last year for which we have information, that is 1937, there were 70,000 less tons of turf cut in the country, but the value of the turf was 19/3 a ton, or 2/3 extra per ton.  For the smaller amount of turf we had in the country we had to pay £346,000 more.  That is what we got from Government expenditure.</P>
    <P>Even if the Government were satisfied that during the next five years there would be a loss of £500,000 in the odd bad debts that might arise from giving the farmers credit to get themselves over their present position, and to seize the old position that they had in the British market, we would get something for that money.  All we have got for an expenditure of £540,000 on turf is an increase in the cost of the <Col N="2187" /> turf which has been cut, and a diminution in the quantity in the last couple of years.  We were able to spend £444,000 on industrial alcohol in the last three years.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in answer to a question the other day, gave particulars of the working of the factories during the last potato season.  During the last potato season the sum of £444,000 was spent on the production of industrial alcohol.  What happened?  The industry paid £3,425 in wages, and £18,949 worth of potatoes were bought. That is the result of an expenditure of £444,000 on industrial alcohol.  Now, when the economic and financial and political futility of the economic war has passed, and when some recognition should be given to the losses suffered by the farming community during that time, they are simply told: &ldquo;You have a better position in the British market now than ever you had, and nothing else is to be done.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>An Agricultural Commission is investigating the matter.  Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party have themselves indicated what they think is going to come from the Agricultural Commission. Whatever is going to come from it, a period of time must elapse, and there is no time to let elapse in the face of the economic factors of the present position.  It will take some time after the restoration of the agricultural industry before anything really substantial can be done to improve the unemployment situation in the City of Dublin.  It will take some time after the restoration of the agricultural industry to get back to work on Irish land the 43,000 men whom the last four years have put off it. When talking of the value of the home market, Ministers must know that the only possible way of improving the position of the Irish farmer in the next year or two is to export more.  The conditions brought about here have shown that while the industrial side can be developed here, and while the Pat Murphys of the town can be turned into a market for the Irish farmer inside tariff and quota walls, unless the earning capacity is there in the country they will be eating less bread and using less clothing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2188" /> What is the position in which we stand to-day when the statement is made that we are in a better position than ever in the British market?  The figures for 1938, which have been quoted with approbation by the Minister for Finance as showing an improved position, indicate that on fat cattle, calves, sheep and pigs the Irish farmer is still losing £5,000,000 that he got before Fianna Fáil came into office. The present Government came into office in 1932, when the previous Government had decided to sit down with the British Government and see how the effects of the depression of 1929 and 1930 could be got over, and how the agricultural output of this country to Great Britain could be restored.  It was the position of the farmer in 1931, when his income had been lowered, that induced the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Industry and Commerce at that time to go to Great Britain in the beginning of 1932 and to come back with a preferential 10 per cent. protection for our produce in the British market against the Dutch and against the Danes.  It was in order to better the 1931 position that we had arranged that Ministers representing this State would go to Ottawa to discuss with the British, with the Canadians, with the South Africans, with the Australians, and with the New Zealanders, how best to improve mutually our economic position.</P>
    <P>When I say that the Irish farmer to-day is getting £5,000,000 less than he was getting in a particular year, I am relating it to the year in which things were so bad that we had to undertake special discussions.  Those special discussions did not come to anything.  The 10 per cent. preference went waste.  The discussions at Ottawa did nothing except the reverse of what we might have anticipated.</P>
    <P>The economic war was embarked on, although the chief representative of the Irish Government, when he returned from Ottawa and stood on the pier at Dun Laoghaire, told the people of this country that things were practically settled.  Instead of things being practically settled, we have had five years of loss and futility.  Now, when it is all over, the position is that in <Col N="2189" /> live animals alone our farmers are getting £5,000,000 less than they were getting in 1931.  But there is a more serious side to it.  The exports of fat cattle are down by £2,715,000.  We have lost half of our fat cattle trade.  Eight hundred factories have been established in this country, according to the Taoiseach yesterday; 900 have been established, according to the Taoiseach to-day.</P>
    <P>How many factories does the wiping out of our finished cattle industry to the extent of one half represent?  In calves we are done £500,000; in sheep, £796,000; and in pigs we are down nearly £2,000,000.  Let not the Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Education say that the reason we are down in pigs is because we are now sending more bacon to the British market.  We are exporting £1,041,000 more of bacon, but we are exporting £1,060,000 less of pork.  So that we can wipe out, as a book-keeping item in this particular argument, the increase in bacon as against the fall in pork, and we can say definitely that the losses of our farmers, as compared with 1931, even with last year's improved position, amount to £2,000,000 in the export of pigs and, between dead poultry and eggs, £1¼ million.</P>
    <P>It would be easy for our farmers to get that position back if the statement of the Minister for Finance is true; that we are in a better position in the British market now as the result of the negotiations with Great Britain than ever we were.  But has any consideration been given to the position of the Irish farmer with regard to the credit that he wants to enable his industry to be efficient?  The man who has a ten-cow farm and who, as a result of the wastages of the last few years, is now left with six or seven cows, must get back to the ten-cow position before he can be efficient. The same applies in dozens of other directions.  The farmer is also hit by the fact that £2,482,000 is being lost through the fall in the exports of beer. We did not hear anything in this debate as to what is being done to restore our fat cattle industry.  Is it <Col N="2190" /> the position that our fat cattle industry is gone for ever in the way in which Ministers used to think of it before?  What is being done to restore our fat cattle industry, the £2,000,000 we are losing on pigs, the £1¼ million we are losing on poultry? Is there any chance of doing something so to reverse the policy of the Government that we will get back some of the £2½ million we have lost in the export of beer?</P>
    <P>The only interpretation that can be put on the long rambling speeches of the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach is that they want to keep away from these definite points because nothing is going to be done.  It is because nothing is going to be done in respect of these that we say that the burden must be taken off the backs of our agricultural community in some way, and they must be allowed to do their work without interference.  It is quite right in modern circumstances that the Government here should concern themselves with the general wellbeing of the community and the relief and assistance of those people who cannot provide for themselves in the present economic circumstances.  But, no scheme, however well planned, for social services, for relief of any kind, or even for the carrying on of the ordinary machinery of Government here, can be maintained except in relation to the value of the production in the country.  We can help to make firmer the foundations on which both the social and Governmental structure is reared by assisting agriculture at present; but that is the one thing for which we are told there can be no assistance by way of credit at present. There can be State concern for industry.  One of the things that is sticking out particularly at present is the Government's concern for industry. The Minister for Industry and Commerce, speaking on a Financial Resolution in connection with the Budget said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A great part of our future development depends on the willingness of the people of this country to entrust to the State their savings or their capital for expenditure on capital undertakings.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2191" /> Here we have a position in which, during the last seven years, about £34,000,000 has been spent by the Government more than they would have spent if they had kept to the 1931-32 position.  Who would think, after a review of some of the things I have mentioned as showing the bad trend of things in 1938, that we are at the end of a period in which the Government, thinking nobody can spend money better than themselves, had collected or borrowed in one way or another and distributed through this country £34,000,000 above the expenditure of seven years before?</P>
    <P>Now we are told that unless savings are accumulated and entrusted to the State for further development, development here will be checked.  The Taoiseach smiled the other day when Deputy Cosgrave mentioned the fall in the contributions for Savings Certificates and in savings banks last year, as showing, in the nature of things, that the position was getting worse. The amount of money put into the savings banks last year fell from £900,000 the year before to £500,000. The Taoiseach denied that Deputy Dillon was right when he said that in the beginning of last year bank directors had complained that the farming community were living on savings. Speaking in January, 1938, according to a report in the <i>Irish Press,</i> the Governor of the Bank of Ireland said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I must confess to a measure of misgiving with regard to the shrinkage which occurred last year, and, indeed, during the years immediately preceding it, more particularly at our country offices, in the smaller deposits of over £2,000 in amount.</P>
    <P>While, no doubt, the amounts withdrawn have been devoted to restocking lands in some cases, I find it difficult to resist the general conclusion that those who live on the land have not yet been able to adjust themselves completely to the altered conditions in agriculture, and have found themselves obliged to make inroads upon savings accumulated during better times.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2192" /> At a time when a farmer is deprived of the necessary capital, and when the urban population have their standard of living reduced, when less bread is consumed, less bacon consumed, and less money put into savings that the ordinary people tend to put them into, the Minister for Industry and Commerce tells us that substantial savings must be put into the hands of the Government by the people in order to carry on capital development.  Is it the Government is going to run industry here?  Agriculture is thrown aside.  It has to look after itself, except in so far as it might be interfered with by the Government.  Apparently on the industrial side the Government is going to take a directing hand. Before they further injure the credit of this country, we ask the Government to indicate the steps they are going to take.  If they are going to handle such savings of the people as they can lay hands on, one way or another, to bolster up industrial development in the unnatural way in which they have done it on recent occasions, we ask them to review some of the industries that they have been responsible for setting up here.  In every country technical efficiency is being aimed at in industry and in agriculture.  It would be time enough for the Government to threaten to take capital for industrial development when they had assured themselves that some of the industries that had been established here had, either by Government assistance or otherwise, been made technically efficient.</P>
    <P>We had industries before the present industrial development, and they were able to export without subsidies or assistance of any kind.  When we look at an industry like woollen tissues we find that not only is there a very substantial fall in the quantity exported now as against 1931, but the tendency to fall still further is there.  Exports in 1931 amounted to £110,000, but these figures have fallen to £51,000.  In 1931 we exported apparel value for £159,000 but it is down now to £26,000.  Exports of shirts fell from £83,000 to £3,000, and the export of newspapers and books fell from £224,000 to £98,000. We were also able to export polishes <Col N="2193" /> and pictures.  When will some of the newer industries that have been established be brought to the efficiency of the older ones, and when will they be able to check themselves with world prices?  Unless we have efficiency in agriculture and efficiency in industry we cannot carry on our social services or the additional high class learning that is being provided for in the new institute of which we heard yesterday; we cannot be a credit either to the nationalism or the nationality that we boast we have, nor can we bring any credit to ourselves in relation to the duties we owe as a country, in trying to work out machinery, under which the social principles of the encyclicals, so much talked of here, must be worked out.</P>
    <P>We have command of all the resources of the country, the brawn and intelligence.  The brawn that the Taoiseach spoke of is there to be used. The brains of the country have been interfered with by the political and economic policy of members of the present Government for the last 17 years.  The brawn has been interfered with too.  We had remarks from the Minister for Finance and from the Taoiseach which show that they wanted to avoid this discussion.  They said it was a vote of censure on them, and they applied to the vote of censure the kind of political dope and rambling from China to Peru, to New Zealand and to the United States, to which we have been treated.  We are concerned with conditions in this country, to see them clearly and objectively, and to take definite action, either to help the people to develop their industries or to stand aside and let them help themselves. Nobody is going to solve the agricultural problem but Irish farmers standing over their farms and doing their own work.  Nobody is going to build up Irish industries but Irish industrial organisers and Irish workers. There is going to be no chance for farmers or industrialists to make progress as long as they are crushed down by the weight of taxation that is there at present.  A burden is falling on our people in the matter of debt, and the more that burden is increased, the more taxation will ultimately fall <Col N="2194" /> upon people later on, taxation during which there will be no production.</P>
    <P>We had Deputies speaking of the position in other countries with regard to debts, where they complained that these debts were piled up in the past, and that there were suggestions that they should be repudiated.  We should be careful to know whether we are leaving for people in ten or 16 years' time a burden of debt about which they may say to themselves: &ldquo;This debt was created by futile, wasteful people who laid their hands on this country ten or 16 years ago, and we have no moral responsibility for repaying it.&rdquo;  It is not so easy for us to face a situation like that, or to get away from it, and with a view to the possibility of improving the present situation or securing that there will be an improvement, it is for the Government to open its eyes to the trend of things and not to sit back in the calm way in which their spokesmen in this debate suggested when they said that things are no worse than they were in 1937.  Things are worse in every way that can be imagined; more unemployment, more emigration, less production, less tillage, less employment on the land, falling production in our essential industry and falling employment there.  As we said in the early days of the economic war, it is because the things that were bound to happen did happen that we intend to keep pointing out to-day the essential facts of the people's lives, and the essential difficulties that are confronting them.</P>
    <P>The Executive Council shut their eyes in the past, and even at the present day they turn a kind of poker face to the difficulties that surround them. They seem to be paralysed, in so far as any type of real, effective action that will help the situation, is concerned. The situation cannot last. The unemployment position, the number of people in Dublin living on home assistance, cannot continue to remain as they are without serious difficulties being created for the Government.  The people cannot melt out of this country and they cannot melt off the land without very serious difficulties arising here.  That is why we say that one <Col N="2195" /> thing that requires to be done is to relieve the country of some of the burden of taxation that has been piled on it this year and that was piled on it last year.  Stop the system by which private taxation imposes on bacon, flour, wheat and butter alone, £5,000,000 a year.  That is the taxation that is going into private pockets, and I ask you to stop that.</P>
    <P>Review the position in which debt is being piled on here, and in my opinion, it would be better to cease for a year both house building and land division and apply some of the savings towards assisting agriculture.  If money is not spent on agriculture to-day to give the farmers the credit they require to get on their feet, then the people who will live in the houses that will be built to-morrow will not have anything to keep them there.  There is no use in dividing land and putting people on the land when the situation of the agricultural industry generally is that it is only capable of giving less employment.  Putting more people on farms means putting other agriculturists out of work and means putting people on farms at a time when they cannot make a success of their farms.</P>

      <P>It was not my intention to participate in this debate except in the capacity of a patient listener. I was going to leave it to my betters, to the intellectuals, the industrialists, the political economists and the experts on high finance.  Into none of these realms did I feel fit to intrude.  I must confess, however, that we on the back benches have had very few pearls of wisdom cast before us.  Very little of a constructive nature has emerged from this debate, which has been carried on quite obviously in an atmosphere of unreality and insincerity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Banking Commission Report brought anything home to the minds and hearts of the ruling classes here, it should have been that this country is perilously near economic and financial ruin.  It should have made them realise that agriculture is our major industry and, as such, it needs careful nursing and treatment.  The lion's share of our national income is derived from agriculture, and yet what <Col N="2196" /> are the characteristic features of our national life?  Drift from the land, emigration, a low birth and marriage rate, extensive unemployment and last, but by no means least, the concentration of the masses of the people in the cities and towns.  Look at Dublin, the capital city of our country.  Its principal employing units are the Sweepstakes, Guinness's Brewery and the Civil Service.  Yet we have one-sixth of the population of this country concentrated in the City of Dublin.</P>
    <P>I have no hesitation in saying that there was never such distress, that poverty was never so widespread or rampant in the City of Dublin, with the possible exception of the years following the Act of Union and, later, the Famine.  We are rapidly, in this city, approaching a state of affairs simulating that which existed in Vienna at the termination of the Great War. Vienna could be likened to an unfortunate, malformed child, a monstrosity, whose head was too heavy for its body. What have we got here?  The Opposition cry is &ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo;  and the Government retort &ldquo;Show us the way.&rdquo;  The Opposition say &ldquo;Reduce taxation,&rdquo; and the Government retort &ldquo;Would you have us reduce taxation by curtailing the social services?&rdquo;,  and so on <i>ad nauseam.</i></P>
    <P>Recently we had the bland spectacle of the Minister for Finance, in this House, blaming every Deputy outside the Government Benches for the depressing state of the country.  I would like to hear from the Government, seeing that they have attached responsibility to the Opposition and to all Deputies outside their own Party, on what occasion have they ever consulted any member of the Opposition with regard to impending legislation?</P>
    <P>Have they on any occasion, in any political or economic crisis in this country, called the Leader of the Opposition or the Leader of the Labour Party and asked his advice, his opinion or his cooperation? Has the Prime Minister on any such occasion ever done that?  The facts are that the Government, like their predecessors, just before they relinquished office, have lost the common touch.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2197" /> My suggestion to restore our national economic equilibrium is a simple one. Put agriculture on a paying basis.  I may well be asked how is that to be done.  Well, it is very simple, in my opinion.  Next door to us, at gun's range from us, throbs the heart of the British Empire.  Great Britain, with its teeming millions, stands at the crossroads, faced with the gaunt spectre of famine in the event of what now seems to be the inevitable greater war. England will want food in quantities beyond all our dreams.  The British Navy will be faced with the difficulty&mdash; the impossible difficulty to my mind&mdash;of fighting in five or six seas and oceans. It will be impossible for the British Navy, in those circumstances, to defend the long sea route.  Here is our opportunity to step in.  The British pocket is long and deep.  I recognise the fact&mdash; I believe the fact that we have not sufficient capital here to restock our farms and to stimulate intensive agricultural activity, but I repeat that the British pocket is long and deep, and our slogan should be: England's difficulty is Ireland's economic opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of his very lengthy and eloquent speech, the Taoiseach, both last evening and to-day, gave expression to such very sound policy, principles and aims, that I think it would be difficult for anyone of good will to quarrel with his speech. He pointed out that the policy of the Government is aimed, has been aimed, and will continue to be aimed at the creation of greater social improvement for the vast majority of the people in this State.  He said that it was the intention and determination of his Government to continue to utilise all the natural resources of this State for that purpose.  These are certainly laudable ideals and very laudable aims, and I am accepting at once that the movers of the motion and of the amendment, and in fact all Parties in this House have at least one thing in common, and that is that they are all honestly and earnestly desirous of doing the best thing possible for the people of this country.  The previous Government, I am sure, were in their <Col N="2198" /> time equally imbued with an equally honest desire to do the best they could for the people of this country.  That brings us, then, in the short summary which I propose to make in the course of my brief remarks, to inquire how far, in the course of 17 years in which two Governments, Cumann na nGaedheal and Fianna Fáil, both equally zealous and determined to try to secure, as far as in them lay, the best possible results for the people of the country, these Governments have succeeded in their aims.  We have got to ask ourselves whether or not they have, cumulatively or separately, succeeded in their aims for the betterment of the people of this country, or if we have reached a stage in which we can be satisfied that the efforts made by the two native Governments, to produce the best results for the people, have been successful.</P>
      <P>Listening to the discussions here, one would be inclined to feel a little mixed as to what the condition of our country is.  According to the Minister for Finance, he is satisfied that everything in the garden is lovely, that we are prospering, and that there is no room for a motion or an amendment of this kind, since everything is going so well. The Taoiseach tells us that 1934 was unquestionably the peak&mdash;or rather, the lowest point&mdash;in the depression, both internationally and, particularly, here when, at that time, we were engaged in the economic war; and that, when founding his Banking Commission, he was not unmindful of the fact that we were then at the lowest ebb, and the Taoiseach gave very excellent reasons for the choosing of the personnel of that tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That personnel was such, he said, that no stone could be flung, at the Government which appointed them, by anybody from the point of view of showing up the worst that they could find, and he said, in effect, that he was satisfied to know that the worst that could be said of our position had been said, in the hope of doing better in the future.  He said that, in setting up the commission, the Government were anxious to get as close an examination <Col N="2199" /> of the financial and economic position as they could get by people who were not likely to have any particular Party point of view.  That was a very laudable aim and ideal, and, presumably, the Taoiseach should be admired for appointing the personnel in that particular form, but there is another aspect of their appointment since they were going to report in accordance with the old financial standards to which it is to be presumed they were loyal devotees, and their standards must be taken that Ireland was at a low ebb in the financial world judged by these old, antiquated rules and measures.  The Banking Commission made their report according to the old financial framework that has held this country in enslavement in the past, and we are told that the aim and object of the commission, as a result of their report, was to put the nation into financial health, but I am afraid that the result of their report will not be to put the nation's stomachs into good health&mdash; certainly, not if the practices prescribed by the Banking Commission were to be adopted.  Luckily, however, as the Taoiseach said, the Government is not bound to accept the findings of that commission, and I trust that they are not likely to accept the findings, because, if they do, it only means going back to the old tale of trying to do something inside a ring where, no matter what you do, you are bound in advance to fail.  The acid test that I am trying to apply, if we accept the view, as I am sure we all do, that both the previous Government and the present Government have been and are doing their best for the betterment of the people of this country, is: whether or not we are satisfied that we have achieved a measure of prosperity commensurate with the efforts made by native Governments in the last 17 years.</P>
    <P>I think it should be unnecessary for me, at this late stage of the debate, to start recapitulating all the evidence that has been put forward as to the mass of unemployment, the mass of emigration, the numbers of our people on home help, and the depression in agriculture.  That welter of evidence <Col N="2200" /> cannot be challenged or denied, irrespective of all the figures that may be read out by the Minister for Finance as to the increase in the export values which he gave us here last night.  Those figures, when divorced from the facts relating to them, are capable of playing old Harry with the truth, because I think that a short examination of the success alleged by the Minister would show that, apart from the tariffs, the actual fact is that the volume has decreased and that the volume of our agricultural produce has decreased and appears to be decreasing.</P>
    <P>Now, I am more conversant with the position of the working classes and with the unemployment problem generally, and I am sure that neither the Taoiseach nor the Government nor any member of the Government can express satisfaction with the position as it exists to-day.  Giving them credit for the very best intentions, I think it will have to be admitted that they have failed to solve the unemployment problem, and is it not time that they should examine carefully and impartially the statement that the Taoiseach himself made some time ago when he said that, if he could not find a solution inside the present system, he would not hesitate to go outside the present system?  He said that, if necessary, he was prepared to go outside the present system to find a solution, but does he think that it is too early yet until they had tried out the present methods? Now, there may be differences and disagreements between the Fine Gael Party and the Fianna Fáil Party on the question of quotas and bounties, free trade, protection, tariff reform, and all that sort of thing, but I contend that, no matter whether it be a Fine Gael Government, a Fianna Fáil Government or any other Government that might be set up, it will be impossible to achieve the measure of success that is desired by all citizens of goodwill inside the present financial system.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government is being reduced to a state in which they are not distinguishable from their predecessors. Having got caught up inside the same ring, they are chasing around after the fashion of the interesting but fatuous pastime of the dog which chases <Col N="2201" /> his own tail.  We were told by speakers on both benches that the experiment as regards public credit was being made by a country analogous in many ways to our country.  The Minister for Finance cuts that analogy very short. Speaking in the precincts of this House the other day, he said that the analogy held practically in only one respect&mdash; that we had a common market.  That is a very short and insufficient picture of the analogy obtaining between this country and New Zealand, with its small population of 1,500,000 as against our 3,000,000, with a climate similar to ours and with the same market that we have, save that they are 12,000 miles removed from it.  Surely what is good for New Zealand should be worthy of careful, sympathetic analysis by this country with a view to seeing whether it could be utilised for our benefit. There is no use in shouting that the experiment in New Zealand is &ldquo;bust&rdquo;. It seems to be the habit of many people who are tied slavishly to the old system to strain their eyes and necks looking for the collapse of the New Zealand experiment.  Thank God, there is no sign of that collapse yet.  The <i>Standard</i> of Friday, July 7, has the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;His Grace, the Archbishop of Wellington, assuring Mr. Savage, New Zealand's Labour Prime Minister, of his goodwill, on the eve of that country's last general election, told him:&mdash;`You have done more to raise up the masses and improve the lot of the working man's family than any previous Government of New Zealand.'  This was recounted to a <i>Standard</i> Special Representative in Dublin on Tuesday evening last by the Hon.  Walter Nash, New Zealand's Finance Minister.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Mr. Nash was our guest in this city. He has given of his best to his country and he explained what has been done by his Government so that it might be emulated by us and get us out of difficulties similar to those which he experienced when he came into office in 1935.  The <i>Standard</i> says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;He explained the monetary and economic policy which enabled New Zealand to abolish unemployment and <Col N="2202" /> is now enabling that British Dominion to build decent houses for every family and achieve internal social stability and family security. They have been told New Zealand is `bust.'  New Zealand is not `bust,' nor won't be in spite of the English financiers' efforts to `bust' her.  Unemployment can be totally abolished.  New Zealand has proved it.  Homes can be built and food grown for every family in the country. New Zealand has proved that also.  Asked why New Zealand had embarked upon a national monetary policy separated from that of Britain and took over control of currency and credit.  Mr. Nash said: `New Zealand left parity with sterling in order to make sure that the standard of living of the people would be maintained. On the production of the country and with every rise in the volume of production&mdash;that is, with every increase in the amount of food or goods produced by New Zealanders&mdash;the standard of living of every worker in the country would be raised.' Asked whether it was true that New Zealand had to restrict her imports from England; if so, how that affected the standard of living, Mr. Nash declared emphatically that every family in New Zealand had sufficient. Every sort of food and clothing needed by the people was produced in plenty in New Zealand. New Zealand had to restrict her imports from Britain in order to pay the interest and other charges on the enormous debt borrowed on the London market by previous administrations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>New Zealand Government's predecessors had borrowed £89,000,000 in 12 years in London.  The Labour Government has borrowed no money outside the country.  Their 4 per cent. loan of £4,500,000 at £98 for ten years and at £99 for 20 years was oversubscribed. That is a good picture. New Zealand is not so remote that we cannot check up and obtain details of what the position there really is.  The Government came into office in a country laden with heavy debt.  One of the reasons we were told why that country was not analogous to our own <Col N="2203" /> was that they were a debtor nation whereas we were a creditor nation.  If the difference between a debtor and creditor nation is, on the part of the creditor nation, poverty, unemployment, emigration and misery and, on the part of the debtor nation, teeming prosperity and abundant employment, then I should not object to a transfer and the label of the bottle would not appreciably affect me.</P>
    <P>I was glad to notice the tone of the speech of the Taoiseach to-day and I trust that he will take his courage in his hands and deal with this question. I believe him to be a man of goodwill and if he is satisfied, as he ought to be satisfied, that the present situation calls for desperate remedies, then I suggest to him that breaking from the financial system, while it might be unique, would not be in any way desperate.  We have got a lead from the hardy pioneers of New Zealand, with a small population.  The Government were guided by only one idea and one instinct when they came into office. Their country was practically on the rocks.  They said, in effect, &ldquo;We have in the soil of this country, given to us so prolifically by God, the necessary means to produce a full and fruitful life for our population.  It is our job to provide for our people and we are going to do it irrespective of how our efforts square with the financial system.&rdquo;  They took office in 1935 and they were re-elected in 1938.  They introduced the Social Security Act on top of what they undertook to do in 1935.  They increased the standard of pensions for the blind, for widows and orphans, for the infirm and for others, and they ended unemployment.  They had, as a matter of fact, to withdraw some of their men from development schemes in order to put them to work in the factories, as Mr. Nash explained in an interview.  They had to transfer the men to the factories in order to manufacture the things which they had been previously importing from Great Britain.  We cannot ignore the fact that there is a strong analogy between the position in New Zealand and the position in this country.  Why should we be so slavishly wedded to <Col N="2204" /> the system which has been the cause of our subjugation up to now?  Why hesitate any longer?  Why should we have all this carping criticism and all these attempts to bore holes in a system which has given proof of its capacity to do the job we want to do?</P>
    <P>I suggest that the motion tabled in the names of Deputy Dillon and Deputy Mulcahy does not make any attempt to rescue us from the old, vicious circle.  They want to give effect to the advice contained in the Majority Report of the Banking Commission. That advice, if taken, may lead us back to the type of financial health which they envisage but that is a type of health from which I should like to get away.  In the amendment by Deputy Norton, Deputy Davin and myself, we are asking the Government to take their courage in their hands and follow the example set by New Zealand&mdash;an example profitably used in Sweden and other countries.  I am not so concerned with the places mentioned by the Minister for Finance who dealt at great length with the position in Germany, Italy and Russia. I want to point to countries similar to our own such as Denmark, Sweden and New Zealand.  The time for hesitation is long past.  The Government should make up their mind and it will have the backing and support of every man of goodwill if they say that the soil of Ireland is the wealth of Ireland and that we are not going to be slavishly tied to this old fetish&mdash;the old financial system&mdash;but that we will do what New Zealand has done.  Within three or four years of taking up that position, I am sure that Ireland will be in as happy a situation as New Zealand is able to boast to-day.</P>

      <P>The Front Opposition Bench made a complaint about the lack of desire displayed by the Ministers on the Government Bench to interest themselves in this debate.  Deputy Mulcahy, who has just spoken, complained that when they were afforded the opportunity they talked too long. I can assure the Deputy that he will have no such complaint to make against me.  In the forefront of what I am going to say I think it right to <Col N="2205" /> remove some misunderstanding, perhaps, in some instances, misrepresentation, of what is contained in the minority reports of the Banking Commission. At one stage of the debate, listening to the Minister for Finance yesterday evening, I decided that there was very little purpose in participating in the debate.  I, at least, adduced from what he said that the Government had already arrived at decisions on the main issues as between the Majority Report and the Minority Reports.  Therefore, I satisfied myself that the whole object and purpose of this motion and the attitude on the Government Benches was to produce something of an academic debate; that there was no real interest in the outside conditions that prevail.  Deputies on the Opposition Benches and the Minister for Finance last night would give an impartial listener the impression that the recommendations embodied in the Minority Reports of the Banking Commission suggested confiscation of the wealth of the people of this country.  I want to categorically repudiate any such representation being made in any of the reports. Those who signed the Minority Reports of the Banking Commission are as jealous of the safety and security of the credit of this State as those who signed the Majority Report.</P>

      <P>We gave a considerable amount of thought to the question; we spent more time on the commission than some of those who signed the Majority Report and we brought all the intelligence that God bestowed upon us to endeavour to understand the problem.  We presented a report that represents our honest convictions and convictions that cannot be changed by anything that has been said in the Majority Report, notwithstanding the distinguished individuals whose names appear beneath it. We recognise that this country is one of, I believe, seven creditor nations in the world and we made no suggestion in any of our reports that would in any <Col N="2206" /> way militate against continuing that credit so established.</P>
      <P>Reading the motion that stands in the names of Deputy Dillon and Deputy Mulcahy, I am prompted to ask whether the Deputies really believe in the national wisdom of those who signed the Majority Report of the Banking Commission and have they tabled this motion implicitly relying upon that belief?  Reading the third line of the motion, I see that it purposes to abolish poverty within the State.  I have listened to most of the debate and I have paid particular attention to those who spoke in support of the motion and I have not heard one practical proposal made by the supporters of the motion that would either abolish poverty or remove unemployment in this State.  I am tempted to ask, therefore, what is the real purpose of the motion.  In my opinion, the motion was tabled, not in the interest of any person outside this House, but was tabled for the purpose of affording Fine Gael an opportunity of flaying the backs of Fianna Fáil with the findings of the Majority Report of the Banking Commission and indirectly, perhaps, affording an opportunity of propagating and promoting the charge of squandermania already made against the Government by the Leader of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>The English language is a splendid medium for concealing the real intention of words spoken or written and when you remove the outer coverings from the recommendation of the Majority Report of the Banking Commission what do you find?  That is the report that Fine Gael have hitched their wagon to now.  You find, number one, that they say that it is not the duty nor is it within the power of the State to provide for full employment in this country.</P>

      <P>I will resume my seat if this interruption continues.  The second recommendation is that social considerations should not be allowed to interfere with what they describe as the unchangeable law of economics. You find professors and economists throughout the world who dispute that.  The third recommendation is that housing in this country should cease.  Housing should cease.  The removal of slum areas should no longer be considered or replaced by the Government with sanitary dwellings.</P>

      <P>Thanks.  I have said that the third recommendation in the <Col N="2209" /> Banking Commission Report was that the housing operations of the Government should cease.  The report does not say, in so many words, that housing should be discontinued.  It says the same thing in what I have called the deceptive English language because it says to the Government: &ldquo;You can only proceed with that housing which you can finance from revenue&rdquo; which would mean nothing. In other words, the removal of the slum dwellers from their insanitary houses in the cities, towns and villages of the country is not to be undertaken. They are to remain where they are. What reason do the Banking Commission give for that recommendation? That the Government are to wait until we get what they describe as sound money conditions.  What is to happen to the dweller of an insanitary house in a slum area?  He is to be crucified on the cross of British sterling.</P>
      <P>The fourth recommendation is that compulsory land purchase should cease. In that part of the country that I come from there are thousands of acres of land owned by men who reside 40 and 50 miles away from it.  The sons of local small farmers have been waiting for some of that land for years, patiently hoping that the Land Commission would see to the division of it. If the fourth recommendation in the report of the Banking Commission is to be given effect to, what will it mean? That those men who have been waiting for some of that land will be driven across St. George's Channel.  There you have, in all their nakedness, what the findings of the Majority Report amount to.  I submit that the adoption of the Majority Report of the Banking Commission by the Government should mean the repeal of Article 45, Section 2, of the Constitution. It lays down:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The State shall, in particular, direct its policy towards securing</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>i.  That the citizens (all of whom, men and women equally, have the right to an adequate means of livelihood) may through their occupations find the means <Col N="2210" /> of making reasonable provision for their domestic needs.</P>
    <P>ii.  That the ownership and control of the material resources of the community may be so distributed amongst private individuals and the various classes as best to subserve the common good.</P>
    <P>iv.  That in what pertains to the control of credit the constant and predominant aim shall be welfare of the people as a whole.</P>
    <P>v.  That there may be established on the land in economic security as many families as in the circumstances shall be practicable.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>If you take the Majority Report of the Banking Commission and place it beside Article 45, Section 2, of the Constitution you will clearly see that the two cannot live together.  It would be as reasonable to expect that fire and water would live in the same container.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention to travel over the social, economic or financial fields which have been traversed by a number of Deputies who have spoken in this debate from both sides of the House.  I shall confine myself to pointing out what, in my opinion, are the abnormalities that prevail in this country: abnormalities that do not exist in any of those countries that were quoted by the Minister for Finance or by other Deputies.  We have abnormalities here that do not exist in any of those countries with which a comparison has been made. In the first place, we in this country export more human beings in proportion to our population than any other country in the world.  We have the lowest marriage rate of any white race in the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Loghlen</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, these are abnormalities that do not prevail in most other countries.  They are abnormalities that are certainly an evil growth.  They are abnormalities that, in my opinion, have within them a germ which, if allowed to grow unchecked, may easily cause the decay, if not the death, of this nation.  We are in one respect more favourably situated than most other countries in proceeding to remove these abnormalities. In most other countries where they have a huge unemployed roll, we find that they are highly specialised industrial countries.  Even if they have the machinery, the men and the raw material they cannot put their people into employment unless they are assured of a market for the products of their factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With us, 90 per cent. of our emigration would be from the rural areas. Somewhat the same percentage&mdash; slightly less&mdash;of our unemployed would exist in those same areas.  We have in the areas where the unemployed and the emigrants come from works waiting to be carried out and works&mdash;not-withstanding anything that has been said to the contrary&mdash;of a reproductive character.  Commissions&mdash;perhaps I should say, to make it more pleasant to Deputy Dillon's ear, Royal Commissions&mdash;sat in this country and made reports on questions of afforestation and drainage.  The report that is available said that in this country we have millions of acres of marginal land that could be used for afforestation. That report also said that our climate and soil are suitable for the growing of wood.  It is rather amazing since the time those experts examined that problem, that the soil and climate of Ireland should have changed or that the land should have disappeared.  We are told by experts here to-day that wood cannot grow in this country. When I hear the word &ldquo;expert&rdquo; I always become suspicious, as one hears people say &ldquo;I have consulted an expert&rdquo;.  We hear about experts who have reported on matters of forestry, but we have not heard who they were. It would be reasonable to ask these experts what was the position of Ireland in the 16th and 17th centuries <Col N="2212" /> in so far as the growing of timber was concerned.  How did it grow then? How did our extensive forests come to exist and what has happened to make a change in the meantime?</P>
    <P>I am reminded of what occurred when British experts were sent to report on the possibility of constructing the Suez Canal.  They came back and reported that it could not be done. French experts went out and did it and the Suez Canal is there to-day.  I am very much afraid that the experts who are reporting against the possibility of planting timber in this country are to a large degree of the same type as the British experts who were sent out in connection with the construction of the Suez Canal.</P>
    <P>We have the men in this country&mdash; the men and the work are there.  In other countries there are cries of &ldquo;Back to the land,&rdquo; and in other countries they are failing to induce the people to go back to the land.  We have our people on the land to-day and our first purpose should be to endeavour to keep them there.  Rural Ireland is the foundation on which the cities and the towns rest, and if that foundation disappears it will only be a short time until the cities and the towns must crumble.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all saying that for the last ten or 12 years&mdash;at every election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterJosephOLoghlen" hpid="Mr. O'Loghlen Mr. O'Loghlen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Loghlen</NameTxt>
      <P>In addition to afforestation, we have vast tracts of land waiting to be drained.  We have the finest land in the world under water from January to December, awaiting the completion of main drainage schemes.  These two works alone&mdash;apart from reclamation&mdash;would absorb every unemployed man, and they are works of a reproductive character.  Can anybody show that they are not?  If we bring the people back to the land and reclaim the land that is now under water, do we not increase the productivity of the country? If we plant our marginal lands with timber, is it not real wealth that is being produced in the country?  If it were done 30 years ago there would <Col N="2213" /> be no need for us to be importing timber to-day.</P>
      <P>Most of the reasonable people we talk to will admit that we have the work to give the unemployed to do. The men are there, the work is there; but then we reach the cry: &ldquo;Where is the money to come from?&rdquo;  That is the controlling factor in bringing together these two elements in the life of this country&mdash;the work and the worker. Let us be honest with ourselves.  It is because of the fact that we have not got the money that we cannot bring these two elements together.  Under the Currency Act of 1927 our unit of value here is on a parity with the British pound.  Our pound is on a parity with the British pound.  There are a few facts in connection with that which I want to state as clearly as I may.  In the first place, we are the only country in the world whose unit of value is on a pound-for-pound parity with the British.  The British unit of value was determined without consultation with us: they determine their unit of value to suit themselves.  Their law was made to suit England.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can recollect hearing the Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Cosgrave, speak in the elections of 1917, 1918, 1919, and he always conveyed to the people the advisability of placing their trust in Sinn Féin and electing a Parliament here at home to make laws for this country.  He always dwelt on the unsuitability of laws made by the British Parliament for this country. As he said, England is an industrialised country and we are agricultural, and the law that is made at St. Stephen's in Westminster is wholly unsuitable for our country.  It is quite extraordinary that whilst he favoured that change and obtained authority to do it, the most important of all laws operative here is still the law made at St. Stephen's in Westminster.  Orthodox countries that we hear so much about&mdash;Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Portugal&mdash;are on a sterling basis, but their relation to sterling is decided and determined by themselves.  They did not blindly switch their parity or their currency on to the currency of England or the British pound.  They determined their own currency in relation <Col N="2214" /> to sterling and did that in the interests of their own internal economy.</P>
    <P>The placing of our pound on a parity with the British pound has other implications.  This is a major one, that, if our Government to-morrow decided to finance an undertaking, involving the expenditure of say, £1,000,000, they must satisfy themselves beforehand that they are in a position to deposit sterling assets with the Bank of England to meet that outgoing expenditure, and, unless they can do that, they must call a halt to that expenditure.  From that, it is obvious that the operations of any Government in this country, in the matter of financial expenditure, are governed by an institution foreign to this country.  In that connection, let me quote, as clearly as I remember, a contribution made by one of the distinguished signatories to the Majority Report of the Banking Commission, Professor Gregory.  Writing in the London <i>Daily Telegraph</i> in July, 1935, he set down that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;we must not ignore the fact that it would be difficult to conceive the United States of America or France being willing to subordinate their domestic currency to the views of either the Bank of England or the British Treasury, for that is what association with the sterling group means.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those were the words of Professor Gregory in 1935, but, in signing the Majority Report of the Banking Commission, in 1938, he had no hesitation in ignoring a fact which he said should not be ignored then.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>He had more sense then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterJosephOLoghlen" hpid="Mr. O'Loghlen Mr. O'Loghlen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Loghlen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no hesitation in asserting that this country at present has not financial freedom.  I care not whom it offends.  We have the means of obtaining that freedom, if we make use of it, and I remind the House that this Dáil, for the first time, has the opportunity of doing that, and that if it fails to make use of the opportunity, it may never come its way <Col N="2215" /> again.  Deputy Dillon threw up his hands in despair and said: &ldquo;If you part company with sterling, you ruin this country and you are burst.&rdquo;  Other countries have done it as I pointed out&mdash;Sweden and Norway, Denmark, Portugal and New Zealand.  These have all parted from parity with the British pound, and they have done it in their own interests, mind you.  Since that is the considered judgment of the Ministers for Finance and the Governments of these countries, although I have a very high estimation of the Minister for Finance in our Government, and of the Cabinet associated with him, I think that the balance of opinion, taking all these countries on one side, would go to show that their pooled financial wisdom must be somewhat more convincing than the wisdom of one Cabinet in one country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apply a simple test to the position as it exists at present.  If any Deputy in this Assembly had power to issue currency and credit to finance his undertakings, would he go to his neighbour for authority to do it and place a burden on the shoulders of his family?  Would he not do it himself? In like manner, this authority, which surely is the prerogative of the State, under the present monetary system is passed over to a purely private profit-seeking institution to be used by them as they think right in their own interests and in the interests of their depositors.  Again, I want to say that I make no complaint whatever about the commercial banks of this country. I want to allow nobody the opportunity to say that I said anything detrimental to these institutions.  They are there, and they have a useful function to discharge in the commercial life of the country, and in financing the other undertakings that exist there, but it is not the duty of the banks to solve the social or economic problems of this country.  It is the duty of the State. Until the State clothes itself with authority to take control of the currency and credit of the country, the State cannot discharge the duties that are expected from it.  That control does not aim at inflation as has been suggested here, but it aims at and <Col N="2216" /> certainly can achieve, by wise direction full employment and full economic activity.  We have proceeded along the lines of solving the unemployment problem by the payment of doles, unemployment assistance.  If that were a solution of the problem, these other countries would long since have solved their problems.  Other countries tried that before there was a Government formed here, and they have that same evil with them still, and it will prove no solution here.  One forecast I make, that, while we endeavour to proceed to solve our social and economic difficulties, to discharge our obligations within the social sphere, upon the foundation of interest-bearing, we are never going to succeed.</P>
    <P>We have had attempts made to establish analogies between this country and other countries.  I think I have given the House to understand that the analogies were not correct, and that, in making those analogies, and in seeking to establish them, for the purpose of stampeding people away from any movement in this country to reorganise the monetary system of the country, the picture against these countries was overdrawn by Deputies and by the Minister for Finance last night.  We were already told about conditions in New Zealand.  Deputy Dillon had already described New Zealand in this House on two occasions as being &ldquo;bust&rdquo;.  I will not characterise the opinions he expressed by his own fishy word.  I will pass it over. But in that condemnation of other countries other Deputies joined.  During the debate on practically this same subject at a previous meeting of the Dáil, Deputy Childers joined in, and he showed that the efforts of the President of the United States to solve this problem were unavailing.  He described these efforts as pump priming. Then he moved across to France. Last night the Minister for Finance dealt for a considerable time with the position of New Zealand.  In dealing with the figures, he showed that one item alone in the exports from New Zealand had fallen considerably last year.  I think he could have reasonably told the House that one item of exports, namely, wool, from New Zealand had dropped in value by <Col N="2217" /> £7,000,000.  One can easily understand how much that upset the exports from New Zealand.  There was one other item which I think he might have given to the House in connection with New Zealand.  That was the figure of unemployment in New Zealand.  Now, the number of unemployed persons in New Zealand at the end of December, 1938, was 1,200.  Only 1,200 people were receiving relief through unemployment channels.  On the basis of our population our figure for unemployment should stand at 2,400, that is taking our population as double that of New Zealand.  I think that was a comparison that he should not have excluded from the other comparisons he made.</P>

To continue, Deputy Childers in reply to me said:&mdash;&ldquo;That is quite true&rdquo;.  I said: &ldquo;You describe that as orthodox finance.  Do you not think that you should have told the House that Dr. Salazar has had control of the commercial banks in Portugal?&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Oh, yes, that is very true but that is a control with which I would not trust our people with&rdquo;, was Deputy Childers' reply.

      <P>While I do not agree with everything that has been said by Deputy O'Loghlen, I am glad to live and see the day and be a member of the Dáil when a speech like the one just delivered has been given to this House.  What is freedom?  Deputy O'Loghlen defined it in his closing remarks.  I said myself a few weeks ago here that this House is nothing better than a talking shop if the control of money and credit in this country is vested in the Bank of England.  I do regret that this Banking Commission Report comes up here as a kind of side wind to a motion.  It should not have been brought up in this matter.  I agree with the Taoiseach when he said yesterday that this Banking Commission was appointed to investigate various aspects of our economic life, but that there was no assurance and no undertaking given that this House was going to accept that report.  But the Dáil should have got an opportunity before now of considering it, not on a side wind but as a main question brought before the House.  Now, I understand that an agreement has been come to that many more Deputies will not speak except the mover of the motion, who has a right to reply. Others, therefore, will be debarred <Col N="2220" /> from participating in this debate.  That is very unfair in connection with a matter like this, and I would suggest to the Taoiseach that within the next three months during which we are going to retire into private life that a day would be fixed and the Dáil assembled to debate this Report of the Banking Commission until nobody has any more to say about it.</P>

      <P>Yes, it would be a long debate, but to the Minister for Defence I would put this view&mdash;that it is a long, weary road for the man out of work looking for a job.  Here is material which, if properly arranged, could solve the unemployment problem. There is no other road to its solution. I was surprised at previous speakers dragging in conditions in New Zealand here.  They need not drag in anybody. Take September, 1931, when we had world-wide depression and when all countries that were on the gold standard found themselves in the position that they were not able to sell their goods.  Great Britain was up against the greatest depression in her life. Great Britain had plenty of gold in the gold reserves in the Bank of England. It was not want of gold that made England go off the gold standard on the 15th September, 1931, but the necessity to depreciate her currency so as to enable her to reduce costs and sell her goods in the world market.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Taoiseach is here and I hope he will forgive me if he thought my remarks, when he was speaking, were in the nature of interruptions.  I did not then think that I would get the golden opportunity of speaking when he would be here and of addressing a couple of questions to him.  He made a long, exhaustive speech on the position, and the questions I wanted to put to him then I should like to put to him now.</P>

      <P>I want to give him information, <Col N="2221" /> A Chinn Comhairle, and I hope he will take it in the spirit in which it is tendered.  Great Britain in order to be able to sell her goods in the world market got off the gold standard.  She had to depreciate her currency, and, of course, it is a well-known law of finance and trade that countries on the gold standard cannot carry on a profitable trade in selling with countries working on a depreciated currency. Countries with a depreciated currency, selling to countries on an appreciated or gold standard currency will make money hand over fist.  When Britain went off the gold standard we, who were on a sterling standard, automatically slipped off the gold standard just the same as sterling.  What did our competitors, Denmark, New Zealand and the Argentine do?  They were then on the gold standard, but they slipped off the gold standard at the same time, but much further than Britain did.  What do we find here? This is the position that should be known to every farmer and should be examined by every farmer in the country.  The Dane is our competitor on the British market.  His unit of currency, the kroner, had a parity with sterling of 18:159 to the £.  To-day it is between 23 and 24 to the £, which means that if he sells £1 worth of butter in the British market and brings that £1 back to Denmark, it is worth 25/- to him.  If we sell £1 worth of butter in the British market and take back that £1 here, it is worth only 20/-.</P>

      <P>I can argue that.  That is why I said, as a preamble, that we would want longer to debate this question than is provided by a makeshift debate on an adjournment motion, because that is what it means.  What the Minister has said is quite right, but it has got to be examined.  I am not arguing positively.  I am showing the position created by a depreciated or an inflated currency and the impossibility of agriculture in this country competing in the British market with Danish agriculture, New Zealand agriculture <Col N="2222" /> or Argentine agriculture.  The Minister is aware that what drove British cotton prints out of the Chinese market was the depreciated Japanese currency which enabled the Japanese mills to undersell the British mills in the Chinese markets.  He is aware that that was a subject of long negotiations and strained relations between the two countries&mdash;the depreciation of the Japanese yen.  I am surprised above all to find lined up or the side of financial Imperialism the Minister for Defence.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Loghlen suggested something that to my mind bordered on social credit.  I am not a believer in social credit.  I just take the stand with regard to finance that I took in regard to nationality when this was a crown colony.  Let us get control of whatever type of currency we think best for the country and let us adopt that.  If it is in the best interests of the country to remain hitched to sterling, let those who are the Government, and who have means and sources of information that Deputies have not got, keep hitched to sterling and good luck to them but let them control credit.  It would be very interesting to examine the amount of currency in circulation in this country during the war years.  Remember, it is the amount of currency that affects prices.  Increased prices mean an increase in the money value of goods and diminished prices a reduction in the money value of goods. During the Great War and around the years 1918 to 1920, we had circulating in what is roughly the Free State now about £21,000,000.  At that time Britain had something over £500,000,000 in circulation. To-day Great Britain has over £500,000,000 circulating but we have not £10,000,000 circulating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of credit arises on this motion and on the Report of the Banking Commission.  It is admitted that there is a shortage of credit here, but, as a businessman.  I agree with the Press report which I read of Deputy Dowdall's speech on this motion.  He said substantially that, as a businessman, <Col N="2223" /> he found the banks of this country always accommodating for a sound business proposition.  As one who has borrowed largely from banks, and paid them back, I can endorse what Deputy Dowdall has said.  I can repeat here what I said before the Banking Commission a couple of years ago, that I have never been refused accommodation by my bank when the accommodation was good for me.  I have been refused.  That is a cryptic way of putting it but where I have been refused I have found afterwards that, as things worked out, the banks saw better into the future than I did.</P>
    <P>I should like to put this to the Taoiseach.  The British Government made representations to the Japanese Government about their trading in China produced by the depreciation of the yen.  Has the Taoiseach, either as Taoiseach or as Minister for External Affairs, made any representations to the British Government to give Irish agriculture a preference that would equate with the advantages that our competitors are getting in the British market, because of their working on currencies depreciated in relation to sterling while we are hitched on to sterling?</P>
    <P>Personally, if it meant no loss to our trade, I should like to see the link with sterling maintained.  It would make for the sympathetic working of trade between the two countries.  But I am afraid we are losing by it.  I am certain that our competitors in agricultural produce in the British market are having a decided advantage over us.  I should like to know if the Taoiseach has ever made a case to the British Government to give us preferential treatment which would equate with the advantages that those countries have over us there.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is not an asset on which money can be borrowed in this country. The Taoiseach, in addressing himself to that aspect of the matter when speaking on this motion did not dwell very long upon the case made from these benches, and made in the country, that the loss of freedom of sale acted detrimentally on land as a <Col N="2224" /> security in getting accommodation.  He said that the objection to the sale of those lands by the banks when defaults occurred has had an effect.  I agree that there is that objection to selling out a farmer.  That is a survival from the landlord days; it is part of the old boycott system.  It has survived, and it is really a loss to agriculture that it has survived.  Although we would all sympathise with the person who would find himself in those circumstances, it is a loss to his neighbour.  The banks must protect themselves, and if they get stuck in one case they are not going to lend money in similar cases in future.  There are millions of frozen debts in the banks in the name of the farmers.  What has produced them? Was it not the deflation of the currency from 1919 to 1925?  Are they not a legacy of that period?  What was the deflation of the currency?  Was it not a simply working back to the gold standard?  Britain did it for British interests and to suit British purposes. It bankrupted agriculture in this country. People say that the banks gave out foolishly during the war years. They did not.  They gave out freely, and when they gave out freely you had business going well in this country. You had no unemployment and you had good wages.  It was about the only time&mdash;certainly the only time during our lives&mdash;when there was adequate currency in this country to do the business of this country.</P>
    <P>If there had been a full dress debate on this whole question of national currency and national credit, it would have paid us to go back 150 years, and examine each crisis that took place and the periodical famines that took place in this country from the Act of Union down to the present time.  It would be found that what led to every famine was a shortage of currency.  Compare the currency that was here in 1845 with the currency that was here in 1850; it was only one-third of what was here in 1845.  The shortage of currency was the direct cause of the famine.  One could only touch those things in spots in a short debate of this kind, and I should be glad if some more suitable occasion could be found for going exhaustively into this whole report, the <Col N="2225" /> issue being: &ldquo;Shall we take control of our credit and currency here, or shall we not?&rdquo;  This debate has not gone on stereotyped or orthodox Party lines. That is as it should be, because this a a very important issue.  Whether the Taoiseach sees it or not, or whether he believes it or not, I am convinced&mdash; I am not issuing a Partyism when I say this&mdash;that this country is up against a very acute national financial crisis. The Taoiseach, in his address to this House on this motion, said that we have all building materials here except timber.  That is substantially correct. We have practically all.  We have the men, skilled and unskilled; we have the demand for houses.  Why are we not assembling the materials and making houses?</P>

      <P>He should get them to gather around a table, and, if a builder says to a worker: &ldquo;You are not doing enough, and you are asking too much for it&rdquo;, let the worker answer that. If the financial people will not give the accommodation, if, as is alleged, they will not help in borrowing money, and are throttling business, let them be accused of that across the table, and let them answer the accusation.  We would get a lot nearer to realities in a conference like that than in any inquiry.  In an inquiry, one man goes in and gives his point of view; then <Col N="2226" /> another man with a different point of view gives his opinion, and those who are conducting the inquiry are puzzled as to how they are to reconcile the conflicting statements.  You get no further.  The whole thing is pigeon-holed. The other is more in the form of a debate.

      <P>I would.  He would need to be there.  The builder, I think, is a kind of a ratepayer.  I hope that the Taoiseach will try and get some setoff for agriculture that will equate with the loss that agriculture is sustaining or, to put it the other way, the advantage that our competitors have by working on a depreciated currency in the British market.  I also think that the time has come for a very careful consideration of the question of taking control of our currency and credit.  It is a very serious thing that the principal industry in this country has no credit.  Nobody can deny that, whatever the causes may be, whether the boycotting of sales of land even for an ordinary debt, or the denial of free sale.  The Taoiseach said that everybody knows the law; that land can be taken but that the occupiers will get a fair price for it.  I personally cannot see why a man's land should be taken from him any more than a man's factory or a man's shop should be taken.  He has his money invested in it.  We all know that the proper draining and cultivation of the land dates from the time that fixity of tenure was granted.  The hands of the clock are being put back by destroying that fixity of tenure which is a man's estate in his land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder would it be possible to get a meeting within the next three months and to debate in detail all these various reports.  No matter how anybody pretends to gloss it over, the position is serious.  The Taoiseach said that national credit stood high.  We know that at the last attempt at floating a <Col N="2227" /> loan in this country one quarter of it was not subscribed.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davin stated yesterday that the Dublin Corporation wanted £3,000,000, and that was true. We wanted £3,000,000, but it was cut down to the bare margin that would pay for our commitments.  We were told that the present was not a time for public borrowing.  That statement was made by the banks and was agreed to by two Ministers.  We were told that only £1,500,000 would be sanctioned to meet our commitments on housing contracts and a couple of other contracts, like the Poulaphouca contract, already placed.  Although we got that £1,500,000, we did not get £1 to put a single additional man working. That is the position to-day.  To say now that our national credit stands high is not in accordance with the facts. If we are not facing a national financial crisis, I cannot read the signs of the times.  That money was for direct housing in the City of Dublin.  Six months before that, the indirect aid <Col N="2228" /> for housing in the City of Dublin was withdrawn, that is, loans under the Small Dwellings (Acquisition) Act. Prior to that being withdrawn, the amount advanced was cut down from 90 per cent, to 70 per cent. of the market value of a house, while there are British insurance companies operating in this city advancing loans up to 85 per cent. of the market value.  How can the Taoiseach say that the credit of the country stands high when the capital city cannot borrow money for the housing of the people?  We should face the real facts of the situation.</P>
      <P>I would be very slow to approve of juggling with our currency.  There was a time when we could have made millions by adopting a national currency. At one time we could have taken £20,000,000 worth of paper and placed it on the counter of the Bank of England and, by the law of England, we are entitled to get £20,000,000 in bullion for it.  We did not do that.  The currency was backed as to one-third by gold and as to two-thirds by paper, and we exchanged our paper money, for which prior to then we could have got bullion, for that paper.  Now, after fighting an economic war&mdash;whether we won or lost it is immaterial&mdash;the credit position of this country is so poor that in this city the housing of the working classes and private speculative building, which formerly got that help from the State, are brought to a standstill. Some weeks ago 300 carpenters went over to jobs in Great Britain and had their fares paid for them by British trade unions operating here, because they were refused benefit, if they did not take jobs that were available in England.  The work is here to be done.  The Dublin Corporation have about 400 acres of land developed for building but they have no money to build.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the use of &ldquo;codding&rdquo; ourselves by saying that we have credit? If we have credit why do we not borrow? The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Local Government will not sanction borrowing.  They have refused to sanction it.  How, then, can the Taoiseach tell us we have credit and tell us about the houses built, and so <Col N="2229" /> on?  We know that.  Thanks to the co-operation of the local authorities and the Government&mdash;and, to do him justice, the Minister for Local Government has always shared the thanks between the local bodies and the Government&mdash;that has been done.  It was owing to that co-operation, and the drive of the last few years, that the houses were built.  But we are brought to a stand-still now, at a time when we are considering credit and the financial position.  With full knowledge of the position, I say that we are up against a national financial question when the City of Dublin cannot borrow money to build houses. There are representatives of the corporation in this House, and I challenge any of them to contradict that statement. I wonder will the Taoiseach, or any members of his Party who may intervene in the debate, tell us where our credit stands high?  Is it not time to look around and to consider the proposals outlined in the motion and the amendment.  Progress can be made if either of them are considered.  The motion asks that steps should be taken to reduce the burden of direct and indirect taxation.</P>
    <P>If we remain hitched to sterling there is no alternative but to reduce direct and indirect taxation.  It is for the Government to decide what services will have to be curtailed.  That cannot be suggested from this side of the House.  The difficulty of getting finance to run the country will be a compelling force on the Government to reduce taxation.  The Taoiseach studied his economics well lately, which shows that the situation is compelling the Government to look closer into things with which they previously went straight ahead.  In effect, the Taoiseach said that if it cost £2 a week to put a man to work, and if what he produced was worth only 35/-, that was no relief of unemployment.  I agree.  The problem before the Taoiseach and the Government is not to have that man idle but to have him absorbed into our ordinary economic life.</P>
    <P>The claim was also made that 45,000 people had been put into employment as a result of tariffs and the present <Col N="2230" /> industrial policy.  But there are still 100,000 unemployed.  There is something wrong when 100,000 people cannot be absorbed into our ordinary industrial, commercial, and agricultural life.  It is costing the State a good deal to keep these people, and to give them temporary relief in the way of three days work now and then.  The loss to the country, by not having them at work, means further economic loss, because of the fact that they are being rendered useless, as far as full utility value goes, for production in future. Another problem concerns the thousands of young people, many of them approaching manhood and womanhood, who have never worked and who are passing on to the dole or to some kind of home assistance.  The Taoiseach wrings his hands and sheds tears about the low marriage rate and birth rate.  He does not agree with what the Labour representatives suggested&mdash;that the low marriage rate is an economic question.  I believe it is an economic question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>If they had developed many people would not get married as early as they did.  I am sure the Taoiseach would not advocate marriages between young people who are on the dole.  When young people cannot get married because of the economic situation the remedy is to bring about a situation on which they can afford to get married.  The alternative is to let young people get married on the dole or be brought up on <Col N="2231" /> poor law relief.  Would it not be better for the country not to have people existing under such conditions? No matter how the Government attempts to get out of it, the responsibility is theirs.  The hard facts are staring them in the face.  A case has been made here that if the currency must be inflated in order to create work, the effect would be to depreciate the savings of the people.  I agree with that view.  That is a fact. Remember that rentiers who had money on deposit found that their savings were greatly depreciated during the years of deflation.  I have a fair amount of fixed property and if inflation started, it would devalue that property. I am prepared to have it devalued, because the inflation of the currency means, in effect, devaluation of fixed assets.  What I would lose on the swing boats I would gain on the roundabouts. I do not think there is anything in the point about the currency being inflated.  I must not be taken as advocating inflation or deflation, but I am a strong advocate in this respect, that if we want freedom, or consider that we should have a free choice, we ought not only have the right to freedom, but should exercise it.  We have not financial freedom, but we have the power to be financially free. This is all I advocate, and I am in a miscellaneous collection, so to speak, who advocate it.  It is a good thing to see Party barriers of all kinds broken down on this common platform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, may I say I reciprocate what my old friend, Deputy Dowdall, said here.  I hope there will be a union of all forces in this House, and outside it, a union of the forces of goodwill, a union that will lead to the establishment of a national force that will help to bring the country out of its present terrible plight, that will rehabilitate its credit and help to relieve unemployment, and not only to have the will to be free, but to be actually free.  We have the whole mechanism of freedom.  Nobody is keeping us from enjoying the full fruits of freedom but ourselves, and we should not stand in the way any longer. I would be glad if an opportunity could <Col N="2232" /> be given for a full-dress debate on this Banking Commission report.  I think the motion around which the whole discussion should gather should be a motion asking this House to give its authority for the taking over of the control of credit and banking in this country.  By that I am not to be taken &mdash;although I have read pretty well everything that has been written on social credit&mdash;as an advocate of social credit.  I advocate taking control of our currency and banking, just as England has control of it in England, just as France has control of it in France, America in America, and so on.  Whatever is the best machinery for that control, when we have got it, let us adopt that machinery, but we will only know what is best when we have taken control and when we have tried to work it.</P>

      <P>I am not going to take up much time, because I think the Taoiseach has already got an indication from our side of the House as to what we mean in our motion.  I expect it will take some time before the Government will be prepared to do anything in connection with the findings of the Banking Commission, but I think in the meantime the Taoiseach should try to get something done with regard to the question of giving credit for the building of houses.  I listened with interest to what Deputy Belton said about the Dublin situation.  The Cork situation is no better.  The building of houses for the workers in Cork City has not cost the ratepayers in Cork a penny so far.  For the number of houses built in Cork City during the past five years there is a sum of £19,000 to the good side of the rates instead of there being any burden on the rates in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We asked for a loan of £250,000 last November and we issued a 4 per cent. loan 15 months previously at £99.  The loan was more than doubly subscribed on that occasion.  Fifteen months later we asked for £250,000, and the bank that offered us £20,000 on the earlier occasion, and the insurance company that offered us £8,000 on the same occasion, did not subscribe.  Strange to say, three of the directors of the bank were also directors in the insurance <Col N="2233" /> company.  Out of the £8,000 offered by the insurance company we were able to give them only £2,600. After 15 months not as much as a solitary £ was offered by these two corporations for the building of houses, even though we offered 4 per cent. on the money.  I am quite satisfied that that was due to the Majority Report of the Banking Commission.  Such is the position that has been created, that we are not able to proceed with the building of houses because we cannot find the money, even though we are offering 4 per cent. for it.  I submit that offering 4 per cent. for money to-day for the purpose of building houses is not asking money for nothing.</P>
    <P>It is because of these facts that we have indicated to the Government that they should be in a position to control the credit and currency of the country. It would be better to have a position like that rather than have our people rotting in slums.  Who can estimate properly the dreadful conditions in which people are living to-day?  I am glad to be able to say that I very much appreciated the spirit in which the Taoiseach discussed the matter this morning.  I feel that he is inclined to do the right thing.  I hope that it will not be very long until he submits proposals here to take over the control of credit and currency in this country.  I submit that there is not a Government anywhere in the world that is in a more favourable position to tackle this problem and relieve the evils from which we suffer.  You have the backing of the masses of the people, you have the backing of the Church, and the support of anybody who is worth anything in the country.  They are all with you, 100 per cent., in dealing with the social evils with which we are confronted.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach asked to-day what did we mean by saying that the Government should utilise the credit of the nation.  To-day we have not alone the need for houses, but we have thousands of people on the verge of starvation.  I took some trouble recently to find out the weekly income of 709 families living in 709 houses built by the Cork Corporation. I ascertained that 163 families were living on an income of 20/- a week; 110 were living on sums <Col N="2234" /> ranging from £1 to 30/-, and 83 were living on amounts ranging from £2 to £2 10s.  In the 709 houses the average number in each family was six.  We discovered in the course of that inquiry that there were over 2,500 persons living on 4/- a week per person.  That was the amount they had for food and clothing and to give the warmth necessary for life.</P>
    <P>These are matters I am very concerned about.  This is a Christian country and I suggest to our leaders, and I do not mind on which side of the House they are, that that sort of thing should not be allowed to continue for 24 hours.  I am not trying to make Party capital out of this.  I am speaking as one who witnessed the grim realities of the situation.  I could, if I wished, talk about things that would stir the heart of anybody.  We are not worthy of being called semi-statesmen while that type of thing is allowed to continue.  I trust that when we reassemble in October we will have some proposal from the Government to deal with such pressing problems as I have outlined.</P>

      <P>In view of what I consider the unreasonable amount of time monopolised by the Taoiseach, and as there are other Deputies anxious to express their views on this most important matter, I think the agreement which was entered into between the leaders of the big Parties should not be strictly adhered to.  As it is unlikely that we shall have, for some time at least, the opportunity which Deputy Belton suggested of debating this question further, I think any Deputies who desire to speak on this matter should be permitted to do so, at least briefly.  I do not think it is quite proper that there should be any attempt to restrict the debate on a question so important as this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that in this country at the present time feeling is becoming very hostile to Parliamentary institutions. In a recent election in Dublin we saw it demonstrated that over 50 per cent. of the people abstained from voting. Why was that?  It was because the people came to the conclusion that the Parliamentary institutions in this <Col N="2235" /> country are not being used to serve the best advantage of the people, but are being used simply for Party purposes. I cannot be accused of having any Party interest in this matter, as I am not attached to any political Party, and I think that, if the leaders and the members of both political Parties in this House realise the gravity of this problem, they will come together and seek a solution of the tremendous financial and economic difficulties which face this country and which members of the Government, in common with members of th Opposition Party, agree are absolutely desperate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite, and therefore I hope that Deputies will not assume that any attempt is being made to prevent them from taking part in this discussion, but I am sure it will be agreed that debates must come to an end some time.  However, I must say <Col N="2236" /> that I have sympathy with Deputy Byrne when he comments on the fact that the Minister for Finance addressed the House for three and a half hours, to be followed, I think, by the Taoiseach, for about four hours. I appreciate very much the Taoiseach's desire to cover the ground in the most comprehensive way, and if he had occupied his four hours in applying his mind acutely and closely to the economic problems confronting this country, I would have listened to him with respect&mdash;as, indeed, I always do&mdash;for two and a half hours, but when he began to talk about the practice of gavelkind in the State of Saskatchewan in Canada, I must confess that my interest began to flag. Then, much as I have enjoyed in the past the pleasure of a chat with the Taoiseach in his informal moments, when he began to brood on his childhood, and on his neighbours, the tailor and the blacksmith, at home although, as I say, I enjoyed it, since the Taoiseach is ever a gracious companion and a charming speaker&mdash;when he took up the limited time at our disposal in discussing these weighty matters, I am afraid that I thought that that charming reminiscence might have been postponed to another day.  I cannot help thinking that, on reflection, the Taoiseach will come to feel that to-day he was rather in the mood of the Right Honourable Stanley Baldwin, under an umbrageous English oak, dwelling on the characteristics of the Irish nation and his reactions to livelihood here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although Deputy Hickey seemed to like listening to the Taoiseach, I frankly felt&mdash;and I listened as closely as I could&mdash;that the more I listened, the more befogged and bemused we were becoming.  Now, I do not want anything from the Taoiseach but to inform me as to what they propose to do, but when the Taoiseach took up the position of the foolish crowd who looked at the Chinese Emperor and admired his clothes, it seemed to me that Deputy Dowdall played the role of the child who got up and said that the Emperor had no clothes at all and that it was time to cover his nakedness. There is no use in the Taoiseach telling <Col N="2237" /> us that this nation is arrayed in the golden vesture of national solvency when the fact is that it is nearly naked, and I think it is time for the Taoiseach to consult the seamstress in order to devise some raiment, however simple, to cover its nakedness.</P>
    <P>I dwell on what the Taoiseach said because, in fact, his was the only contribution from the Government Benches that had any significance at all.  The contributions of Deputy O'Loghlen and Deputy Dowdall, when stripped of the verbiage and passion and the claim to speak on behalf of the Encyclicals, simply amount to this: Let us turn the handle of the printing press and produce whatever money we require.  Now, that experiment has been tried in every country in the world.  Two thousand years B.C. that experiment was tried in China, and you have got a classical example of the terrible consequences of resorting to that expedient in the history of China at that period, and all through the history of the world, from the dawn of time until to-day, you will find muddleheaded and woolly-minded people breaking down under the stress of public life in difficult times and trying to find an easy way out by resorting to such methods and then sinking deeper into the bog and morass of insolvency than they were before and then clamouring to those whom they denounce as the bankers' friends to pull them out of the mess into which they have got us all.  Let us, for Heaven's sake, while bearing no ill-will against those well-meaning and warm-hearted men, which, no doubt, they are, tell them that while they are free&mdash;because this is a free country&mdash; to talk their silly minds as much as they like in public, they are not going to drag us down to the misery and destitution that the course they advocate would bring them, just because they are wrong.  We know they are wrong, and we are not going to have our people harrowed and afflicted just in order to satisfy Deputy O'Loghlen's mind that he has made some economic error in the calculations to which he has been addressing his mind for the past two or three years.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke of standing fast <Col N="2238" /> upon the policies he advocated seven years ago.  He said that he attached prime importance to the home market if agriculture was to be revived, and he said that the object of the Fianna Fáil policy was to build up here at home for our farmers such a market as would render them more or less independent of the markets outside, or at least much less vulnerable to them than if they were dependent mainly on them for the profits required to maintain the State.  What are the facts? The Taoiseach has been for seven years at the head of the Government, and he has had that particular aspect of his economic policy much accentuated and much accelerated by the impact of the economic war.  By the impact of the economic war he was driven back on the home market much more drastically than he would have been without the advent of that struggle.  Even under that extra urge of untoward events on his natural inclination, what is the result?  The home market has not expanded at all.  I have the figures for 1929-30 which show that £31,000,000 worth of agricultural produce produced on the farms was consumed by persons living in Eire not engaged in farm work.  In 1936-37, we consumed in this country £31,000,000 worth also exactly the same amount of money.  So that the expansion of the home market during that period of intensive development by the Government has been precisely nil.</P>

      <P>In volume the figures are practically the same.  I have not got the figures here with me at the moment, but the Minister will find that these are the facts, that the consumption by our people of agricultural produce is practically stable, and that any increase that might have taken place, owing to the peculiar circumstances in which we found ourselves when it was necessary to distribute free beef and so on, which might have been expected to raise substantially the consumption of agricultural produce, has been offset by our declining population.  These are the facts, and they cannot be got away from.  They are not things to be argued about.  I <Col N="2239" /> am not trying to make a case now; I am only setting out the figures, and these are taken from the <i>Irish Trade Journal</i> of September, 1938.  I have been trying to get more recent figures, but they do not appear to be in the official publications yet.  I presume that they are not printed and we must wait for them, but the figures I have given are sufficient for the moment to show what is the state of affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the Taoiseach spoke of the impact of tariffs and said that he admitted that tariffs raised the cost of the raw materials of the agricultural industry, and he spoke of boots and shoes; but there is something very much more vital than that.  What the Taoiseach seems to forget is that every farm is a factory.  But each of these factories has its market&mdash;the world market or the British market. If you raise the cost of the raw materials that we bring on to a farm to convert into the finished product, we are going to get precisely the same price for that product in Great Britain as we would get if you had not raised them and, when you raise the cost of the raw materials, what you are doing is simply eating our profit.  You are taking out of the farmer's pocket the money he would otherwise have to spend on clothing his children, feeding his children and maintaining his standard of life.  In short, what you are doing is simply reducing the farmer's standard of living in order to provide protection for some particular, individual industrialist whom you want to establish.  I do not mean that you want to establish industrialists who are personal friends of your own or that you are acting with any corrupt motive.  But you want to establish certain industries, no matter what the results, and you blind your eyes to the fact that, by establishing those industries you may deprive the farmer of the standard of living that we all want him to enjoy. While you are doing that in the hope of raising the industrial output of the country, you close your eyes to the fact that those parts of our industrial economy which were truly profit-making and which were primarily concerned <Col N="2240" /> with the use of raw materials produced in this country are dwindling away.</P>
    <P>Have any Deputies here recently adverted to the output of the greatest industry in Ireland&mdash;the brewery industry.  In 1931, our exports of porter amounted to 1,400,000 barrels value for £4,687,000 and our output to-day is 794,000 barrels value for £2,205,000.  This is an industry which was consuming the raw materials of the country, which was giving the best employment in the country, which was inposing no extra charge on the people of Eire, which was paying the highest rate of wages of any industry in Ireland and which was keeping dozens of malt-houses going.  These malt-houses are now closing.  That is the kind of thing about which we are alarmed.  Do you not realise that your industrial loss in that one instance more than outweighs the value of dozens of the workshops which fascinate your mind?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has had four hours and, on occasions, I was strongly tempted to interrupt him but I restrained myself.  Perhaps he will be good enough to give me the fifteen minutes that remain.  A colleague of the Taoiseach waxed eloquent on the subject of pigs.  He explained that there was a rising tendency in the pig-products industry.  What are the facts?  It is quite true that we are exporting more bacon than we exported before but have we forgotten that &ldquo;pigs is still pigs&rdquo; and that pork is still pigs.  While I freely admit that we increased the value of our exports of bacon by £1,041,000 in the period referred to by the Minister, our export of pigs decreased by £1,965,000 and our export of pork decreased by £1,060,000, giving us a net decrease in our export of pig products of £1,900,000.  Is that the kind of evidence of increasing production that appeals to the mind of the Taoiseach? If we are to discuss these questions objectively it is not honest&mdash;it is disingenuous <Col N="2241" /> at best&mdash;to tell the House that there is an increasing output of bacon when the truth is that the pig industry, which is the means of the farmers' livelihood, reveals a decrease represented by £1,900,000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just going to talk about that.  That is why I mentioned the matter.  The Taoiseach asks why should we bring American bacon into the country when we can make bacon ourselves.  The answer is simple. Suppose we like American bacon, why should we not bring in American bacon?  Suppose I am making 1,000,000 cwts. of bacon, which I can sell at a handsome profit abroad, why should I not use American bacon if I like American bacon?  If you put American bacon on one side and Irish bacon on the other side, for the purpose of dressing cabbage, I prefer American bacon and I can get it at 6d. per lb.  Why should I be forced to buy Irish bacon, which I do not want, and pay 1/3 for it when I can get American bacon for 6d. and sell my Irish bacon in England at 1/4?  Why should I be made to take a loss on my pig when my natural inclination is to consume another product and, when by consuming another product, I can make a better profit for the community to which I belong?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We speak of wheat.  The Taoiseach seemed to justify the expenditure of £2,500,000 on the production of wheat on the ground that it provided a guarantee for us against starvation in time of war.  Our problem in time of war will be to get food out of the country.  Does not the Taoiseach realise that 5,000,000 acres of arable land will feed all the people of the country, even if you ram food down their stomachs with a ramrod.  We shall be smothered, stiffled and buried in a rotting heap of foodstuffs in the event of war.  That is the deadly blow that the enemies of Ireland can deliver against us&mdash;to suspend our outgoing traffic.  We shall be buying shovels and shovelling food into the sea.  With <Col N="2242" /> that vast, immense, unconsumable accumulation of food, we are to pay £2,500,000 to protect ourselves against a scarcity of wheat.  I lived on oaten bread in my schooldays.  I never got wheaten bread from one end of the year to another and I weigh 14 stones to-day.  We are paying £2,500,000 per annum for the growing of wheat.  We have 220,000 acres under this crazy, futile crop, every acre of which could be growing a profitable crop which would provide for our people a higher standard of living.  That is Fianna Fáil economy.</P>
    <P>We are told that we can get sugar at dumped prices.  I stood in the sugar fields of Honolulu and watched the workers&mdash;coloured men&mdash;engaged on the crop.  They were receiving four times the wages that an agricultural labourer in Ireland receives.  They were working shorter hours than the agricultural labourer in Ireland works and that sugar was being shipped at 8/- a cwt.  Here it costs 27/- to grow it and the agricultural labourer receives 27/- a week.  We wonder why the labourers in this country do not get married. Where is the man in this House who will marry and support a wife and four children on 27/- a week?  I have seen them trying to do it.  I have seen their children gradually starving under their eyes.  I have seen them just kept alive and growing weaker and more miserable with the passage of every year. Instead of adding to their strength, every year tended to make them leaner, thinner and poorer than they were before.</P>
    <P>That is life for a family on 27/- a week.  Let those Deputies who talk about dumped sugar remember that sugar produced in the islands of the Pacific Ocean, deliverable in this country at 8/- per cwt., can afford to pay black men four times what we pay the agricultural labourer in this country. There is no use wagging your head about it.  I have been there and have seen it and I have talked to them.</P>
    <P>I have only a few moments left.  The Opposition as conducted by this Party since this Parliament sat has been one, so far as I am aware, both within Party councils and in this House, <Col N="2243" /> designed to do one thing only and that is to serve the best interests of this country.  Everybody knows that we are confronted by a grave financial crisis and I said with the full authority of the Party for which I speak, at the opening of this debate, that anything we can do to help the Government to protect the country from the consequences of that disaster we will be glad to do.  That has been interpreted in certain circles as an invitation from us for a coalition.  It is not. People who think of coalitions often indulge in wishful thinking.  They imagine that if you take men whose political outlooks are completely different, and put them around a table a miracle occurs and they all start to agree.  There can be no coalition between honest public men unless there is identity of purpose amongst them.  This is a democratic country. We went to the country with our policy and the Taoiseach went with his and he won.  He has the right and his colleagues have the right to form the Government of this country and to maintain it until they go to the country again and the people pass judgment upon them.</P>
    <P>They sought the suffrage of the people and they got it.  Very well. There is no Party in this House that desires to interfere with the constitutional right they have to form and maintain the Government of this country. But, while they may enjoy the privilege of forming the Government of this country, they are bound by solemn duty to accept responsibilities at the same time.  They have no right to let this country drift along the path leading to her destruction, to drift along the path which brings honest and well-intentioned men into this House to advocate the turning of the handle of the printing press.  Their duty is to safeguard the economy and the wealth of this country in such a way as to prevent developments of that kind, because, if those developments once get under way and are put in practice, neither that Government nor any Government this House can put up will be strong enough to stop them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2244" /> We have presented the views of the minority.  We have made it clear that we are prepared to do all we can to help the Government to take the requisite steps to meet this situation and overcome it.  It is not our job and it is not our right to dictate to the Government the policy that they are to pursue.  Our duty is to point out to the Government where their policy goes wrong.  Our duty and our privilege is to lay before the people our policy and that we shall continue to do. We put our policy before the people at the last election.  It was rejected.  The policy of the Government was accepted instead.  Let the Government now meet the crisis that they have brought upon this country with some policy and, if they are not prepared to do it, let them go out and tell the country that we will present a policy to the country and ask the country's suffrage to give us authority to do what Fianna Fáil has not the courage to do.</P>
    <P>This is the last word.  There has grown up in this country recently a practice among certain guttersnipes to refer to those in public life in terms of contumely and insult, to fling mud and suggest that no man enters in public life in this country except for private profit or gain.  If that thing continues a day will dawn in this country, as it has elsewhere, when those who are not prepared to submit to that beslobbering with dirt by those who have not the courage to undertake responsibility themselves, will get out of public life.  There is no man sitting on these benches who could not make at his own profession far more than this State will ever offer him for his services.  It would be very easy for most of the people on these benches to quit public life and leave it to those who would be prepared to take such rewards as it has to offer in exchange for the abuse and misrepresentation and slanders that are heaped upon them by certain irresponsible individuals at the present time.  I would be sorry to see that happen in this country but, if it is not to happen, then those who sympathise with me should realise that, totally as we may disagree with one another in public affairs, we have a bounden duty at <Col N="2245" /> least to recognise the dignities of one another and jointly to resent encroachment upon the personal honour or integrity of those who are asked to do the nation's business.  It is time that was said because I have seen democracies in this continent and in another in which that kind of scurrilous abuse which I was sorry to hear Deputy Cogan for Wicklow refer to in words of apparent approval to-day&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy considers with me that scurrilous abuse of Parliamentary institutions and public men can destroy democracy in the country in which it is allowed to go unchecked.  It ought to stop, because whatever Parliament the people have got is the Parliament they themselves chose.  If it is not good enough for them let them get a better one.  If it is good it will not be long before they get a worse one.  I think this fairly represents our belief, and I am not ashamed of it.  If the critics do not like it let them produce something better.  We have got a big job before us.  I do not expect the Prime Minister to get up in sack cloth and ashes and confess that he made a mistake and that he made a mess of it all.  That would be more than human nature could expect, and I am not sure that even if he were swept with an unprecedented humility it would be a wise thing to do.  I do not so much despair as Deputy Belton of the good this debate may have done.  While it may not have been exhaustive, it made the Taoiseach talk for four hours to prove he was right, and when you hear a man talking for four hours to prove he is right it is a very good sign that there is some little something stirring in his mind.  It made him pursue a course <Col N="2246" /> which resulted in certain individual Deputies of his Party being left in a sickly silence.  That would suggest to me that something was stirring in the minds of others.  If that be so, thank God for it.</P>
      <P>Let me conclude on this note.  Let him rest assured that if during the three months before us he will cogitate the motion we have discussed to-day and finds that he has difficult things to do in the service of this State, he need not be one bit afraid of this Opposition.  They will help him. That does not mean that they abandon the principles for which they stand. He fairly described them as on our side, leaning slightly towards free trade, on his, leaning wildly to protection. I misrepresent him only just so much as  tried to misrepresent us.  We will maintain those positions. We will argue them before the people, and I think we will ultimately convince the people that we are right. But in the meantime there is urgent work to be done and I think it may be work which will require the co-operation of us all.  If it is wanted, that Government or any other Government the Irish people will put in will get it from the members of this Party.  I only hope and pray that that Government will have the moral courage to face their responsibility and save our people both here and scattered all over the world as they are from an unprecedented humiliation in the eyes of their enemies.</P>

Separate employment figures are not available in respect of the assembly of laundry machines by these firms.  It is not possible, therefore, to state the number of persons employed solely in this work at present, nor the number of additional employees who have been taken on since the duty was originally imposed.</P>
