      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether any guiding rules have been issued to school managers, either verbally or by circular, or whether it is a matter of personal discretion, as to what constitutes &ldquo;necessity&rdquo; under the scheme for the provision of State aid towards the cost of supplying book equipment for necessitous children.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state if wool can be <Col N="398" /> imported into this country duty free, where Irish wool is not obtainable in the necessary colour, for the manufacture of woollen goods for re-export.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Wool as such is not liable to duty.  Presumably the Deputy refers to wool yarn.</P>
      <P>Section 38 of the Finance Act, 1932, provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that where the Revenue Commissioners are satisfied that any article or goods chargeable with a duty of customs are imported for the purpose of undergoing in Saorstát Eireann a process of manufacture and being subsequently exported, the Revenue Commissioners may, subject to compliance with such conditions as they may think fit to impose, permit such article or goods to be imported without payment of duty.</P>
      <P>Subject, therefore, to such conditions, e.g., identification, security for exportation, etc., provision exists for the importation of wool yarn without payment of duty in the circumstances indicated by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that the price fixed for beet for the ensuing year, taking into account the increased price of pulp, represents a net increase of 8/9 per ton of beet over the price fixed for last year; that the ¾d. per lb. placed on sugar over and above the tax imposed by the Supplementary Budget represents in terms of beet approximately £1 per ton, and if he will state if the increased burden thus placed on the consumer has been apportioned between the grower and manufacturer equitably.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first part of the question, the Deputy's figures are substantially correct.  As regards the other parts of the question, I would refer the Deputy to the very full statement made by the Minister for Supplies during the debate on the Supplementary Budget of the reason for the increase in the wholesale price of sugar over the duties imposed by the <Col N="399" /> relevant Financial Resolution.  It is apparent from that statement that no question of apportionment of the increase referred to by the Deputy arises in the circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that the schools in the Killorglin and Glencar parishes are excluded from the provisions of the School Meals (Gaeltacht) Act, 1930, while meals are provided under this Act for the schools in Glanbehy parish which immediately adjoins them; and whether in view of the severe hardship imposed on the children of the parishes omitted, he will take steps to ensure that meals are provided in the schools of these parishes.</P>

School meals may be provided in schools situated in one of the scheduled district electoral divisions comprised in the Gaeltacht as defined in the School Meals (Gaeltacht) Act, 1930.  The schools in Killorglin and Glancar parishes are not so situated and do not therefore come under the terms of the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state if he has received any representations from local authorities in the Counties of Laoighis and Offaly requesting him to sanction the acceptance of tenders for carrying out sewerage schemes with stoneware pipes made in the constituency; whether he has received or will consider evidence to show that the use of stoneware pipes for such schemes is in the interest of public health and economy; and whether he will now reconsider his recent decisions rejecting tenders for carrying out sewerage schemes in certain towns in Laoighis and Offaly with stoneware pipes and sanction same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received representations of the nature referred to in the case of two sewerage schemes in these counties.  In both cases the advice tendered to the local authority by their technical adviser was in favour of the lowest tender, which involved the use of pipes other than stoneware.  My Department recommended the local authorities concerned to act in accordance with the technical advice tendered to them.  In all such cases the recommendations to local authorities are intended to serve the interests of public health and economy.  I see no reason for reconsidering the matter.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the reply of the Parliamentary Secretary, I should like to know if he is aware that the County Dublin Board of Health, on the advice of their own engineer, recommended that stoneware pipes be used for a sewerage scheme in Finglas, and that, according to the evidence he could produce before the board, concrete pipes have been a failure, particularly where the dairying industry was concerned?  Has the Parliamentary Secretary any evidence, or has his Department any evidence, to that effect, and is he aware that, in the case of the Finglas sewerage scheme, the County Dublin Board of Health recommended stoneware pipes?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he has received any representations regarding the provision of a water supply to residents at Carrigduff, County Carlow; and if he will state whether it is proposed to provide a water supply for this village, and, if so, when.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the affirmative. The provision of a water supply for Carrigduff is a matter for the Carlow Board of Health.  I cannot say when a supply will be available.  The Carlow Board of Health have for a considerable time been negotiating with the Wexford Board of Health for the taking of a supply of water for Carrigduff from the pipe line serving Bunclody, but no agreement as to terms has so far been reached.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if, in view of the fact that many years have passed since a new hospital was promised for 30 patients in Birr, he is <Col N="402" /> now prepared to sanction the proposal and to allow the board to submit plans, etc., with a view to initiating the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he has satisfied himself that the conditions under which the sick patients in Birr hospital are treated are suitable and proper; and, furthermore, if he will state why he refused to hear a representative deputation from South Offaly with reference to the necessity of a new hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take together the Deputy's two questions regarding Birr hospital.  The reply to the first question is in the negative.  The present commitments of the Hospitals Trust Fund would not permit of the immediate erection of all the institutions which it is proposed ultimately to provide.  In the circumstances the reception of the deputation referred to in the second question would not have served any useful purpose.  A committee of the Offaly Board of Health which inspected Birr hospital about a year ago reported that it could be put into perfect repair with a small outlay. Certain repairs and alterations were recently recommended by the board's engineer, and if the board would adopt those proposals it is likely that the hospital accommodation could be made suitable for a long time to come.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have answered that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>We considered that the county hospital was of primary importance. We could not carry out the provision of all the institutions in the county at the same time.  There are a good many counties in which no hospital provision has been made out of the Hospitals' Fund.  We proceeded with the Tullamore County Hospital, believing that it was of primary importance.</P>

      <P>The maximum retail price of batch bread is regulated by orders made under the Bread (Regulation of Prices) Act, 1936.  Retail prices of the other commodities referred to in the question are not, at present, regulated by statutory order.  If the Deputy will furnish the names of the traders in Donegal charging 6d. per 2lb. loaf of batch bread, action will be taken by my Department. Action will also be taken regarding the other prices mentioned by the Deputy if particulars are furnished to my Department, and where, on investigation, it is found that the prices charged are unreasonable.  A number of complaints have recently been received regarding the prices <Col N="404" /> charged in Donegal for sugar, flour and maize meal, and the investigation of these complaints is proceeding.  The present maximum price for batch bread delivered to customers in any place in the State is 11d. per 4lb. loaf or 5½d. per 2lb. loaf.</P>

      <P>Small farmers generally do a good deal of tillage, and I anticipate that not only will there be no slackening of their efforts in existing circumstances, but that they will do even more than formerly.  It would also be most desirable that labourers should use for tillage to the fullest extent possible the plots attached to their cottages.  I am not satisfied that the needs of the position are such as to warrant the introduction of any new scheme for the purpose of providing seeds and manures.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will state whether anything has been done to relieve the Clare farmers who lost their cattle through the fluke epidemic during the past two years; and, if not, if he will state the reasons; and whether in view of the fact that these farmers and their families are at present suffering severe hardship and privations, he will state whether he now intends to make available some financial assistance in their cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Owing to the wet condition of the land in certain areas in County Clare outbreaks of fluke disease amongst stock have frequently occurred in the past.  As a result of investigations and inquiries carried out on the spot I am satisfied that the epidemic referred to was not appreciably more serious than those which occurred in preceding years.  It is evident that the remedy for this state of affairs must be a permanent improvement in the conditions under which stock are kept. Measures taken by individual farmers <Col N="408" /> for the drainage and liming of their land have proved the most effective means of reducing the incidence of outbreaks of this disease.</P>
      <P>In arranging the allocation of funds for the lime distribution scheme special consideration was given to the needs of County Clare in this connection and accordingly farmers will be able to avail of the scheme to improve the condition of their land with a view to preventing further outbreaks of disease amongst stock.</P>
      <P>Farmers in the county will also be assisted under the general scheme for the supply of artificial manures at reduced prices.  Provision has been made for a special course of veterinary lectures which will be given in the county in the near future.  With a view to meeting cases of exceptional hardship arising from losses from fluke disease arrangements have already been made under which financial assistance for the purchase of heifers and cows will be available through the creameries in County Clare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be quite easy for us on this side to express a desire to assist the Government in the crisis which has arisen, but, before we could do that, we should have to ask ourselves what confidence we had in the Government, and what right they had to our confidence.  It was rather amusing to hear the Minister for Finance, speaking on the earlier stages of the Budget, referring to the fact that the speech of the Leader of the Opposition might be likened to the speech he made on the last Budget, and the one before, and the one before that, and that it was simply a question of shouting squandermania on each occasion.  As a matter of fact, that was a compliment which the Minister did not realise he was paying to the Leader of the Opposition.  It was a perfectly true statement.  It is perfectly consistent with the position he took up ever since Fianna Fáil came in and told the House that they were going to save the country millions of pounds, and, instead of that, having millions of pounds piled on.  One of the most extraordinary statements made in the whole debate was the speech of the ex-Minister for Finance, when he said that opposition to this Budget was an attack on the neutrality policy which the Government had declared, and those are the reasons we cannot have any confidence in the people who constitute the Government.  They ought to be straight with the people, and with the House, and there is no use in the ex-Minister for Finance, or the Minister for Industry and Commerce, endeavouring to drag a red herring across the path in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody knows that it is schoolboy childishness for a Minister to say that opposition to this Budget is an attack upon neutrality, but I suppose it was simply that the Minister was so hard-pushed for some material on which to build a case for this Budget that he had to fall back on nonsense of that sort.  We have, right through the administration of this Government, the feeling that there is an extravagant notion permeating their whole policy. I remember hearing a member on the Government Benches declaring, with emphasis and with enthusiasm, that <Col N="415" /> they had killed the 200-acre man in this country, and defying anybody to put him back.  I do not think that was anything to boast of, and we have the Minister for Finance declaring that he very much regrets that there are not more wealthy men in this country who would be able to carry the burden.  That is true; it is a cause for regret; but an appreciation of that fact has come pretty late in the day to the Government.</P>
    <P>If there is anything which would impress us in favour of this Budget, it would be that it was necessary, that the war which has come upon the world, and which so encircles us here, would put fresh burdens on the people; but, in considering that, we must remember that the people in charge of affairs to-day have broken confidence with the people and when we remember the position with regard to the flour millers, the bacon curers, the turf bricquettes, the alcohol factories, the Roscrea factory, and all the silly idiotic things the Government put the people's money into, and which went down, we can have very little confidence that if we give them more money to-day, it is going to be well spent.  There is evidence&mdash;it has been produced in the House&mdash;by a commission set up by the Government themselves that certain people have overcharged the community to an enormous extent, and have done that with the protection of the Government.  The figures have been set out and the amounts set out by the Prices Commission would relieve the present burden to a considerable extent, if the Government only put their hands on them.  While certain people can get away with loot of that sort, the poor people must be ground down by a new tax on sugar, on tobacco and on beer, and all those other items which, bound together, will surely press very hardly upon the community.</P>
    <P>What evidence have we that this increased expenditure is going to be put to good use?  Has the Minister told us, has anybody told us, what the new activities of the Army, of the coast watchers and of the new type of <Col N="416" /> marine service which we are setting up will cost?  We ought to know, and the people, since they are footing the bill, are entitled to know, what effective machinery the Government propose to set up in connection with this coast watching and marine service.  Personally I should be very intrigued to know what steps these coast watchers and other such people will take if they find foreign submarines in our territorial waters.</P>
    <P>I heard a story told last week about two men who had been appointed coast watchers.  Apparently the best qualification they had for the appointment was that they were strong supporters of the Government.  I was told that they were put into some old ruin on the western coast.  They had not even glasses to enable them to carry out their duties and the nearest Guards' Barrack was five miles away.  These two gentlemen go out to watch from 9 o'clock in the morning until 5 o'clock in the evening.  Between 5 o'clock in the evening and 9 o'clock in the morning, anybody and everybody who wants to do so, is welcome to come into our territorial waters and to land on our shores.  Between the hours from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., these two gentlemen, paid at the public expense, were to watch apparently without the aid of glasses.  They were asked what they would do if they saw something that they did not understand or that they thought was a submarine and one of them said: &ldquo;We will tell the Guards.&rdquo;  The question was asked: &ldquo;How will you tell the Guards?&rdquo; and the answer was: &ldquo;One of us would go back to the Civic Guards' Barrack&rdquo;. He was then asked how he would get there, if he would walk, or cycle.  The reply was: &ldquo;There is no road back; we would have to walk back five or six miles&rdquo;.  The next question asked was: &ldquo;What would the Guards do?&rdquo; and the reply given was: &ldquo;We do not know.  We go on at 9 in the morning and we finish at 5 in the evening&rdquo;. Is that a service to which the Minister is asking the people of the country to subscribe?  If the people of this country had to subscribe by way of a Supplementary Budget to new services, <Col N="417" /> they ought to be told what the services are and how they are going to affect the country.</P>
    <P>Again we have had all this bungling in connection with the A.R.P. services. I do not think I ever heard in all my life so much bungling as there was in connection with that Department.  We had an instance of it here in this House when not one Minister on the Front Bench knew who was responsible for the orders given for the black-out. Then it was sought to throw the blame on the people themselves by suggesting that they resorted to the black-out themselves because they heard about it in foreign broadcasts, notwithstanding the fact that the Guards went around in certain places and ordered the people to have a black-out.  Apparently that has been finished.  At least we have got the lights on again.  If that is the kind of service the people of the country are going to get for this Supplementary Budget, then I think everybody has a perfect right to oppose it and ought to oppose it.</P>
    <P>There does not appear to be very much left unsaid as far as this Bill is concerned.  I just desire to add that although it does not rest with mortals to command success, at the same time mortals very often deserve success. If the Minister and his Government in the past have not succeeded in their efforts, perhaps in some instances there might be some good reasons for that, but on the whole, looking back on the whole programme of the Government, it has consisted mainly of a series of bunglings from the very beginning up to date, and it seems as if we are to have a continuation of that bungling.  We have reached a position now in which the Minister says, &ldquo;What else is there left to tax but sugar?&rdquo; Surely, that is a sorry situation for the Minister after the Fianna Fáil Government has been seven or eight years in office.  We have the unemployment position becoming more acute daily.  We are now faced with a position, after seven or eight years of a policy of self-sufficiency, in which the factories established in furtherance of that policy are shown to be dependent almost entirely on raw materials from <Col N="418" /> outside.  If we had been really self-sufficient, the war would have given these factories an opportunity of proving themselves, but instead the whole programme went flop when war broke out.</P>
    <P>Again we are confronted with a position in which more money is required from the people to spend on services about which we are told nothing.  There is, we are told, increased expenditure on the Army, but no details of that expenditure are given.  I was informed on my way up from my constituency to Dublin that in one military station between here and Roscommon 500 gallons of petrol are distributed daily for use in that station.  Why should we be called upon to pay for expenditure of that kind? I do not think that the Minister or any of the speakers on the Government side have justified this Budget. They find themselves now in a bad position and they have put the country into a bad position.  They are surrounded with difficulties into which their own policy has led them.  We have at the moment the extraordinary spectacle in this country of a section of our farmers going on strike, a thing that never happened before.  I do not want to go into the merits or the demerits of that strike now, but I do say that while you have taxation piled on the country in the way in which the Minister proposes to pile it on now, you are bound to have reactions of this sort.  If it was necessary to impose taxation there were other methods which might have been tried. The Minister apparently does not think there were.  The Minister took a different road.  He has taken a road which is going to press very hard on the poor people of the country and, in my opinion, the case which he has made does not justify this Budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinMNally" hpid="Mr. Nally Mr. Nally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nally</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to enter a strong protest against the increase in the tax on sugar and beer and on the other commodities referred to in this Supple mentary Budget.  This Fianna Fáil Government has been in power during the last seven years and has, I understand, spent about £210,000,000 of the <Col N="421" /> people's money during that period.  If the Government that had been in power in 1931-1932 had been continued in power, this country would have been saved at least £60,000,000.  We all know that the conditions in the country were never as bad as they are to-day, and, in my opinion, if the Minister wanted to save money he could have done so by reducing certain services. In that way he could have got the money he required instead of taxing the sugar, beer and other commodities of the poor people of the country.  Let me indicate some of the services on which I think he could save money instead of taxing the commodities of the poor.  The upkeep of the two Houses of the Oireachtas costs at the present time £125,070.  In 1931-1932, their upkeep cost £111,000, although at that time we had, I think, about 15 more members in this House than we have to-day.  He could save on that service at least £15,000.  In my opinion we are getting no greater service now than we got in 1931-1932.  That is a service that could easily be cut down.  The cost of the Taoiseach's Department has been increased by £3,000 since 1931. There is no reason why that increase should have taken place, and there could at least be that amount saved on that Vote.  The Department of the Minister for Finance in 1931 cost £57,000.  The figure is now £75,000. Surely at least £15,000 could be taken off there.  No one, I think, would contend that the services in this country are any better now than they were in 1931, or that it should cost more to run them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Office of the Revenue Commissioners in 1931 cost £644,000.  The cost to-day is £885,000.  There could be a cut there of £250,000.  Why should that Department cost more to-day than it did in 1931, especially in view of the fact that not only is the revenue of the country going down but the population is also decreasing?  In view of the fact that the wealth of the country shows a decrease, I think there could be at least a saving of £250,000 there.  That is one direction in which the Minister might look for savings. The Office of Public Works, which cost £90,000 in 1931, is to-day costing <Col N="422" /> £123,000.  If there was a saving of £40,000 made in the case of that Department, I think it would be very desirable because, in my opinion, the Office of Public Works was being run in a far more efficient manner in 1931, when it was costing the country nearly £40,000 a year less than it is being run to-day.  Public Works and Buildings in 1931 were costing £609,000. The figure to-day is £1,370,000.  The Minister could easily cut off £80,000 on that Vote, especially in view of the fact that the country is getting poorer in all directions.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service Commission is costing £25,000.  The cost in 1931 was £12,000.  What are they doing for this £25,000?  Where is the money being spent?  That is a service that, I think, was being run far more efficiently on £12,000 in 1931 than it is to-day.  There could be a saving of £10,000 there.  Secret Service is costing the country to-day £20,000.  In 1931, the cost was £2,000.  What secret service have we in the country at the present time?  Who is getting that money, and what are they doing?  The management of Government stocks is costing to-day £15,000.  In 1931, that service cost £10,000.  There is room for a saving of £5,000 there.  The cost of the Department of the Minister for Justice in 1931 was £36,000.  Now it is £43,000.  What extra work is being done in that Department to justify that large increase?  I do not think there is any more work being done there now than there was in 1931.  Probably some of the increase is required to pay supporters of Fianna Fáil who have succeeded in getting soft jobs in that office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinMNally" hpid="Mr. Nally Mr. Nally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nally</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few other services that I propose to refer to.  The cost of the Gárda Síochána in 1931 was £1,599,000.  To-day it is costing £1,888,000.  I think there could be a saving of £250,000 on that Vote.  I understand that a short time ago the strength of the Gárda Síochána was increased <Col N="423" /> by one-fifth.  What was the necessity for that?  Has the country got more lawless under a Fianna Fáil administration than it was under the last Government?  I do not think so.  I do not see any evidence of lawlessness in my county, in my constituency or in the country generally, so far as I can gather from reading the newspapers. In 1931 the Department of Local Government and Public Health was costing the country £527,389.  The cost to-day is £1,349,000.  There could be a saving of at least £800,000 on that Department. If these savings were made there would be no need for bringing forward this Supplementary Budget.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Minister for Agriculture should, in my opinion, be run as cheaply now as it was in 1931. We all know that throughout the country a great deal of fault is found with the way in which this Department is being run.  We all know that even at the present time there is a strike of farmers all over the country.  That strike could have been averted if there had been any efficiency in the Department of Agriculture and anybody there to look after the interests of the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1931 the Department of Lands cost £517,027.  Now, it is costing £1,792,028 to run it.  I suggest that that Vote could be cut down by at least £750,000.  Then, as far as the work done by the Land Commission is concerned, I want to say that the Minister should see that that Commission does its work. It is costing the country a huge sum of money.  Yet, all one could see for it is a horde of inspectors going all over the country in their motor cars wasting petrol and apparently doing nothing. The Department of External Affairs was costing £55,000 in 1931.  Now, it is costing £90,000.  That Vote could really be cut down by £40,000.  In 1931 the Army cost £1,173,794.  Now, it is costing £3,252,199.  What return are we getting for that money?  What is the Army doing?  Where are they?  I suggest that that Vote could be cut down by £2,000,000 and yet leave us with sufficient of an Army to look after the interests of the people and give <Col N="424" /> them the protection they need.  Indeed there is no necessity for the Army.  The Gárda Síochána could do all that is required in the way of protecting the people, and there is no necessity for the double cost of the Army.  Then there are the export subsidies costing £606,000 in the present Vote.  There was no item down for that in 1931.  That Vote could be reduced by £500,000.  We all know that the country is overtaxed.</P>
    <P>I will now read an extract from a letter published in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of some days ago&mdash;it appeared on the 18th November under the title &ldquo;Will We Waken Up?&rdquo; The letter sets out Fianna Fáil election promises and performances as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;(1) Over-taxation would be reduced by £2,000,000 a year.&rdquo;  That was the Fianna Fáil promise before the General Election of 1932.  Here is the performance: &ldquo;They have increased it by £8,000,000.&rdquo;  That is £10,000,000 altogether away from the promise. &ldquo;(2) The Army was not wanted.  (They have increased it by 75 per cent.).  (3) As a peaceful country we had too many police.  (They have increased the Gárda by 20 per cent.).  (4) There would be so much work that we would have to send for all our relatives from overseas to cope with it.  (We have over 100,000 unemployed and no outlet for our boys and girls leaving school). (5) They would reduce the number of Government officials.  (They have increased them by 33 per cent.).  (6) Our university students were urged to take out their degrees and learn Irish, the jobs were waiting for them.  (Yet we import foreigners for all the good jobs and leave the £2 and £3 jobs for our students to scramble for).  (7) The former Ministers were overpaid, the new Ministers would do the job for less money.  (Yet they waited until they were firmly in the saddle, then voted bigger salaries for themselves&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nally</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, Sir, we all know that Fianna Fáil has been in power for the last seven years.  We all know, also, Sir, that in 1931 the Estimates totalled £20,925,911.  In 1939 the total is £30,248,897.  What has the Government done with all that money?  There is there a sum of £10,000,000 more than what it cost to run the country seven or eight years ago.  If we add up all the increases in the Estimates since 1932 it will be found that the entire lot is between £60,000,000 and £70,000,000. That is what the Fianna Fáil Government <Col N="426" /> has already spent in excess of what the former Government was spending.  Now, they come before this House and ask for powers to further increase taxation on the Irish people. I understand that the Government are about issuing a new loan for between £6,000,000 and £7,000,000 in the near future.  I do not know where they are going to get the money, but at all events we would like to know from the Minister on what is this new loan to be spent?  There are reports in the Press that they are about to buy quite a number of torpedo boats from England. These are really only scrap as far as the British are concerned.  If our Government wanted to get armaments of that description, why not set to work and build boats themselves?  That would relieve unemployment to some extent &mdash;that is to say, if the boats are needed at all, but I do not believe that we need boats.  I am aware that boats are being built in Athlone.  If the Government want boats for the purpose stated in recent reports why not have them built in this country instead of importing them?  The only way in which Fianna Fáil can bring about prosperity in this country is by announcing a general election and let the people of this country rule the country.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to deal satisfactorily with a question of this sort without going generally into the whole national economy.  Anybody who listened to the debates must have noticed that those who were speaking from the opposite benches had at the backs of their minds, as an alternative to the policy which we are pursuing, a free-trade policy, modified perhaps a little, but fundamentally and essentially a free-trade policy.  The policy was, as it was put: &ldquo;Buy wherever you can; no matter how it affects you at home, buy wherever you can in the cheapest market.  Sell, if you can sell, if you are permitted to sell, in the dearest market.  Let there be no State interference with the individual.  Let the law of the jungle prevail both within the State, concerning the units within the State, the individuals of the State, and between one State and another.&rdquo; Now, that is an old cry here in this country, and the battle between those who hold that view and those who hold the view which we hold has been fought out over a long number of years.  Those who hold for free trade built up an abstract theory which would work perhaps, with certain obvious consequences, in a world very different from the world we are in, with <Col N="429" /> a political condition very different from the political condition of this world at the present time.</P>
      <P>The policy is a policy of <i>laissez faire</i>, unrestrained competition, the weak to go to the wall, and only those who are fit to survive in that jungle conflict to survive.  We have at all times opposed that type of policy.  We have opposed it because we believe that it is essentially an unjust policy.  On the basis of justice, we have opposed it as a policy, because we believe that the weak have a right to exist and live, weak individuals within the nation as well as weak States within the world. The gentlemen who stand for that policy in fullness would wipe out all national barriers, because it could not work successfully if those national barriers were not wiped out.  They want a cosmopolitanism which is not accepted by the majority of people in any country in the world to day.  They want a state of affairs in which, say, as a French economist has put it, a modern Greece would have to disappear from the world because its land was not sufficiently rich to enable it to exist in the conditions of fierce competition upon which free trade is fundamentally based.</P>

      <P>I say the free-trade policy is a policy which we do not stand for.  It has been fought out in this country over a number of years. We saw it in operation, in so far as this country was concerned, in the 19th century, during the greater part of the 19th century, down to the beginning of the 20th century, and our people revolted against it, and a national policy was set up, and our people deliberately decided to seek not merely political freedom, but also economic freedom, and in order to get their economic freedom they based their efforts mainly on a policy of protection, because that was the only economic policy that would enable them to have any measure of real freedom.</P>
      <P>This has been fought out by the Irish people and they have given their answer unhesitatingly and with a definiteness which it is not possible to misrepresent.  They saw the working out of the free trade policy and they made up their minds that they were going to get rid of it.  They saw it working out in the depopulation of the country. It affected our country in this way, that it reduced our population from 8,250,000 to 4,250,000 over a period of 80 or 90 years.  They saw it continuing and they saw that if this nation was to survive we would have to have protection for the industries and the people; otherwise, the end was obvious, that we would have, in competition with other countries, to get larger and larger units, more and more machinery, carrying less and less people upon the land.  That was the inevitable end&mdash;we were going to be a large grass farm beside Britain, a large industrial country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was to save the country from that fate that the other policy was adopted by the people.  We have pursued that policy consistently and if you want to measure the results to-day, you will <Col N="431" /> have to take the two sides of the account.  You can take the policy of the previous Administration as shown in their activities; take its advantages, whatever advantages free trade would give; take its disadvantages, and get the net result.  Then compare that net result with a similar balance taken in relation to the economic policy for which we stand.  Take its advantages and its disadvantages and, when you get the difference, make a comparison with what has been done by the previous Administration.</P>
    <P>It is idle to be arguing here, with Deputies saying that if they were allowed to get in such and such a commodity our production costs would be less.  We are quite prepared to have a complete analysis made and to judge the policy for which we stand to-day and for which we stood when we came into office.  Judge that policy in its results with what the opposite policy would have given us.  So far as the last eight years are concerned, you have the actual working out of our policy.  You have not the working out, for those eight years, of the other policy, because it was not allowed to work&mdash;the people did not want it.  You can go back over the previous eight years and see the working out of the other policy, or you can go back two or three generations and see the working out of the other policy, and I ask you to compare them.</P>
    <P>When we came into office we told the people definitely that we were going to try to build up industries here which would give employment to people who otherwise would be unemployed. We said: &ldquo;We are going to protect industry, the agricultural industry as well as the manufacturing industry.&rdquo;  We pointed out to the people what the position was at the time.  When we came into office there was some £17,500,000 worth of imports, foodstuffs and live animals.  Those imports included things which were being produced on our own farms every day, things for which we found it extremely difficult to get a profitable foreign market.</P>
    <P>When we came into office we had <Col N="432" /> reached a period of rapid decline in relation to agriculture and agricultural prices.  We saw that the foreign markets presented a difficulty, yet here quite obviously was a home market that could be preserved for our farmers.  We deliberately set out to try to get that market.  There was no reason why bacon should come in here, there was no reason why other commodities like cheese and products of that sort should come in here.  We decided that we would make that market available for our own farmers, and we did it, and you will see, if you compare the figures for the articles we imported when we came into office with the figures available to-day, that we have given a protected market worth £6,000,000 odd to our farmers, and that could not be obtained for them except through the policy of protection.  That £6,000,000 represents a safe market, a market that cannot be taken away from them by unfair competition or by dumping from outside.</P>
    <P>We have gone over the severe period of the economic depression, but it is important that we should remember what the conditions were at that time. It is not always remembered that there was a bigger drop in prices for the two years before we came into office, from 1929 to 1931, than there was here from 1931 to the lowest point reached, even when the economic war, as it was called, was in progress and British tariffs were being operated against our goods.  I want you to remember that.  I want you to remember also that at the time we came into office our dairying industry was practically destroyed on account of the reduction that had taken place in the prices in those earlier years.  One of our first acts when we came in was to protect that industry.  We set up a system of stabilisation and control, the result of which was&mdash;I will give you a picture of it&mdash;that with the subsidies that were given at one period the price in the English market of butter was only 70/- a cwt.&mdash;allowing for the tariffs the net price of Irish butter would have been only 50/&mdash;while there was given to the creameries, to the Irish farmers, at that time, a price <Col N="433" /> somewhat over 104/-.  When we came into office we found that the dairying industry was being destroyed and we had to come to its assistance by means of the Act of 1933.  As a result of the operation of that Act the industry was saved.  Although it could not be said that the prices were particularly remunerative, still the industry was saved and the farmer, during the time of the lowest depression, in the period I have mentioned, actually got £1,327,000 more as a result of that Act and that assistance which was given to him than he would have got in the free open British market.</P>
    <P>Looking at our imports, there was one big item which must strike anybody and that item is imported wheat. We had only 21,000 acres of land under wheat.  We want over 700,000 in order to get our requirements.  We have now about one-third of our requirements. About 258,000 acres, I think, were grown last year.  But at that time we were only growing a mere fraction of our requirements of that essential foodstuff, wheat&mdash;a fraction that it is almost not worth writing down, it was comparatively so small.  We were sending very considerable sums of money abroad purchasing wheat.  It was not merely wheat.  I will come later to our manufacturing industries, and I will show that even flour was not being milled here.  We said that the land of Ireland should be able to grow wheat. They grow it in Denmark.  We said that the land that is untilled can be used to produce that essential commodity and make it available to our people and give to the farmer a secure market for it&mdash;something that cannot be taken away from him by action from outside&mdash;and give him the value for it in cash, as a cash crop.</P>
    <P>The same was true of sugar.  We were importing considerable quantities of sugar.  We said that a root crop such as beet would be a valuable addition to our general farming economy and, whereas there was only a small portion of our needs grown when we came into office, we set out with the intention of providing the whole of our requirements.</P>
    <P>When people talk of the neglect of <Col N="434" /> the agricultural industry during that period&mdash;as they have talked and as Deputies have suggested during this debate&mdash;I want to give a few figures to show what the policy for which we stand has meant to the farmers during these years.  I have mentioned butter. The value of the control of butter and the subsidisation and help which was given to the dairy industry in that regard during the years 1932 to 1938 has meant £5,000,000 to the farmers. Our policy in regard to wheat has meant that he has a cash crop, the value of which over the years has been over £9.8 millions.  Beet has given him a cash crop of over £6.2 millions during the period.  That, in addition to the reserved market of £6.1 millions, gives some sort of picture of what our policy of general protection, and particularly the protection of the agricultural industry, has meant to the farmer for that time.</P>

It was not due.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, £5,000,000 was a considerable sum to this community.  It represented at the time more than all our fat cattle were worth.  To pay it we would have to hand over all our fat cattle at the time we came into office and much more than the fat cattle to-day will fetch.  Our butter and bacon would be worth only £3,000,000 or £4,000,000, either then or now, and you could produce all your bacon and hand it over, and all your butter with it, and you would not get £5,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We asked the Irish people to stand by their rights and to resist that imposition&mdash;because it was an imposition. They had to resist it for three or four years.  I want you to remember that if that war had not been fought, every single year £5,000,000 would have to be paid, the whole of our fat cattle would <Col N="436" /> have to be handed over in every one of those three or four years and, at the end of it, you would have to continue, this year, next year and for the next 20, 30 or 40 years, to pay £5,000,000 a year.  The capital value of the sums we were paying at the time was estimated at £100,000,000.  About £80,000,000 of it was reckoned as being the present value of the payments in respect of land annuities, and the rest of it consisted of payments on other heads. There was a settlement of two years' purchase of the sum due to be paid. The sum that would have been paid in two years, namely, £10,000,000, was used as the basis of settlement for that sum of £100,000,000 and, henceforth, this nation is free from that sum and the payment of £5,000,000 a year. That is what you have got by the fight: the saving of that £5,000,000 a year for year after year, the preservation, for the benefit of the community, of £5,000,000&mdash;more than all your fat cattle, a great deal more than your butter and your bacon would produce to you every year.</P>
    <P>As we are talking about the farming industry and what has been done for it during our period of office, I want to point out that £2,000,000 of that sum was made available for the farming community.  That sum which was due to the central Exchequer from the farming community, on the head of land annuities, was used for general purposes but £2,000,000 of it was sent back directly and immediately to the farming industry.  If you take the results of the 1933 Act, with the cutting down of annuities to one half, the remission and funding of arrears, the total sum up to date by which the farming community has benefited during that period is £13,250,000.</P>
    <P>Again, it is no harm, when we are talking of our farming economics, to refer to what the community as a whole, through the Exchequer, has been doing as far as the agricultural community is concerned.  It is worth noting that the agricultural grant which, during the eight years before we came into office had totalled <Col N="437" /> only £9,735,000 during the last eight years, has amounted to £15,268,000; that is, there has been a further additional sum of over £5,500,000 given to the farming industry.</P>
    <P>I want, therefore, to repeat these sums in order that those who talk of the injury that they say we have done to the agricultural community may remember them.  On butter they have got £5,000,000; on wheat it has meant a cash price of £9.8 million; on beet, £6.2 million; on annuities, £13.2 million; the agricultural grant has meant £5.5 million; and that, with an additional reserved market of £6.1 million, gives some sort of picture of the other side of the account anyhow. Together with that the community as a whole, of which the farmers are perhaps the principal portion, has been relieved by the settlement which was made at the end of the economic struggle of an annual payment of some £5,000,000 for a considerable number of years.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we came into office at a time when the depression in agriculture was world-wide.  Every agricultural country was practically on the verge of bankruptcy.  We took over the policy of protection and we believe that were it not for that policy of protection the farming industry would have been destroyed during that period. We are now facing a different period. I have always admitted that during that particular period the part of our community which was most in need, which was most deserving of help, and, consequently, did get help, was the farming community.  But we have a new position in which the conditions are going to improve and have improved so far as the farming community is concerned.  We want to take full advantage of any improvement and any opportunities for improvement that present themselves.  We are anxious to see that everything that can be done, consistent with the good of the community as a whole, will be done to help.</P>
    <P>But it was not in agriculture alone that we had this desperate position. Our other industries were being wiped out.  I mentioned the milling industry. <Col N="438" /> I have said that we were not merely not growing our own wheat, but not milling the flour.  We were practically allowing others to do it for us instead of doing it ourselves.  We were milling only a little over half of our requirements in flour.  We set out to protect that industry and to-day the fact is that we are in a position in which we can produce practically the whole of our requirements.</P>

If it is said that our milling is not being done in the best possible way, then it is within our power in this Parliament and in this community to see that the production which is capable of meeting our needs is done in the best interests of the community as a whole.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should wait and allow me to make the points I want to make.  At this time, when it is important that a foodstuff such as flour should be capable of being produced here, we have the producing power, and if our farmers give us the raw material, the wheat, we can produce all we want.  If, as Deputy Dillon or somebody else suggested, the only way in which we can get the thing properly done is by nationalising the industry, and if that can be proved to be the best way, there is nothing to prevent us from nationalising it, if we want to do it.  It is within our control. We would be in a very different position if it were coming in from outside when we might not get any flour:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke about sugar.  Deputy Dillon when speaking said: &ldquo;I will tell you how you can reduce the bill; you can reduce the bill by getting rid of wheat <Col N="439" /> and beet, and probably peat.&rdquo;  There again we have to look at the two sides of the account.  It is true we are producing sugar at a price which is higher than the price at which it could be bought if it could be brought in here at the present time, and considerably higher, no doubt, than the price at which it could be bought when sugar was being dumped on the market from other countries.  At any rate, let us look at the other side of the account. For the year 1938-9, the acreage, I think, was about 48.500.  There were 24,500 farmers sharing in the benefits of that cash crop; there were 2,727 people employed during the season; the amount paid to the growers was £924,000; salaries and wages amounted to £202,000; the transport of beet by the railways and otherwise amounted to £127,000; there was £16,000 spent on Irish coal, £5,000 on lime, and £49,000 on sacks and miscellaneous items. That industry benefits not merely the farmers but the workers; those who are engaged immediately in the factories, those who are engaged in making the sacks, and those who are engaged in transport, etc.  So that you cannot, in talking about an industry of that sort, waive it aside and say: &ldquo;Yes, but look at what the cost is to the Irish consumer more than he would have to pay if we got it in from outside.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then, as I have said, we considered our manufacturing industries.  The most important manufacturing industries were those ancillary to farming; to turn our own raw products into consumable goods for the community. We went on to consider our manufacturing industries, and looked at the import lists, and took the principal items on it, items of apparel for example.  Having dealt with the items like sugar, flour-milling, and others that were immediately ancillary to agriculture, we took those other manufacturing industries which supply our most essential needs and which were the biggest items on the import lists.  We went through them, and the result is apparent.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>What we did was, we went through these items in advance, and the marvellous thing was the accuracy with which we foretold some of the numbers that were going to be taken into employment in some of these industries.  The total increase to-day in industries insured under the National Health Insurance Acts is some 74,000, of whom 48,000 are in the protected industries.  There are about 24,000 employed in new factories. Throughout the country you will find that there were, even at the time of the last election, some 900 new factories&mdash;not to bring in a more up-to-date figure&mdash;and workshops established. There are some 100 new industries and the figures of our industrial output have increased from £18,000,000 to £24,000,000.  These are proof positive that the policy of protection did result in increasing our ability to produce at home the things we need for ourselves.  If we want to compare another policy with the policy we are pursuing, let us see the two sides of the account.  I am not going to pretend for a moment&mdash;it would be ridiculous to do so&mdash;that these things were done without cost. They cost a good deal but, just as in the case of the economic war, we say the result was worth it, because it has saved £5,000,000 a year for the future, £5,000,000 that would have to be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="441" /> I say, taking it as a whole, the cost of protection for our agricultural and manufacturing industries is worth while.  I am not going to pretend that the cost has been negligible or that we got all that for nothing.  We did not. What we have to ask ourselves as a community is: whether the thing we got is worth what we paid for it.  We hold that the cost to the community&mdash; and there has been cost&mdash;to develop our industries in that particular way, has been worth while, and that it has been productive.  We believe that, to the extent that we mean to continue it, and if the Irish people want to change to a policy of free trade or to any other policy, they will have to get people who believe in that to do it. We believe in our policy, and the more we take the country as a whole, the more we look forward to a national policy of trying to be reasonably self-sufficient, because that is the basis and is good national policy.</P>
    <P>The other side of that policy was the social side.  We saw a country that very badly needed houses.  We said that if we left the question alone, without State help and State stimulation of one kind or another, we were not going to have houses built.  We said that after the food that farmers will grow, and clothing that our manufacturing industries will look after, the next thing for human life and human beings was the provision of shelter and proper housing conditions.  We set about dealing with housing conditions. Certainly, we have had to pay for that. But what have we got?  When the question is asked whether what we have got is worth the price paid for it, the answer is that we have close on 100,000 houses now, over 75 per cent. of them new, and the rest have been reconstructed one way or another. These 100,000 houses are well worth the amount we have had to pay for them.  As far as the social side is concerned, we have put a considerable burden on the taxpayer in providing these things, but, as has been stated many a time here, very few people on the Opposition Benches, when there is a project here for improving social services or housing, will stand up and say: &ldquo;No, that is going to cost more <Col N="442" /> than we can pay.  We prefer to keep the money in our pockets and not pay for them.&rdquo;  No, the attitude of the Opposition is always: &ldquo;Give us more and more services and let us cut down the cost.&rdquo;  Certainly, if it could be done, but it is not possible to do it.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to increase services and at the same time cut down costs. That is what the Opposition are looking for.  I admit that there can be waste, and wherever there is evidence of waste, in the sense of bad administration which makes for it, it is certainly the business of the Opposition to point it out, and it is the business of the Government to get after such waste and to eliminate it, if it is possible to do so.  But if you want services in general, you will have to pay for them.  You will have to pay if you want to increase old-age pensions or to bring in new classes.  You will have to pay the amount of the pensions, and you may have to pay the extra administrative cost of the officials that may be required to look after them.  If you want unemployment assistance, the State will have to meet the amount that is given to the individuals, and it will also have to meet the administration cost of inspectors and others necessary in the Departments.  But by all means let us see that every penny spent is spent correctly; is spent economically and spent without waste. If that is the complaint made from the Opposition Benches, I am quite willing to meet them to any extent, and to correct that if it can be corrected.  It is our business to try to see that administration, as such, is carried out as efficiently as it can be carried out, and at the least possible cost.</P>
    <P>You cannot get these things done without cost.  In every individual scheme, apart from the money required immediately, and from the actual sum for those intended to benefit, there will be also additional cost by way of administration. That is inevitable.  When you look at the extra sums that have gone out in taxation, from the time that our predecessors were in office and ask how these sums are made up, it will be found that the greater part is made up, if you take in the administration costs which are essential, <Col N="443" /> of sums that are distributed to those intended to benefit by these schemes, the widows, the unemployed and, in various other ways, such as housing grants plus the administrative costs.  Do you want these schemes or do you not?  Do you want to have housing schemes continued?  If you do, and if you cannot get the cost reduced, the State will have to help to bear the cost.  You will have to choose which you want, whether new houses or savings. It is ridiculous to come along and expect us to carry on services&mdash;very often improved and increased services&mdash;and at the same time to cut down the cost.  That cannot be done. Rather than that we have chosen a way of improving social services, building houses, giving pensions to widows, and unemployment benefit, and so on.</P>
    <P>Talking of unemployment assistance, there is no doubt, I think, that people are benefiting by unemployment assistance whom it was not intended originally to benefit.  If there is a better way, or if anyone can devise a system by which benefit will be given only to those who deserve to be helped, and only to those for whom it was originally intended, well and good, we will be only too happy to examine any suggestions in that direction.  As I said on other occasions, it is going to be an extremely difficult task to separate the sheep from the goats.  Then you will also want to look after those coming in to keep them out of a scheme which was never intended for them.  That is one of the most difficult tasks we are faced with in our general policy of trying to improve the condition of the people as a whole, and particularly, the weaker members.  When I was talking of the policy of the jungle, of unrestrained competition of <i>laissez faire</i> and all the rest, I intended to refer to the fact that in the Constitution, in different directions, as we pointed out, the one aim of the community was to assist the weaker members&mdash;to see that the weak did not go unnecessarily to the wall. Consequently, we have taken over the idea, in a policy based on justice as well as charity, of providing services which would enable the weak to continue to exist.  I think I can leave now <Col N="444" /> what I might call the foundation of this whole debate&mdash;the difference of policy between the Opposition and ourselves. I leave it with a repetition of the contention that, if you want to compare the effect of these two policies, you will have to take the two sides of each account.  You will have to ascertain the advantages and disadvantages, estimate the difference between them and see on which side the balance lies.  You will have to do that with each policy.  Looking at the two sides of the Government accounts, our conclusion is that the policy we have adopted for the past eight years is the best policy for the common good and is in the general national interest.  It was put before the people on several occasions.  The speech I have made here this afternoon, minus the figures necessary to bring it up to date, might have been made at any time since Fianna Fáil was formed, or since this Government came into office.  It was the case put to the people in asking them to choose between the two policies.</P>
    <P>With regard to the present and immediate situation, the fact we have got to face is that there is a world war in progress and that every country in Europe is affected by it.  We are, of necessity, affected by it.  We are doing our utmost to shield our country from its effects.  We are growing things off our own soil and manufacturing things at home and these provide a certain shield by rendering us less dependent on imports.  It is no small matter to know that, if our farmers set to work, they can grow half our wheat requirements next year, that we can mill the wheat in our milling plants and thus have a supply of an essential commodity&mdash;bread. The same is true of another essential commodity&mdash;sugar. These are of no small advantage to us. That was not the main purpose for which our policy was adopted, but it was kept in sight in the adoption of the policy and it is helping now.  Even what has been done is not going to shield this country from the effects of the conflict which is taking place.  We have tried by our policy to shelter our people from immediately engaging in that conflict or being partisans.  We have adopted a policy of neutrality, <Col N="445" /> but even that is a policy for which we have to pay a considerable amount. When we are asked what we have to pay for it, we have to ask ourselves what is the alternative and what the policy that others might have adopted &mdash;the policy of engaging in this war&mdash; would have meant to our country, not merely in the blood of our people but also in the expense which the waging of war would have meant, expense far exceeding anything which the policy of neutrality will involve.</P>
    <P>As I have said, neutrality cannot be secured without cost.  If we are neutral, we are supposed to be in a position to protect our neutrality and to prevent that neutrality, so far as our means will ordinarily allow, from being violated.  How are we to do that?  We have had people objecting to some boats that are being acquired. We have territorial waters.  It is our duty, if we want to maintain our neutrality, to put ourselves, as best we can, in a position in which our territorial waters cannot be used by belligerent craft&mdash;whether surface craft or submarine craft.  We can do that only to a certain extent.  We cannot act as if we were a nation which could afford to spend thousands of millions of pounds on equipment.  To the extent that we are able to protect our neutrality will our neutrality be safe and will inducements be taken away from people who might have a desire, for one reason or another, to violate our neutrality.  We are supposed, as neutrals, to keep our territorial waters clear of belligerent craft.  We are doing that at present, partially, by air patrols.  Over and above those air patrols, we want certain surface craft. These are the boats to which reference was made to-day.  Does anybody here say that the price is too much?</P>

      <P>The Deputy will get the figures ultimately.  It is not going to be a large sum, but it will be a significant figure in our Budget when we remember what a penny in the lb. on sugar produces.  When we estimate the tax that will produce the necessary revenue, it is a fair way of saying what it will cost.  A certain minimum&mdash;we <Col N="446" /> are not going beyond the minimum in any service of that kind&mdash;is adjudged necessary.  We have tried to acquire that minimum equipment as quickly as we could.  It is going to take time to get it, but it is capital expenditure, while another aspect of it is likely to be recurrent expenditure.  Both figures are significant and have to be taken into account when we are considering Budget matters.  The way to judge the matter is to ask ourselves if we want to be in a position in which our neutrality will not be immediately threatened.  I say that it is worth making a certain sacrifice to get ourselves in that position.  Therefore, we want a certain marine service which will involve the spending of a certain sum of money.  If we want to come to a conclusion as to whether we will engage in this expenditure or not, the way to estimate its effects is to ascertain what tax will have to be put on sugar or tobacco, or some other article, in order to raise the required amount and see whether it is worth while paying that tax in order to keep our neutrality safe.  Is it better to do that than to have our neutrality immediately and directly threatened by failing to put ourselves in a position to see that, so far as possible, our territorial waters are not occupied by belligerent craft.</P>
      <P>Now we come to the land forces. When we came into this House as an Opposition, I referred to the Army expenditure.  I think it was then nearly £2,500,000 per year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Very near that.  It was £2,300,000 the year before we came in.  We pointed to that expenditure and suggested that a national defence policy be based on a small standing Army which could be developed in time of crisis or national necessity and on volunteer forces.  We wanted, then, to have a small Army which would be the nucleus of a defence force, with trained officers, so that we could extend the volunteer forces.  We pressed that policy.  Either because the Government itself had come to a similar conclusion or for some other reason, there was a rapid reduction in the Army about the time we came in.  I think it was reduced to a very low point, so <Col N="447" /> far as numbers were concerned, about the year we came into office.</P>
      <P>Now, our Army here has a number of things to do, and in an emergency it will have these things as well as other things to do.  There is a number of important points in which a reasonable garrison must be kept.  You can divide the needs of the Army into two classes: first of all, those who are required for defending fixed positions&mdash;that is, fixed troops&mdash;and then, if these fixed troops are held, in an emergency, to their positions, you want, in addition to them, a mobile force, and a mobile force of such a size as to be reasonably effective.  These were the considerations which led the General Staff and the Minister for Defence to consider the present organisation of the Army in its present numbers, and we considered what would be the war strength that it would be reasonable to have and what would be the peace strength corresponding to such a war strength, or to whatever war expansion might occur in a case where we would be actually engaged as belligerents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Taking these considerations into account, we arrived at certain figures. At the moment, perhaps, it is better not to go into details with regard to these figures, but at any rate they were got as notional figures upon which establishment figures were built up, and figures on which, similarly, war establishments and peace establishments were arrived at.  Now there is a situation midway between the peace establishment and the conditions of actual open warfare where we would be actually engaged as a belligerent.  I think there is nobody who will deny for a moment that in the present conditions the war is being waged around our coast.  The principal war is being waged around our coast at the present time.  It is not on the land in Europe that the war is being waged,&mdash;at the moment at any rate&mdash;it is being waged on the sea, and it is being waged around us, therefore.  In a time like that, is there anybody who will say that our peace establishments, cut <Col N="448" /> down to the bone as they were, would be sufficient?  We did not think so, anyhow, and we believed that the bringing back of our reservists for a period of training, and getting our volunteer forces actually with the colours and giving them a period of training over and above the period they had got, was a wise measure both from the point of view of having with the colours a reasonable defence force, and also from the point of view of improving the efficiency of the Army during that time.</P>
    <P>Now, we do not want to spend a penny more on the Army, police, or any other service, than the Opposition do, but we have the responsibility of seeing, to the best of our ability, that the country is safeguarded, and in going into the problems that we have got to face we have come to the conclusion that what we are doing at the moment, such as having the reservists who have been trained brought up to the Curragh&mdash;some of them have been sent back&mdash;and having certain Volunteers brought up, is the minimum which it would be in the national interests should be maintained.  Very well, then; we have to pay for that.  What are we paying for?  We are paying for security.  It is not perfect security. We cannot guarantee absolute security. No small country in Europe can do it. At present, Switzerland has its whole army mobilised.  Some time ago we saw figures which suggested that the Swiss were paying over £250,000 a day in maintaining their army mobilised. Now, I am sure that at the present time there are certain people in Switzerland, and perhaps outside, just as we have certain people here, who say that that is not necessary, and who say: &ldquo;Nobody is going to attack us; our neutrality was recognised.&rdquo;  A number of the arguments such as we have here are also being used in Switzerland, but the Swiss Government has had to stand fast and say: &ldquo;Although this is costing us the comparatively huge sum of £250,000 a day, and although, apart from that, there is huge economic loss to the community as a result of having these people taken out of production and placed in the army, nevertheless we are paying <Col N="449" /> that sum and facing these economic losses because we want to remain what we are, and that is an independent State, and we do not want to be swallowed up by one or other of the contending parties, nor do we want our territory to become a cockpit for the contending parties.&rdquo;  The same applies to Denmark, Holland, and other small countries.  The same applies to Sweden and Norway.  You may tell me that Sweden and Norway, perhaps, are in a different position, or rather that Denmark, Holland and Switzerland are in a very different position from ours, and that they are in far greater danger than we are.  You might have said some time ago, perhaps&mdash;although, just now, you might not say it with equal certainty&mdash;that they were equally free from threat of attack; but look at the expense which these countries have to bear.  Some of these countries are much smaller in size than our country, although the populations of most of them are greater.</P>
    <P>Still, some of them are smaller countries than ours, and yet look at what they are spending on their protective forces.  I think I have some figures here which will give you an idea of what they are spending in comparison with us.  In Switzerland, in peace time&mdash;not at all in the position in which they have this huge army mobilised which, as I have said, is costing over £250,000 a day, but in peace time&mdash;they spend ordinarily on their army about 22.7 per cent. of their revenues.  In Holland they spend some 15 per cent.; in Denmark 12 per cent.; in Norway 7 per cent. I have not the figures for Sweden at the moment, but here with us we were spending 5.1 per cent.  You see, accordingly, that we are at the bottom of that list.</P>
    <P>You may say that we are safer than all these countries.  That may or may not be; perhaps we are and perhaps we are not, but at any rate, nobody can say that we are spending extravagantly on our defence forces here.  The point is this: Is the freedom that was got worth defending and maintaining?  Is it worth trying to have, at any rate, a reasonable addition&mdash;because we are not doing anything that is unreasonable&mdash;to <Col N="450" /> our protective forces?  We who have the responsibility, anyhow, say that it is, and we say that we are anxious that not one penny more be spent on our protective forces than is necessary.  As we can see more and more what way this fight is going to develop, and as we look at the situation and see if opportunities are given and if conditions appear favourable for reduction, we are naturally anxious to reduce any cost that there may be, but so long as this condition of affairs continues, I think it would be wild and mad&mdash;it would be stupid&mdash;not to face the additional expenditure which, compared with that which other countries have to face, is relatively very small.  I said that we, at any rate, are prepared to face that additional expenditure, and that we must face it; not that we desire it, but because the nation's needs and necessities and the protection of our people and of their rights demand that it should be faced.</P>
    <P>The police were mentioned and the expenditure on the police force.  I have explained on two or three occasions in this House the position in regard to the police.  In the Budget Estimate there was provision, I think, for 400 or 500 additional, and ultimately we cut that down to a point at which those who were responsible&mdash;from the police point of view&mdash;held that they had too few.  They have actually too few police at this moment to do the work that falls to them to do.  Do not forget that we have used the police force not merely for ordinary police duties but as officers in connection with a number of our schemes.  There are places in the country where one might say that there is no reason for having any Guards, but it will be found that in those particular areas they are doing definite work.  The instructions given, and the attitude taken up by the Minister in charge, have been to try to reduce the cost to a minimum and to see that Guards are not maintained in any place where they are not required.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another point.  If everybody were absolutely honest and only took that which the Legislature intended him to take, if nobody took advantage of an Act which was not intended for him and if nobody was inclined <Col N="451" /> to deceive, if we had perfection in our community, we would not need the number of officers that we have to send out at present&mdash;investigation officers and a whole lot of others which have been mentioned.  But that is not so, and, therefore, we have to have these men, not merely to administer protection but to see that very many of the usual provisions of the Acts are not evaded.  If every citizen was prepared to obey the law, and in dealing with his neighbour to avail of the courts in order to settle disputes&mdash;if we were able to do that and if we had a perfect community&mdash; we could undoubtedly do with far less Guards for police duties; but we want these men for dealing with census returns and various other matters in districts where otherwise they would not be required.</P>
    <P>Again, surely the Government does not want&mdash;and nobody can suggest that the Government does want&mdash;to increase unduly the force of Guards?  Surely nobody can suggest that it does not want to cut down expenditure?  It would be a much more pleasant task for the Minister for Finance to come along here with a reduction in taxation than to come along and suffer the odium not merely of the House but of the country for increasing taxation.  It is obvious that the attitude of mind of the Government must be to try to cut down expenditure and see that there is no waste.  That is pretty obvious. Whether they are successful or whether other people might not be more successful is open to question, but that attitude of mind is obvious.</P>
    <P>We have examined the police question with the Commissioner and we have come to the conclusion that we cannot&mdash;at the moment, anyhow&mdash;reduce the police force beyond what it is at present or make less provision than we have made.  It must not be forgotten that this City of Dublin has grown tremendously in the last eight or ten years and that the growth of a city like this means a considerable addition to police work.  That position has got to be met.  There is extra <Col N="452" /> traffic on the streets and, therefore, extra work in dealing with such traffic. One can, therefore, see the need for the police and for the provisions that we have been making.  A number of the increases have been due to the usual increments, through men who came in as young men getting their usual increments as was decided upon. That goes on year after year and will, without any increase in personnel, naturally increase for a considerable period, until there are compensatory adjustments of various kinds.</P>
    <P>I want the House to remember&mdash;in talking about the size of the police force&mdash;that they are more than a police force, they are agents for the Government Departments in a number of other services.  They have work to do, and in addition one has got to remember that this capital city in particular has increased in size and that the traffic has increased also, and that this has added to the duties required of the Guards to perform.</P>
    <P>Another point of criticism has been air raid precautions.  There has probably been more misunderstanding and more criticism about this than about any other activity in connection with the present emergency.  I think I explained in this House before the war the main purpose and main object of these air raid precautions.  First of all, in order that our neutrality here might not be made use of by either of the belligerents as a means of attacking the other, we wanted that the lights from our city should not be a guide to aero-planes which might attack others or attack ourselves if such were in their minds.  We wanted, to start with, to shut out what is known as the &ldquo;skyglare&rdquo;. The lights of a great city can reveal the existence of that city to an aeroplane 15,000 feet or so from the ground, at a considerable distance away.  We wanted, therefore, to ensure that, by the cowling of our lights, we should shut out any glare which might be reflected into the sky.</P>
    <P>We knew that that amount of covering or cowling of lights would have to be done.  It is pretty well done at the moment, but until that was done there was danger&mdash;particularly in the first <Col N="453" /> weeks of the war, when nobody knew what form aerial warfare might take&mdash; and it was necessary in the earlier stages to have the only substitute possible, that is, a diminution of the amount of light.  We have, then, this diminution of our light from our principal cities, particularly those near the coast which might be a guide to enemy aircraft enabling one belligerent to attack another.  We wanted to get that sky glare diminished by cowling, and considerable progress has been made.  As the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures has already explained to the House, the moment that is done we can have very much more lighting than we have had up to the present.</P>
    <P>The next thing we wanted in regard to public lighting was to be able to shut it off into complete darkness at very short notice.  In order to do that we had to have certain switches which were not in the existing system.  Those had to be got and put in, so that if there was actually an attack upon ourselves and it was necessary to have a complete black-out we could have it. There used to be in the old lesson books a phrase to the effect that the boar does not put off sharpening his tusks until the enemy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an important lesson for us, that provsion for protection must be made well in advance.  We must remember that the world will not end when this war is over.  There may be other wars and nobody is going to think for one moment that wars in the future will not develop aerial combat, aerial warfare and bombardments from the air&mdash; unless we get sense at last, and I think we are very far off from getting that kind of sense.  I think we will have to recognise that attacks from the air will be a likely feature of any future war.  What is being done now will be a protection for this community, not merely against the present war but against the future.  If at any time such circumstances unhappily arise as make <Col N="454" /> it necessary for us to take protection against aerial attack, we will have, not merely for this war, but afterwards, the power of shutting off at very short notice&mdash;at a signal&mdash;our public lights. That means, as far as public lighting is concerned, cowling and the ability to shut the lights off at short notice.</P>
      <P>Another thing which we specially wish to provide for is in regard to private lighting.  Obviously, the thing to be aimed at was the ability to shut off the lighting quickly and that, first of all, there should not be any lights except one or two in the front of the house, that all the windows might be so capable of being covered by curtains or blinds that when lights are lighted they will not be visible outside.  Once that is done, we are in a position in which, when an order goes forth to the people: &ldquo;During this period, you must not have light visible,&rdquo; it can be done.  But, again, that takes time, and remember that the people on the Continent have been making preparations and taking these measures so as to enable them to meet an urgency such as this, or the greater emergency of an actual attack, for years back. We have had to begin to take them now.  Some people say that there is no likelihood of air attack upon us. Again, I say that nobody can tell what will be the future development of this war.  It is our business, when we have the opportunity of doing it, to take the protective measures which other countries have had to take, with due regard, of course, to our means, and providing in the first instance against the more imminent and likely dangers and leaving to a later period protection against the dangers that are less likely, but possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These protective measures have meant a certain amount of expenditure over and above the items which come into our usual Budget, but there is one thing I should like to say with regard to this Supplementary Budget.  Many Deputies have talked about increases in taxation.  Increases are necessary where there is extra expenditure, undoubtedly, but remember that the greater part of the speech of the Minister, and of the Budget figures, had reference rather to a decrease in the <Col N="455" /> amount coming in.  I think £1,600,000 odd was the amount estimated we were going to receive less from certain taxes and duties than we had estimated for.  Why was that the case? Because war conditions prevented goods from coming in.  Clothing apparel, petrol, motor parts and so on were not coming in to the extent which they came in before and, therefore, the customs duties on these were not gathered.  In other words, the citizens were not paying these taxes, so that so far as that deficiency is concerned the new taxation is not additional taxation, but substitute taxation.  I am quite willing to admit straight off that we would very much have preferred to get that money in the ways designed in the last Budget than to get it by substitute taxation, but it is substitute taxation, and do not forget it.  What we have not got out of the left-hand pocket we have had to get out of the right-hand pocket, but except that the incidence is different and that it is not quite the same class of the community which pays it, the new taxes do not represent extra taxation.  They represent substitute taxation&mdash;admittedly, a substitute which we reluctantly had to face&mdash; instead of the taxes that were designed originally.</P>
    <P>I think I have said most of the things I wanted to say.  I repeat that we cannot take these things apart from the general policy of which they are a part.  We cannot take the disadvantages without considering the advantages, and we cannot compare two policies unless we compare them as a whole.  With regard to the emergency, I repeat that the measures which we are taking are the minimum which we think will carry us safely through this period.  Those who want us not to face that expenditure are inviting us to take risks, so far as the country is concerned, which we, as a Government, do not think it is in the national interest to take.  Some people can gamble if they want to, but there is a limit to the extent to which it is right, in the public interest, to take risks of the kind.  These are insurance, and we have to regard them as insurance <Col N="456" /> costs, and I believe generally that these costs are justified.  I therefore naturally support the Minister in the Bill he has put before the House.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on sugar, tobacco, beer and spirits.  That is the proposal before the House.  We consider it a very serious blunder, and what we are discussing here to-day is, not the past blunders of the Taoiseach, his Ministers or his Party, but the blunder of to-day.  On Friday there was a Government attempt to black-out this discussion.  Now, the Taoiseach has come in to-day to try to smoke us out.  I thought at first that he had made a mistake in the speech he brought in.  I thought it was a speech rather like that which one would get at the opening of a general election.  I felt rather convinced of that until he got further on in his speech, and I am assured by him now that it was done deliberately.  I want to say that we ought to deal with what is in front of us, and what is in front of us is that the Minister for Finance proposes that the consumers of sugar shall be asked to pay £243,000; of tobacco £277,000; of beer, £50,000; of spirits, £20,000, and that estates duty shall be asked to pay £13,000.  On the general Budget resolution, I appealed to the Minister and to the members of the Government not to insist on dragging across this discussion the various things they did succeed in dragging across.  I said that to discuss these would be unhelpful and irrelevant, and I understand from remarks made by the Minister for Finance that my appeal made an impression on him. I am sorry it did not make an impression on the Taoiseach, because the Minister for Finance, in introducing the Second Reading, instead of following the line of thought which I was on, simply reiterated that they were going to be down £1,620,000 in their expected revenue, that they were spending a <Col N="457" /> considerable amount on the Army and that they were approaching a situation in which they were going to economise to the extent of £400,000, going to tax to the extent of £603,000, and going to borrow the rest.  I suggest to the Minister that the very thing which he expressed himself as being afraid of is the very thing that is happening as a result of the imposing of this £603,000 additional taxation.  When we discussed the proposed Army expenditure, both on the Estimates and during the Budget discussion at the beginning of the year, the House was asked to vote £3,250,000 for the Army, and it was indicated that £1,388,000 of that was going to be borrowed.  The House was also informed that an additional £4,250,000 was going to be spent during the financial year ending March, 1941, on Army buildings and equipment. What has happened is that the Army has been mobilised, and, principally because the Army has been mobilised, additional expenditure is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the expenditure on the equipment of the Army can be borrowed, why could not the additional £603,000 be borrowed and why should this supplementary Budget be presented at this stage?  What is the effect of it? The effect of it is to bring about the exact situation which the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce have expressed themselves as really fearing at the moment.  Rising costs as the result of the war situation reacting on this country and rising wages following that, are going to bring about a spiral tendency in these things one after another.  That is going to have an inflationary effect and is going to damage this country economically. There is no use in the Government saying that they are afraid of invasion at the present time.  There is no use in their saying that they are terribly excited about the equipment of the Army at present.  There seems to be no attempt to get the equipment that was ordered at the beginning of the year. No attention at all seems to be paid to the real danger.  I submit the real danger to this country and the challenge to its security at present will <Col N="458" /> come from rising costs followed by rising wages, followed by still more rising costs and by a general disturbance and disintegration of the economic and even of the political life of the country.  Government action, which results in driving up costs and which in consequence leads to demands for increased wages has a far more serious effect on the economic position of the country than any effects resulting from the war outside.  What is the reason why this £603,000 cannot be put into the borrowing pool at present, so that we could carry on with the existing taxation until March or April of next year?  Then we could have a clear view both of the position as regards industry in this country and the effect of the war on prices here and also in so far as it might impinge on the necessity for a real defence here.  These matters would be shown in a much clearer perspective in another four months time.</P>
    <P>Just as we have been plunged into expense on an unnecessary black-out and on the erection of air raid shelters in Merrion Square and other places, here we are being plunged into a much more serious expense.  In spite of all that is said in the Constitution about a desire to see that the weak do not go to the wall, we are taking from people who are the weakest in this country at the present time, people who must suffer the first shock of the rise in the cost-of-living.  We are saddling them with increased expenses without regard to the ordinary expenditure which they have to incur on the necessaries of life and the amount of money they have at their disposal.</P>
    <P>We are not told of any increased expenditure on unemployment benefit or on relief works.  We do not hear of any increased expenditure to get our building machinery going again, although it is a definitely accepted fact that there has been increased unemployment here, and that there will be increased unemployment as a result of the war situation.  Despite the panegyric of the Taoiseach about present conditions in this country, there were more persons registered as unemployed for every month of this year than there were for every month of last year or <Col N="459" /> the year before.  Apart from the war situation, the number of registered unemployed was increasing here, while in walks of life, in which unemployment is not disclosed by registration, there has also been an increase in unemployment.  We see no reference to the fact that any part of the increased expenditure provided for in this Bill will be devoted to relieving that unemployment.  Yet it is down on these poor people who are unemployed that the taxation proposed in the present Bill is being imposed.</P>
    <P>It cannot be denied that the position in regard to revenue is somewhat obscure. I have no doubt that the tendency of the revenue had been carefully watched.  We have the position in regard to customs that, at the time the Budget proposals were put before the House, it was estimated that in the 12 months ended the 31st March next, an increase of £179,000 was expected in customs duty.  What is the position in regard to the existing revenue from customs duty?  In the first eight months of the year, £850,000 more had been received in customs duty than was received last year.  There is a very big margin there.  On the income-tax side the situation is different.  An extra 1/- was imposed at the beginning of the year on income-tax, and that was expected to bring in in 12 months an increase of £374,000.  We advised the Minister at that time that it was very likely that he would not get the revenue from income-tax which he expected as a result of the increase.  We do not know how things may stand at the end of the year, but up to the present time, that is, for the first eight months of the year, the revenue from income-tax instead of being up, as against the first eight months of last year, is down.  It is down by £243,000. That shows that you do not always get your expected revenue by increasing taxes.  The fact that you impose these taxes on sugar and tobacco does not necessarily mean that you are going to get all the increased revenue which you expect.  In a situation where prices are naturally tending to rise because of outside influences, by Government action prices are being still further increased for every home in the country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="460" /> These increases in prices are being most appreciably felt in the homes of people who can least afford to bear them.  I ask why on earth, with the danger that is confronting the Minister, which confronts him so much that he has made special reference to it in his remarks on this Budget, could we not wait to borrow this £600,000 just as you are borrowing the other £1,300,000 and as you are promising to borrow another £4,500,000 in order to equip the Army?  Why could not the £600,000 be borrowed?  Why could we not go through to the end of the year until we knew the full impact of the war on conditions here, undisturbed by Government action with regard to taxation so that we could get a clear view of how outside events, and outside events alone, were going to affect the position of rising prices here.  We could have an impression of how we were going to have increased production, if there was going to be an offset in taxation, as well as of what was going to provide an increased margin for taking additional taxation, if additional taxation was necessary.</P>
    <P>I think that the Government's action in introducing this Supplementary Budget imposing taxation of this particular kind, at this particular moment, is as disastrous a blunder as ever the Party opposite was guilty of.  Because of the tendency to increase prices, a tendency which has been definitely stirred up by the Government, we will find ourselves at the normal Budgetary period in the position in which we cannot view the effects of this war on the country undisturbed, due to internal messing such as this.  I do not see that any action by the Minister now could redress the mistake that has been made, but yet, I think, it would be well worth while, as a gesture, to withdraw these proposals for taxation.  It would be well worth while to say that you were going to leave taxation here undisturbed. I think that a gesture of that kind might do something to throw back rising costs.  It might do something to show that the Government were really serious in doing their part to prevent costs rising unnecessarily here.  Not only, in my opinion, has their action disturbed the situation at the present <Col N="461" /> time, but by March or April next it is going to put us in the position in which we will not be able truly to assess the situation in this country.  I would like to stick simply to that challenge: that the Government are simply messing the situation here by blind, hasty, ill-thought out action.  There is no declaration of policy of any kind enshrined in either the Budget statement or the Finance Bill.  If there is a scrap of policy in it, then I say it is such that it has not given any real consideration to the effects behind it.</P>
    <P>I hesitate to leave unanswered some of the things that the Taoiseach dragged across the situation here this evening.  His speech was utterly irrelevant and certainly unhelpful to a discussion of the serious matters that affect us in this country.  All his talk about the Army, liberty and security was all nonsense and futility.  The only way in which we can secure our country and our liberty is by dealing with our business here in a proper way, and by discussing things with the facts clearly known.  I say that the Taoiseach's intervention this evening was for the purpose, deliberately, of smoke-screening this discussion.  He described the economic policy of this Party here as the policy of the jungle.  I will not say any more on that except to make the comment that he so described it. I want to say that in the conditions brought on this country by the war, and in the conditions here at the present time, we are considering these matters in circumstances in which certain tendencies have been showing themselves over the country in the last three or four years.  What are these tendencies?  The Taoiseach spoke about the valuable things that the policy pursued by the Fianna Fáil Party over the last seven or eight years have brought on the country.  Since 1935, in spite of all that was done for agriculture, 36,309 fewer men have been employed in Irish fields at agricultural work.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am giving the Minister for Industry and Commerce the statistical figures that tell us, year by year, what the tendency is of certain things that bear on the economic condition of this country.  In case the Minister is not fully assured of the tendency, I will tell him that the number of men employed in agriculture in June, 1934, was 579,409.  In the year 1935 the figure was 573,531.  In June, 1938&mdash;the 1939 figures are not yet available&mdash;the number was reduced to 537,222, so that, taking the figures from 1935 alone, 36,309 men have faded off agricultural work on the land.  In the same period, but up to June, 1939, the population had declined by 37,000.  In the same period there had been 41,000 emigrants.  In the same period the total amount of tilled land had gone down by 101,000 acres.  The striking fact of all that is, that if the Minister will refer to the estimate of the crops for this year he will see that in 1939 there were 78,400 less acres under the plough than in the previous year: that there were less cattle, less pigs and less sheep.  The one increase we had in agriculture was an 0.2 per cent. in poultry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are considering, and dealing with, an economic and social situation arising in this country with these facts before us: falling employment on the land, emigration, a falling population and rising taxation.  Every year since the Party opposite got into power taxation has been rising.  During the current year, if the Budgetary situation had stood and if the Estimate had not gone up, we would still be spending £10,000,000 more than when the Fianna Fáil Party came in as a Government, half of that being taken as tax revenue, £2,000,000 of it as revenue, and the rest, I suppose, borrowed money.  With that situation <Col N="463" /> of increased expenditure here we have had more unemployed in every month this year than last year.  Now, when we are driven into a war situation, taxation is being imposed here for a comparatively petty amount that hits the people who are already being bent more and more under the present situation by unemployment&mdash;I might mention the unemployment from which they were already suffering and the unemployment that is coming to them as a result of the war.  I think it would be very difficult to characterise the magnitude of that blunder.  We are paying very dearly for it by economic unrest.</P>
    <P>There is not a single part of the country from which letters do not come giving most harrowing pictures of the position of decent unfortunate people who are trying to live their lives, and who are simply harried out of existence by their inability to support their families.  It is in a situation like that that this disastrous blunder of the Minister for Finance comes on the country.  It is very difficult to characterise it in anything like reasonable terms.  We hoped and had been hoping that the men who shouldered the responsibility for ministerial office at the present time would have made a thoughtful review of the situation and would set the position before every class and before every Party in the country, and that thus it would be possible without misunderstanding and without irritation that every class and Party in the country would assist one and the other to get through whatever difficulties exist. But so far as there are difficulties to-day these difficulties are magnified and increased&mdash;if the greater part of them are not created&mdash;by Government action and want of consideration.</P>
    <P>I think the contribution by the Taoiseach to-day was a disgraceful contribution coming from a man who holds and shoulders the responsibilities that he does.  Such a man should be very careful and thoughful about the present situation.  I confess I did hope for better things.  I did hope when the Minister for Finance spoke the other <Col N="464" /> day that we should get some kind of reasonable exposition of the position; that we would get some hope of understanding here, that the House would be treated as a House of intelligent representatives, representatives of every class and constituency in the country, who come here fairly well-informed as to the conditions around them and fairly responsible as to the duties that devolve on them to assist in improving the situation in the country. But nothing that has come from any of the speakers on the Government side during the debate on this Budget and Finance Bill, has shown that it is the kind of contribution that would be of help in a discussion of the kind we have here.  I do not know whether it leaves this discussion entirely hopeless so far as the House and the country are concerned.</P>
    <P>I ask the members, when replying, to state exactly what the necessity was for creating a situation with regard to the rising prices and costs in order to get this small bit of money, especially when one takes into consideration the amount of money they are planning to borrow, and particularly when it is for the Army and for Army equipment that they are borrowing.  In that connection, I would like Ministers to consider this: are they going to spend on the Army the money that they plan to raise next year through borrowing?  I hope that they will then have a clearer conception as to what are the military dangers that confront this country, and a clearer idea as to what will be the military machine they want organised to avoid these dangers.  There is not a single one of the Ministers who have spoken who is not at sixes and sevens with the others with regard to what the dangers are, and with regard to what particular type of machine we should have here to combat and resist these dangers.  It is, as I say, disastrous both to the political and social situation in this country that this thoughtless Budget is introduced, and this taxation sought to be imposed in the manner in which that is being done. We had hoped that there would be some clearer view of the situation.  By the time they come to the financial end of the year we hope the Government <Col N="465" /> will be able to present a saner idea of the position, and that they will have shown that they have given more thought to the consideration of the future than one would expect, judging from their present proposals.  We do hope that they will have given saner thought to these things than they have done up to the present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy has expressed surprise at the speech delivered here by the Taoiseach on the Budget this afternoon.  There is not in the speech of the Taoiseach, where he expressed again, for perhaps the hundredth time, the policy of the Government, one item which, if we take the ordinary rules of debate, could be regarded as out of order.  I think the Chair would have reminded the Taoiseach as the Chair reminds every Deputy who strays beyond the limits of order, that he had been out of order. There was not one item in the Taoiseach's speech that was not raised over and over again by the members of the Opposition in the debate on the question of the Budget.  I think it is true to say that there was hardly one member of the Opposition who spoke who did not raise this question of Government policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every member of the Opposition criticised the Budget because practically every one of the Opposition spoke of this extra taxation as being imposed on certain items, as if this extra money was required for the Army.  They scoffed at the idea that we should spend any extra money on our Defence force; they scoffed at the idea that anything extra was necessary to be spent in this time of emergency. Deputy Mulcahy expressed the same idea here this afternoon.  I think with his knowledge and experience he should be the last to develop that line of discussion.  The Army is needed here in normal times for normal Defence purposes.  If that be so and if we have to spend £1,500,000 to £2,000,000 on the Army during normal times, does it not stand to reason that in times of emergency, when as has been said here by several speakers on this side of the <Col N="466" /> House and again expressed by the Taoiseach this afternoon, we are in the very centre of a war area, in a very delicate international position, more money is now necessary?  Does it not stand to reason that in such circumstances we have to take every precaution and we have to spend the additional money necessary to make certain that that delicate international position of our neutrality is not to be impinged upon to our detriment by any of the belligerents?</P>
    <P>I was surprised to hear Deputy Mulcahy&mdash;a man who lectures so often here on economic and financial matters that one gets the idea that he believes he knows a good deal about finance, and perhaps he does&mdash;suggesting that the right thing to have done was to have borrowed for the additional expenses that are required due to the emergency, and particularly for Army expenditure.  I should like to hear what the Deputy and his colleagues would have had to say if we had proposed borrowing all that money.  Whatever Deputy Mulcahy's indignation was this afternoon at the idea that we should ask the Dáil here to impose additional taxation under certain heads to make up the loss that we estimated we were going to sustain in our revenue, his indignation would have been tenfold if we had dared to suggest to the House that we should go on to the end of the financial year with the full knowledge of the fact&mdash;taking the best advice we could get from experienced men&mdash;that we were going to be short in our revenue, to the extent of £1,600,000 odd, from the taxation imposed in the Budget of May of this year.  That was the figure given by the experts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Then why did you not tax for the whole of it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard a good deal from Deputy Mulcahy about the taxes we have put on.  His wrath and his indignation have been boiling over because we have suggested&mdash;and the Dáil has agreed to some extent already&mdash;that that taxation is necessary. They have agreed to allow us to <Col N="467" /> put on that taxation, and the Deputy wants to know now why we did not put on double that, or more.  I think the Deputy knows&mdash;certainly his chief beside him, who was Minister for Finance, knows, as does every member of the Government, and above all, the person who has to bear the brunt of the brickbats during the debates&mdash; that it is no pleasant task to come in and face this House with a Budget such as I presented here on the 8th November.  It was not for fun that that was done.  It was not done, as was suggested by Deputy Mulcahy, because due consideration had not been given to the matter by the Government. The matter was thought out and debated by the Government over a sufficiently long time to arrive at the full extent to which our financial and economic position was going to be affected through conditions arising out of the war emergency, so far as the best of our judgment and advice could go.  That showed us that our revenue was going to fall very considerably. The taxation that we have put on has been described by somebody here&mdash;and I think I agree with him&mdash;as a blister which the country has been asked to bear.  That is true, but if in our view that extra sum of money&mdash;the sum of money that we budgeted for here in May last to carry us over the financial year ending on 31st March next&mdash;was necessary for all the services of the State, then it is necessary in the Government's opinion that that money be provided.  It is to provide that money that we have asked this Dáil to put on the taxation that we asked it to impose, in order to give us as much as we thought we could get in this period to tide over the difficult interval between 8th November and 31st March next.  Deputy Mulcahy asked for a declaration of policy.  He saw no declaration of policy in the Budget, or in the speeches made introducing the Budget or supporting it. There is one thing that is clear, and certainly more clear because of the adverse criticism to which we have been subjected arising out of the Supplementary Budget.  It is a Budget and a policy of financial honesty and straightforwardness.  That is one for Deputy Cosgrave.</P>

If we had adopted the other policy suggested by Deputy Mulcahy this evening, we would have cloaked it and waited until 31st March to see how the cat would jump, as he told us.  We would have said nothing; we would have hidden the fact that we were not going to get what we had expected to get in the way of revenue.  We would have cloaked it up and gone to the country without telling the people how we were circumstanced. That is the Opposition policy, as against the policy of coming to the House and putting the facts before it, saying what our position was, and how much money we wanted in order to go as near as we could to balancing the Budget.  I believe we will have it balanced when it comes to be summed up at the end of the financial year.</P>

Some of the people who have these savings that the Deputy would take and give no return for&mdash;if I understand him correctly&mdash;are poor widows.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy talked about the borrowing of this money.  It has been indicated already that we had arranged to borrow a considerable sum for defence purposes. That we intend to do in order to enable us to carry out our policy, realising that all of the expenditure arising out of the emergency need not necessarily be met out of this year's or <Col N="472" /> next year's receipts.  It will be postponed for some time, anyhow, and those who come after us will have to bear their share of it.  But we have to decide what proportion of these extra expenses may be borrowed and, believe it or not, we do take time to consider and are conscientious and scrupulous in deciding what proportion of that increased expenditure could be put by to be borne year after year in the years to come.  We realise that the expenditure is heavy and that it cannot all be borne, and need not all be borne, this year.  We have to use our judgment and experience to decide how much of it we can afford to treat as a capital sum that can be borrowed.  We have set aside a considerable sum for defence purposes and equipment.  That will be paid for out of borrowings in years to come; but there is a considerable amount that we have to bear year after year, and this year and next year this amount will be much heavier.</P>
      <P>It certainly is a revelation to me that Deputy Mulcahy, speaking as a responsible, serious leader of the Opposition, would suggest that we should not have informed the House of the position; that we should not have said anything about it and that we should go on until the 31st March next, when we could see how the situation would develop.  What is our position?  We were advised by those whose duty it is to advise us, what our financial situation was arising out of the emergency, and we were told that we would not get the moneys for which we budgeted.  The Deputy suggests that we should have kept that fact hidden from the public and from the Dáil and that we should go on as if nothing had happened and as if we were getting the money in in the ordinary course.  That is not a policy that this Government would stand for.</P>

We decided that the full facts should be put before the Dáil and all the figures given.  We had to make up our minds what we would have to ask in the way of, as the Taoiseach called it, substitute taxation, which would have to be imposed by the House to make up what we were losing, the revenue we were losing as a result of the emergency.</P>

Again I will say, speaking for myself, that it is not with enthusiasm that I come to the Dáil as Minister for Finance and ask the House to agree that this extra taxation on <Col N="474" /> sugar, beer, spirits and tobacco be imposed.  I know as well as Deputy Mulcahy what difficulties extra taxation of that kind is going to impose on every class of the community, particularly the effect of certain items of it on poor people.  I am not saying I have any better knowledge than he.  I am not saying I have any more sympathy with the poor than he, but I know it as well as he does or any other man in this House.  It is not for fun it is done.  Deputy Mulcahy need not come in here preaching sermons to me on how the poor have suffered.  He need not preach in this House.  I think there is not a Deputy in the House, whatever Party he belongs to, that does not feel that it is a hard thing to have to put taxation of that kind, say, on sugar.</P>

But the money has to be got, and taxation has to be put on to get it. Nobody suggested how that sum of money could be got other than by taxation. Many members of the Opposition, Deputy Cosgrave leading off and others following, said that we could go through the first 20 items in the book of Estimates and save money.

      <P>Let us take that one item.  When I went in as Minister for Local Government, in 1932, I was asked by the Government to produce a Housing Bill, which I did, and which the Government and the House adopted.  In order to implement that Housing Bill and to get housing going, we had to increase the housing section in the Department of Local Government enormously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>To the extent of £1,000 a week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Enormously.  I was astonished myself at the number of additional clerks that had to be employed&mdash;astonished&mdash;and I went into it very closely.  At one time, some years ago, when I got complaints from the country about delays in paying housing grants, I got the secretary and the head of the housing section to come down to the office to me, and I examined the matter closely.  I asked why there <Col N="476" /> was necessity for two weeks' delay in acknowledging a letter, and I asked how many letters they received in a day.  I cannot pin myself down to the accuracy of the figure now, but it was in the region of 3,000 a day at that time into that one section alone.  I had to agree that the staff had to be increased substantially.  That is one item alone where I was conscientiously satisfied that there had to be a large increase in staff and, naturally, they had to be paid.  That is reflected in the increase in numbers and in the increase in cost.</P>
      <P>What is true of that section of local government is equally true of another section, the section that dealt with public health services, waterworks and sewerage.  There never was in any one year in the history of this country half as much or quarter as much work done in the way of waterworks and sewerage improvements, and new schemes, as was done every year I was in Local Government. There was done every year five or six times the amount that was done in the year before.  You cannot do all that without staff.  These are items I know of.  I can give the House my word of honour that there was reason for the increase there in the staff and in the salaries.  I think every Deputy in the House will have to agree that there was good work done in housing and public health services, and I do not think any Deputy, honestly answering, could deny there was good work done. You have to pay for it.  I do not object to paying staff and paying good wages, but I want to see results.  Certainly in that respect, whatever increase in staff there was, we got good value for it, in my opinion.</P>

      <P>No.  They were held up for examination as to what our condition was.  We had to get a clear picture of how much we would have to spend.  They were held up for some time.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cosgrave suggested that we could save in regard to officials.  A certain number of the civil servants in the various Departments retire annually, no doubt, not a very considerable number, but the salaries and wages of those who remain in the Service go up every year, and even if you had not one extra person in the Department of Local Government in the eight years from 1931, the cost would have gone up.  Deputy Cosgrave gave the figure for 1931, but had not one individual been added the cost would have gone up&mdash;I do not know to what extent but probably 20 or 25 per cent. on the salaries and wages alone.  That accounts for a certain amount, so that you could not say the figure Deputy Cosgrave gave&mdash;roughly, £1,000,000 might be saved on these estimates. Nothing like it.</P>
      <P>For our deficiency in revenue alone we want £1,600,000 odd.  I know what this additional tax on the people means.  I know that people resent it; even people who can afford to pay resent it.  I do not meet many of these people but I meet some of them occasionally, and whenever I do, and since this Budget came in, I find that the wealthier they are the rougher they are in their attacks on me about the additional taxation.  Deputy Mulcahy said that letters come from people from every part of the country, from people who are harried out of their lives because of the extra taxation that this Government has put upon the country since it came into office; that year after year, the extra taxation has mounted.  There is only one way of testing that and testing the feeling of the people in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Goodness knows we have had quite a sufficiency of general elections since 1932.  Is not that true?  We have gone to the country over and over again, more often, I think, than normally <Col N="478" /> would be necessary, and every time the Opposition have had their chance to put their case about this extra taxation, broken promises, and all that kind of thing.  They did not miss an opportunity of rubbing it in.  They rubbed it in here, and they rubbed it in all over the country, to the best of their ability, and the best of their ability has not availed them much, because we have improved our position every time, and at the last election more than ever.  The country knows the facts as well as any Deputy here.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon went over the same ground as Deputy Cosgrave about the book of Estimates and about setting out the essential and the unessential items.  I think any non-Party committee of this House that might sit down and go through that book and analyse it, would find it very difficult to get any concensus of opinion as to what items, let us say, of the extra expenditure imposed by Fianna Fáil ought to be struck out, because, though some people do not like us to mention it, and say that there is no use in dragging in the social services because nobody wants to cut them down, the greater part of the <Col N="479" /> extra expenditure that has been imposed on the country by this Government arises out of the social services. Nobody wants to cut them down.</P>
      <P>All of us, even including the Opposition, would, if the country could afford it, like to see many of them increased and improved.  Is not that the position? Certainly nobody wants to cut down the social services introduced by this Government or by the last Government, whatever they are.  If there is anything more that can be done for the poorer elements in the community, everyone here in every Party would like to see that done, but we have to cut our coat according to our cloth.  While everybody clamours for increased expenditure on social services and services of that kind, nobody likes footing the bill.  When the bill is presented, people want to know why we cannot cut down this, that, and the other.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon has been dealt with pretty fully by the Taoiseach in his speech this afternoon.  He clamoured for the abolition of the wheat, beet, peat, and industrial alcohol schemes. If the Government would get rid of these experiments and get rid of Fianna Fáil policy then, he said: &ldquo;We are prepared to co-operate with them&rdquo;.  That was Deputy Dillon's speech: &ldquo;Get rid of Fianna Fáil policy and then we will co-operate; take a middle ground.&rdquo;  We are here as a Government because we advocated a certain policy and stuck to it and carried it through, and if we desert that policy we ought not to be here; some other people ought to be in our places.  The policy we have been put into office to carry out we have steadfastly carried out and we intend to carry it out until the country decides otherwise.  The country will in due time get its opportunity to decide between our policy and any other policy that may be put to the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon and other Deputies also referred to the question of deflation&mdash;the high costs now and the deflation period that would follow after the war comes to an end.  It was the experience of the last war, having lived through that and seen what happened during the war and after the war, that induced me to say what I did say as a <Col N="480" /> warning in introducing the Budget&mdash; that the Government would have to try to set its face against these large increases and the vicious circle, or, as others call it, the spiral, the upward tendency, that is bound to follow.  Certain increases in prices cannot be stopped.  No Government can control all the prices or control completely increase in prices; but it can discourage increases, and the Government intends to do that wherever possible, so that we can, as far as possible, avoid that spiral increase in costs, salaries, wages and profits, that we saw go up to such alarming heights during the last war and then come down in such a hurry, with disastrous results to so many people when the period of deflation arrived after the war.</P>

      <P>What I said in my statement referred to all classes of the community, so far as the effort we intend to make to try to prevent that vicious circle or spiral arising this time goes.  In the course of my remarks I referred to the workers, and those in the public services.  These are the people over whom we have direct control, and who we may expect to show a good example to the rest of the country.  I stated the last time I spoke here, and I repeat now that it was with no intention at all of making an attack on organised workers, that the thought of setting our faces against these increases was mentioned by me in the course of my speech introducing the Budget; that our intention was that all classes of the community should be treated alike, as far as the Government <Col N="481" /> can make that possible, but that we were anxious that no class of the community should be penalised for the benefit of any one particular class.  In that connection Deputy Norton asked me if the Government intended as a deliberate policy to prevent workers looking for increased wages in face of the rise in prices.  We cannot, as Deputy Norton said, prevent the workers looking for increased wages in face of rising prices.  Nobody can do that.</P>
      <P>Our idea was to try, as far as we could, to prevent prices rising; at any rate, to prevent what happened the last time happening to anything like the same extent as then.  If the cost of living does go up workers and others are bound to seek a rise in wages and in salaries, and I am sure others in profits.  That will happen.  But we have to try to see to it, as far as the Government can do so, that an undue rise in the cost of living should not come about, in so far as we can do anything to stop it, that therefore, there will not be the same case for the big rises that took place during the last war owing to the enormous increase in the cost of living, and that the same conditions will not exist this time that then caused a rise of wages, of salaries and of profits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Norton also asked if the Government intended to honour the agreement with the Civil Service, on the cost-of-living bonus.  On that matter, I should like to say that, in its efforts to reduce expenditure, the Government had to examine various matters to secure economies, some of which would affect several classes of public servants in their remuneration. The peculiar position of civil servants, whose remuneration is affected by the cost-of-living figure, naturally arose in the course of its examination by the Government.  Stabilisation of the bonus is only one of many possible economies that have to be considered.  It would be premature for me, at this stage, when no decision has been taken, to single out this particular item for special notice or comment.  I can assure Deputy Norton that when further consideration has clarified the general position, in so far as the Civil Service <Col N="482" /> may be affected, consultation with the service will take place before proceeding.</P>
    <P>Besides the Army, one other item in the Budget came in for special notice, and that was the tax on sugar.  Everybody spoke on that, everybody in the Opposition in particular, and stressed the difficulties that would arise out of it, particularly with regard to the poor.  Deputy MacEoin harrowed us with an account of how the death rate would go up as a result of the failure of the people to get sugar.  We have the experience of the last war, when sugar went up, at least to 1/2 per lb., and even then was very difficult to get in some places, but I do not think the medical reports from any part of the country would show that it was due to the want of sugar alone that there was any rise in the death rate.  It is a necessary article of food, and it is unfortunate if it has to be taxed, but it was a tax that, if the poor had to bear their share of the burden, was a ready one, and, comparable with previous times, one that could reasonably bear a share of the taxation that had to be put on every class in the community.</P>
    <P>But, of all who spoke against the sugar tax and criticised it, there was not one who would make a definite suggestion as to what other item we could tax.  I heard this afternoon the only speech in which a suggestion was made for a substitute for sugar, and that was by Deputy Michael Óg MacPháidín, who spoke in Irish.  He suggested that instead of taxing sugar we should put a tax on picture-houses.  Even if we did the Deputy must know very little about the additional revenue that could be derived from picture-houses.  In the first place, picture-houses are very heavily taxed at present.  I was not long Minister for Finance until I got from the organised trade a protest because of the very heavy imposts on picture-houses.  I am not much of a picture fan, but if there was a chance of getting money out of them, I certainly would put it up to them, if I thought it would help us over the difficulty. But it would not be a fleabite or anything like what we require.</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin said that the sugar <Col N="483" /> tax was bad, that the tobacco tax was worse, and the spirits tax worst of all. Neither the Deputy nor anyone else suggested where the money was to be got.  It is agreed that the money is necessary.  I do not think anyone who examines the situation from an impartial point of view will deny that the money we are asking for is the least that is absolutely required.</P>
    <P>On Friday last Deputy Linehan criticised adversely the tax on sugar, rubbed it in again about the poor, and said that we were letting off the rich. The Deputy called attention to the fact that estate duty was being increased by 10 per cent., <i>mar eadh.</i>  He said that by the 10 per cent. put on estate duty the Minister was trying to put his finger in the eyes of the public, and pretending to tax the rich.  He went on: &ldquo;We know that will mean nothing. What is he going to get out of that? That is simply to blindfold the public, while he is rubbing it in very hard on the poor.&rdquo;  Deputy Linehan ought to know better.  He is, I hope, a man with a large practice, and if he is a successful lawyer, must deal with estates from time to time.  Evidently he does not and has not any realisation of the money we get out of duties on estates. They gave us in the last seven years an average of £841,000 a year.  Estates exceeding £10,000 gave us an average of 76.4 of the total revenue out of Estate Duty.  Is not that something worth getting?  That is not to be scoffed at.</P>

      <P>The man who scoffs does not know what he is talking about.  He ought to inquire further before he gets up and makes a speech on such a subject.  A professional man who, I hope, has a large practice and deals with Estate Duty ought to inquire further before he makes scathing remarks of that kind on Estate Duty and similar matters and shows his ignorance.  I was disappointed to hear Deputy McGovern who, I am sorry, is <Col N="484" /> not here at present, making what I thought was a very unjust attack on civil servants.  That is not done in this House.  Very few members have done it.  They usually know better.  Any man who goes into any Department of Government, no matter what Department will, from the official he sees, receive courteous, generous and kind treatment.  He will go to extremes to help him.  Before I became a Minister, I was in only two Departments.  I happened to represent a constituency which gave me very little trouble.  I was in the Old Age Pensions Department and in the Land Commission.</P>

I will take all I get and give back as much as I can, but the civil servants should be left out of it.  They do their job well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fagan said that we had reduced everybody in the country to a low state.  A few years ago, he said, everybody had enough to spend.  I wish I had met him a few years ago.  If he bad so much, I might have relieved him of portion of it.  I never knew the time when I had enough to spend.  I could always find good use for any money I ever had and I think that that is true of the country as a whole.  Let Deputies look around and apply the test of the cinema or any other test they like. The amount spent on cinemas and on amusements of one kind or another is very considerable now if we compare it <Col N="485" /> with what was spent ten years ago.  If Deputies consider the attendance of people from the country at the big matches at Croke Park or the attendance at the Rugby matches at Lansdowne Road or at the Soccer matches there is no doubt that more money is being spent in this way than was spent ten or 15 years ago&mdash;a good deal more. That money has to be got somewhere. If that be any indication, there is no diminution in the means of the people. They are as well off to-day as they were at the time referred to&mdash;and better off.  There is certainly more money going into their pockets in wages because there are more people at work in every part of the country.</P>

      <P>That is as good an indication as any other&mdash;the amount of money spent on amusement and the number insured under the National Health Insurance Act.  The revenue of Cumann Naisiúnta ar Shláinte has increased and the numbers have very considerably increased.  That is a sure indication that more money is going into the workers' pockets and that more money is being spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not true, as Deputy Brennan said in opening his remarks this afternoon, that the Minister took the easy <Col N="486" /> road by bringing in a Supplementary Budget.  It would be much easier to do what Deputy Mulcahy suggested&mdash;slide over the period and say nothing to anybody, then present a picture that would frighten a lot of people.  That would not be an honest or a straight picture. He suggested that we should go ahead and spend, not knowing where the money was to come from.  When we had a deficit&mdash;we say it would be £1,600,000&mdash;at the end of the year, then we were to borrow.  That is not a policy that would keep the credit of this State as high as it has been kept by his Government and our own up to the present.  We should not be fit to be here if we adopted that policy.  If we did not come to the Dáil, tell the Dáil straight and honestly how the emergency has affected us and was likely to affect us, what steps we intended to take, and if we did not ask the Dáil to help us in meeting the financial situation with which we are faced, we should not be worthy to be where we are.  If we adopted any other course the credit of this country would not be as high as it is and the loan we are looking for this year and the loans we shall be looking for later would suffer.  The credit of this country has remained unimpaired.  We are still a creditor country and, from that narrow financial point of view, well off.  We intend to keep that credit position safe as long as we are the Government.  We shall borrow for those things for which we ought to borrow and for which we can borrow with a good conscience.  As for the day-to-day expenditure, we shall come to the House and straightforwardly and honestly tell it what the position is and take the consequences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That the Dáil disapproves of the action of the Government in making an Order under Section 36 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, declaring scheduled offences for the purpose of creating jurisdiction in the Special Criminal Court established under Part 5 of the said Act to deal with matters arising or alleged to arise from recent action of the farming community, and calls on the Government to revoke such Orders and to establish independent arbitration or conciliation machinery with a view to adjusting in a manner just and equitable to the interests of the farmers, the consumers and the taxpayers the matters giving rise to such action.</P>
      <P>In proposing this motion standing in the names of Deputies O'Donovan, Jeremiah Ryan and myself, I am aware of the fact that I am moving a motion of a very delicate type in a particularly grave situation, and that, in moving this motion and discussing it, there is at least the possibility that a particularly bad situation might be worsened.  I am conscious of the fact that when there is a struggle on, any exhibition of partisan feeling one way or the other is only possibly having the effect of provoking the opposite side to greater depths of determination and of, perhaps, considerably worsening the position.  This motion asks for two things, and two things only.  It is divisible into two sections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I am interpreting the feelings of the House fairly when I say that every single Deputy here and every Party here deplores the unfortunate situation that has arisen, where the most important section of the producers of this country have been driven to withhold their produce. As a result of that situation existing for a week or ten days, as far as the man in the street or the Deputy in the Dáil is concerned, the only answer of the Government and the only effort of the Government in that deplorable state of affairs, to ease the <Col N="490" /> situation and bring about a termination of that appalling position, is to brand those people as criminals and bring them before the Military Tribunal. I, for one, regard that action as a recklessly provocative action that can have no other result than to turn a strike that is a strike for economic reasons into quite possibly a strike of desperation.  There is nothing that I can picture more dangerous and more damaging than a widespread strike when it becomes a strike of desperation.</P>
    <P>That particular half of the motion, asking the Government to try these people, if they commit offences, through the ordinary laws of this land, will find a re-echo in the heart and mind of every single Deputy.  These people are as democratic as any one of us here; they are our own brothers, our own fathers, our own cousins; they have the same State responsibility, the same civic outlook, as any one of us.  Some may hold that they are misguided in their efforts; some may hold that they are unjustified in their efforts; but none will agree that these men should be branded as armed conspirators or as traitors to the State.  Has the machinery of the law broken down? Have these men entered into a desperate and dangerous conspiracy of a desperate and armed kind?  Is there any evidence at the disposal of the Government that these people have organised themselves to intimidate jurors at the point of the gun?</P>
    <P>Every one of us remembers the case that was made for such awful powers as are in that section of the Offences Against the State Act.  It was to meet insurrection and armed rebellion.  Are these unfortunate poor farmers, who interfere with somebody sending cows to the market, criminals, outlaws, or armed conspirators?  At the time the Government was asking the Dáil for such powers, we had all kinds of cooing from the Government Benches, we had all kinds of soft speeches, we had all kinds of reassuring statements that such powers would not be used except in the very last ditch.  Yet, in the first week of an agricultural strike, we have an order made that these people will be brought before a military tribunal. I do not know which Minister was responsible for the order, or which Ministers <Col N="491" /> were responsible for the advice, but I do know this: that the most reckless thing that was done by any party associated with this trouble&mdash;and many reckless things of a minor kind were done&mdash;the most deliberately provocative and reckless action was the invocation of these special powers against the farming community of this country. That is one portion of the motion: asking the Minister to withdraw that Order, in the despairing hope that even at this stage there may be talks in a committee room.</P>
    <P>Definitely and well the Minister knows that there can never be talks in any room, if people have to walk into that room, or crawl into that room on their knees, under the shadow of a baton.  That Order definitely postpones the day when talks begin, and the trouble cannot begin to end until conversations commence.</P>
    <P>The second part of the motion asks the Government to establish some arbitration tribunal, or some machinery directed towards conciliation, so as to bring about, or to expedite, the termination of this dispute.  Let this dispute carry on for days, or for weeks, until one side are battered to their knees.  Let us assume that the Government, armed with all the powers of a State at war, beat the farmers to their knees and that the losses under which the farmers are suffering at the moment continue day after day for another three weeks, is there any Deputy, sitting behind or opposite a Government, who is going to regard that as a victory?  Is there any Deputy with any sense of responsibility who is not going to regard that as a definitely damaging situation for the State? Is there any Deputy, with a responsibility towards either revenue or local rates, who is going to think that anything is achieved by bankrupting completely a certain large number of farmers in every county?  On the other hand, if the other side succeed in completely withholding supplies, and if the public, the poor, the sick and the children of the city, are completely deprived of food, is there any farmer throughout the length and breadth of <Col N="492" /> the land who is going to regard that as a victory?</P>
    <P>Is it not one of those situations when every one of us must refrain from taking sides, when every one of us must refrain from doing harm by discussing the merits of the dispute and when every one of us must try to do good by merely realising there is a dispute on, that the situation is involved and that the quicker a really deplorable situation is ended the better.  Every one of us has been on one side or another in disputes in our time; every one of us has been associated with strikes and tussles of one kind or another; and if the big stick is waved against us, does not the backbone of every one of us stiffen, no matter how hopeless the outlook?  The use of this particular big stick at this particularly early stage can only have the result of stiffening the back of the other side, and of provoking, in the direction of recklessness, an organisation that might have been held behind sensible and firm leadership. If any one of us is branded with a label which we do not deserve, and remember that there is the same blood in the veins of every one of us, we will very quickly live up to the label.  Irish history should have taught each one of us something.  There was no organisation ever outlawed or branded too early that did not live up to the brand and if these people are to be brought like criminals before a military tribunal, just as if they had intimidated juries, just as if they had challenged the services of the State, you are provoking the younger and wilder elements amongst them to live up to the label you are giving them.  But is there any Minister, or any Deputy speaking from the Government side, who is going to argue that anything helpful can be achieved by such tactics, who is going to argue that you are bringing nearer to an end the present unfortunate situation?</P>
    <P>You may say that the demands are unreasonable, but nothing is being demanded that was not backed by the most influential leaders of the Government Front Bench at a time when it suited themselves.  I will keep off that <Col N="493" /> line because I do not want, at this juncture, either to start or to participate in a debate that will go into the particular merits of one side or the other.  I put down this motion merely with the idea of suggesting that all Parties in the House deplore the situation which exists at the moment, that they can see nothing but harm and damage for every day this state of affairs lasts, that the longer it lasts the worse for all, and the fewer provocative speeches and provocative actions by one side or another, the quicker the whole thing will be brought to an end. There have got to be conversations and there have got to be meetings between the Government, on the one hand, and the farmers, on the other.  The use of the censorship, the suppression of news and views, is driving people to ferocity in certain counties.  The first weapon used against them was the weapon of censorship; the second was the weapon of military courts; and the third was the Government right to seize goods at any price fixed.  If even at this stage, even within the next 24 hours, these special powers could be held in abeyance, and the Minister would say, without prejudice to anybody's claims or anybody's stance, that he was prepared to open conversations with a view to ending the deadlock and to let everybody meet, not as bosses on one side and escaped criminals on the other, but as leaders of one and the other side, with a sense of responsibility, I believe the termination would be very speedy and the result very satisfactory to all.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am proposing that the Dáil ask the Government to revoke the Order containing the special powers which they are using against the farming community at the moment, giving them the right to bring these people before the criminal courts, and, secondly, to establish some form or any form of arbitration and conciliation. When they have reopened conversations and have got people together, one side to advance their claim and the other side to reply to that claim, if the Dáil is satisfied that moderation, patience, toleration and justice have been shown by one side and that recklessness, irresponsibility and lack of <Col N="494" /> reason have been shown by the other, then it will be time enough to use all these extraordinary powers that are being used at the moment.</P>

      <P>I beg to second the motion.  Whilst I live a long distance from the scene of this strike in the Dublin area, I believe that the milk producers in that area have a grievance. I must protest also against the inaction of the Minister for Agriculture and the Government in this crisis, and a crisis it is.  According to the figures which I have before me, the producer gets 1/4 per gallon, and I understand there is a penny deducted from that for collection, leaving the net price 1/3. The distributor, on the other hand, gets 2/4 per gallon.  If those who have to be out in the early hours of the morning, in all sorts of weather, have to deliver their milk in Dublin to the distributors at 1/4 a gallon, whilst the distributor who is sheltered away from wind and weather is allowed a profit of 1/- per gallon, I am wondering which of them owns the cows or is entitled to a price for the milk.  The distributors in any case have the lion's share.  If the producers have a case, as I think they have, it is the Minister's duty to intervene at once to tackle the problem, and not to allow the dislocation of services to continue any longer.  The producers may have demanded more than they are really entitled to.  I am not in a position to judge of that.  I live too far away from the scene of the strife, and I am not competent to judge.  If they have demanded too much, again the Minister should have intervened and, as we all do when we have anything to buy ourselves at a fair or market, try to arrive at a fair price.  Bargaining would settle the whole thing, and this crisis would have been avoided.  It is certainly unfair to all parties to the dispute, to allow it to continue any longer.  If it is allowed to develop, I think the responsibility for far more serious results which may follow will fall on the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion is a very simple one.  It first suggests that those who have been arrested be brought before the ordinary courts.  These men are not criminals. I think the farmer in this country is the most law-abiding citizen <Col N="495" /> in the State.  He always has been and always will be.  I hope the Government are not going to repeat what they did not so very long ago in the case of law-abiding, decent, respectable, hardworking farmers.  If these farmers have committed an offence, the ordinary courts of the State should be sufficient to bring them to book.  If you are going to brand them as criminals, the reactions will fall on the Government, the people responsible for bringing them before these special courts.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why the second portion of the motion, suggesting the establishment of an arbitration board, should not be acceded to.  I do not see any reason why it should not be established within 24 hours.  Strikes, no matter how long they may go on, are usually settled by arbitration.  All strikes are bad, and I doubt if any party who ever went into a strike gained anything as a result of it.  There is too much lost on both sides.  I cannot see why the Minister could not select an arbitration board from amongst the members of the Agricultural Council he has set up.  I know that I myself could pick three men from amongst them who could settle this dispute within 24 hours.  In that way, we would get rid of all the difficulties and troubles that are facing us. There is no question but that the Minister has power to set up this arbitration board.  We suggest that that should be done, and done immediately to settle this strike.  That, I think, would be a much more satisfactory solution than to be requisitioning milk from creamery societies 200 or 230 miles away from Dublin.</P>
    <P>As regards the requisitioning of milk, whilst I, as a member of a co-operative society, from the humanitarian point of view, would not like to see the citizens of Dublin deprived of milk, I do not think it fair that the Minister should requisition milk from the back end of West Cork.  I believe the quantity of milk requisitioned from West Cork is about 1,200 gallons for every working day of the creamery.  That is requisitioned under a threat, a dire threat, that if they refuse to supply the milk <Col N="496" /> for the first day, they will be fined £100, and for every subsequent day's refusal, £10.  They are also threatened with a withdrawal of all subsidies to the creameries, and finally they are threatened that if they still persist in their refusal, they will be brought before the special courts I protest against that.  I think it unfair to our people in West Cork, who are hardworking, industrious, law-abiding people, who have put their money into the creameries, and the majority of whom, although small suppliers, are big feeders&mdash;feeders of pigs, principally young pigs, who want every pint of separated milk they can get from the creameries.  In fact, every pint of milk is worth gold to them at the moment, owing to the scarcity of other feeding-stuffs. I think it unfair that they should be compelled to send milk to Dublin, whilst the Milk in the border counties, to which the Minister gave a monopoly of the Dublin trade, is going waste.  I suppose it is going down with the flood.</P>
    <P>I think it would be a good thing if the Minister, if he is so fond of requisitioning things, requisitioned the Volunteer force in the Curragh and formed them into a mobile squad, to go out and milk all the cows in the area of supply around Dublin, instead of sending down to West Cork for supplies. He would be much wiser and better employed in doing so than in sending down to the poor unfortunate farmers of West Cork for milk they want so badly at home.  The societies which have supplied milk under these threats have an interest in their own special work.  They built up these creameries and made a success of them.  Of course, the Minister can exercise any power he wants, but I do not know why he should threaten to withhold their subsidies and fine them if they do not supply milk, when there are other avenues to be explored, and other ways of getting milk.  The simplest and easiest way, the way that any people with commonsense would adopt, would be to set up an arbitration board as suggested in the motion, and get it to function immediately.  Three or four men of commonsense would settle the strike within 24 hours, and all our troubles would then be over.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="497" /> The Government, with their idea of coercion&mdash;they are full of it&mdash; threats, and all the rest of it, do not want to adopt the commonsense method.  I want to refer to the reason given as to why the farmers should not strike, and the Minister's speech in Rathdrum on Sunday last.  The Minister quoted the increased prices which farmers are getting as compared with what they were receiving in September last.  I have here the increases that he quoted.  I admit that there was a substantial rise in cattle prices in the month of September, but that rise did not continue. Speaking from my own experience at fairs in West Cork, I can say that September was a good month for cattle, but in October and November prices were down and trade was dragging, so that it was almost impossible for people to sell cattle in these months.  It is not necessary for me to go into the increases that the Minister quoted.  He said that these increases would counterbalance any increase in the price of feeding stuffs. I have my doubts about that.  I know that on the 1st September I could buy maize or meal in West Cork at about 9/- per half-sack of ten stone.  To-day the price is 15/-.  The same thing has happened with regard to the milk producers here.  I am certain that, whatever price they were paying for feeding stuffs in September last, that price has since increased as much as, or perhaps more than, the price that I have quoted for meal in West Cork has.  I think that the milk producers had a just cause and a reasonable cause for strike: in looking for, demanding and asking a living wage.</P>
    <P>The way out of that situation is for the Minister to do what is suggested in this motion.  Farmers want a living wage as well as anybody else.  In my opinion, the milk producer here is justified in demanding an increased price for his milk in view of the price that he has to pay for feeding stuffs and for cattle.  That is a point that I want to stress.  He has to pay £25, £26, £27 or £30 for a springer.  I live in West Cork and I am sending my milk to the creamery, milk which is now coming up to Dublin, but I could not afford to pay anything like that <Col N="498" /> price for a springer.  If, therefore, the milk producers here have to pay that price for springers as well as increased prices for feeding stuffs, they are entitled to an increase in the price paid for their product.  The sooner the Minister sets up an arbitration board, as has been suggested, and settles the strike, the better it will be for all concerned.</P>
    <P>I attended a meeting of my creamery committee in West Cork last night. The members of that committee are very anxious to help to see that there will be no continuance of this strike. I was asked specially by my committee to meet the Minister and discuss the situation with him, as we have it in West Cork.  I hope he will give me an opportunity to do that either to-night or early to-morrow.  We are anxious to look after, as far as possible, the interests of our own people.  Our hope is that this motion will be accepted by the Government, and that there will be no further requisitioning of milk from our creamery.  I hope the Minister will withdraw the Order that has been made against the hardworking, industrious farmers in the counties adjoining Dublin, that he will accept the motion that has been brought before the House, and thereby save further trouble, confusion and annoyance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>This Order was made because the Government was satisfied that the ordinary courts were not suitable to deal with the situation that exists.  Everybody who reads the newspapers must admit that a serious state of disturbance was occurring in the neighbourhood of Dublin, and that it was extending through the country.  If it was only a question of farmers advising their neighbours not to bring their stuff to the markets or fairs, no action would have been taken, but it is quite clear to everybody that that is not what was done.  Advice may have been given in the first instance.  If the advice was not taken, threats were used, and then we had acts of violence which were growing at such a rate that, if allowed to continue, we would have had a situation that I do not like to contemplate. Now, there is no intention, and never was any intention, of taking any <Col N="499" /> action against hard-working, industrious farmers.  All that we are doing here is scheduling offences that already exist, and thereby making them triable by a special court.  We are making no new crime.  Surely, if farmers want to bring their produce, whether it be milk or farm produce, to Dublin, they should be allowed to do so without having that produce stopped on the road, as has happened.  Cases have happened, everybody knows of them, where farmers have been held up&mdash;farmers who wanted to come to Dublin or to other markets with their produce.  The produce was scattered around the road. We had cases where milk was spilled, and of potatoes and cabbage being scattered on the road.  Pigs were taken out of lorries and driven away.  If things like that were allowed to continue we know what the result would be.  You will have people who will resent it.  Blows will be struck and shots may be fired.  We know already that firearms have been used, but luckily no one was shot.  We are all glad that no one has been injured. That is a situation in which a very serious state of affairs could rapidly develop if not dealt with promptly.  I have a list of those outrages here.  I would like to know how any Deputy could expect the ordinary courts to deal with these cases, especially as the number of them is multiplying so rapidly.  As regards the machinery of the courts breaking down&mdash;Deputy O'Higgins mentioned this&mdash;I want the House to know that this has happened; that in some cases P.C.s have refused to act.</P>

      <P>What the speakers on the other side have been referring to is the milk strike, but one other thing has not been mentioned by any of the speakers.  They are ignoring the fact that there is another organisation working side by side with the milk strikers, and this organisation is insisting on having demands conceded now which were before the country at the last two general elections and which were turned down by the country.  These demands have been debated in this House time and again. This organisation has said that they will allow no fairs to be held and no produce to reach Dublin City until their demands are granted.  These are: <Col N="501" /> first, a moratorium; secondly, fixity of tenure; and thirdly, derating.  The small farmers in the country, the labourers and the general dwellers in our towns are going to be forced by strike action to pay the rates for the big farmers.  That is what that amounts to.  Now, that demand was decided both in this House and in the country.  Having been beaten in a constitutional way, they are now seeking to gain their ends by force.  No Government could stand for that. That side of the question has been kept in the background by the two speakers who have given their views to the House.  Well, I hope that is because they do not stand for such things.  I really hope it is.  Now, as for the milk strike I know that Dr. Ryan, the Minister for Agriculture, and the Department of Agriculture are anxious to effect a settlement.  I believe the machinery is there for settling it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Government is going to do and what the Government is determined to do is, not to allow these matters to be forced on the people.  These questions were before the country at two General Elections, and they were decided upon.  The Government is determined that they are not going to allow them to be settled by force.  That is really what it amounts to.  I do not want to prejudice the case against any of the farmers.  I wish to say that if these violent acts cease, and if there is no more spilling of milk and no more holds-up of farm produce, then there will be no necessity to bring these people before the tribunal.  But if what has been going on since this strike started were allowed to continue this country would not be fit to live in. The Government will not tolerate it. We are not going to allow any body of men to prevent the people of the country doing what they have a legal right to do.  It is the duty of the Government to assert the rights of the people; to see that the citizen can go about his ordinary avocation, and that <Col N="502" /> he can attend at any fair or market he wishes without being interfered with. It is on that we are insisting&mdash;that the people will have that right.  It is because we feel that the ordinary courts would not be able to deal with a situation like that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

On the 19th November, a lorry containing 60 gallons of milk was held up in Naas district, and the milk spilled on the roadway by men who arrived in eight motor cars.  These are &ldquo;the poor farmers&rdquo;. On the 20th November, a lorry, containing 35 gallons of milk, was held up in Naas district.  It was held up with the aid of a motor car drawn across the roadway.  This would remind one of the things that happened 20 years ago. On 24th November, a motor van laden with eggs, value £16, was held up in Naas district and the eggs destroyed.</P>

The owner of the hay had sent cattle to the Dublin market the previous day, and the burning of the hay is believed to have been a reprisal.  On 24th November, in Naas district, a farmer slaughtered a <Col N="504" /> beast value £18.  The carcase of the beast was strewn with Jeyes fluid in its purity.  It was the farmer's purpose to have the carcase consigned to Dublin.  On 23rd November a lorry containing rabbits for Dublin was stopped by a picket.  The driver drove through, and his wind-screen was smashed by the stroke of a stick.  In Louth-Meath area, on the 20th November, near Drogheda, 42 gallons of milk were spilled in a dairy yard.  The culprits took away the milk cans.  On 22nd November a farmer's wife was working in her yard when a number of men approached.  She seized a shotgun and fired a shot over their heads. They then scattered and fled.  Next day a number of shots were fired at the dwelling-house of this woman.  Examination revealed that a window was broken in the kitchen, apparently by a bullet.  The local police found three 45 revolver bullet cases in the vicinity. Most of the hard-working farmers I know have not got so many motor cars. This is the type of thing with which we are dealing.</P>

When passing a picket of farmers, sticks and stones were thrown at the lorry which was in the convoy.  The windscreen was broken and the owner suffered some injury to his head.</P>

    <P>In the Drogheda district on 20th November 28 gallons of milk were <Col N="505" /> spilled in a farmyard.  On the 19th November telephone wires were cut in the Navan district.  On 20th November, in the Navan district, a party of men called to a house, and while some argued with the owner the others forced the dairy and spilled 35 gallons of milk.  In the Navan area on 22nd November the Gárdaí were escorting a milk lorry, which had been turned back by a picket, when about 50 men rushed the lorry, knocked the Gárdaí to the ground and spilled four cans of milk. On 22nd November a lorry containing 26 pigs for Dublin was stopped on the road.  The pigs were taken out and driven into a field.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin-Wicklow area: on 19th November, in the Howth area, eight men arrived at a dairy yard in a motor-car and spilled 21 gallons of milk.  On 23rd November, in the Howth area, a motor-car containing 28 gallons of milk was held up, and the milk was spilled on the road.  On 21st November a party of men entered a dairy yard and spilled 80 gallons of milk.  The milk was locked in the dairy, the door of which was forced open by the culprits. On 21st November telephone wires were cut in the Howth area.  On 23rd November, two churns containing 50 gallons of milk were spilled by four unknown men, who arrived in the dairy yard by motor-car.  On 24th November, in the Dundrum area, 12 gallons of milk were spilled in a dairy yard. On 24th November, in Dundrum area, a horse-drawn vehicle containing 24 gallons of milk were stopped by men who arrived in four motor-cars.  The milk was spilled on the roadway.  On 21st November, in the Howth area, 40 gallons of milk were spilled in a farmer's yard, the entrance lock of which was forced.  On 21st November, also in the Howth area, 24 gallons of milk were spilled in a farmyard.  On 21st November, in the Balbriggan area, a lorry laden with vegetables for the Dublin market was stored in a shed, and during the night the vegetables were strewn about the yard.  On 21st November, in the Howth area, a lorry load of potatoes was held up by a party of men, who opened the sacks, about 80 in all, and scattered the potatoes on the road.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Agriculture will deal with the merits of the dispute, if that is relevant, but I take it that the principal idea behind this motion is an objection to having a special court trying those cases.  From the way in which this thing has been developing, everyone can see the danger there is of very serious disturbance, and perhaps loss of life.  Although Deputy McGilligan thinks the resignation of two P.C.'s. is nothing, still it is an indication of the position.  In the circumstances, the Government had no alternative.  This has nothing to do with the merits of the milk strike.  I do not see what conferences could be held in connection with <Col N="507" /> matters which have been decided at two general elections, if not three, and which have been decided in this House several times, that is the question of a moratorium and security of tenure. Security of tenure is there.  Those are things which were decided several times in the House, as well as at the general elections, and there is no question of any conference on matters of that kind.  On the question of the milk strike, I am quite sure that the Minister for Agriculture is quite willing at any time to discuss it.</P>

      <P>As one of the persons whose names are to this motion, I should like to say that I think there is nothing to apologise for in putting down the motion, but I think the Minister for Justice might apologise to this House for the litany of trivial offences which he has read out.  It would appear to anybody that the Civic Guards do not exist at all in this country.  The Minister talks about threats, and about danger to the State, but he has never questioned the Minister for Agriculture about his threats.  In the very early stages, before the country knew one word about this thing taking place, the Minister for Agriculture, through his inspectors, made threats of every kind to the creameries&mdash;any kind of threat that would induce them to send milk to Dublin.  This was before things took a serious turn.  Since then, the Minister has sent down a notice to the creameries&mdash;I was one of the people in this House who wanted him to discriminate&mdash;threatening them with withdrawal of certain subsidies if they refused to send milk to Dublin.  He never thought for a moment about discriminating; he <Col N="508" /> just took them haphazard.  From what I can learn in the country the impression was that the Minister made every effort to get one group of farmers at the others' throats to try and break the strike.  I think that was a terrible thing for any Minister or any Government to do, especially in view of the situation we are in.</P>
      <P>This Emergency Powers Act was passed in this House.  No matter what we thought, we all agreed to that Act.  If I had thought that this Emergency Powers Act was to be used in this way, I for one would never have voted for it, no matter what the emergency was.  We were led to believe that a situation existed in which it was necessary.  It has been used perhaps to some extent to deal with that situation, but when a few petty offences are committed because of a farmers' strike that Emergency Powers Act is invoked.  Under the conditions which existed, I think it was certainly the Minister's duty to try to set up some conciliatory machinery.  I do not hold with the strike, nor do I hold against it, but I do hold that Dublin must get milk; I hold that the poor of Dublin must get milk, and I hold that it was the duty of the Minister to try to set up conciliatory machinery to provide some way of getting milk, instead of going down the country and getting it through threats from his inspectors or himself and then invoking this Emergency Powers Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said already, I think that was a terrible thing to do, and I also think that the Minister should have discriminated as to the creameries from which he got that milk.  The peculiar position is that the milk is being taken from creameries which are not registered dairies; they have no right to supply milk.  I hold that they have no more right to supply it to the Minister than they have to supply it to the poor persons who are hungry in the country. The Minister made that order; he saw to it that the poor persons in the village would not get a pint of milk. He saw to it that nobody could supply them except a registered dairy holder. He saw to it that the creamery would not supply them.  But when it comes <Col N="509" /> to breaking the strike, he breaks that law himself.  He goes down and threatens the creameries: &ldquo;I will revoke your registration,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I will take away your bounty on home produce,&rdquo; and they had to supply the milk. Why does the Minister bring the milk from these creameries if he will not allow them to deliver a pint of milk in a bottle in a village?  That is a pertinent question, and I think the Minister should answer it.  If he breaks the law, surely the farmers are entitled to break the law?  I do not hold that they are doing so, and I do not want to say they should.</P>
    <P>The Minister ought to find some other means of settling this dispute besides invoking the Emergency Powers Act. We have had revolutions in this country, perhaps too many of them, and God alone knows who was responsible. The Ministers over there are, perhaps, just as responsible as anybody else.  What are they doing now? They are trying to drive decent young men towards revolution.  You cannot deal with a matter like this in the manner in which the Government propose to deal with it; you cannot deal with decent fellows, farmers' sons, in this fashion without driving them towards revolution.  That is what you are doing.  You are out to smash the strike in this way.  I believe you can do it but, if you do, you will be doing a bad day's work.  You will be driving decent young fellows, who are good citizens, no matter what anybody may say, and who will be good citizens, to desperation and disloyalty if you enforce the Emergency Powers Act.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Taoiseach is here. I would like to give you a little advice. The Emergency Powers Act was applied to the I.R.A. not so long since. You have now applied it to the farmers. Why do you not continue applying it?  Why do you close your eyes to certain things that are happening? There are certain organisations in this country and some people are inclined to think that they are sacrosanct.  They can broadcast on a wave length of 25.4 with your knowledge.  I consider it is a terrible thing to try to bring farmers' <Col N="510" /> sons, decent, ordinary loyal citizens, before an Emergency Act Tribunal.  You are trying to terrorise them.  If another churn of milk is spilled you may bring one or two of them before the special court, in order to terrorise them.  Why not bring them before the ordinary courts?  There is no district justice who will fail to deal with them.  They will send them to jail if you want them to.  The district justices always did their duty; they never failed in their duty, and why cast them aside?  Deal fairly and squarely with all sections.  If you do, you will not apply the Emergency Powers Act.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister could set up some kind of conciliatory machinery to settle this dispute.  This motion has nothing to do with derating.  It is dealing solely with the milk business. Derating has nothing to do with it.  I am not concerned at the moment with derating, and I am sure nobody on this side of the House has anything to do with derating at the moment.  We want the milk strike settled, and I believe the Minister can do a lot by setting up conciliatory machinery.  In the Press day after day we can see that there is only a slight difference, something like a penny or twopence.  Are we to have turmoil over that?  Is the Minister so desirous of turmoil, or what does he want?  Human nature is human nature, and you cannot blame one farmer for helping another.  The Minister is the head of a big Department with a lot of civil servants.  It is up to him to revoke whatever Orders he has made, and set up conciliatory machinery.  The milk was 1/4½ last year, and the producers have a good excuse when they claim that it should be a little more this year.  There should be machinery set up to settle the price this year, and it should be a little higher.  There is plenty of room between 1/4 and 2/4, and the Minister can easily bring about a settlement. There is a difference of 1/- between the producers and the distributors. Surely some arrangement can be arrived at without allowing this dispute to reach a more dangerous stage?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>We take the view that this is a rather unfortunately-worded <Col N="511" /> motion.  Evidently those responsible for the motion have realised that.  The motion opens with what is quite a legitimate and desirable thing, namely, condemning the application of the Offences Against the State Act to this dispute, in so far as it relates to the milk dispute; but it goes on to ask for a revocation of the Orders and the establishment of conciliation machinery and independent arbitration, with a view to adjusting in a manner just and equitable to the interests of the farmers, the consumers and the taxpayers, the matters giving rise to such action.  If the sole cause of this dispute was the price of milk, it was surely much easier for the proposers of the motion to delete the last seven words and substitute three simple words such as &ldquo;the milk strike&rdquo;?  The omission of a reference such as &ldquo;the milk strike&rdquo; in this motion clearly indicates that those responsible for the motion have in mind the application of conciliation and arbitration machinery to something other than the milk strike.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was quite good tactics and wise tactics, politically, for those who proposed and spoke to the motion, to make no reference whatever to any other matters but the milk strike; but it is not just by accident that the phrase, &ldquo;the matters giving rise to such action&rdquo;, was inserted in the motion.  I think the object of the proposers originally was to bring within the ambit of conciliation machinery and independent arbitration a much wider list of matters than the milk dispute. In so far as the milk strike is concerned, we are prepared to support any motion which has for its object the establishment of conciliation and arbitration machinery for the settlement of that dispute.  But there are other matters which cannot be referred to arbitration, because they are not economic or industrial matters, because they do not relate to the price of this or that commodity.  They are, instead, not merely public questions, but highly controversial political questions, and it does not seem to us to be possible to refer to arbitration and conciliation highly contentious political questions which have formed the subject <Col N="512" /> of keen debates in our political life for the last ten years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will only allow me to make my speech, I will answer him in due course.  I am willing to refer the milk dispute to arbitration, because it is a matter which should be the subject of arbitration, and which could be settled by arbitration. It is not an unusual thing to refer a matter of that kind for settlement by an arbitration tribunal.  But the phrase, &ldquo;the matters giving rise to such action&rdquo;, in this resolution is intended to bring within the ambit of arbitration a number of matters which I say cannot effectively be arbitrated upon.  There is at least one of them which I do not want to see arbitrated upon, that is the subject of derating. The Fine Gael Party, when in office, opposed derating.  I think that was a sensible line to take.  The Fianna Fáil Party then used to back derating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice says &ldquo;no.&rdquo;  I had the unfortunate experience in a bye-election of listening to Fianna Fáil Deputies say that every vote that was given to a particular candidate in that election was a vote for no rates and no annuities and I believe I could produce a local paper, and perhaps two, with a statement of that kind in it.  We had the spectacle of the Fine Gael Party at one time being opposed to derating, when Fianna Fáil was in favour of it.  Now the wheel has run its full circle.  The opposite is the case.  Fianna Fáil are now opposed to derating and the <Col N="513" /> people who could have applied derating for ten years are now in favour of it.  That is the precise position. And it is gymnastic and trapeze-artist tricks of that kind that are causing the farmer in this country to believe&mdash;I think he is only believing it temporarily&mdash;that he has for the time the support of Fine Gael in the matter of derating, just as he believed at another time, that he had the support of Fianna Fáil for derating.  I do not want to see derating arbitrated upon. I would oppose derating because derating is a scheme which will help the big farmer at the expense of the small farmer.  Derating is, in the long run, a scheme by which those who have most money in this country will get the most relief and those who have least money will have to pay that relief.</P>
      <P>Obviously, you cannot allow a big economic issue of that kind, with widespread ramifications on our whole agricultural and financial structure, to be the subject of arbitration.  Obviously, that is a public question and a highly contentious political question.  The only way in which you can settle a dispute of that kind is by a political Party establishing itself to advocate it as its sole political objective or by an existing Party embodying a proposal of that kind in its programme, getting a majority of electors to vote for them at any general election, coming into office, and applying derating.  That is the one way in which you can get it done.  That is the proper way, if it is to be done at all.  I, personally, will try to persuade people to oppose that policy.  The way in which you cannot get it done is to allow three arbitrators to sit down and calmly decide whether there is to be complete derating of agricultural land in this country, irrespective of the consequences on the small farmer and the people who do not own a rood of land in the country&mdash;three people, by the way, who are not fortified with a single vote from any section of the people in the country and who probably in their parish council election would not get a quota.  That is what this Resolution is suggesting. It is going to refer to arbitration highly contentious matters of that kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="514" /> The opinion in the country in regard to fixity of tenure, if it is questioned or challenged at all, is that the big ranches get too much fixity of tenure. Deputy Gorey will not believe that. It is perfectly true.  In my view, there is no necessity at all for fixity of tenure in this country, but if we are to have fixity of tenure the way to do it is by legislation in this House. The way to do it is by some political Party getting a majority to strengthen whatever weakness there may be in fixation of tenure in this country.</P>
    <P>These are matters, therefore, which I think cannot properly be referred to arbitration, and the nation ought not to take the consequences of referring highly political questions to arbitration boards which are intended solely for the settlement of such minor matters as disputes in relation to such things as the price of milk or which, perhaps, might decide a matter of wages in a national industry or in any particular industry.  We are opposed to a motion, therefore, which seeks to make arbitrable highly contentious political questions, and for that reason we cannot see our way to vote for a motion of this kind.</P>
    <P>At the same time, I think the Government have acted very unwisely in applying the Offences Against the State Act to a strike of this kind in so far as it has been applied to the milk strike.  The Minister read out a list of offences this evening, the majority of which consisted of heads of cabbage being scattered on the roadside, milk being spilt and potatoes being thrown about.  With, perhaps, the exception of one instance, the firing of shots somewhere in Louth, the catalogue of cases consisted of the spilling of milk, and scattering cabbages and potatoes.  I suppose the potatoes and cabbages could be picked up again and no great damage would be done.  The most damage that was done was probably the spilling of the milk.  But that was not nearly as harmful or as destructive or as wasteful as the deliberate burning of boots in Galway last week.  At least, one was done in hot blood and the other was premeditated insanity.  There is no <Col N="515" /> justification for a litany of minor offences of that kind being made the excuse for the application of the Offences Against the State Act to this particular dispute.  I do not think the Minister gave a very convincing explanation of his action in this regard. The statute obliges the Minister to say that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order.  All the Minister quoted for us as constituting interference with the legal administrative machine was the resignation of two peace commissioners.  There would be no great harm if another 102 peace commissioners resigned.  We have probably twice as many now as we had ten years ago.  The creation of peace commissioners is the one growing industry in the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>No harm at all is done by two peace commissioners resigning. It would not matter if 102 resigned.  But the fact that two peace commissioners resigned&mdash;I do not know what Government appointed them&mdash; rather than hear a case as to whether particular prisoners should be remanded for trial is not a reason for the application of the special criminal court to offences of this minor kind. The Minister at least ought to have brought a substantial number of these people before the ordinary courts, if they are guilty of an offence; an effort should be made to try them there; they could have been tried by a jury there.  If the Minister felt that he could not get a fair trial for them in provincial centres it would not be impossible for him to secure a trial for them in Dublin and he probably could not say that the jury would suffer from the same intimidation in Dublin as they might if the court were held in a provincial town or city.  But, without any trial by the ordinary courts whatever, the Minister decides to take up the big stick and to apply the Offences Against the State Act in a dispute of this kind.  I think that is a most tyrannical action on the part of the <Col N="516" /> Minister.  I do not think he has the slightest justification for it whatever. The only result I can see accruing from it is to further inflame feelings of passion.  An effort ought to be made to try to prevent the importation of unnecessary heat into this dispute.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins ought to realise at this stage that he gave his approbation to the Offences Against the State Bill when it was going through this House against warning that it could be used in this and every other circumstance. It would not surprise me at all, with the mentality behind this particular No. 2 Order, that an effort might not be made at some later date even to apply it to industrial disputes.  That is the danger of a Bill of this kind; that is the power you give to an Executive Government when you support a Bill of this kind.  The support which the Government has got in its Offences Against the State Bill&mdash;an unnecessary and tyrannical Bill, creating a whole lot of offences unknown in any democratically controlled country&mdash;is probably encouraging them to apply the provisions of that Act to a dispute of this kind.</P>
      <P>I think at this stage the Minister would be well advised to revoke that Order in respect of the application of the Offences Against the State Act to this dispute.  There is no necessity for it in the whole list of trivial offences put together and, multiplied by ten, it does not justify the trial of these people by the special criminal courts when our ordinary courts are functioning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody would like to see the milk strike settled.  So far as the people of Dublin are concerned, they are paying a very heavy price for its continuance. What is described as milk is being sent into Dublin and a high price charged for it, though everybody who takes the trouble to examine what is sent here knows perfectly well that it is much inferior to the quality of milk which formerly came to Dublin.  The ordinary people of Dublin, particularly delicate children, are being compelled to drink this milk, and they might as well be drinking water.  The sooner the dispute is settled, therefore, the better, <Col N="517" /> because the community is being asked to consume a very inferior quality of milk at the moment.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into the merits of the dispute, as to whether the producers are entitled to more money for their milk, or whether they should get that price at the expense of the consumer or at the expense of the wholesaler. All that is a matter which could be settled around the conference table. I should like the Minister for Agriculture in the course of his reply to indicate that if the parties to this dispute &mdash;I mean only the milk dispute, and not the other dispute&mdash;consent to refer the matter to arbitration, he is prepared to constitute an arbitration court in order to hear and decide on the merits of the dispute, and let all parties to it accept the verdict of the independent arbitrator.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ryan told us the object ought to be to deal fairly and squarely with the community.  I think that is what caused this motion&mdash;that we had dealt fairly and squarely with the community.  The Minister for Justice read out a litany of offences which I do not think any community would tolerate for a moment.  These, of course, are all amenable to the ordinary law, but it was necessary that further steps should be taken in that direction.  I am not so concerned with these particular offences.  I am concerned with the peculiar situation that has arisen.  Many people believed, and a whole lot of people yet believe, that this is a milk strike.  Deputy O'Higgins seemed to think that.  I think Deputy O'Donovan had not the slightest doubt about it.  There is no use in looking at these things with coloured spectacles.</P>

      <P>You could not tell which was which.  I could not either. As I say, there are numerous people all <Col N="518" /> over the country who yet believe that this is a milk strike.  I may tell you quite honestly and fairly that I am concerned with this milk strike, and the reason I am concerned with it is because, when the producers were getting a very low price, I did all I could to get them a better price.  An organisation was started, a fairly good organisation, and they got facilities. The organisation was non-political. The Government listened with a sympathetic ear.  What did the Government do?  After having protected the whole of the milk producers by a tariff on foreign milk products, we protected this organisation by practically putting an embargo on the milk produced in other parts of the country.  We went a lot further than that.  If I am wrong, the Minister for Agriculture will correct me.  A milk board was set up, and that board had on it representatives of all concerned.  It was their business to regulate the price, and the price was a minimum price.  The price is still a minimum price, and these milk producers can get anything they like above that minimum price if the market will stand it.  That is a matter for themselves to consider.  I am not going to make any statement on the position, or what may happen to the milk producers, because, so far as these producers are concerned, if they can disentangle themselves from the unfortunate company into which they have got, I am sure it will be possible to protect them and fix them up in some way.</P>

One man told me it was a milk strike, but when I came along the road and saw pigs being attacked, I could not connect pigs with milk.  On the next day eggs were thrown on the road, and I could not connect eggs with milk.  Unfortunate people from County Cavan with families to support had their eggs thrown on the road.</P>

      <P>I could not tell you whether it was or not, but I have a very fair idea as to who they were.  I am not going to say that I know them, but I could not say that I do not know them.  There is no use in being misled on this question.  People in County Cavan, having families to rear, who did not know anything about this, had their lorries broken and their produce smashed, while perhaps there were hungry children waiting for the return of the money in order to get food. People are still complaining to me that they are afraid to bring their eggs to Dublin.  There is no connection at all between eggs and milk.  A farmer in North Meath no later than this afternoon complained to me that farmers could not sell their cattle.  It was necessary for them to take their cattle to the fairs as they had no grass for them and very little hay.  But they were stopped and turned back and that evening the cattle were purchased by some people.</P>

      <P>That is a thing I am not going to stand for whether the Government stands for it or not.  That is the reason I say to the milk producers that they should disentangle themselves from that company and then we can look at them with a clear vision; we would know them then. Personally I should like to help them and I have informed them of that.  I do not believe the Minister is in any way hostile to these people.  I believe he would help them if he could, because he was once their best friend; but for him they would not be where they are to-day, and let them not forget that.  I do not know whether these unfortunate people went on strike in the ordinary course of events and the other crowd came in when they saw the door open and said, &ldquo;Come along, we will make these fellows lead us; there is an excuse now.&rdquo; That is the position we have to face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Norton that the other matter could not be arbitrated <Col N="520" /> on.  It was beaten at a general election. If it is to be done, it must be done by constitutional means and there must be an election upon it.  I think that at this particular period it is a calamity and an awful misfortune that here in the Dáil we should encourage that thing by the slightest whisper.  I do not think that we in this Dáil should encourage that situation in the light of events to-day.  Men with a large number of cattle can get all their cattle away.  But the small farmers, who in this miserable weather have very little &ldquo;keep&rdquo; for animals and who want to dispose of them in order to meet their land annuities and other debts, cannot dispose of them.</P>
    <P>None of us is so foolish as not to know what is happening in this terrible war that is going on, but we do not know at what moment business will be completely held up.  What will become of these unfortunate people then? What the Minister for Justice did was perfectly right.  He went out, not alone to protect the hungry children in the City of Dublin, but to protect the very men who are on strike.  I do not deny that others would have taken the law into their own hands if he had not acted.  That is the position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to bring this discussion back to the range of relevance, and into some relation with the terms, scope, and objects of the motion.  I feel that when Deputy Norton read and considered the motion, he must have felt a certain amount of glee at spelling something into its terms which was not there, but which could be imported into it by some sort of special pleading.  He was enabled to put himself into the position that is so dearly loved by him and by the Labour Party, of being able to criticise, on the one hand, Fianna Fáil and, on the other hand, Fine Gael.  If it were a fact that this motion was intended to call on the Government to deal with questions of a highly controversial nature, such as derating and fixity of tenure, that situation could be easily met by the Government.  If they said they would exclude from the purview of any machinery set up, in order to <Col N="521" /> settle the disturbance that exists at the moment, those matters of a highly controversial character, they would be immediately met by the movers and supporters on this side saying there was no intention of going into any matters of the highly controversial nature referred to by Deputy Norton. Deputy Norton made an election speech on the sins of Fianna Fáil and the peccadilloes of Fine Gael.  It gave him an opportunity of washing his hands of the motion and, if he is going into the Lobby against it, let there be no doubt about it, the Labour Party are going into the Lobby in favour of the action of the Government in bringing into operation the very drastic provisions of the Offences Against the State Act, in circumstances for which there is no justification.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton said to-night that we approved of that Act.  We did approve of that particular Act.  If it were before the House, we would again vote for it, and again say the same thing that we said at that time.  We would give any Government, whether Fianna Fáil or Labour, or Fine Gael the power to deal with matters affecting the vital interests of the State, and the life of the State, which are the matters supposed to come within the scope and purview of Part V of the Act.  It is not by setting up a smokescreen, such as Deputy Norton endeavoured to set up, in respect of fundamental principles which are endeavoured to be protected by the motion, and by its framers and supporters, that Deputy Norton and the Labour Party will get away from the real principles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are interested in three things arising out of the motion.  As the Minister stated&mdash;and I agree with him in this respect&mdash;the principal matter at the back of the motion is disapproval of the action of the Government in making an Order on the 24th November, 1939, scheduling certain offences as offences triable by the Military Tribunal, or special court, as it is called, for the purpose of meeting a situation which, it now appears, subsists only by virtue of the strike of the farming community.  There is no getting away from that issue by Deputy Norton or by anyone else. <Col N="522" /> That is what is at the back of the motion.  As far as I am concerned, I speak as the representative of a purely urban constituency with poor people, with people on the border-line of poverty, with people on the border-line of comfort and with very few rich people.  It is a constituency the representation of which is shared with the Minister for Industry and Commerce and Deputy Benson.  In no part of that constituency are there any farmers, nor is there any interest in farming.</P>
    <P>It is purely a consumers' constituency, a taxpayers' constituency, a workers' constituency, and, speaking on their behalf here, I protest against the action of the Government, in the words enshrined in the motion in declaring these scheduled offences, even in the circumstances, outlined by the Minister.  I do so because I think action of this kind involves a matter of grave fundamental importance in connection with the administration of justice in this State.  I have not the slightest intention of going into the merits of the matter or of referring to the people engaged in this particular action which is causing the Minister and his Department a certain amount of trouble.  It is not because I have a desire to burk the issues that I decline in this discussion to enter into any controversy or any examination as to the merits or demerits of the farming community, or what they are engaged in, or the objects they are endeavouring to pursue.  That is a matter that can be examined some other time and in some other place.</P>
    <P>Speaking here as a member for a purely urban constituency, I am interested in matters of fundamental principle, and I find, arising out of the situation, that powers have been invoked under the Offences Against the State Act, in circumstances in which it was never contemplated that these powers would be invoked, or the jurisdiction of the Military Tribunal brought into operation.  I say, so far from the Minister having made any case whatever to-night for bringing into operation the scheduled offences, and the jurisdiction of the Military Tribunal, his speech is a condemnation <Col N="523" /> of his own Department and himself and is not an improvement in the administration of the law.  I wonder what is wrong with the machinery of justice, and what is wrong with the ordinary courts, that they were not able to bear the slight strain of a situation such as exists when two peace commissioners resign, some rabbits get out of a lorry, and milk is strewn around the fair green in Dun-shaughlin.</P>
    <P>The law on unlawful assembly was brought to its final pitch by the riots that occurred in England.  We have taken over that law.  Serious riots occurred, the Gordon riots and the Chartist riots.  The law of unlawful assembly was brought to its present scientific state during that time in England.  The ordinary machinery of the law was sufficient to deal even with such serious and tumultuous scenes in Great Britain as the Chartist riots. We can read that in the text books. Why is it that machinery that was so efficacious then is not sufficient here? In the Preamble of this Order, which has brought into operation the jurisdiction of the Military Tribunal, as it is popularly called, to deal with a farm strike, we have the relevant section of the statute recited.  I want to draw the attention of Deputies, and of the public outside to what the Minister said to-night in justification of this particular action of the Government, in bringing into operation the drastic provisions of the Act in connection with the scheduled offences, and the specific provisions of the statute itself.  I quote from the recital of the Order:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Government is satisfied that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order in relation to the offences specified in the Appendix hereto.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>How did the Minister show in his speech in justification to-night that the ordinary courts were inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice?  What did he say?  He said that the ordinary courts were not suitable places for the trial of these <Col N="524" /> offences.  That is no justification for the bringing into force of Part 5 of the Offences Against the State Act, 1939. This House and the country are entitled to know the specific offences and to be told what acts have been committed which justified the Government in coming to the conclusion that they, apparently, did.  Otherwise, this order is <i>ultra vires.</i></P>
    <P>Has it been shown that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice?  So far as I could follow the Minister to-night, the only justification he gave was contained in two sentences.  He says that the ordinary courts are not suitable to meet the situation that exists.  That is not what the statute says.  The ordinary courts may not be suitable, but what evidence has the Minister adduced to show that they are &ldquo;inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My mind goes back to the years following the murder of Kevin O'Higgins down to the passing by this House of Article 2A, and the steps taken to meet the situation that existed at that time. Time would not permit me to go into the details of the steps taken by the last Government to meet the cruel situation that faced them at that time when the administration of justice was clogged by unconstitutional action, backed by murder, backed by every weapon of the assassin, the thug, the thief, the robber and the intimidator. Every step that human and legal ingenuity could devise to meet that situation by way of the ordinary courts was taken before Article 2A was brought into legislative effect.  When Article 2A was proposed by the then President of the Executive Council&mdash; the present Leader of the Opposition&mdash; he justified his action to the House and to the country and his justification is to be found in the records of this House.  He almost produced in this House the dead bodies of the people murdered&mdash;the people who had been shot throughout the length and breadth of the country.  He produced evidence of intimidation, of Communism and of sabotage.  He produced evidence that the administration of justice, although <Col N="525" /> given every trial from the time of the murder of Kevin O'Higgins in 1927 up to 1931, had broken down under the gun of the assassin and the machinery of murder which extended throughout the country.</P>
    <P>It was to meet a situation of that kind that Article 2A was brought in. The Offences Against the State Act is the lineal successor to Article 2A.  It is an improved copy of Article 2A, with the holes in Article 2A more or less stopped.  It was only to meet a situation intended to be met, and which was met, by the provisions of Article 2A of the old Constitution that Part V of the Offences Against the State Act was introduced.  My mind cannot help going back to the years 1934, 1935 and 1936 when the provisions of Article 2A were operated against farmers and Blueshirts, although it was brought into force ostensibly against the I.R.A. &mdash;against the action of bodies around the country who were contending that this House and the Government were not the lawful Parliament or Government of this country.  Ostensibly, it was brought in to put down these particular organisations, as a species of smoke-screen, but the Act was more effectively operated against farmers and Blueshirts than it ever was operated against the I.R.A.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am drawing an analogy which, I submit, I am entitled to do.  I am drawing an analogy betwen the present circumstances and the circumstances when Article 2A was last brought into operation.  When Part V was to be brought into operation against the I.R.A., we gave the Government our support.  But what do we find?  We find that it is again brought into operation against the farmers, with no justification.  That is the meaning of this motion&mdash;that we object to this particular instrument, forged for one purpose&mdash;the preservation of the State in times of danger&mdash;being used for another purpose.  It was forged for the protection of the State when the very foundations of the State were being menaced.  It was thought <Col N="526" /> that the Government of the country&mdash; whatever Government was in power&mdash; should have in its hands or within its grasp power, and effective power, to meet such a menace.  That is the real motive behind Part V of the Act of 1939.  That is why we supported Part V of the Act of 1939.  We object to its being brought into operation in the present circumstances because, in the first place, no case has been made for it and, in the second place, Part V should not unnecessarily be used, even though provocation be given to the Government, and even though its use may ease the difficulties of the Government. We say that Part V should not be used except as a last resort, until the machinery of the ordinary law has been tried out to its last link and its last movement, and until there is not another cog left in that machine.  Until it has been tried out, Part V should not be brought into operation.  That is the reason we have put down this motion, as a matter of principle.</P>
      <P>Part V should be only sparingly used. If it is unnecessarily used, even under provocation&mdash;and the Government have, in present circumstances, some provocation&mdash;then, when Part V is intended to be used as an effective instrument, it will break in the hands of a Government that sorely needs it when, perhaps, the very foundations of the State are menaced.  It is the old cry of &ldquo;Wolf, wolf!&rdquo; If those people who are scattering pigs at Dunshaughlin or scattering milk or rabbits from off lorries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the Minister for Justice had an opportunity of making the case that the Minister is now making.  He made no case that officers of justice had been in any way seriously maltreated.  If officers of this State have been maltreated, what are the district justices doing?  Why have not these people who are alleged to be guilty of these offences been brought before the district justices?  The Minister for Justice made a justification which was his own condemnation.  He was only able to say that two peace commissioners <Col N="527" /> had resigned.  The fact that only two have resigned is a condemnation of the Minister's case and of the Minister himself.  If two peace commissioners have resigned, what are the district justices doing?  He says that there are so many cases it would be unfair to bring them before the ordinary courts.</P>
      <P>But there is only one military tribunal&mdash;one special court.  Are you going to set up a whole series of these or is that only a smoke-screen brought across the realities of this picture? There are any number of district justices and there is power to appoint more.  If the situation is such as to require more district justices, if the ordinary justices are not sufficient to deal with any situation of lawlessness, so far as we can do it, we will give you the power to deal with it, but we will not allow you to use unnecessarily the powers under Part V, because we think it is a situation in which they ought not to be used and that their use will bring the administration of the ordinary law into disrepute.  What will my constituents in Dublin get into their heads but that the ordinary law is no use except as a facade, and that it is not able to bear the burdens put upon it by any little disturbance that may arise out of the ordinary course?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to know if there has been a single case in which these alleged lawbreakers have been brought before a district justice.  Is there any case in which a jury of the City of Dublin or anywhere else has refused to bring in a verdict?  Is there any menace such as there was from 1927 to 1931 when jurors were intimidated and prevented by armed bodies, and by unarmed political bodies behind these armed bodies, from doing their duty and carrying out the ordinary administration of justice?  Where is the evidence that has been produced, or rather what kind of evidence has been produced, by the Minister here to-night?  It was really comic&mdash;that is, if it had not been so tragic it would have been comic&mdash;to hear the Minister reading out his list of offences to-night which, even though he read the list very rapidly, were only <Col N="528" /> concerned with this matter of milk and rabbits.  Even with the help of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, all the Minister could do was to show that these cases concerned assaults on a few police officers.  Now, I do not suppose a week passes without a few police officers being assaulted either here, in the city, or in the country.  We know that the juries have been doing their duty in the Circuit Court and the other courts in connection with these ordinary cases, and what evidence is there that they will not do their duty in other cases where the law is broken? I do not say that the law has been broken in this connection.  I do not know whether or not it has been broken, nor do I know where the merits of this dispute lie, because the Minister has refused to allow me, or the constituents whom I represent, to know what this dispute is about.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton spoke here tonight about derating&mdash;running away, both he and his Party, in full cry, from the real issue.  I did not know&mdash;and I say it here publicly&mdash;that this so called strike of farmers throughout the country had anything whatever to do with derating, fixity of tenure, and so on.  All I knew was that there was a milk strike; and I am speaking now for people who have spoken to me in connection with this Motion that has been put down.  It may be perfectly clear to some Deputies here that some organisation or another, or some part of the farmers' organisation, want to bring in derating, fixity of tenure, and so on, in connection with this dispute, but, so far as my constituents in the City of Dublin know anything about this matter, the only thing they know is that there is a milk strike on, and the only thing that they want is not to have to pay more for their milk and not to have their taxes increased.  That was the reason why this Motion was framed.  It was framed so as to ensure that, if any dispute with the farmers were to be settled, it would be settled in a way that would have regard to the consumer and the taxpayer, and to ensure that the Government, in connection with this strike, would not take the method that they have taken in every single such instance up to this, <Col N="529" /> of paying off the strikers with the taxpayers' money.  The farmers, as well as various other sections of the community, as we all know, have been bought off by the taxpayers' money in connection with similar disputes, and we want, by this Motion, to see that, whatever may be the merits of this strike, they should be examined independently and, if they are examined independently that the rights of the consumers, for whom I am speaking, and the rights of the taxpayers, whom I represent in my constituency, will not be jeopardised by the Government buying off the farmers for the purpose of getting their votes for the next general election.</P>
    <P>That is the real principle involved in this particular Motion that is here before us to-night.  I stress the point again, that Part V. of this Act can be an effective instrument in a time of stress and trouble for a Government charged with the duty of preserving law and order in this State, but if these powers are abused by any Government, or used when there is no necessity, or if they are made a mockery of, as they will be in connection with the present strike, then the use, or rather the abuse, of these powers will bring the administration of the law into disrepute in this country and make it firmly fixed in the minds of the citizens that the ordinary courts of this country, in which they have confidence, and in which they, justifiably, have confidence, are not capable of bearing even the slightest strain.</P>
    <P>I think that the Government ought to have learned a lesson from their recent experiences in connection with Article 2A of the Constitution.  I think that they ought to have learned from their experiences, that the bringing of certain people before this tribunal has tended to make heroes instead of criminals out of these people. Deputy O'Higgins referred to-night to these people, and it is my personal view that, whatever may be the view of the Government with regard to the merits of this strike, the bringing of these farmers before this special court that has been set up under Part V of the Act will have the effect of making <Col N="530" /> heroes of these people&mdash;and this at a time when confidence in our courts may be sadly and seriously required.  I am afraid that it will also mean putting into the minds of the people of this country the thought that Part V of the Act will only be used for political purposes and against political parties, and that it will not be used seriously against the people against whom it is meant to be used, and for the purpose of strictly preserving the lives of the citizens of this country and the institutions of the State.</P>
    <P>There is one other principle involved in this motion, to which I shall refer very shortly.  In the Schedule or Appendix to this order, certain offences are set out.  The first offence is unlawful assembly.  As I have said before, that has been, and can be, dealt with by the ordinary courts of this country.  It can be dealt with effectively by the Guards.  One baton charge would be more effective in dealing with a case of unlawful assembly than four sittings of this special court in connection with unlawful assembly of the type that is likely to arise in connection with the present dispute.  The second offence that is mentioned is, &ldquo;any offence against the Malicious Damage Act, 1861&rdquo;.  Now, I had the curiosity to look up that Act.  I think it is well known to all junior practitioners of the law in this country as the foundation of their income&mdash;offences under the head of malicious damage are a considerable aid to the incomes of junior practitioners.  Really, however, to suggest that the present action by certain sections of the farming community covers such things as riotous and tumultuous assembly for the purpose of destroying or burning churches, houses, warehouses, yachts, harbours and farmhouses, or intimidating tenants or burning their holdings, is too ludicrous. It would be too ludicrous, if the matter were not so serious.  Yet, that is what the Malicious Damage Act, 1861, covers.  It is things of that sort that come within the scope of that Act.</P>
    <P>The next offence that is scheduled here is an offence under Section 7 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act, 1875, which can be tried summarily; and the last scheduled offence is No. 4, an offence under Section <Col N="531" /> 5 of the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, and that is the one which really raises the question of principle.  Now, so far as my information or knowledge goes of the incidents that have occurred in connection with this dispute or so-called strike, there is nothing in the list of offences that the Minister has read out that could not be adequately dealt with by a district justice binding over the person concerned to keep the peace for 12 months.  There is nothing that has arisen so far, in connection with this dispute, or nothing that is likely to arise in connection with it, that could not be dealt with by that very elastic power that is in the hands of every district justice in this country, of binding over the people concerned to keep the peace for a certain period. We have, however, in No. 4 in the Appendix to this Order, something which does raise a question of vital principle, and that is the question of offences under the Emergency Powers Act of 1939.  When that Act was passing through this House, we, on this side of the House, drew attention to the fact that, under its provisions, as introduced, the conscription of wealth and man-power was possible, and we got an assurance from the Government&mdash;and we believed that the Government's assurances were genuine&mdash; that the conscription of wealth and man-power was not intended to be enforced, even under the drastic and very wide powers that were going to be obtained, and that subsequently were obtained, under the Emergency Powers Act of 1939.</P>
    <P>The insertion of this item 4 in the appendix is nothing else, in my view and in the view of a good many others, than an effort at conscription of the goods of the farmer, and an interference with the Constitutional right of the farmer to his private property and with his right to dispose of his goods as he wishes.  We have heard the Prime Minister here this afternoon speaking on the directive principles that are enshrined in the Constitution. One of the fundamental rights is that to private property; one of the fundamental rights of each citizen of this <Col N="532" /> country is the right to dispose of the produce of his soil and the produce of his toil in any way he wishes.</P>

Orders of this kind bring within the scope of No. 4 in the appendix the taking and requisitioning referred to by Deputy O'Donovan of West Cork.  Farmers are ordered to deliver up to the Government, to the agents of the Government, the produce of their soil and the produce of their toil.</P>

      <P>I have already told the Minister, if he were listening to me, that that intimidation could have been dealt with under Section 7 of the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act.  It could have been dealt with even in the courts.  It was so dealt with here by resident magistrates in the British régime and subsequently by district justices.  These are offences that are triable summarily, by binding to the peace; and, <Col N="533" /> if the Minister for Industry and Commerce would devote the time that he devotes to irrelevant interruptions to making himself more acquainted with facts having some sort of substance, he would perhaps contribute a little more seriously to this debate.  This motion raises the question of fundamental principles; it is this question of fundamental principles that is enshrined in this motion.</P>
      <P>Nothing that the Labour Party can say, by their efforts to turn it on to derating and fixity of tenure and by stating that the motion is one that only brings within its scope matters of a highly controversial nature, can get away from that fact.  Nothing can get away from the fact that we are not here advocating&mdash;whatever our personal views may be&mdash;the rights or wrongs of the people taking part in this strike, as it is called.  We are not entering into the merits of that, but we are standing here to protest against a misuse of the drastic provisions of Part V, and we say that that section is bringing into disrepute the administration of the law in this country.  It is bringing into the minds of the citizens the idea that the ordinary courts are ineffective to deal with what really are ordinary crimes&mdash;if crimes they be.  We are protesting finally&mdash;I repeat it&mdash;against the use of these very drastic powers in Part V of the Act, in circumstances in which there is no justification for their use.  Above all, we are protesting because, by the fact that they are used in such ridiculous and trivial circumstances, when these powers are really and seriously required by some Government to resist a threat against the State, these powers&mdash;which ought to be effective against any such threat &mdash;will break in the hands of the Government that has the misfortune to have to use them.</P>

      <P>I suppose I may take it that every Party in this House would agree that no section of farmers or any other part of the community should be permitted to achieve a political objective either by intimidation or by violence.  If I had said that in the Dáil previously, I have no doubt whatever <Col N="534" /> that it would have had general acceptance; but, after some of the speeches made by Deputies opposite and after some of the scoffings which we have heard, I am doubtful about that principle being accepted.  However, I suppose I may expect, at any rate, that the leaders beyond&mdash;even though they may have laughed at certain crimes that were committed&mdash;will accept that principle, that a political objective must be achieved by ordinary means.</P>

      <P>It is true, and I say that it is a pity that a responsible Deputy like Deputy O'Higgins should bring in a motion of this kind, which we now find is badly drafted, in order to condone or to give encouragement to the actions of that association.  We heard from Deputy Costello that the motion was not drafted to mean, as any ordinary person would read it, that the question of derating, moratorium or fixity of tenure were matters that should be referred to arbitration.  We regard this action by the Farmers Federation as a very serious affair, and if Deputies opposite were not in such a funny mood to-night, they might themselves regard it as rather serious that the smaller, poorer farmers in the districts around Dublin should be prevented from bringing their eggs and butter to the market or their few cattle and pigs to the fair.  But these are not matters that should be taken seriously by the Deputies opposite.  The only matter to be taken seriously by them is that the big farmers of County Meath and County Kildare and County Wicklow should get arbitration on the matter of derating because they have gone out on strike.  It is no concern of theirs that the small farmer in the hills of Wicklow should be prevented&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Everybody in this country knows&mdash;although Deputies may try to make light of the situation, they, too, know it very well&mdash;that if one of these cases were to be tried before a district justice in any of the towns round Dublin where the strike is taking place, there would be a demonstration outside the court.</P>

      <P>It is hardly fair to expect these district justices to try these cases, even though they may be very serious.  Some of these cases may go for trial before a jury.  Is any Deputy going to tell me that you can get a fair trial by jury for these farmers in any one of these counties?  Do we not know well that there are some men in these counties would be inclined to hang them for these offences, while there are others who would be inclined to let them off?  Surely you are not going to get a fair trial where they would be biassed one way or another?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, some of them would be against it and some of them for it. I say that we were perfectly entitled, as a Government, to say that we were satisfied that the ordinary courts were not adequate to deal with these alleged offences.  We were satisfied of that because these men who were capable of coming together in eight motor cars to spill the contents of a lorry of potatoes around the road, were equally capable of coming to demonstrate outside a courthouse where a district justice might be trying one of these cases. Deputy Costello said that we could deal with these offences by having the defendants bound over for 12 months by a district justice.  Deputy Costello should have a fair idea of how a district justice would be inclined to deal with cases of this kind at the present time, and of the intimidation that is likely to take place.  Does Deputy Costello think that binding them over for 12 months is going to have the slightest effect?  Many of them may be honourable men and probably would keep their bonds but there would be others to take their place.  There would be several ready to take their place if they thought that the maximum penalty for going into the fight on behalf of the Federation was that they might be brought before a district justice and bound over for 12 months. That is not going to be a deterrent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The special court to which these cases can be sent under this order is not subject to intimidation.  It is not subject in any way to any influence of that kind and the Leaders opposite have said on many occasions&mdash;and we have said so, too&mdash;that those who go before that court will get a fair trial. What more do they want?  They get a fair trial.  I do not see that we have done anything that should be condemned in this House, when we make sure, as far as we can, that people <Col N="544" /> whom we accuse&mdash;I put it that way to please Deputy O'Higgins&mdash;of committing certain crimes will be brought before a court where they are sure to get justice.  That is all we have done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, under the Emergency Powers Act.  Deputy O'Donovan said that the producers of milk had a case. I do not know whether they have or not but if they have, they have the most perfect form of arbitration machinery under the Act passed by this House setting up the Dublin and District Milk Board.  The board which was set up was composed of representatives of the producers, the wholesalers and the retailers with a chairman. They were to discuss amongst themselves the price to be paid to producers. If they could agree, that could be looked upon as an arbitration.  If they did not agree, the chairman sent me a report together with a statement of the views of the different sections of the board and his own views.  It is not correct to say that I determined the price to be paid to the producers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall tell you that in a moment.  On the 14th April of this year &mdash;this is the last letter I got from the milk producers&mdash;I received a communication from them saying that a price had been fixed by the board for May, June and July.  They were willing to agree to the May and June price but they thought that the July price should be revised.  They have said that I refused to see them.  Here is the letter which my secretary wrote to them in reply to their letter.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;With further reference to your letter, dated 14th instant, I am directed by the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="545" /> to state that as pointed out in my letter to you of 14th March, 1938, alteration in milk prices can only be effected through the medium of a determination by the Dublin District Milk Board submitted for the Minister's consideration.  The Minister will, of course, be prepared to consider any such determination referred to him by the board.  In the circumstances, it is considered that the reception of the proposed deputation would serve no useful purpose.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That Act permitted certain creameries to send milk to Dublin.  I come now to another matter.  It may be thought that those people have a good case.  Deputy O'Donovan, and other Deputies opposite, take it for granted that they have a good case.  They say they believe they have a good case.  I have not been in a position to get costings for the production of milk for this area. They are very difficult things to get. I have here a report made by a professor or a lecturer, I am not sure which, in Oxford University.  He took quite a long time in trying to get the costings of milk production and distribution. He did not produce anything very definite in the end and admitted that he could not.</P>
      <P>The only thing, therefore, that I can do is to look around and see what are the prices paid elsewhere.  I quoted here before&mdash;many Deputies know them&mdash;the prices paid to creameries down the country.  They are not more than half what are being paid here in Dublin.  It is true to say that the members of the Milk Producers' Association who live in these counties surrounding Dublin have greater expenses to meet than the creamery supplier, but what that figure would amount to I do not know.  If we take the case of the supplier in Northern Ireland and Great Britain who is supplying liquid milk under the same conditions as the producers here, what is the position?  In England, the October price was 1/1½, less the cost of collection.  For November and December the supplier is getting ½d. more.  Our price here is 1/4 less cost of collection.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that later. In the North of Ireland last winter, at this time, the price paid was 1/3.  I <Col N="548" /> believe they have said that they are going to pay 3d. more this winter.  That will bring the price to 1/6, less 1¾d. levy made by the Northern Government which leaves the price 1/4¼, less cost of collection.  That is definitely higher than it is here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the only comparisons that I could get as to what producers are getting in Great Britain, in Northern Ireland or our own creamery producers.  Compared with any of these, the producers here are not being badly treated.  Deputy Belton asked what about the cost of feeding stuffs.  I would like to tell him that the plea made by those men to me, when I first brought in the Act, was that they were men who deserved support because they were self-sufficient farmers: that they produced their own milk, their own grass and their own crops and that they were self-sufficient in every way.</P>
      <P>I say, whether that is true or not, that the man, whether he is in these five counties, or in some other county outside the five counties, who is prepared to produce milk on a mixed farm: the man who produces his own hay, roots and grain, is a greater asset to this country than the man who fills his houses with cows and buys all his feeding-stuffs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can say to the Deputy is that it may have been too dear last year.  I want to say this: <Col N="549" /> that I was asked the day the milk strike started if I would have arbitration on the question as to how much more it cost to produce milk this year than it did at this time last year.  I said: &ldquo;No.  I will have arbitration on the point: how much does it cost to produce milk this year.&rdquo;  I do not know, but I may have sanctioned too much last year.  I am prepared at any time to have the cost of the production of milk coming in here, allowing a reasonable profit, examined.  In that case the producers would, in my opinion, run the risk of having their prices come down.  That would be just as likely as that they would go up.</P>

      <P>I have some tables here. Let us take the winter period from October to April.  Milk is 1/4 a gallon delivered to the wholesaler in Dublin.  Milk delivered to consumers' houses is 2/4 a gallon.  For milk taken at the shops they get 2½d. on 3d. a pint, mostly 3d.  That is 2/-.</P>

      <P>These are the retail prices in Dublin.  The retail prices in England are as follows:&mdash;In London, all the year round, milk is 2/4 a gallon.  In other centres, with a population of over 25,000, the price is also 2/4 a gallon all the year round except in May and June.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

      <P>In London it is 2/4 the whole year round, and, in certain of the larger towns in England, it is also 2/4 throughout the year except during the months of May and June.  Now you go down until you reach 2/- in the smaller villages.  As I have already said that milk is sold by the producer at an average of 1/0½d. per gallon for the year.  The distribution costs in London are very large.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, about the same as here.  Before I sit down I want to refer to two or three other points.  A question was raised about derating. Evidently we have to repeat our facts on this issue every time the matter is raised here, before Deputies will see that we more than carried out our guarantees with regard to derating.  It is true that when in Opposition we were in favour of derating.  And the Government who sat on these benches was then against it.  But when we came into power we felt that halving the annuities was a better proposition for the farmers than giving them derating. The rates are levied on the poor law valuation according to the value of the land rated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we did not.  On the other hand, we have the position that some people pay a very high rent for their land and others pay a low rent. By giving half the annuities we were conferring more benefit on the men who were paying a high rent than if we gave them derating.  Let us take the <Col N="551" /> figure for the rates which, as the Opposition tell us, have gone up so much. The rates on land have increased by £724,000 but against that we have given the farmers half the annuities which amount to £2,200,000, so that the advantage there is very considerable. There is one other set of figures which I would like to give and that is the Agricultural Prices Index figure. Statements have been made here by the Opposition on this aspect of the question.  I have been asked what was the price of cattle, sheep and so on for the year 1931.  In 1931 the Agricultural Prices Index was 111.  In the year 1938 that had risen to 118 and the figure this year is 126.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

      <P>I want to go back to where I started, and to impress on Deputies opposite&mdash;though there is no use at this stage in asking them not to proceed with this motion&mdash;the danger of the course on which they are embarking.  The Opposition are doing a dangerous thing in giving the support of so many Deputies here to those outside who have adopted the weapon of violence or intimidation in order to get support for derating or anything else of that sort.  In that action they are doing a great disservice to this country.  They ought to realise the evil of that course before they proceed with this motion.  The people behind this strike are war-minded.  They have issued their war bulletins.  They have adopted war methods, the methods of violence and intimidation.  I would regret exceedingly if any considerable number of Deputies on the Opposition side of the House or anywhere else go into the Opposition Lobbies in support of this sort of thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret I had not the honour of listening to the Minister for <Col N="552" /> Justice when he spoke this evening here.  It strikes me that he could have improved upon the speech to which we have just listened.  That speech is characteristic of the policy under which the country has groaned for the past eight years.  Let us take the last statement as an example of it.  It is quite clear from what he has said that the Minister wants the country to understand that the Government in this case is acting as administrator and not as a partisan, whereas there has been running through his speech, from one end to the other, the most partisan and incompetent series of statements that could be given utterance to by any Minister in any Government.  He says the Agricultural Prices Index figure for the year 1931 was 111, that the figure for 1938 was 118, and that it is now 126.  Did he really mean to mislead the House and the people when he made that statement?  Could he not have said that any person who sold agricultural goods up to a certain date which included 1938, got 118 as against 111 for 1931, and that he is now going to get 126?  Let us examine this a step further. It is clear that 126 is in respect of all items.  But every farmer is not in all items.  Some are purchasing some of their items at 126; they sold at 118.  If there is one thing that is fallacious and that has been since the Party opposite cursed this country by coming into public life, it is their treatment of figures.</P>

      <P>There you have the Minister's contribution to this debate.  Is that his idea of evidence?  Where is his evidence? Where is the evidence for the statement that justice could not be done in the ordinary courts in cases of this kind? He says everybody knows it.

Would it not be only fair, before one would make a pronouncement like that, that at least one jury should get an opportunity of showing it was not going to do its duty in one particular case?  One case would not be convincing to me, but at any rate the House would have been entitled to a single case of that sort. The Minister will recollect that I produced a case here where jurymen were shot at, one being killed and one wounded, and the Minister at that time would not take the suggestion we made for dealing with that particular form of intimidation.</P>

      <P>The Minister said the special court would not be subject to intimidation.  I know that quite well, but is there not one thing obvious to any person who has had experience of this sort of internal disturbance in a country, in this country and over in <Col N="555" /> England, that the courts in considering those cases endeavour to make the situation easier between the parties; that there are cases in which, if there is a serious internal situation of that kind, the judge will postpone sentence with a view to seeing whether or not it is possible to compose the differences that there are between the people? This special court is set up to deal with this, directed I have no doubt in some form or other by some intimation that the Government wishes to put it down.  Who is to administer justice in this country?  Is it the Government or is it the courts?  If it be the courts, it is not enough to tell us that they are inadequate to deal with that situation, or that the district justice is fearsome of doing his duty, or that there are so many cases in which he cannot do it.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied that this special court which the Government has set up, and which is the one we set up when we were in office, is the appropriate court to deal with a matter of this sort at all.  People who are accustomed to courtsmartial are not the people who are the best adapted to deal with an internal situation of this character.  It is not a conspiracy that is going to affect the existence of the State or the security of the State.  The Minister went at great length into the merits of this case.  He presumably is the judge, and he proceeds to pronounce his opinions, even at a time when one would expect that he would be impartial in his views.  I am not concerned with the merits of this case at all in connection with this motion.  I am concerned entirely with the question of law and order, and respect for law and order in this State.  Those farmers have not been taught that respect for law and order by the very Government that is now speaking of it.</P>

      <P>The Minister has the advantage of me if he has handbills. He objects, if I understand it correctly, to this farmers' body, or whatever it is called, putting down as one of its conditions a condition to which he subscribed at a certain time.  I sat over there listening to Deputy Ryan, as he then was, telling us of the difficulties of the farmers throughout the country, and how they were unable to pay their way.  He had the right to do that here when he was in Opposition, but when he is in the Government he denies the right to some person who puts up that as a proposal.</P>

      <P>I heard him here like a cry-baby making a case for the farmers.  They were never as well off since as they were at that time.  The Minister's own statement to-night is an indication of it.  He told us that the index figure was 111 in 1931.  What was it since?  He did not tell us when it was 90 or when it was 85 or when it was 82.</P>

They have put the farmers in the position in which they are at the present moment.  We are offering them the first lesson in how to administer the laws in the courts of this country.  We are offering them, secondly, an opportunity to get <Col N="559" /> out of this difficulty that they have got into.  I advise them to accept it.</P>

      <P>I merely wanted to draw the attention of the House to this fact, that the issues raised by the farmers in this leaflet have been three times referred to the electors of this country.  They are the arbitration tribunal, and the only tribunal which can settle these issues.  They have given their decision and, if there is to be any appeal from that decision, they are the only tribunal to which that appeal can be carried.  We have no right to overthrow the Constitution by asking, as this motion now asks us to do, to set up a tribunal which is going to reverse, if necessary to override, at any rate, a decision which was given by the people of this country on this question of derating, on the question of the land purchase policy of these people and on the question of a moratorium. The people on three occasions have turned these things down and this House is not entitled to reject the verdict of the people on that matter.</P>

      <P>We have newspapers in this State controlled, bossed and suppressed for the last 14 days at the beck of the Censor, in the interests of the Government, who are in strife with the most responsible and most important members of the community, and then you come in, having suppressed one side of the case, and jeer at Deputies on this side because they do not know all the little details of the petty squabble.  Your actions for the past fortnight are typical of your recklessness in big and little things for the past seven years.  You have deliberately provoked a tragic and deplorable state of affairs in this country.  It is a tragedy when the peasant farmers of Ireland are in revolt against any Irish Government.  It is not a situation in which either the Government or the Opposition can feel comfortable.  It is not a situation about which any of us can feel proud.</P>
      <P>There was no speech made from the Government Front Bench this evening that was not calculated to make a bad situation worse.  We had jeers and jibes of a snivelling, political kind against the audacity of the Irish farmer to demand the derating of his land.  Who were the people who first raised that standard in the country, and on what issue did that Government first get into power?  It was on the issue that is a despicable issue to-day. Remember, it is the farmers who are in revolt, and if they are engaging in what the Minister for Agriculture presumes to call crimes, it is because they, like many others, are rapidly losing faith and confidence in the democratic institutions of this State.  You cannot roll together a mass of support with responsible men, or men holding responsible positions, deluding the public with false promises and then, when they have succeeded, repudiating those promises.  We warned you down through the years that the seed that was being sown then would be reaped in turmoil and trouble when you disillusioned those people.  If the farmers are inclined to take the unconstitutional path, who blazed the trail, who undermined their confidence, who sapped their faith in Parliamentary institutions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="561" /> We had a Minister getting up on one occasion, a colleague of the leader, telling us in this House that when one of our institutions, such as the Military Tribunal, had to be used, it was time for the Government to quit; it was time to quit when any Government had to rely on such instruments. Remember, that was at a time when the Government, having gone through months of armed conspiracy, and having marched behind the coffins of many young and old Irish people, finally came to the House for special powers.  But, even in those circumstances, the powers were branded as unjustifiable, undemocratic, and the Government that asked for those powers were told they were a Government of failures.  We have these same successful politicians, but broken statesmen, coming in here this evening to apply such drastic powers against a group of poor Irish farmers who presumed to revolt, or presumed to defy, in an economic way, the all-mighty Government of politicians who got in here by scrambling on their shoulders.</P>
    <P>We are told that all the courts of Ireland have failed, that the Government are forced to the conclusion that the courts of an Irish State are inadequate to deal with ordinary Irish offences.  We are told by the same Minister in the same breath that they came to that conclusion after nine days of agrarian activity; that they came to that appallingly grave decision before they had found even one man guilty before any court.  And, in the determined desire not to mend the situation, but to wound their opponents; in the vindictive desire to do untold damage provided they wounded an Irish farmer, we have an Irish Minister in an Irish Parliament getting up to level a charge at our brothers and cousins in this country that even die-hard Unionists revolted at in an English Parliament, when one indiscreet person charged Irish people with being perjurers.  Decent Englishmen, decent Scotsmen and decent Welshmen repudiated the person who hurled that charge.  And now, because there is a bit of trouble over disillusioned, down-trodden depressed Irish farmers because they presumed to <Col N="562" /> challenge the judicial knowledge of a politician opposite, we are told that Irish jurymen are only a pack of perjurers. The Government have asked powers of this kind to deal with the present situation and surely such a Government should quit office when they show such irresponsibility as has been shown over there to-night?</P>
    <P>The situation is bad and the longer it lasts the worse it will get.  I said at the beginning that I would not presume to go into the merits of this dispute. Sufficiently bad is it that there is a dispute. If you let this strike go on for one week and two weeks, armed with all the powers you got under false pretences to deal either with a foreign enemy or with armed insurrection, undoubtedly you will beat the Irish farmers to their knees; you will roll them in the dirt; you will bend the strongest and break the weakest.  Is that a national victory?  Is that any &ldquo;crow&rdquo; for this Parliament?  Is that anything to make this State prouder&mdash;that a Government, armed with war powers, beat the peasant population of the country to their knees?  If that does not happen, if this struggle goes the other way, if by more intense organisation the people of the City of Dublin are starved and the farmers are victorious over Government, is that a comforting thought?  Is it a thing that any of us could be proud of?  It would be a tremendous national humiliation. But you will carry on, armed with the baton, until one or other result is achieved and we are political tricksters to ask you to stay your hand, to stop and think, in the interests of all.  Cannot you withdraw this provocative measure and give one hour's talk to the people on the other side and give one minute's consideration to the people who have still some national pride and sympathy in their hearts?</P>
    <P>This is too grave a matter for anybody on this side to take sides.  There was nothing in the motion to indicate that we were taking sides.  It was merely a distortion of the motion and a twisting of our statements to even imply that we had indicated sympathy one way or the other.  We said: &ldquo;If the Government is not conscious of its <Col N="563" /> responsibilities let us in Opposition be conscious of ours.  Let us ignore&mdash;let us despise&mdash;the tempting political bait of taking sides and embarrassing a Government.&rdquo;  The Minister for Agriculture grins.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>If he would do less grinning and more thinking we would not have a strike at this moment.  We came and we asked you to stop abusing powers you got to deal with armed conspiracy, to give these men a chance to talk around a table.  We refused to take sides.  The Minister came in with his sneers and his jeers.  We put ourselves in the position of being jeered at from that side because we gave you those powers on the eve of war.  We gave them under the assurance that you would never use them on this kind of occasion or that you would never use them, at least, until you had tried the ordinary courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have never stood for lawnessness <Col N="564" /> and we are not standing for it now. If property is being destroyed, if people are interfered with in their ordinary trade, then, we say, bring the offenders before the court, imprison them, fine them.  Give them the ordinary law that you and I have got to stand by.  They will not squeal. They will take their medicine.  If another fills the breach, do the same with him.  The Minister says, we have too many to do that.  You have hundreds and hundreds of ordinary courts; you have only one Military Tribunal. Was that a fair argument&mdash;that one tribunal can do more than hundreds of courts?</P>
    <P>This is a vindictive, political measure, true to form, true to your form all the time&mdash;to use any weapon to crush opposition, no matter how justified or how reasonable.  Proceed if you like; defy that motion.  I do not doubt your capacity, with all the forces behind you, to crush the opposition of the Irish farmers, but I would not be happy to be in the seat of any one of you the day after you did it.</P>
