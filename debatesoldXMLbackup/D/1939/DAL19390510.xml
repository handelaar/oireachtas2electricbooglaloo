      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if representations have been made to him by the Dublin Juvenile Advisory Committee and the Council of the Society of Saint John Bosco pointing out the gravity of the problem of juvenile unemployment and the failure of existing machinery for dealing with it, and asking that a commission of inquiry be set up on the matter; and, if so, if he will state what action he proposes to take.</P>

      <P>Communications have been received from the bodies referred to in the Deputy's question.  One suggests the appointment of a commission of inquiry into juvenile unemployment, and the other recommends the appointment of a commission of inquiry into juvenile unemployment in the City of Dublin.  These suggestions have been under consideration in my Department and replies will be issued at an early date.  All the statistical information available on the subject of juvenile unemployment is already at my disposal and I am not satisfied on present information that a commission of inquiry would serve any useful purpose.  A final decision has not yet been taken on the suggestion, however.</P>

      <P>The financial year which closed on the 31st March last betrayed all the hopes which were founded on its auspicious opening.  The ever-increasing tension between some of the more powerful States of Europe, manifested in recurrent crises which were only partially resolved by the postponement of war, had repercussions of a most disadvantageous character upon our Exchequer position.  For instance, the fall in stock exchange values occasioned by the uneasy and unstable international situation, showed itself in a decline of £84,000 in the receipt from estate duties, while a decrease in the turnover of the Sweepstakes was expressed in the reduced return from stamp duties, upon which the decline in the value of stamped transactions had an additional depressing effect.  Corporation profits tax was likewise disappointing, as was the yield from excise.  If it were not for the fact that an unexpected and unlooked-for overplus of £562,000 on the Estimate occurred in the customs duty form imported sugar, and that there was a small excess of £28,000 in the receipt from income-tax, as well as of £18,000 from excess profits duty, the revenue from taxation would not have filled our estimate by £291,000. Thanks to these, however, the actual yield from general taxation of £24,825,000, together with £1,162,000 from motor vehicle duties, exceeded by £317,000 the original Budget estimate of £25,670,000 for the tax revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main classified yields for the year are to be found in the Estimates White Paper which was circulated some days ago; while the aggregate figures for the tax and non-tax revenues, as compared with the original Budget estimates, are to be found in Table 1 of the tables relating to the financial statement, which, following the precedent of last year, <Col N="1973" /> have been circulated to the House. From this table it will be seen that the total revenue from tax and non-tax sources amounted to £31,884,000, or £379,000 over the estimate.</P>
    <P>The position as regards expenditure was not at all so favourable.  As Table I shows, the issues for Central Fund Services at £4,850,000 exceeded the Budget estimate by £41,710; while on the supply side the total outlay came to £28,260,000.  Thus under all heads, capital and otherwise, covered by the Budget we spent £33,110,000.</P>
    <P>The figure I have given covers the expenditure which took place on certain capital works, such as airport construction, to defray the cost of which, as I stated last year and as Table I shows, we were prepared to borrow. The borrowings, in fact, came to be much less than I had anticipated, for the reason that progress on the capital works being slow, expenditure upon them was much less than had been budgeted for.  Indeed, of such savings as were made last year a large part, no less than £1,300,000, arose in respect of services such as airport construction and defensive armaments, in which there was a large capital element. On the other hand a great deal of overspending took place upon certain recurring public services, like unemployment assistance, which ought to be, and if the public credit is to be preserved must be, paid for out of revenue.  The final position is that with a total revenue of £31,884,000 and a total expenditure of £33,110,000, of which only £698,500 can be charged to borrowings, there was a deficit on last year's Budget of £527,500.</P>
    <P>During the year with which we have been dealing certain special circumstances aggravated the demands on the Exchequer and helped to bring about the deficit.  The first of these was a deficiency of £68,000 in the Appropriations-in-Aid of Vote 61 on account of unemployment assistance.  It arose through certain public authorities withholding payment of moneys due under the Unemployment Assistance Acts to <Col N="1974" /> the Exchequer.  A Bill which will fully clear up the position in that regard will be introduced in due course.  Another circumstance was the intensification of expenditure upon defence which in consequence of the increasingly critical international situation has continued at an accelerating rate since last autnmn. The larger expenditure has been mainly upon increased personnel, personal allowances and equipment, and supplies of munitions rather than upon what may be described as capital armaments. It is likely to be a recurring charge against revenue of approximately £200,000 per annum.  A third circumstance was the increase in the cost of unemployment assistance consequent upon the higher rates of assistance granted by the Unemployment Assistance Act of 1938.  It has been estimated that the higher rates in question account for approximately £200,000 of the additional expenditure from the Vote for Unemployment Insurance and Unemployment Assistance.  Between them the three factors which I have mentioned were responsible in round figures for £468,000 of increased expenditure as compared with the previous year.</P>
    <P>The Votes for the Army and for Unemployment Insurance and Unemployment Assistance were not, unfortunately, the only services in respect of which we had increased expenditure last year.  The outlay upon four Education Votes was up by £243,700, of which teachers in primary schools received £131,580.  Posts and Telegraphs took £125,000 more than last year, £81,379 being in respect of remuneration.  There was an increase of £122,000 in expenditure out of the Employment Schemes Vote, with increases likewise of £139,000 on Agriculture, £115,000 on Industry and Commerce, £80,000 on Local Government and Public Health, £60,000 on Old Age Pensions, £66,000 on Lands, £44,000 on Army Pensions, £32,000 on Forestry, together with smaller increases on other Votes, making, with the figures which I have just mentioned, a total increase of £1,997,000 in respect of 55 Votes.</P>
    <P>The increases were offset to the <Col N="1975" /> extent of £1,437,000 by reduced spending on 17 other Votes (including £1,405,000 in respect of Export Bounties and Subsidies, £14,000 for Property Losses Compensation, £3,700 for Secret Service, £1,500 for Law Charges, £4,800 for Science and Art, and £1,800 for the Industrial and Commercial Property Registration Office), and to the further extent of £60,000, making £1,497,000 in all, by the non-repetition of certain provisions made in the previous year.</P>
    <P>In Table II the issue for each Vote for 1938-39, as compared with the corresponding figure for the preceding year, is set out.  No doubt the figures given therein will receive the careful scrutiny of the Dáil&mdash;and, may I hope, of the taxpayer.  They may not console him, but at least they will tell him where his money is going.</P>
    <P>Before I go on to deal with other aspects of our public finances I may mention that last year 38.8 per cent. of our tax revenue came from customs duties; 23.5 per cent.  from excise duties; 33.2 per cent. from taxes on income, property, profits and stamped transactions; and 4.5 per cent. from motor vehicle duties; while 18.5 per cent. of our total revenue came otherwise than from taxation.  It may be of interest to mention that the yield from customs duty on sugar in 1938-39 amounted to 3.6 per cent. of the total tax revenue as compared with 1.4 per cent. in 1937-38.</P>
    <P>Last year I gave, in Table III, a statement of the financial transactions and cash operations of the Exchequer for the period from the 1st April, 1932, to 31st March, 1938.  I have extended that statement to cover the period to the end of the last financial year. It will be noted that in addition to the £10,000,000 raised by the Financial Agreement Loan, there were other borrowings for the Exchequer account amounting to £9,879,000, while the Exchequer also received in repayment of former advances £187,658, making a total receipt &ldquo;below the line&rdquo; of £20,066,658.  To this may be added £60,000 secured by capital repayments <Col N="1976" /> on foot of funding annuities, making a total Exchequer receipt of £20,126,658.  As against these receipts the cash outgoings for capital purposes for the year 1938-39 amounted to £19,954,014, which included the £10,000,000 paid to Great Britain under the Financial Agreement; together with issues such as £453,704 set aside for Sinking Funds; £450,000 provided for Local Loans Funds; £1,042,700 issued for capital expenditure under Shannon Electricity, Electricity (Supply) and Liffey Reservoir Acts, and Telephone Capital Acts; and £27,310 issued as a repayable advance under the Coinage Act, 1926.  The net position, as may be seen from the table, is that whereas at the 31st March, 1938, the payments from the Exchequer for purposes such as I have mentioned exceeded receipts by £9,047,412, the excess of payments over receipts at 31st March last was only £8,617,733.</P>
    <P>Turning to Table IV, which constitutes a comparative statement of the capital liabilities of the State as at the 31st March of this year and last year, respectively, it will be seen that the figure for our total gross liabilities has increased from £56,834,996 to £69,038,080.  These figures, it must be noted, give only the liability immediately attaching to the Exchequer in regard to stock issued by it, moneys raised, and liabilities directly contracted by it.  Against the liabilities there are certain off-setting assets, among which are repayable advances to the Local Loans Fund amounting to £14,455,084.  In previous Budget statements I have pointed out that most of these advances have been made to finance loans granted to local authorities to enable them to undertake housing schemes under the Housing Acts, 1932-1938.  The Exchequer, however, under the provisions of these Acts is itself charged to make good to the borrowers a very large part of the capital charges in respect of these loans.  Accordingly, in so far as advances to the Local Loans Fund are brought into account as an asset of the Exchequer, the value of that asset should be written down by the equivalent <Col N="1977" /> of the Exchequer liabilities to the local authorities concerned in the advances.</P>
    <P>Not only, however, do liabilities attach to the Exchequer in respect of housing loans made by the Local Loans Fund, it has liabilities also in respect of the housing loans which certain local authorities, the Dublin Corporation for instance, raise from other sources.  One way of bringing these likewise into account would be to write-up the figure given in Table IV for the gross liabilities of the Exchequer by £2,270,000.</P>
    <P>The full extent of the assistance given by the Government to the local authorities in this matter of housing, however, may be expressed more conveniently by an aggregate figure covering both the writing-down of the assets appropriate to bring out the net value to the Exchequer of the Local Loans Fund advances, and the writing-up of the Exchequer liabilities necessary to represent the State's liabilities in respect of housing loans from other sources.  This figure is given in a foot-note to Table IV.  It will be seen there that the liability of the State at the 31st March last in respect of the outstanding indebtedness of local authorities for moneys raised under the 1932 and subsequent Housing Acts was £7,320,000 after allowing for the operation of the Sinking Funds. The total outstanding debt contracted by the local authorities for housing was £13,285,000.  A year earlier the Government liability in respect of the local authorities' housing debt outstanding was £6,100,000 out of a total of £10,575,000.  It may also be mentioned that the initial capital value of the liability incurred by the State up to the 31st March last in respect of the total amount, £13,780,000, originally raised by local authorities under the Acts was £7,515,000.</P>
    <P>The figures which I have given show that at the 31st March last the Exchequer had accepted responsibility for no less than 54½ per cent. of the cost of new housing for the people.  In the light of this fact it must be admitted that the State's contribution towards the solution of this problem, <Col N="1978" /> which is as much a matter of local as of national concern, is ample and generous.  It may not be out of place in this connection to mention that, up to the 31st March last, the liability which the Government had accepted for the programme carried out by the Dublin Corporation under the 1932 and subsequent Housing Acts amounted to 43½ per cent. of the total cost to that date.</P>
    <P>It is necessary if we are to get a fuller picture of the capital obligations of the Exchequer at the close of the last financial year to add the figure which I have given for the capital value of the State's liability under the Housing Acts to the amount set down in Table IV for the Exchequer liabilities, raising it to £76,358,000.  The corresponding figure at the 31st March, 1938, was £62,934,996, and at 31st March, 1932, £44,878,000.</P>
    <P>Against the liabilities to which I have referred we have, as already mentioned, to put certain assets. These also are enumerated in Table IV.  They were valued at £38,629,895 at 31st March last, £37,497,905 at 31st March, 1938, and £22,848,000 at 31st March, 1932.  Setting these amounts off against the appropriate capital liabilities for the several years I have mentioned we get the dead-weight Exchequer liability at the 31st March last as £37,728,105, and as £25,437,091 and £22,030,000 for the corresponding days in 1938 and 1932 respectively.</P>
    <P>It will be noted that between the 31st March, 1938, and the 1st April, 1939, the dead-weight liabilities of the State increased by 48.3 per cent.  Such a rate of increase must be a matter of no little concern to the Minister in charge of the Exchequer.  It would be more alarming if it represented a tendency which was likely to persist with unabated intensity.  The fact is, however, that 81.1 per cent. of the increase, that is to say £9,964,000, is accounted for by the Financial Settlement with Great Britain.  Of the remainder, £1,220,000, or 9.9 per cent., is due to the further progress which has been made with the Government's housing programme; £335,000 or 2.7 per cent.  arose in respect of certain charges <Col N="1979" /> which fell upon the Export Bounties and Subsidies Account&mdash;the Vote hitherto accounted for by the Minister for Finance&mdash;prior to the coming into force of the Trade Agreement with Great Britain; £120,500 or 0.98 per cent. was incurred by expenditure upon the new airports, Volunteer halls, industrial alcohol factories, and defensive equipment; £215,000 or 1.7 per cent. by expenditure upon employment schemes; £28,000 or 0.2 per cent. by property losses compensation under the Acts of 1923 to 1933; £180,000 or 1.47 per cent. mainly by the 50 per cent. reductions which are granted in respect of new annuities under the post-1923 Land Acts; and £527,500 or 4.3 per cent.  has been created by the deficit on last year's Budget.  The aggregate of these items has been offset to the extent of about £300,000 by National Loans Sinking Fund transactions.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that three of the causes which operated to increase the dead-weight debt last year, to wit, the financial settlement, the winding-up of the Export Bounties and Subsidies Vote, and the deficit upon the Budget, were clearly abnormal.  Two of them cannot possibly, and the third is very unlikely to recur.  Between them, however, they accounted, as I have mentioned, for 88.1 per cent. of the increase.  So far as the other factors which helped to swell the dead-weight liability are concerned, some of them, such as the expenditure on industrial alcohol factories and on property losses compensation, have disappeared or are rapidly disappearing.  But others, such as the Housing Acts, employment schemes, and the Land Acts, are still, and are likely to continue to be, active&mdash;a position which cannot but be regarded with uneasiness by the Minister responsible for the public finances.</P>
    <P>Moreover, it has to be remembered that Table IV relates to only part of the public debt.  The position of the local authorities must also be taken into account.  The latest reasonably complete and firm figures available in this connection relate to the year which ended on 31st March, 1938.  According <Col N="1980" /> to them the gross indebtedness of the local authorities at that date amounted to £28,178,664 as against £26,559,938 at the corresponding date in the year preceding, and £15,710,711 at the 31st March, 1932.</P>
    <P>As I have pointed out on other occasions, however, statements of gross indebtedness tend to give a too unfavourable picture of the financial position of the local authorities.  The important figures in fact are those for their net indebtedness and net dead-weight indebtedness.  Taking those out, we find that at the 31st March, 1938, the aggregate net indebtedness of the local authorities came to £18,380,485, and their net dead-weight indebtedness to £12,028,160; while at 31st March, 1937, the figures were £18,260,173 and £11,796,173 respectively; and at 31st March, 1932, £14,081,815 and £9,210,815. Bringing these sums into account we may put the dead-weight public debt (national and local) at the 31st March, 1938, at £37,465,251.  The corresponding figure at the 31st March, 1932, was £31,240,815, and at the 31st March of this year I think it may be taken to have been £51,000,000, assuming an increase of about £1,250,000 in the dead-weight debt of the local authorities. On the foregoing basis the <i>per capita</i> dead-weight public debt of our community worked out at £10.6 in March, 1932, £12.7 in March, 1938, and £17.3 in March, 1939.</P>
    <P>The practical importance of the dead-weight debt lies in the fact that it represent uncovered charges upon the future revenues of the State and, therefore, upon the future incomes of all citizens.  The amount of the charges upon the Exchequer which arise out of it in any particular year are, accordingly, of some significance when we are reviewing the financial position for that year and the outlook for the future.  In this connection, I have prepared Table V to show, for the purpose of comparison, what the charges in respect of the dead-weight public debt (national and local) may be taken to have been in the years ending the 31st March, 1932, 1938 and 1938, respectively.  The table is divided into two parts.  On one side <Col N="1981" /> are set out, <i>inter alia,</i> the gross annual charges falling upon the Exchequer on foot of State debt outstanding during the years I have mentioned.  On the other side in respect of the same periods is given the actual income as it was being received by the Exchequer from productive assets.  For any particular year the difference between the annual income as it was thus being received and the gross annual charge which was falling on the Exchequer or local authorities in respect of the public debt may be taken for all practical purposes to represent the net annual charge in respect of the dead-weight public debt then outstanding.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the table, and taking first the figures for 1931-32 it will be noted that the gross annual charges in respect of the State debt then outstanding amounted to £3,250,190.  The details given represent disbursements actually made by the Exchequer on foot of obligations admitted by it in the year.  These comprise, <i>inter alia,</i> payments arising out of the Ultimate Financial Settlement, as the local loans annuity and such-like.  The pre-1923 land annuities are not included among the charges for 1931-32, as they are taken to be completely off-set by a corresponding sum, which otherwise would figure in the Statement of Income from productive assets in respect of the purchase annuities, payable in that year, and charged upon the Guarantee Fund.  As a set-off against the debt payments, the Exchequer, in the year with which we are dealing, received £1,184,412 as income from productive assets, so that in 1931-32 the true dead-weight charge in respect of outstanding debt was £2,065,778.</P>
    <P>The statement of the annual debt charges for the year 1937-38 includes not only all the payments actually made by the Exchequer in respect of obligations accepted by it, but also claims, arising out of the Ultimate Financial Settlement, which were not admitted by the Government.  The statement for that year has also to take note of a new commitment in the shape of the dead-weight annual charge which would have fallen upon the Exchequer by reason of the halving of the pre-1923 <Col N="1982" /> land annuities if the ultimate settlement of the dispute in regard to them had gone against the State.  In strict accounting we must regard this as a live and uncovered liability at the 31st March, 1938.  It amounted, as may be seen, to £1,424,690 and with other items brought the total of charges against the Exchequer up to £5,285,193.  The annual income arising out of assets had increased to £1,443,791 so that the nett dead-weight debt charge on the Exchequer for 1937-38 was £3,841,402.</P>
    <P>In the year 1938-39 the Financial Settlement with Great Britain was made, and the beneficial effects of it stand out very clearly in the statement of debt charges for that year.  The items in respect of the pre-1923 land annuities, the local loans annuity, the excess stock annuity, etc., etc., have disappeared, reducing the gross charge upon the Exchequer to £3,612,596.  On the other hand, the productive assets yielded an income of £1,488,921, or £304,509 more than in 1931-32.  In 1938-39, therefore, the actual dead-weight charge in respect of State debt outstanding amounted to £2,123,675 as compared with £3,841,402 a year previously when the Financial Agreement with Great Britain had yet to be concluded, and £2,065,778 in 1931-32.</P>
    <P>To complete the account for the annual charges arising out of the dead-weight public debt we must bring in those which fall on the local authorities. Assessing these at 6¼ per cent. of the dead-weight debt outstanding at 31st March, 1932, and at 6 per cent. on the amount similarly outstanding at 31st March, 1938, and of this year, we get £575,000, £721,000, £796,000, respectively. Adding these sums to the corresponding figures for the State debt, we find that the annual charges paid in respect of the outstanding dead-weight public debt (national and local) were:&mdash;</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1983" /> It is to be noted that the payment for 1938-39 did not cover a full 12 months' charges for the Financial Agreement Loan.  If it had done so, then the figure for that year would have been £3,032,416.  The figures which I have given show that though the dead-weight of public debt outstanding increased from £31,241,000 at 31st March, 1932, to about £51,000,000 at the 31st March last, the dead-weight annual charges thereon have increased in a much smaller proportion.  They have in fact gone up from £2,640,000 to £2,919,000.  In this connection, however, we have to bear in mind that the Sinking Fund conditions attached to the First National Loan were much more stringent than has been the case with subsequent issues.  That fact may be taken to reflect not merely the stability of the State, but the easier credit conditions which have prevailed in latter years.  It also carries the implication, however, that in regard to the reduction of debt we have followed less exacting standards than formerly.</P>
    <P>We have now to deal with the position for the current year, in regard to which the usual White Paper of Estimates has been circulated to the Dáil.  In formulating the figures given therein for revenue and for expenditure it has been necessary to proceed sometimes upon one, sometimes upon the other, of two assumptions not quite consistent with each other.  The first of these assumptions has been that a major European War is likely and that it is necessary to take certain precautions against that contingency; and the second, with certain qualifications, has been that war will not, in fact, befall.  The Estimate for Defence may, perhaps, be said to have been based upon the first assumption; those for most of the other Departments and for our revenues upon the second; while in regard to the Vote for Public Works, for instance, both assumptions had to be reconciled with the task of preparing Estimates which were to have a practical application in the immediate future.  These considerations have to be borne in mind in relation to the <Col N="1984" /> figures with which we have now to deal &mdash;and above everything else it is to be remembered that the outbreak of a general conflict in Europe would render our Estimates, or indeed any Estimate that could be made here or elsewhere, of little value as a basis for public financing.  Taking the figures as they have been presented, however, we find that our expenditure during the current year is likely to be of the order of £35,716,000, while our revenue on the basis of our existing rates of taxation should be about £31,130,000.  How to cover the difference of £4,586,000 which exists between these two figures is the problem which we have to solve in framing the Budget for the year.</P>
    <P>Our first consideration in that connection naturally must be to avoid the unnecessary imposition of taxation.  At this stage we are precluded, I must suppose, form looking for any considerable reduction in the actual sums to be provided for the public services.  As I have said so frequently in relation to public spending, economy is a virtue that is often preached but seldom practised.  I have no doubt that when I finish to-day I shall be criticised for placing additional burdens on the people.  I shall be told that in the year 1931-32 the total revenue amounted to £25,496,419, of which £21,286,000 came from taxation; whereas in the year which has just passed it amounted to £31,884,000, with £25,987,000 from taxation; while for the current year we are going to get from taxation&mdash;but it is too soon to go into that just now. The point is that all these millions are taken from the taxpayer for one purpose and for one purpose only, and that is to pay for the public services which the people, in so far as their representatives here in this Dáil speak for them, demand.  If to-day the Minister for Finance has to get from the community so many millions more than in 1931-32, he is in that position because the public services are costing, and so far as the Dáil in regard to the Estimates for the current year has expressed itself, are to continue to cost, so much more than at that time.</P>
    <P>Table VII which I have circulated should bring that home to us.  It <Col N="1985" /> shows, for instance, that expenditure on old age pensions has increased from £2,702,000 in 1931-32, to £3,484,000 in 1938-39, and is likely to reach £3,506,000 this year.  Similarly, as against £161,000 spent on unemployment insurance in 1931-32, there was issued last year for unemployment assistance and unemployment insurance £1,219,000, while the Estimate for 1939-40 is £1,137,000.  Relief schemes and employment schemes got £156,000 in 1931-32; last year the actual issue for such schemes was £1,290,000, and £1,500,000 has been included for them in this year's Estimate.  The Land Commission received £614,000 in 1931-32, it got £1,645,000 last year, and this year it wants £1,792,000.  In brief, £9,780,000 was actually issued last year for what may be described as social services, as compared with an expenditure of £4,551,000 in 1931-32, and an anticipated outlay this year of £10,121,000.  These services, therefore, account for over £5,500,000 of additional money in this year as compared with 1931-32.</P>
    <P>But the increased spending has not been confined to social services only. The provision for educational services has risen form £4,690,000 in 1931-32 to £5,159,000 in 1938-39, and to an estimate of £5,318,000 for the current year. Army pensions cost £195,000 in 1931-32; they cost £588,000 last year, and will probably cost £587,000 in this.  For afforestation £60,000 was expended in 1931-32, £185,000 is wanted this year. The Vote for agriculture took £375,000 in 1931-32.  This year it stands at £594,000, plus £606,000 for export subsidies.</P>

      <P>The actual expenditure upon this batch of services came to £5,320,000 in 1931-32.  This year the estimates for the same services amount to £7,290,000, representing an increase just short of £2,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What does the House want us to do about this position?  Cut the services to reduce expenditure, or maintain the services and increase taxation?  This <Col N="1986" /> is a matter upon which the Dáil cannot have it both ways.  The estimates for most of the larger spending Departments have been taken.  I have read through the debates upon them carefully. Apart from the formal reductions proposed for the purposes of initiating debate and a forthright, honest speech by Deputy Beegan, scarcely a voice was raised to advocate greater care or greater thrift in dealing with the public moneys!  On the contrary, we had, not merely from these benches, not merely from watch dogs sent here by the perambulating farmers to safeguard taxpayers' purses, but even from the benches of the principal Opposition, demands for further expenditure.</P>
    <P>We had members of the Labour Party calling for increased activity in the construction and repair of national schools, the provision of free school books for all children in primary schools, increased rates of pay and allowances for the Gárda Síochána, the provision of houses for the Gárda, the extension of the school-leaving age, with, naturally, increased costs for teachers and schools, fresh expenditure on the ports and a laxer administration of the Unemployment Assistance Acts.  We had a certain farmers' Deputy asking for housing facilities for working farmers on the same lines as for labourers, the carrying out of big national works of drainage and the provision of residential agricultural and domestic economy colleges by the State.  Even leading members of the Opposition, as I have mentioned, were caught by this infection of extravagance, and demanded family allowances, increased provision for drainage, turf development and mineral development, &ldquo;more generous&rdquo; administration of the Unemployment Assistance Acts and again, housing for the Gárda Síochána.</P>
    <P>All these are excellent things in themselves, no doubt, and I am not to be taken as against them.  But they are all proposals which, if conceded, would have to be paid for by someone.  In this case they would have to be paid for by the taxpayers, by those who buy food and clothing, <Col N="1987" /> meat and drink for themselves and their families, out of means which, in the majority of cases, are straitened and scanty.  The truth in this matter &mdash;and it must be grasped by the House and the country&mdash;is that, in so far as the framing of the Budget is concerned, it is not what the Minister for Finance may have been able to do within the three or four weeks preceding its introduction that is important, but what the Dáil and every Deputy in it have been doing in regard to the cost of the public services for weeks and months beforehand.  When, therefore, in due course the prodigals of March, changing into Scrooges in May, go around the constituencies protesting that the Minister for Finance has put so much more on the income-tax, so much more on tea, or beer, as the case may be, let those who feel these imposts and resent them, burst in on all their eloquence and ask them one simple question: Why those who court popularity by opposing taxation now did not, at the right and proper time, risk unpopularity by opposing the expenditure which has made that taxation inevitable?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem, however, which at the moment we have to consider is, not what retrenchment we can make in regard to the proposed expenditure upon the supply services, but to what extent the aggregate total for all the services can be written down to allow for the fact that in each of them some allowance has been made for contingent expenditure which, indeed may not arise at all, and which, in any event, in any year is most unlikely to arise upon every service. The writing-down of the gross total in this way has been customarily described as making an allowance for over-estimation.  The amount thus allowed has naturally varied from year to year and, as Table VI shows, the actual over-estimation that, upon the final out-turn of the year, was shown to have been made in estimates has varied likewise.  Thus, in 1932-33, <Col N="1988" /> upon the normal services, those falling normally to be paid for out of revenue, it amounted to £318,476, or 1.1 per cent. of the Budget estimate for them; in 1934-35 the corresponding figures were £1,331,539, or 4.5 per cent; in 1937-38, £1,686,659, or 5.2 per cent., and for last year, £589,490, or 1.7 per cent.</P>
      <P>These examples, taken from actual experience, indicate that it is a matter of some difficulty to fix the figure for over-estimation with any precision.  In settling it, however, we must bear in mind that, if it be fixed too low, too much will be taken from the taxpayer; while, if it be fixed too high, the balance of the Budget will be endangered and perhaps some injury done to the credit of the State.  In these circumstances, as good a way as any of setting our course, so as to steer between the Scylla of overtaxation and the Charybdis of a deficit, is to take the arithmetical mean of the actual over-estimation manifested in the Budgets of the past seven years.  This gives us a figure of £961,000, which we can round to £1,000,000, and apply to the figures given in the White Paper, thereby making the probable net total of the expenditure to be provided for £34,716,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not the whole of this £34,716,000, however, need be charged against the revenue for the year.  It includes, for instance, in Vote 11, large sums in respect of airport construction.  In that Vote, too, unusual provision has been made for barracks, magazines, stores, aerodromes, etc&mdash; all necessitated by the present special abnormal and pressing requirements for defence &mdash;while in Vote 65, springing from the same cause, there are still larger amounts for armaments and other defensive equipment.  These have all to be provided now, but can, and we hope will, last a life-time.  It would not be just that we who have to pay for them in these hard times should bear the whole cost of them, even if perchance we are to be the first to rely on them.  In my opinion, therefore, we may spread over a period of years some part of the tax burden which <Col N="1989" /> they involve, provided we shoulder a fair share now.  That argument holds good also for improvement works, road works, and development works, such as are financed from the Employment Schemes Vote, and for works like the construction of Volunteer halls.  This year, in view of the need to keep additional taxation down to the minimum, we may accept it in regard also to the provision which is being made for afforestation.</P>
    <P>We shall now apply this point of view to the amount which has to be raised for national defence.  The Dáil, no doubt, when considering the Army Vote, Vote 65, will have noted that, in additional to the £3,252,199 which was provided thereunder, a further sum of £447,125 for Army purposes was included in the Vote for Public Works and Buildings.  This figure covered, not only the normal provision for the reconstruction and improvement of the ordinary Army accommodation, but £35,665 for new Volunteer halls, £135,500 in respect of new magazines, stores and aerodromes, and £114,900 for one other major work of a special character.  Against the cost of these, and other capital items for armaments and equipment, which come within the main Army Vote, it is proposed this year to borrow £1,350,000, leaving the balance of our expenditure on defence to be met out of taxation.</P>
    <P>The current Estimates provide £185,424 for afforestation, of which sum £30,000 is for land acquisition, and £142,000 for cultural operations and maintenance.  Against these two items it is intended to borrow £55,000.  It has always been the practice to borrow the whole amount required for Property Losses Compensation, and, accordingly, the £3,650 standing against that service in the Estimates will be found in that way.</P>
    <P>In the Votes for Public Works and Buildings, Transport and Meteorological Services, and Posts and Telegraphs, there are sums totalling £382,700, for the new airports at Collinstown and Rhynana for the Department of Industry and Commerce. The ultimate total cost of <Col N="1990" /> these with their equipment is expected to be about £1,575,000.  It is the intention, as I said last year, to make statutory provision for financing these important works, and to spread the cost of them over a reasonable period of time.  Owing to pressure of other business, however, it has not been possible to bring in the appropriate legislation yet; the matter, therefore, must be dealt with administratively. On the assumption that the whole cost of the works would be spread over a period of 15 years, it has been decided that at least £136,350, which is approximately equivalent to the annuity required to pay off the whole cost of the works in that period, should be charged against revenue each year. For this year, therefore, the balance of £246,350, representing the difference between the amount of the annuity and the total provision in the Estimates, is to be borrowed if required.</P>
    <P>There is one service, for which a large part of the requirement was borrowed last year, but for which nothing may be borrowed this year.  I refer to the provision for export subsidies on dairy produce, eggs and poultry, and certain classes of potatoes and other consignments exported abroad.  Last year £557,500 was expended on subsidising these and other products.  For reasons which were fully gone into in last year's Budget speech, I felt I could borrow £335,000 against that amount, so that of the total issue only £222,500 fell to be charged against revenue.  This year the amount required for the service is £606,000, and the whole sum must be found from taxation.  Like the Dairy Produce (Price Stabilisation) Act, the Pigs and Bacon Act, the Sugar Manufacture Act, and the reduction in the land annuities, these export subsidies represent a further substantial aid to agriculture. Since I have touched on this matter, perhaps I may say that, in my opinion, the monetary value of the assistance which the State, directly or by the beneficial effects of legislation, is giving to the farming community this year cannot be placed at less than £10,500,000.</P>

      <P>Each year since the very large Vote for employment schemes was introduced it has been usual to borrow, if necessary, up to one-sixth of the total Vote of £1,500,000 in respect of the capital nature of certain of the works financed therefrom.  If we borrowed only that fraction this year it would still leave too great a sum to be found otherwise; for, deducting it and the other borrowings which I have mentioned from the written-down Estimate of Expenditure, we should still be left with a balance of £32,811,000 to be met out of a revenue of only £31,130,000. Some reduction in expenditure is, therefore, unavoidable, and, to be effective for our purpose, it must be secured by administrative action over the balance of the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance has already told the Dáil of the great difficulty which he is experiencing in securing works which, in respect of the requisite labour-content, justify themselves as proper charges on the employment schemes Vote.  Deputies, I am sure, will have noted also that, even so recently as the 24th of last month, a responsible municipal officer publicly stated that the Dublin Corporation was being pressed to carry out schemes under this Vote at a total cost of £100,000, when, in his judgment, only half that sum, or £50,000, could be economically expended within the year upon the particular type of works suggested.  Furthermore, the audited amount expended from this Vote was £1,200,088 in 1937-38, while the total issue for last year was £1,290,088. <Col N="1992" /> Taking all these facts into consideration it has been decided to reduce the Estimate for this service to £1,400,000, thus saving £100,000.  In the exceptional circumstances of the present year, the fraction of the expenditure upon this service to be met out of borrowed money may be raised from one-sixth to one-fourth.  Accordingly, £350,000 out of the £1,400,000 will be borrowed if necessary, but the balance, or £1,050,000, must be provided out of taxation.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for Public Works and Buildings at £1,370,000 is greatly in excess of the actual issues which were made therefor in 1938-39.  After deducting a sum of £39,000 in respect of the borrowed expenditure upon airports and Volunteer halls, the nett issue for this Vote chargeable against revenue in 1938-39 came to £866,000.  The Government has agreed that, while the capital works in connection with defence and the airports are to be pushed ahead, the expenditure upon works chargeable against the revenues for the year must not exceed £850,000. This will enable me to budget for a saving, over and above what might arise from over-estimation, of £100,000 on Vote 11.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately this exhausts our tale of economies, but there are some other matters to be mentioned before proceeding to the <i>denouement.</i>  There has been some agitation about a difference between the law in this country and in Great Britain as to the method of assessing to income-tax the profits derived by a stallion owner from fees charged for the service of mares owned by other persons.  In Great Britain if a stallion is standing on a farm of which its owner is occupier, the profits derived from service fees received in respect of visiting mares are regarded as profits arising from the occupation of the farm and as being therefore covered by the Schedule B assessment on the occupier. In this country it has been decided by the Supreme Court that in such a case the profits in question do not accrue from the occupation of the farm lands charged under Schedule B and that <Col N="1993" /> the stallion owner is carrying on a separate business the profits of which fall to be taxed under Schedule D.  The result of this decision, which in my view is based upon sound principles, is, of course, that a stallion owner here is charged to income-tax on his real income and not on a figure based on the annual value of the lands.  It has been widely contended, however, even in responsible quarters, that the transfer of certain stallions to England, which took place while the British customs duties on horses were in force&mdash;and in fact because of those duties&mdash;was due to this difference between the two countries in the treatment of stallion fees for income-tax purposes.  That contention was never well-founded. The position all along has been that an English stallion owner was, under the double taxation agreement, exempt from our income-tax in respect of profits derived from a stallion which he had standing in this country, whilst an Irish stallion owner was liable to Irish income-tax in accordance with Irish law wherever the stallion stood. The Irish income-tax law on the subject did not therefore provide any incentive whatever for the removal of stallions from this country to Great Britain.</P>
    <P>But it has now been represented to me that, because of the difference in the methods of assessing stallion fees, Irish would-be purchasers attending sales of high-class stallions are placed at a disadvantage as compared with British competitors and that, in consequence, the latter-mentioned can afford to outbid the former.  Those who advance this argument claim that, if the taxation position in Ireland were the same as in England, the high-class stallions needed for this country would be provided by private enterprise.  I must confess to some scepticism in the matter but, since the revenue involved is not large, I am willing to try the effect of the concession.  I propose, therefore, to include in the Finance Bill a clause which will have the effect of providing that, where a stallion is standing on a farm occupied by its owner, who is chargeable under <Col N="1994" /> Schedule B in respect of the profits of such occupation, the service fees received by him in respect of visiting mares shall be deemed to be profits arising from the occupation of the farm.  I estimate that the cost of the concession this year will be about £3,000, and the White Paper Estimate of revenue must be reduced accordingly.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has found it necessary to recommend certain minor changes in existing protective duties, and his proposals will be submitted to the Dáil this afternoon.  If the House accepts them, it will be necessary to further reduce the White Paper Estimate for revenue by £3,000, making it only £31,124,000.  We may concede that at this stage the prospect for the taxpayer is, therefore, not a very pleasing one.  But it would be worse if it were not for the Minister for Local Government who, in consideration of the fact that so large a proportion of the Employment Schemes Vote is spent on road improvements, has agreed to make available for the general purposes of the Budget £150,000 from the Road Fund.</P>
    <P>There is another sum which in our present need may be appropriated for the purpose of this year's Budget.  I have already mentioned that a factor in making-up the deficit last year was the non-payment by certain local authorities of moneys, totalling £68,000, which it was always intended they should pay to the Exchequer under the Unemployment Assistance Acts.  I have also stated that a Bill to clarify the statutory position in this regard, and to provide for the due payment of the sums withheld, will be introduced at an early date.  In the circumstances of the present year, I do not think it would be right to saddle the general body of taxpayers with a burden of £68,000 when that amount, which was withheld to their detriment last year, will be paid over to us in this.  I am, therefore, bringing it in against the year's expenditure.  Doubtless, it may be contended that the amount in question should properly be devoted to reducing the borrowing <Col N="1995" /> occasioned by last year's Budget, and I readily admit the force of that view. If this were a normal year, and these were normal times, when we could afford to draw readily upon our reserve of taxable capacity, I should defer to it.  But as matters stand now, it will be admitted that the public interest will be served the better by not asking for any more in taxation than is found to be unavoidable, and this £68,000 is effective to that end. It must, therefore, be taken.</P>
    <P>The position now is that, by allowing £1,000,000 for over-estimation, by borrowing £2,005,000 for capital purposes, and by cutting down proposed expenditure by £200,000, the prospective charges against revenue are reduced to £32,511,000.  On the other side of the account, after allowing (1) for the diversion of £150,000 of revenue from one form of expenditure to another, (2) for the appropriation this year of £68,000 which we should have got last year and (3) for the tax changes which I have mentioned, we have £31,342,000.  Therefore no less a sum than £1,169,000 has still to be obtained.  It can only be obtained by fresh taxation.</P>
    <P>It is not easy to find £1,169,000 by means which will be economical, convenient, certain and just.  We will agree, I think, that there is no merit in devising new taxes just for the sake of novelty, or as experiments.  New taxes involve new tax-assessing and tax-collecting organisations, new points of administrative difficulty, new opportunities for evasion, new formulæ for estimating&mdash;formulæ which experience either in the shape of a disappointing yield, or of a highly excessive yield, may show to be fallacious.  They are, therefore, likely to cost more to administer than those which have been well-tried and long established, with the result that, while they will take as much from the taxpayer's purse as the older taxes, their nett contribution to meet the cost of the public services will be less.</P>
    <P>New taxes, too, are likely to be much more uncertain, and arbitrary, and inconvenient in the demands which they <Col N="1996" /> make upon individual taxpayers than existing taxes are.  Taxpayers have long experience of the latter.  In so far as the adjective can be applied to the payment of any tax, they are collected at the time and in the manner which renders that distasteful operation as convenient as possible to the taxpayer. Individual taxpayers know that there is nothing uncertain or doubtful about them.  They know when they are to be paid and, of course, what sums must be paid in respect of them.  They cannot, therefore, be easily cheated by interveners between them and the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>How important this can be from the taxpayer's point of view I may bring out by reminding the House of our early experiences with the package tax. In its early stages that was a comparatively simple and modest tax of 2d. per package.  Yet I know that its imposition was made the excuse for increasing the cost of many articles to the consumer, often by three times that amount.  It was a new tax, the incidence and amount of which was not generally known, so that the unfortunate purchaser was at the mercy of the unscrupulous middleman who came between him and the Exchequer.  That sort of thing could not happen in the case of income-tax, or a tax on tea, sugar, tobacco, or even petrol.  The taxpayer in the case of these commodities knows exactly what is the rate of tax, and where it falls, and how much, therefore, he ought to be called upon to pay in respect of it. He may deplore that his money is taken in this way, he may even resent it, but he has the satisfaction of knowing that he is not being cheated.</P>
    <P>Turning now with all this in mind to face our problem, we naturally look to the income-tax as the first source of relief in the present position of the Exchequer.  I am well aware of all that may be said against adding to the existing impositions upon some incomes, how heavily even a small increase in the standard rate will bear upon many households, of the economies in domestic expenditure which in many cases must ensue, even of the effect which an adverse change <Col N="1997" /> may have upon business activity.  But if I fail to get, by means of this progressive tax, a fair and ample contribution to our needs, I must get the equivalent by taxation of a more regressive type, not only from those who now pay income-tax, but from those who constitute the mass of the population and whose cash incomes are even lower.  Moreover, I may recall that while income-tax has been rising elsewhere, it has remained unchanged here since 1934-35 at 4/6.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I propose to increase the standard rate of income-tax here by 1/-, making it 5/6 in the £.  I propose also to increase the allowances in respect of earned income to one-fifth, subject to a maximum allowance of £300, and to reduce the personal allowance to £120 for single persons and £220 for married persons, leaving such other allowances as I have not mentioned unchanged.  As a result of all these changes we ought to get an additional £660,000 this year from income-tax, which is equivalent to £850,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>In regard to sur-tax I propose to increase the existing rates of charge upon all incomes exceeding £3,000, but not exceeding £8,000, by 10 per cent. and on all incomes exceeding the latter figure by 15 per cent.  We may expect £40,000 from this proposal this year and £55,000 in a full year.  The net effect of all the changes in the income tax and sur-tax taken together should be to give us a further £700,000 from these two taxes this year.</P>
    <P>In recent weeks there seems to have been a widespread opinion that the re-imposition of a tax upon all teas was a certainty, and I find that, by a mere coincidence no doubt, the bonded warehouses are virtually empty of that commodity.  I fear there will be no profits for the prophets&mdash;to the taxpayers' relief, the forecast has not come off.  There will be no new tax on tea this year, but there will be an amendment of the law which will enable us to deal more effectively with forestalling.</P>
    <P>Sugar, it might be argued, is in a different category.  While elsewhere <Col N="1998" /> the taxes upon that commodity are fairly high and have recently been increased, our home-produced sugar bears practically no duty.  The considerable revenue which we derived from sugar-consumers last year came mainly from customs duties upon imports.  Indeed, if our present importations were to fall off in any significant degree, we should have to impose heavy additional taxation either upon the home-produced article or upon some other commodities in order to make good the resultant deficiency in the revenue.  On the other hand, even with the present low excise duty, sugar here is as dear as it is in the larger centres in Great Britain or in the Six Counties&mdash;until a few days ago it was, in fact, dearer.  With this in mind, and remembering that it applies to certain other home-produced foodstuffs also, it has been decided to allow the existing duties upon sugar to remain unaltered.</P>
    <P>I cannot do that for petrol, if it be done for sugar.  I am not going to say that a tax on petrol is a luxury tax. In a large number of cases it may be so described; in a greater number, as where the petrol is consumed in vehicles used for the purpose of commerce or public transport, it cannot. Some part of any increase in the existing tax will fall upon the luxury uses of the article, some part will fall upon the necessary uses.  This would apply, however, in a much greater degree to a heavy increase in the tax upon sugar, or even to some increase in the tax thereon, combined with a smaller increase that I am going to propose in the tax upon mineral hydrocarbon oils, light and heavy.  Weighing every consideration, the conclusion has been reached that, in all the circumstances, the customs and excise duties on mineral hydrocarbon oils must be increased as from to-morrow by 2d. per gallon.  The increased duties will give us an additional revenue of £310,000 this year and £350,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>The Budget still requires £159,000, and this I propose to get by making our main rate of customs duty on tobacco approximate more closely to <Col N="1999" /> the average of the existing British main rates, and raising the excise duty on the home-grown article by a like amount, that is to say, by 8d. per lb. in both cases, which ought to give us £170,000.  As in the case of the mineral hydrocarbon oils, the new rates will come into force to-morrow.  It is to be presumed that they will be passed on to the consumer.</P>
    <P>As a result of the several changes which I have mentioned, the estimated revenue for the year will be increased to £32,522,000.  This sum will enable us to meet that portion of our expenditure which must be defrayed out of revenue, and ought to leave a small surplus on the year of £11,000.</P>
    <P>Before I sit down I should perhaps say something about future budgetary prospects.  This year's Budget has been prepared in a time of unusual difficulty.  As the additional taxation, which I have had to impose, makes clear, the present tension in Europe had already cost the Exchequer a very great deal, not only by reason of the greatly increased expenditure which through many channels it has forced upon us, but because of the decline in our revenues, occasioned by the unsatisfactory business and trading conditions it has brought about.  Stringent and straitened as our position is, I believe that we can endure it so long as peace is maintained.  If a widespread war comes, however, our difficulties will be intensified beyond measure.  I speak now only of the reaction of such a disaster upon our finances.  But there I know that with a much diminished <Col N="2000" /> real income, we shall be called upon to shoulder vastly increased public burdens.  Moreover, the problem in that regard will be aggravated by the fact that existing sources of revenue will rapidly dry up.  The stamp duties are a case in point.  And it will no longer be possible to get so large a part of our requirement by customs duties upon imported goods, for we may take it that our imports will be drastically cut down.  We shall have to tax what we can and where we can.  Taxes upon home-produced commodities will, I feel, be greatly increased; as will the standard rates of income-tax and surtax; while all the allowances which at present mitigate the full impact of these latter upon the taxpayer will be drastically reduced.  Our standards of living, our whole mode of existence, our very philosophy of life will be changed radically&mdash;and in my opinion changed eventually for the worse&mdash;by war.  It will bring to the mass of our people, whether we be neutral or belligerent, only increased want, hardship, and insecurity, not merely in that field of affairs which is the particular responsibility of the Minister for Finance, but everywhere.  For that reason we ought to support with all our heart and all our will those whose efforts may defer war and prolong peace.  For the prolongation of peace, even an uneasy and precarious peace, is the one hope we have that next year's Budget will not be even more burdensome to everyone than this year's has had to be.</P>

      <P>I presume that the usual procedure will be followed, that is that brief statements will be made by the leaders of the two Opposition Parties in the House, if they so desire, on the first Resolution. The debate on general financial policy &mdash;taxation and expenditure&mdash;will take place on the last Resolution, which deals with the amendment of the law. That debate will, I presume, be taken to-morrow.  The Minister for Finance might move the first Resolution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain points of similarity, Sir, between the Budget of this year and the Budget of last year and of the year before. Neither last year's Budget, nor the Budget of the year before balanced, and this Budget, drawn or explained as it is by the Minister, will not balance either.  Borrowing money for the purpose of affording employment cannot be defended, and to that extent the £350,000 which the Minister proposes to borrow in respect of the relief of unemployment unbalances his Budget.  Now, the difference between this Budget and the two previous Budgets is this: This Budget proposes to collect from the people £1,000,000 more than was collected last year.  This might be said to be a normal year because no longer have we got the trouble which had been going on for some five or six years with Great Britain, and one would expect, in consequence, some relief to the taxpayers who had borne their share during those five or six difficult years.  However, it appears that the more peace we get the more we are taxed for it, and the Minister, while complaining of the reduction in values and the consequent reduction in income during the past year, has forgotten, apparently, that a very steep rise has taken place in the value of Stock Exchange securities and, consequently, in stamps and so on, since 1932, all of which the Minister has entered into possession of, and spent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, during the course of the statement to which we have just listened reference has been made to the National Debt of this country. Occasionally, one hears, from people speaking at annual demonstrations or disturbances of one kind or another which take place in Dublin during the year&mdash;banquets and so on which the Minister attends&mdash;references to the fact that our National Debt is very light. The Banking Commission did not take that view, and it compares the debt <Col N="2025" /> per head in this country with that of a number of other countries in Europe, somewhat similar or comparable to this country.  In Denmark, with a population of 3,700,000, the debt per head of the population is £16, and the national income is £58 per year. Here, with a population of less than 3,000,000, the debt per head of the population is £24, and the national income, according to the Banking Commission, is under £50 per head.  The whole of the debt of Denmark is off-set by covering assets, and 80 per cent. of the interest charges by investments in capital undertakings.  The major part of the service of the debt of this country is provided from taxes.  Again, Norway has a population within 150,000 of our own. The population is two-thirds rural.  The State debt is £27 per head, almost wholly covered by investments in capital undertakings which provide 90 per cent. of the interest charges, and the national income is approximately £51 per head.  In Sweden, which has twice the population of this country, the State debt is £20 per head, and there are no dead-weight charges for debt as receipts from productive funds more than cover the requirements. State assets considerably exceed the volume of debt and the national income is approximately £70 per head. Austria has disappeared, but, before its disappearance, the State debt was about £21 per head, the population being a little more than twice ours, and a high proportion of the interest charges covered by receipts from productive undertakings.  The combined State debts of Latvia and Lithuania are less than one-tenth of that of this country.  The Banking Commission, commenting on these matters, said that it would be easy to extend these references and that they should negative the contention that this country occupies a relatively favourable position in this matter, and they also said that this country was singular in the rate of increase of its debts, some of these countries having effected decreases in the past five years.  They further stated that this country much exceeds any of the countries mentioned in the amount of its State tax <Col N="2026" /> per head of the population.  This is where we are now.</P>
    <P>If the Minister's doleful references at the end of his statement should happen to materialise, the position would be much worse.  We have very little balance of income in this country upon which to put taxes.  A point comes in connection with taxation at which, when the rate of tax is increased, the revenue from it decreases, I observed during the last few years that those who spend most of their time criticising our neighbours across the water are apt either to quote or to follow the example of these same people when it happens to suit.  Our neighbours have at least a little balance still left to deal with an abnormal situation.  Here, where the national income shows no immediate sign of expansion, we find year after year, increasing taxation, increasing local and national indebtedness.</P>
    <P>When the Minister was introducing his Budget, some seven years ago, he said he was going to tax the rich.  I watched one of these particular taxes with interest during those years.  It was a tax upon a class of people for whom the ordinary citizen has little sympathy, the surtax payer.  The net was widened and people were brought in who formerly were not liable to that tax.  It was assessed on incomes of £1,500 to £2,000 a year and the rate was increased.  Strangely enough, in no year since, has the Minister collected within £150,000 of what was collected in the year before he increased the tax.  A sum of £780,000 was collected in that year and at no time since have we approached anything like that figure.  It is very easy to say: tax the rich, or to say: tax anybody, but it is another thing to get the tax, and in that particular case, by reason of the increase which the Minister with his colleagues and his friends of the Labour Party who applauded him for it imposed, we have lost approximately £250,000 during the past two years and £100,000 or £150,000 in the first two or three years.  Much the same thing may <Col N="2027" /> happen with regard to the present proposals.</P>
    <P>This is meant to be a popular Budget, but it suffers from this defect that, although taxation is being increased to the extent of £1,174,000, it is done at a time when, as the Minister says, there is some uneasiness.  My impression is that the present situation does not call for all that uneasiness and uncertainty.  There are hopeful signs and the situation is not so dangerous as some of those who suffer from political hysteria would have us believe, and it is a time when the people of this country are entitled to get a constructive Budget from the Government. If we are to estimate the value of this Budget on the basis of the tables in the Financial Statement which has been issued, may I direct attention to the last page, in which it is claimed that the agricultural industry in this country is benefiting to the extent of £10,500,000 in this year. Surely somebody suffering from some sort of mania wrote out this particular instrument.  Let us examine two items:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;From <i>ad hoc</i> legislation for the improvement of agriculture.</P>
    <P>Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Acts, 1933 to 1938: wheat scheme:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  Value of estimated increased production of wheat for sale to millers (on basis of Australian wheat price)&mdash;£900,000.</P>
    <P>(b)  Increase in value of (a) through operation of minimum fixed prices (allowing for excess of 2/6 over minimum price per barrel as paid by millers last year) &mdash;£1,000,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Why, the business people of the Cities of Dublin and Cork will be holding up farmers after this Budget is passed, if that be the case.  But a still greater joke than that is the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Pigs and Bacon Acts, 1935 to 1938:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Increase in value of home produced bacon to producers as a result of Prices Orders (abated as to increased cost of foodstuffs), £1,300,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2028" /> The word &ldquo;producers&rdquo; there is ambiguous. I do not know whether it refers to the curers or to the pig raisers, but even if it refers to both, it is typical of this Budget.  In every respect, this provides for a decreasing income for the farmers, for fewer people on the land and for less profits for those on the land.  The same reference can be made to the expenditure under the Land Commission.  We are providing huge sums of money for a falling population. We are expending £600,000 more this year on education for a smaller number of children.  If we concerned ourselves more with the real things that matter to the people, with making the basic industry of the country prosperous, taking from it the enormous costs which are being added to it year after year and which are making it impossible for those engaged in it to have any happiness or prosperity, then we might have some hope for the future of the country.  Until this mania of expenditure has passed, until we come down to earth and realise that the prosperity of this country depends on agriculture, and that we must relieve it and help it, not by figures, but by real work, it is humbug for us to talk about 55 pages of a statement in connection with these matters that are dealt with in a manner designed to show that the agricultural industry is prospering in the country. The Government would be much better engaged in formulating a constructive policy, based upon an increase in profitable agricultural production. That policy would make farming again an attractive livelihood and would ensure much more people being employed and contented on the land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it will be admitted that never was there such a pessimistic tone in the speeches of the Minister for Finance as that we have heard to-day.  I think it will also be admitted that the whole statement is without vision and without hope for the future of the country.  I think it will be further admitted that his last reference on page 54 of the statement could be looked upon as the statement of a gambler.  He appears to have <Col N="2029" /> no hope at all for the future of this country.  The Minister and his Party often refer to the credit of the country.  I do not think the credit of the country will rise very high after the statement just made by the Minister. I can see no hope for the curing of unemployment in that statement, and, as I said before, it shows no vision and no hope of any industrial improvement in the country, and nothing is put forward by the Minister or his Government to show that they realise the position which this country is in at present, in so far as industry and the number of people who are unemployed are concerned.</P>
      <P>It will be noted that during the statement the Minister repeated the statement made by Deputy Flinn, the Parliamentary Secretary, in a debate on unemployment schemes recently, that it is almost impossible at the moment to find schemes in the various areas on which money could be spent. I do not agree at all with that statement. I think that very many schemes, good schemes, can be found in the various localities to enable such money to be spent.  During the course of his statement the Minister also referred to the debts of local authorities. I think the Minister and the Government should be reminded here that in recent years the debts of local authorities have been increased enormously in consequence of Government policy.  Again, I would refer to the Vote for the relief of unemployment. When a grant is given to an area it is mandatory on the council operating in that area that they themselves should put up a certain amount of money.  The previous Government gave certain grants to help the unemployed, and local authorities were never called upon to put up any money to supplement the amount so given.  It may be said, of course, that the amounts given now are greater than those given in the time of the Fine Gael Government, but that does not alter the situation, because the local ratepayers are asked to do something which this Government admitted it was their purpose and their duty to do when they first came into office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under one of the local authorities of <Col N="2030" /> which I am a member it is costing the ratepayers a sum of 2/7 in the £&mdash; money which has been put on definitely in order to augment or supplement grants that have been given under Government policy for the relief of unemployment.  It would be very unpopular&mdash;and something that local authorities could not face&mdash;to refuse to accept some of those grants.  In consequence, local authorities are called upon to supplement them.  Something will have to be done in the very near future to remove this burden.</P>
    <P>Local authorities all over the country, along with the Government, are doing their very best in order to relieve the housing shortage.  That is costing a good deal of money because, even taking into account the Government grant of two-thirds for a house, the rents are too high for the people to pay, and the local authorities are themselves subsidising each house they build.  It will be found that during the past five or six years rates have increased under urban authorities on an average of 3/- or 4/- all over the country and that is a very serious position.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to the statement made by the Minister for Finance when he said he was going to tax the rich.  I would like to congratulate him on this occasion that he has confined himself to the taxing of the rich.  There should be a tax on what might be considered luxuries.  I do not consider tobacco to be a luxury. Many a poor man in receipt of unemployment assistance or with a low rate of wages will find it hard to meet even a small tax on tobacco, and, as the Minister said, it undoubtedly will be passed on to the consumer.  I must say that I did expect that there would have been a tax on the necessaries of the people, owing to the big expenditure contemplated this year for the Army.</P>
    <P>To come back again to the reference of Deputy Cosgrave on the statement made by the Minister for Finance early in his career as Minister that he would tax the rich and relieve the poor and that the Labour Party applauded him for this, we did and will continue to do so, because we maintain that the <Col N="2031" /> rich are not paying their due proportion towards the taxation of this country.  In 1929-30 the total tax revenue was £20,611,000.  After nine years of depression, during the period of the economic war, the tax revenue for 1938-39 was £25,987,000, being an increase of 26.2 per cent.  This is drawn mainly from the poorer classes, from the ordinary man in the street. I take it that 70.5 per cent. is obtained in indirect taxation, that is on food, clothing, household utensils and articles of everyday use.  Our wealthy classes&mdash; or supposedly wealthy classes&mdash;are paying slightly less than 30 per cent. of the nation's taxes, or were doing so up to this year, and the mass of the people are paying 70 per cent.  In England the wealthy classes are paying 53 per cent, as against our 29.5 per cent, and the sum levied on the masses of the people in England is 47 per cent. as against 70.5 per cent. here.</P>
    <P>In the financial year 1926/27 in this country income-tax and surtax yielded £5,063,000; in 1936/37 the yield was £5,284,000&mdash;an increase of 4.3 per cent. A complete census of industrial production was taken in 1926 and again in 1936.  This showed that the net value of output remaining with the employers, after payment of wages, was in 1926 £9,000,000; in 1936 it was £15,000,000&mdash;that is to say, the net profit increased between 1926 and 1936 by £6,000,000, or 66 per cent.  The payments in income-tax in the same period increased by only 4.3 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2032" /> I believe all this goes to show that some relief should be given to the ordinary people and some attention should be paid to people who have gained to such an extent over that period of years.  The Minister has stated to-day that the existing sources of revenue will soon dry up rapidly. As far as that is concerned, I do not know where he is going to get any more taxation from the ordinary people.  He says that the Minister for Industry and Commerce has quite recently made some adjustments in his Department which have taken certain revenue from him.  I suggest that in the case of home-manufactured goods there is a good deal of profiteering going on in a great many cases and the people set up to manufacture goods here are getting a very decent profit by reason of the fact that, in many instances, they are putting on an amount equivalent to the tariff&mdash;or something approaching it, at any rate. The people are being fleeced by this extra imposition, and in that connection I would suggest that the Prices Commission is not moving half swiftly enough.  Attention should be paid to that situation.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I think that the Minister has adopted a very pessimistic tone in introducing this Budget, and if the credit of the country is going to suffer it is by such statements as that made by the Minister before he sat down.</P>

      <P>One would imagine that where the Minister was imposing a poll-tax of £1 7s. 6d. on a definite number of people he would take steps to find out how many people were going to be involved.  He has suggested that the relief he is proposing in respect of earned incomes will, more or less, wipe this imposition out, so far as people with earned incomes are concerned.  Will the Minister give the House one single case, worked out in figures, to substantiate his statement on that point?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  A single man with an income of £150, all earned, is free of tax at the present moment. That position will continue because of <Col N="2038" /> the increase in the earned income relief which is being granted as an offset to the reduction in the personal allowances.  In the case of a married man with an income of £270, all earned, at the present moment his total allowances, including the earned income relief, come to £270.  Under the proposals which I outlined to-day a married man with an income of £275, all earned, will be free of tax for the reason that his total allowances in respect of earned income and personal allowances will come to £275.</P>

    <P>This is the Resolution which gives effect to some of the changes which the Minister for Industry and Commerce proposes with regard to certain effective duties.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certain of these details which are not quite clear. In regard to No. 1, are we to understand that the existing duty of 100 per cent. on cotton threads and linen threads are to be reduced to 40 per cent.?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the best thing to do in connection with these rates is to adopt the course that prevailed in previous years, and to circulate a short memorandum regarding the duties. The result of No. 1 is to exempt from the duty certain classes of ply yarn imported for manufacture into thread. That is the sole effect intended.  I will arrange to circulate a short memorandum setting out in plain language the effect of the duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>While I appreciate what the Minister proposes, there are a couple of points upon which I want information.  For instance, reference No. 6 refers to paper and in the special provisions column the following note appears:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The duty mentioned at this reference number is in addition to and not in substitution for the duty imposed by Section 11 of the Finance Act, 1935 (No. 28 of 1935), and mentioned at reference No. 16 in the Second Schedule to that Act.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>What is the general effect?  Is it an increase in the existing duty?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The change was really made necessary by a desire to prevent a form of evasion which was being adopted with regard to newspaper borders.  They were subject to duty, but by importing two or more on one sheet they escaped paying the full amount.  That is the reason why the change was considered necessary, to ensure that borders, two or more on one sheet would be charged in respect of each form and not in relation to the sheet.  A change has been made, and now the full rate of duty has been imposed.  In other words, a preference rate equivalent to the old flat rate has <Col N="2063" /> been established.  It means that, as far as goods imported are entitled to the preferential rate, there is no change, but in regard to other countries they will have to pay the higher rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not yet understand the general principle.  The Minister spoke about borders of newspapers. That will also affect the wall paper trade, because the note concerning the rate of duty says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whichever of the following rates produces, in respect of each particular article, the greater amount of duty, that is to say:&mdash;75 per cent., or 1d. and 1/2d. the linear yard.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In the special provisions column they proceed to make a difference in what I know has been the view about borders.  What is the effect on ordinary wall paper?  Is the duty increased or diminished?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as ordinary wall paper from the United Kingdom is concerned there is no change.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>The Minister, in the course of his statement to-day, implied that he understood that this increase was going to injure business in a queer kind of way and that it might have a kind of restricting effect on these people who are simply joy-riding around the place.  It is all very well to speak in a general kind of way, but has the Minister considered, in connection with this tax, a detailed question like this: How much is this going to add to the bill that is going to be paid by the ordinary citizens of Dublin who travel in buses and have not cars?  The price for ordinary transport in the City of Dublin is high enough at the moment.  It would be interesting to know how much the increase that is proposed in Resolution No. 6 is going to add to the bill that will have to be footed by these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to dwell on this.  This Resolution is going to result in a tax of 1/8 a day on the average bread-van going through the country.  That means 10/- a week.  Now, that 10/- a week could very well have been given as additional wages to the driver of the van.  It is an interesting reflection, who is going to pay it?  The average person selling bread in rural Ireland, as the Minister for Industry and Commerce knows, is experiencing ferocious competition, a very good thing, which has resulted in the price of bread being brought down to the very lowest farthing that the baker can produce and distribute it for.  They are now going to put 10/- a week on in respect of his travelling vans.  Who is going to pay it?  He cannot, because he is not getting enough out of bread to enable him to pay it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>These are all very interesting reflections, but if Deputy Dillon would only reflect, when he is demanding heavily-increased expenditure, that somebody will have to pay for what he is asking, perhaps we could not have these reflections to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon is prone to forget that this country was ever capable of producing such hopeless incompetents <Col N="2070" /> as disfigure the Government Bench at the present time, and he had hoped that the 700 years' struggle for freedom would not adorn the Government of this country with the deplorable fiascoes that we have at the present time as Ministers of State. So, from time to time, he points out to the Government how the resources of the nation might be mobilised to the best advantage of our people, never despairing that some day sense would penetrate the darkness where some light has found its way in the last six years and where there was no vestige of illumination at all six years ago when the present Government clambered into office.</P>

      <P>It might easily be done if you, Sir, were any way soft, and it would be the Minister for Finance who would be responsible for it.  The Minister, apparently, is not prepared to answer the type of question I put him first about the effect of this tax on transport in the City of Dublin.  I would like to put him the question in the form in which Deputy Dillon put his.  Who, in the City of Dublin, is going to pay the increased cost?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night, before <Col N="2085" /> reporting progress, I was referring to the question of credit facilities for farmers, who at the moment find themselves in the position of not being able to carry on their agricultural economy as they had been accustomed to carry it on in previous years.  I also stated that possibly the giving of loans was not the best way of helping the farmers, but owing to the very serious times through which they have passed I think there is a large number of farmers in every county who find themselves in need of having credit facilities placed at their disposal.  I happen to represent a county where mixed farming is extensively carried on, and where the farmers as a rule were able to make ends meet without any assistance from Government Departments, but recently I came in contact with many farmers who, through no fault of their own; find themselves very much handicapped through lack of capital.  I refer now to the type of farmer who went in extensively for the rearing of cattle during those six years of the economic war, and suffered very great financial losses as a result of having to sell those cattle at prices which did not pay. That is the position at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point I should like to bring before the Minister, and I think it is a most important point in connection with the position of agriculture at the moment, is that the farmer cannot buy as he sells.  If the farmer could buy as he sells, then at one stroke the chief difficulty in regard to the farmers' position at the moment would be settled.  Everybody who has studied the question knows that some 30 or 40 years ago the farmer&mdash;the small farmer in particular&mdash;brought in his load of potatoes to the nearest market town. That load might consist of ten cwts. or it might consist of only six.  He sold his potatoes at that particular period at an average price of 2/6 or 3/- per cwt.  If he had ten cwts. he got about 30/-.  The point I want to bring to the notice of the Minister is that when they got that 30/&mdash;most of them being married men with families, some of them with very large families&mdash;they went into the shopkeeper, and out of <Col N="2086" /> that 30/- were able to buy three or four pairs of shoes for their little children; they could go into the grocer's shop and buy groceries, and would have something left out of that 30/-.  To-day that same farmer, if he is alive, or a farmer placed in the same circumstances, taking in the same amount of agricultural produce as represented by potatoes, gets about the same price.  This year the price has undoubtedly gone up, owing to the fact that the winter was severe and there was a scarcity of potatoes, but if you take the average price for the last seven or eight years you will find there is very little difference between that price and the price which obtained 30 or 40 years ago.  In the natural order, the farmer again goes into the shopkeeper to make certain purchases.  Let us again assume that he goes in to buy a few pairs of shoes for his children.  How many pairs will he be able to buy at the present high price as compared with 30 or 40 years ago? How many pairs can be pay for out of the 30/-?  If he wants to buy a half cwt. or a cwt. of flour, what price will he have to pay to-day as compared with the price during those years?  In the same way, if he wants a little suit of clothes, or anything in the way of wearing apparel for any member of his family, he finds he has to pay anything from 70 to 100 per cent. over and above what he paid during those years.  That is the real difficulty confronting the farmers, both large and small and, incidentally, to the same extent the agricultural labourers of this country, namely that, for the money which they have to spend to-day, they cannot get the same amount as they could get some years ago.</P>
    <P>I readily concede the point that this is a very difficult matter, but I consider that it is the duty of the Minister as representing the agricultural community of this country to keep a very close watch over the activities of the Ministers who are entrusted with the destines of the other Departments, particularly the Department of Industry and Commerce.  I am one of those who have been connected with the Labour movement for a very large <Col N="2087" /> number of years.  I am one of those who have always believed in giving a man a fair day's wages for a fair day's work, but I have also had the commonsense to know that I never could support a policy the object of which was to make the position of people who are comfortable more comfortable, and to make the position of people who are uncomfortable more uncomfortable.  There should be some sense of relativity as between the activities of the various Departments. While people may laugh and joke at the expense of the farmer, and say he is always crying, we must remember that after all the rural population in this or in any country is the foundation on which the security of the country rests.  For that reason, I think it is the duty of the Minister, backed up by the members of the Government, and, in fact, by the members of all Parties, to do something to make the lot of those who are engaged in agriculture more comfortable than it is at the present time.</P>
    <P>Again, we come to the question of the employment provided by agriculture at the moment.  At the opening of my remarks last night I referred to the growing of wheat and I questioned whether the introduction of the wheat scheme had provided any extra employment.  As I stated then, and as I have since verified, one of the Ministers on the Front Bench stated that the growing of wheat would provide employment for an extra 30,000 or 40,000 labourers.  He went on the basis that every 20 acres of wheat cultivated would mean the employment of an extra man.  He estimated that it would take 800,000 acres of wheat to supply the flour needs of the country. Assuming that each 20 acres sown represented employment for one man, if 800,000 acres were sown, employment would be provided for an extra 40,000 men.  Using my powers of observation, and I read at one time that observation is the best form of education, and from inquiries I have made I find that employment on the land&mdash;and I am now referring to land even in counties where wheat has been grown <Col N="2088" /> extensively &mdash; is unfortunately decreasing instead of increasing.  There again, in my humble opinion, I think it is the Minister's duty to find out the cause.  I think you can trace the cause back to the one fundamental fact that the farmer is not able to buy as he sells.</P>
    <P>A farmer who employs three or four labourers is expected to pay each of these labourers 27/- per week.  I am sure everybody will agree that that is not an exorbitant wage for an agricultural labourer who has to provide for himself, a wife and his family.  But to pay even that wage of 27/-, week in, week out, for the 52 weeks of the year, on a farm takes some doing.  The price which the farmer is getting for his produce is not sufficient to enable the farmer to keep these labourers in continuous employment.  Consequently we have in this country a position vastly different from that of some years back, which was referred to by Deputy Ryan.  At that time, when the farmer engaged his labourer he engaged him for 12 months, but in recent years he just engages him for the putting in of the crop and the taking out of the crop.  In that way, he is only providing casual employment for agricultural labourers. Deputy Ryan had apparently at the back of his mind an idea that the farmers were not as keen workers as long ago, but he forgot to tell the House the reason for that, that the farmer is not in a position to pay the wages to-day, small as they are.  At the time to which he referred the farm labourer's wages were only 8/- or 9/- a week.  There is a big difference between employing four labourers at 9/- a week, which totals less than £2 per week and employing four labourers at 27/- a week, which works out at £5 8/- per week.  The farmer would need to be something of a philanthropist to provide the same employment now.  Deputy Ryan was unconsciously making a case against his own Government. He was proving up to the hilt that farmers who employ labourers are not in a position to keep these labourers employed for the 52 weeks of the year as they were some 20 or 30 years ago.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2089" /> Of course Deputy Ryan had to get some scapegoat and he alleged that cattle dealers during the economic war formed a ring.  It is nonsense for a man of Deputy Ryan's experience to speak in that strain about cattle dealers.  Everybody knows that cattle dealers at that period could not give a price for cattle because of the fact that they had to pay £6 per head to the British Government before they were allowed to ship any cattle to the British market.  If there was any ring, it consisted of those trick-of-the-loop supporters of the Government who saw a chance of making money by getting licences at that period to export cattle and who took away from genuine cattle dealers an occupation which they had followed by tradition for years.  Anybody who knows anything about the conditions obtaining in the cattle industry at that time knows that all along the Border certain men who could never buy a goat previously, were given licences by the Government and before the economic war ended they were semi-millionaires.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ryan alleged that these cattle dealers had formed a ring.  I know that the farmers of the country would be very happy indeed if they had these cattle dealers going to their homes to-day as they did in the old days.  Not alone the cattle dealers, but the pig dealers also visited the homes of the farmers, made their bargains there and put money into the hands of the farmers there and then.  That was a practice that lasted over 40 years.  People were far happier then than they are to-day. Conditions are such to-day that, to all intents and purposes, large numbers of our people must depend on casual employment for a living.  In my opinion the policy of the Government in regard to the centralisation of many of the services that were not centralised some years ago, has been the means of putting thousands out of employment during the last three or four years.  I refer specially to the fairs and pork markets that were formerly held in all the little towns along the <Col N="2090" /> Border.  Thousands of people made a living out of these fairs and markets. It is not for me to say exactly how they earned that money but they were able to rear large families in fairly comfortable circumstances to my own knowledge.  All that trade has died away to-day and there is nothing to replace it.</P>
      <P>That is why you have a situation to-day in which so many are flying from the land.  That is not to be wondered at.  Any young man with spunk in him will not go on living under conditions in which he can only earn from £1 to 27/- per week while he sees another young man of the same age getting 50/- or £3 a week in the neighbouring town. I do not grudge these young men in the town what they earn, but how can you expect a young man in the country to remain on a farm and to do the very heavy work involved in agricultural operations, when the recompense is so small as compared with the wages of the town worker?  In my opinion the greatest tradesman in the country is the good all-round agricultural labourer. He can take a hand at anything and he is worth any amount of money.  That man is condemned to work for £1 or 27/- per week, and to expect him to compete and to buy in the same shops with the man in the town who has an average of £3 a week, is to expect the impossible.  That is the position that faces the Minister and the Government at present.  That is the position that is going to face any future Government that may succeed the present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not here to blame the Minister for everything.  I am only pointing out that much of the legislation passed in this country has brought about the state of affairs to which I have referred to-day.  It is my opinion that until the farming community can be placed on a sound basis, that is those farmers who are anxious and willing to work and to rear their families in comfort&mdash; I know that there are exceptions amongst the agricultural community as in every other section of the community, the sort of man who finds it difficult to get on under any circumstances&mdash;we can expect very little improvement <Col N="2091" /> in rural conditions.  I am contrasting the state of affairs which exists in rural parts of the country with that which exists in our towns and cities, and I suggest that some effort will have to be made to bring about a closer relationship between the purchasing power of the two sections. There will have to be a much greater sense of proportion shown in our dealings with them.  That is the business of the Government in my opinion.  I am not saying these things by way of criticism.  I say them because I am honestly convinced that the position of the people who earn their living on the land at the moment is not a very happy one.  Everybody knows the quotation:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A bold peasantry, their country's pride,</P>
    <P>When once destroyed can never be supplied.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There are thousands of young men leaving the land every year and, God knows, how many more thousands would leave if they could get to America.  If the emigration laws were the same as they were 15 or 20 years ago, our population would be very much further decreased.  I remember distinctly the Taoiseach, when he was in Opposition, saying in this House on one occasion that there was no reason why this country could not support a population of 15,000,000.  I am afraid it will be some centuries before that happy state of affairs will come into existence at the rate of progress we are making.  That is the position, and, as I say, it does not give me very much satisfaction to bring it to the notice of the Minister.  But, representing a country where many of the people live out of farming, it is my duty to bring it to the attention of the Minister so that he will know the real state of affairs.  So much has been said on this Vote that I am not going to go over the same ground again.  We all know that it is a very important Vote, and anything we say here is by way of help rather than by way of criticism, up to a point anyway.  I hope and trust the Minister will see his way to do something to improve the position of the farmers all over the country.</P>
    <Col N="2092" />
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>From the discussion on this Estimate it would appear to be the general opinion that the agricultural population and their means of income are rapidly disappearing.  It is not necessary for me to refer to a number of matters which have been mentioned, but I should like to deal with one item which does not seem to have been brought to the attention of the Minister and which is a very profitable item of production.  I refer to egg production, which I hold is of great importance.  If egg production disappears it will be a serious matter for the small farmers concerned.  In 1930 our export of eggs to the British market was something like 4,735,000 hundreds.  In 1937 the export had gone down by nearly half, to 2,458,000 hundreds.  That is a very serious decline in seven years.  As a matter of fact, the money value went down from something over £3,000,000 to about £1,000,000.  That was very big loss to these small farmers of from £1 to £5 valuation.  These are the people who produce eggs and who are suffering a great loss at present by not being in a position to produce them.  During the same period Denmark and Holland doubled their export of eggs to the British market, while our export was halved.  As I have said, that is a very serious matter and the Minister will have to do something to change the conditions with regard to the production of eggs.  I believe that the position in 1938 was even worse and that the position in 1939 will be even worse than it was in 1938.  I am not speaking from figures but from information got from people who are in the egg trade when I say that I believe the export of eggs in March this year was the lowest for the last ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the decrease in production, the production of third quality eggs has increased.  I have been informed on good authority that second quality eggs represent nearly 20 per cent. of the total production at present.  That is a serious position, because second quality eggs, while they are allowed to be exported, are not recommended for export.  If they are exported, they have a serious effect on the quality of Irish eggs in the British market.  But these eggs are <Col N="2093" /> there and they have to be sold and exported.  When these eggs are exported they are sold at 3/-, 4/- or 5/- per hundred less than specials or other first quality eggs.  Therefore, I think it is up to the Minister to see what can be done to improve that position.  I believe that something can be done.  If the Minister would provide £50,000, spread over a period of two years, it would be money well spent, if we could bring the export value of our eggs from £1,000,000 up to £3,000,000 per year, or perhaps £4,000,000.  I believe that some of that £50,000 would be well spent on evening classes or some other classes in the different parishes at which the exporters would attend and explain to the producers the necessity of having their eggs sent in proper condition for export.  There could be a register kept of exporters and producers who attended, and if the producers were not prepared to put their eggs on the market in proper condition they would be much better out of the trade rather than be producing eggs of second quality and destroying the market for the producers of first quality eggs who take an interest in having their eggs in a fit condition.  I believe also that a lot could be done by advertising our eggs, bacon and fowl in England, and I hold that £50,000 would do a lot in that way.  We have new legislation in force now which is serious as far as eggs are concerned, considering the quantity of second and third quality eggs on the market.  The better quality eggs are bound to suffer by the marketing of eggs of an inferior quality, because when eggs are bought at a flat rate through the country they have to be bought at a price which will meet the loss that is going to be sustained on the inferior quality eggs</P>
    <P>The matter of day-old chicks has been mentioned by some Deputies.  I agree that that method would be a useful way of improving the production of eggs.  At the same time, I think that the production of these chicks will not improve the production of eggs in this country unless something is done to improve the housing accommodation of fowl.  I think that the most important thing in connection <Col N="2094" /> with this matter is the provision of proper housing accommodation for fowl.  Every Deputy here knows that fowl are allowed to wander around the farmers' houses, and no attention is paid to the fowl in the winter at all, with the result that they are not fed properly or heated properly during the winter months, a period in which eggs would be most profitable if proper accommodation were provided.  It is my opinion that the people concerned are not in a position to undergo the cost of providing new housing accommodation themselves, and I suggest to the Minister that grants in a big way should be provided for the farmers to meet, this matter, or, if not grants, at least loans to meet the cost, or even a part of the cost, of providing proper housing accommodation.  If that were so, and if proper accommodation were provided, the fowl would be warm during the winter months, and I think I can go further and say that if proper accommodation were provided, the farmers would not see these fowlhouses empty; they would make it their business to have fowl in these houses.  I think it has certainly never been known in this country that if proper fowlhouses were there the farmers would not see that they were filled.  As I say, the fowl would be properly housed and kept warm during the winter, and that would mean that you would have increased egg production during the winter months instead of as at present when there is a scarcity of eggs in this country during the winter months.  As a matter of fact, in some of the small towns in this country it is nearly impossible to get an egg during the winter.  Even to-day our eggs, as compared with the price in Northern Ireland, fetch a smaller price, although they are the same quality eggs, the same grade, and so on.  I would go so far as to say that our eggs are of a better quality, and yet our eggs, as compared with Northern Ireland, fetch from 1/- to 1/6 per hundred less on the British market.</P>

      <P>At any rate, whatever may be the cause, our eggs are less in value than those of Northern Ireland by 1/-, and at other times there was a difference of 1/3 and even 1/6.  I think that the biggest difference was 1/6. Now, it seems to me that there is no reason why our eggs should be 1/6 less than those of Northern Ireland.  We have the same grade and exactly the same weight per egg, and our eggs are at least of as good quality and, in my opinion, better quality, and yet our eggs fetch 1/6 less on the British market.  That, of course, means a lot to the farmers of this country.  It would mean a difference of about 6/- a week to some of the farmers in the matter of eggs alone, and that is a considerable item.  With regard to the matter of the stamping of eggs, that may have something to do with it, but apart from that I think that if the matter were taken up properly and if our Department were to spend money on advertising Irish eggs we might succeed in making the stamped egg more valuable than an unstamped egg, because the stamp would be a guarantee of security as far as our eggs are concerned.  It might improve the position if money were to be spent in that way in order to prove that the stamped egg was better than the unstamped egg.  At any rate, I certainly would recommend to the Minister that he should make a special effort to do something to revive the egg industry in this country.  If he does not revive that industry inside this year, or certainly within the next year at the latest, my opinion is that that industry will die out, and that would be a very serious loss to this country.  I know that the Minister would be very sorry to see that industry dying out, but certainly there is something wrong with the industry, and something must be done or the <Col N="2096" /> industry will go out of existence entirely, and it will cost much more to bring it back than it will cost now to revive or preserve it.  Now is the time to do that.  That is all I have to say with regard to the egg industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is the question of bacon. Let us take the price of Irish bacon to-day on the English market.  We have the best bacon on the British market, but where do we stand with regard to price?  We only stand in the third place and, as a matter of fact, we are only running a race to see if we do not stand in the fifth place. Danish bacon, according to to-day's paper, is 84/- to 93/-; Swedish bacon, 76/- to 82/-; Dutch bacon, 76/- to 86/-; Polish bacon, 72/- to 81/-; and Irish bacon, 79/- to 83/- per cwt.  We are looking for a bacon trade in this country and for the production of pigs, and hoping to do everything to promote the bacon industry in this country, but that is how we stand with regard to the prices of our bacon on the British market, although our bacon is of the very best quality.  That is not all of it.  If we take legislation into account, with regard to the hypothetical level and so on, we find that Irish bacon is cheaper on the British market than it is on our own market, and the public here are complaining about the difference in price.  In every shop that you go into you see what the price of Irish bacon is here, then you read about what the price of Irish bacon is on the British market, and the public are asking why there should be that difference.  Shopkeepers are being asked continually how it is that the price of bacon should be so high here as compared with the price of Irish bacon in Great Britain.  If you go into a shop here you will pay 1/6, 1/8 and even 1/9 for your 1b. of rashers, and the public, naturally, compares that with 83/- a cwt. for Irish bacon on the British market, or 8½d. a lb., and they want to know why there should be that difference.  If you get a quotation to-day for bacon here, that quotation is anything from 130/- to 150/- a cwt.  The public are asking, where does that difference come <Col N="2097" /> in?  I think it is too bad that the poor consumers in this country should have to pay in order to provide for cheaper bacon for the British consumers.</P>
    <P>Now, with regard to pig feeding, during the months of May, June and July we have a shortage of pigs and, as a matter of fact, have to import pigs into this country.  I think that something should be done to remedy that, and to tempt the producers here at home to produce pigs in May, June and July.  These are the three months of the year when it is expensive to rear pigs because there are not the same means of providing cheap feeding stuffs as at other periods of the year. I quite understand that it is a hard thing to raise or lower prices suddenly, but I think that the Minister should consider the giving of a subsidy on bacon pigs during the months of May, June and July, and that, if he is prepared to give such a subsidy, the farmers should be made aware of it in time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister tried to, but the curers put it in their pockets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBrowne" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>If the farmers knew that this subsidy was to be given in the months of May, June and July, a number of farmers who otherwise would be willing to sell their small pigs for the porker trade in February and March would hold them over for the months of May, June and July.  If a subsidy of even 10/- a cwt. were to be given for the months of May, June and July, the farmers would hold over their pigs for these months, and that would mean that it would be possible to reduce the excess production of pigs in October and November.  These are two items of which I desired to speak. I felt that eggs had been neglected by every Deputy, with the exception of Deputy Cosgrave, and nobody seemed to realise the condition of that industry. I ask the Minister to make a special effort to get the Department to work so that the egg industry will be put at least into the position in which it was ten years ago.  There is no reason why it should not be put in the position in which it was in 1928, or even in 1924, when the first Eggs Act <Col N="2098" /> came in.  If we compare our export of eggs in the years 1924, 1925 and 1926 with our export in 1938, every Deputy will be satisfied that something must be done for the industry.  I hope the Minister will give these matters consideration during the coming year. Egg production for this year is practically at an end, but I urge him to prepare some scheme for putting into operation in November, so that we may be ready for the months of January, February and March, when we will have a supply of eggs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJRogers" hpid="Mr. Rogers Mr. Rogers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rogers</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we have reached a point at which the Minister should come to the assistance of the farmers. During the years of the economic war the farmer sold his stock for absolutely nothing and was unable to restock his lands.  Through no fault of his own, he has gone down, and I am sorry to say that the Fianna Fáil Government was responsible for it.  He sold his stock at bad prices to pay his land annuities, his rates and his shopkeepers, and was then unable to restock his land.  I listened to Deputy Esmonde last night fearlessly and ably telling the Minister that his colleagues, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Defence, have only to come in here and ask for money and their requests are granted, but the Minister for Agriculture, who represents the backbone of the country, the farming community, has not tried to do a single thing for the farmers.  It is up to him, and to him only, to get the farmers out of the plight in which they are to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that the farmers of this country always paid their debts honestly if they had the means, but to-day they are unable to pay.  I have made a track over to the Land Commission with appeals from decent farmers in County Sligo for time in connection with the payment of their land annuities.  Men who were always well able to pay their way are to-day unable to pay.  They are unable to pay their land annuities or their rates, so that it is up to the Minister to do something for them.  We hear a lot about the factories and large amounts of money were put up to keep factories <Col N="2099" /> going, but there is one factory in this country, the homestead of the farmer, the cowshed, the stable and the piggery, which must get consideration. That is the industry on the land to-day, and in a native Parliament the farmers are the first men who should be considered, because it was the farmers' sons who went out when men were wanted and won a native Parliament for this country.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies have mentioned pig production.  In County Sligo, pig production has declined and many farmers have gone out of sows for the reason that feeding-stuffs are too dear, and they are unable to produce bacon at the present cost of feeding-stuffs.  I also ask the Minister to consider whether it is possible to do something for farmers who are breeding shorthorn heifers.  Perhaps they intend to keep that heifer for a cow on their own land, but they may have to pay rates and land annuities and shop debts, and I suggest that the Minister should give a bounty to those farmers who go in for shorthorn heifers, and so retain them on the land.  We have in County Sligo one of the best cattle-breeding districts in the Twenty-Six Counties, but for the last year our store cattle have declined, owing to too many crosses with the Polled-Angus.  I ask the Minister to consider that matter. There are also in County Sligo very good brood mares, bred of Irish draught stallions, and I would ask the Minister to consider giving a thoroughbred horse to the county.  By doing so, I believe we would get far better horses than we have at present. Finally, I appeal to the Minister to do a little for the one section which is the backbone of the country, the farming community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that Deputy Coburn and Deputy Browne, in dealing with the question of bacon and eggs, dealt with matters which affect the agricultural community in a very grave way.  So far as the bacon industry is concerned, everyone must admit that production has decreased, but the operation of Government policy <Col N="2100" /> has injured the entire agricultural community and the people who, to a certain extent, make their living out of the land in another way, because, owing to the operation of the present policy with regard to the sale of pigs, the monthly markets held in the various country towns have dwindled to practically nothing, and a number of people who made a comparatively good livelihood out of that business have lost it.  On the question of eggs, I want to put this point: The worst effect, to my mind, of the drop in egg production is the loss of ready money going into the smaller houses.  There was a period when, in the small farmers' and labourers' houses, the money made from the sale of eggs at the weekly market in the towns provided the necessaries of life for those householders.  That is one of the most serious features of the decline&mdash;that the actual ready-cash income of those people during the week, and mainly people in a very poor way, has been lost.  The reason, to my mind, is the cost of feeding-stuffs and the fact that people did not regard the cereal admixture as a good feeding-stuff for poultry production caused many of the smaller people to drop entirely out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is completely unfair from the point of view, either of pig production or poultry production, that the people here should be competing with their neighbours in the Six Counties on terms which are disadvantageous to us. Is it not a fact that, within the past month, bacon was imported into this country; that sufficient was not produced to meet even the home demand, and the fact that bacon could be produced by our Northern competitors on far more advantageous terms to them than obtain here was simply due to the fact that the price of maize was lower in the North.  There was an attempt by some of the Government Deputies to make a justification of the Government policy, and their reason for the flight from the land, for the lack of inclination to work on the land, was not that the work on the land is badly paid, not that it does not give sufficiently remunerative employment, but that work elsewhere is more attractive. That is a rather peculiar statement. <Col N="2101" /> If everybody in this country&mdash; whether in professions, in business, or on the land&mdash;suddenly discovered that the particular work they were doing here was being paid better in some other country you would expect everybody to emigrate.  It is perfectly well known that the reason for emigration is not that the terms of employment are more advantageous in England or anywhere else, but that the young people do not see any future for themselves on the land.  They are leaving the country simply and solely because they are not satisfied to remain on the land, where they would never be able to make a living and support families in the manner in which they should be supported.</P>
    <P>That will affect the population and the agricultural industry in two ways: Firstly, through people leaving the country, there is a drop in the marriage rate.  People are not inclined to get married, as they are not satisfied that they could make a decent living on the land.  The old people are remaining in legal ownership of the farms until they are nearly in the grave and then the sons and daughters are almost too old to get married. Neither they nor their families think it wise to settle down on the land.</P>
    <P>As far as the beet and wheat schemes are concerned, they are no justification for the entire Government policy. They may be all right in their own way and in their own place.  As far as my portion of the country&mdash;North Cork&mdash; is concerned, I do not think that wheat or beet would ever solve the problem there, because the bulk of the farmers are small farmers and the land does not lend itself to beet or wheat growing. In the second instance, and I am sure that Deputy Corry will agree with me, one of the great troubles is the labour question.  It is hard to get labour&mdash;particularly casual labour&mdash; for beet tillage.  It is extremely hard to get workers in the winter months. The average farm worker would rather do anything than pull beet in the winter months.  When servant boys offer themselves for hiring at the beginning of the year, and are making their bargain&mdash;which does not happen <Col N="2102" /> so often now under the Agricultural Wages Board, though it does in some areas like my own, where we are paying more than the Agricultural Wages Board rate&mdash;one of the questions is: &ldquo;Is there any beet?&rdquo;  and if there is the hiring price goes up.</P>
    <P>I doubt if Deputy Corry will deny that one of the things that militate against beet is the lack of inclination on the part of labourers to deal with that crop, and it is hard to blame them.  I do not believe there is a harder job to be found than that of working in a beet field on a frosty morning in the winter time after two weeks' rain.  One of the things I would suggest in order to help the agricultural industry is that, in areas where there are a number of unemployed who are capable of doing normal farm work and are on the unemployment register or in receipt of unemployment assistance, and where there are farmers anxious to get labour but are not in a position to pay the legal rate of wages, though they may be in a position to pay one man the full legal wage and a second man a lower figure, one solution to the problem would be to make up the difference between the amount of unemployment assistance being paid to the labourer and the wage that he ought to get from the farmer.  It should be possible to provide a subsidy for that.</P>

In introducing the Vote he said: &ldquo;I do not know if I can say very much on the general question,&rdquo; and then he referred practically every question back to the Agricultural Commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will quote the Minister:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I do not know if I can say very much on the general question.  I do believe that very much can be done apart from legislation, and Deputies will agree that very much must be done for agriculture in general.

As Deputies are aware, the commission was set up practically with the terms of reference to consider increased production.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister drew me that time.  The Minister said a lot should be done for agriculture, and when he is winding up the debate he will probably say that everybody has said that a lot should be done for agriculture; but the Minister is the person in charge of the agricultural policy of this Government, and he has not suggested anything that could be done to improve the position of the agricultural community.  He has not stated whether an attempt will be made to increase production and if an attempt will be made to increase the production of bacon, eggs, and so on; he has not said what would be done to arrange for the proper marketing of those commodities.</P>
      <P>I would like to put another point to the Minister&mdash;a point to which he may be able to reply.  There is a complaint in certain areas where the Dairy Disposal Company is operating a number of creameries that the prices paid by that company do not compare favourably with the other co-operative creameries in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The other complaint is often made, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely that the other complaint is often made, that the Dairy Disposal Company in certain cases may pay better than the other co-operative creameries, but the point I make is that the Dairy Disposal Company is being operated under subsidies obtained from the Government and, therefore, there should be no complaint about that company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They try to pay the same price as is paid by the other co-operative creameries, but we get complaints that sometimes they are paying too much and sometimes not enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, but I do not think for a moment you could justify <Col N="2105" /> the position in an area like North Cork, where you have 20 or 30 creameries spread over a small area, that the Dairy Disposal Company, operating nine creameries together, would not be able to compete with individual co-operative societies if it were properly run&mdash;and, in case the Minister might think so, I am not referring to the Rathmore group.</P>
      <P>There is just one other point.  In a considerable proportion of the constituency I represent, terrific damage is being done by the rabbit pest. Nothing that has been tried, as far as I know, from trapping to the famous gas attack that was tried a few years ago, drowning, etc., has had any effect.  There are some small farmers on the hillsides there whose farms have been absolutely ravaged, who have scarcely a field that is worth calling an arable field.  It is very hard to find a solution.  As far as I can judge, the more rabbits that are killed the faster they seem to multiply.  It is a position that is rapidly becoming alarming in a number of areas.  Whether the Minister has any effective solution in his mind or not I do not know, but I would suggest to him that it is a thing worth looking into.  Considerable damage is being done and some farmers have been absolutely ruined in a number of areas in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other point, in conclusion, on the question of agricultural education.  There was a suggestion made here that the Press, radio and other organs of propaganda should be utilised to carry out a campaign of agricultural education.  That sounds very well.  If somebody in the United States, or in Czecho-Slovakia, or anywhere else, read that it was suggested in Dáil Eireann that a campaign of agricultural education was to be carried out by radio they would say that this must be the most prosperous country in the world because, otherwise, we would not waste money putting agricultural lessons on the radio when the farmers had no wireless sets.  The position at the moment is that it would be very little use wasting time on radio lessons when most of the farmers have not wireless sets and the <Col N="2106" /> farmers who are able to buy cheap wireless sets&mdash;who may be buying them on the instalment system&mdash;will want to get something to cheer them up and make them forget the sufferings under which they are labouring owing to the policy of the present Minister for Agriculture, rather than lessons teaching them how to do their own business which, I suggest, they were always pretty well capable of doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not delay the House very long, but I would like to ask the Minister has he had any complaint from farmers to the effect that, when they bring pigs to a factory, the factory will tell them they cannot take any pigs that day, and when they take the pigs just outside the factory, a pig buyer will take them.  The pig buyer then takes the pigs into the same factory an hour later, and the factory will take them from him.  I have had complaints from people living within the suburbs of Cork that that has happened.  It is causing great hardship to the farmers, because they cannot take the pigs home, without greatly depreciating their value.  I understand that the position is that those factories have a pig buyer or two who supply them with their requirements, and when certain pig producers bring in their lorry load of pigs to the factory the practice that I have described takes place, resulting in great hardship to the farmers.  Some farmers co-operate and bring all their pigs in on one lorry and when they come to the factory they are told they cannot be taken.  I have been told that that took place no later than last week.</P>
      <P>I have been listening to many speeches about increasing production on farms.  I remember reading a statement of the Minister himself during the economic war that there was too much production of eggs in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>As coming from the city, some might think it rather strange to hear me talk about farming, but I know that if the farmer is not prosperous the city also suffers to a considerable extent because, after all, the farmers are consumers as well as producers. If they are not prosperous that fact is reflected in the shops and everywhere else.</P>
      <P>A good deal has been said about the education of small farmers throughout the country.  I would like to point out that, when I was working on a farm, which is nearly 23 years ago, I found that the greatest education in the country-side was given by agricultural instructors from the Department, who came down to particular farms, took a strip of land, and demonstrated the growing of certain seeds and the use of certain manures.  Farmers' sons in the locality came to see for themselves how the thing was done.  I think that practical demonstration of that kind is the best means of imparting the necessary agricultural education to farmers' sons.  If anybody went to the trouble of visiting the agricultural stalls at the Spring Show last week, he would have noticed young boys studying very seriously everything pertaining to the work of the farm.  I believe practical demonstration is far more important than leaflets or lectures, radio, or anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to say that, as far as the bacon industry is concerned, and as far as the flour industry is concerned, I do not think enough can be said about the inactivity of the Government in dealing with that problem in time.  I remember that during the economic war everybody was <Col N="2108" /> suffering.  Not only the farmers, but a good percentage of the unfortunate workers were suffering.  I refer to the dockers.  They were hard hit by the economic war.  These unfortunate men sometimes had to be called up at six o'clock at night to do four hours' work and because they were signing on at the labour exchange during the day they were summoned and fined severely because they drew a paltry 2/6 a day although they were working for four hours.  I want to say to Deputy Dillon or anybody else that whatever stand the Labour Party took at that time to fight the economic war, they would take again, but we do expect that, in fighting a war of that kind, people like the bacon curers and the flour millers should not be able to get away with excess profits without any punishment whatever.  I think it is most unfair that they should do so and a very poor appreciation of the poorer section of the community who took part in that war.</P>
    <P>I would point out to the Minister that there is one branch of the agricultural community that is of great importance, that is, the egg and poultry business.  I notice that £600,000 is being given to the tourist industry this year, but I think the egg and poultry industry is of far greater importance.  I would seriously suggest that if there is anything necessary for the farming community, especially among the smaller farmers and the agricultural labourers, it is accommodation for the rearing of poultry.</P>
    <P>I think the matters to which I have referred are far more important than finding fault with the economic war, because the economic war is past, and we should concentrate our minds on what we should do in the future.  I would emphasise again that, as far as my experience goes, demonstration on the farm is far more important and more effective than anything else we could do to educate the farmers.</P>

      <P>We have spent 20 hours on this Estimate, and I cannot say that I am very edified by any speech I heard from the Opposition.  I brought this Book of <Col N="2109" /> Estimates with me, but no Deputy on the Opposition seems to have ever seen it.  I was never asked about a single sub-head in the Estimate.  I was never asked whether a little more could be given under a certain sub-head or a little less.  In fact, I think if I had time I could have written out every speech from the Opposition Benches, because I had heard them all so often before, including the two hours' nonsense with which Deputy Dillon led off.  Indeed, I could have put in the personalities that Deputy Dillon quoted in his speech.  As we all know, Deputy Dillon thinks that personal attack is a good argument when he has no other argument to use. However, we will leave it at that, because I am not going to follow with a personal argument.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon devoted much of his time to the bacon position.  I do not mind being attacked in this House for anything wrong I have done, and I suppose I have done wrong fairly often, at least in the opinion of the Deputies opposite, but I do resent meanness from any Deputy.  In fact, I feel sorry for this House when I see a Deputy adopting a mean attitude. That is the attitude Deputy Dillon has adopted on the bacon question.  I would ask him to go back and read his speech on the Second Reading of the Bill.  He will find in that nothing but praise for the Bill.  Every single provision of it was praised by Deputy Dillon, and I read that lately just to make sure.  So that he approved of that bacon legislation just as much as I did.  Now Deputy Dillon comes along and, with his satellites there behind him, tries to give the impression to the House and the country that the bacon scheme was my scheme and not theirs. Why has Deputy Dillon not the manliness to come forward here and say that he made a mistake, just as I did, in that legislation?</P>

      <P>I ask the Deputy to read his Second Reading speech on that Bill when it was going through.  If he does, <Col N="2110" /> I defy him to point out to me where he found the smallest fault with its provisions when it was before this House.  Instead of finding fault with that Bill, he gave great praise to it and said it was long overdue.  He had words of praise for the different provisions in it.  I would ask Deputy Hughes who reiterated the words used by Deputy Dillon, to go back on that particular speech of his leader and read what he said on that occasion.</P>

      <P>Not to bacon, perhaps&mdash; that is true.  I would ask the Deputies who sit behind Deputy Dillon to read the speech he made on that Bill four or five years ago.  Having listened to the speech that he delivered on this Estimate, and having read the speech that he made at that time, they will be in a position to draw their own conclusions as to whether he is not adopting a mean attitude now.  As I have said, I do not mind being attacked here, but I do object to a member of this House&mdash;I do not care what Party he belongs to&mdash;or to any Irishman taking up the mean attitude that Deputy Dillon has taken up on this question.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon said other things about bacon which, of course, were absolutely ridiculous.  He said that the British asked us some time ago for 100,000 cwts. of bacon, and that we could not give it to them.  I admit that we could not have given it to them, but the point is that we were not asked for it.  We were asked for 10,000 extra cwts., and we gave them 3,000.  We also gave them 1,000 live pigs, so that, if you like, we gave 4,000 out of the 10,000 extra cwts. asked for.</P>

      <P>He was not.  The arrangement we have under the Agreement, which everybody can road, is that we can discuss with the British what quota we think we can fill, and what quota they think they can give us.  We take the initiative, as we did this year.  We put it to the British Government that we can export so much bacon, and they accept that.  I think it was about the beginning of March that they came along and said they could take another 10,000 cwts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>No. If they had asked for 1,000,000 extra cwts. we could not give them either.  We made up our mind as to what we could export.  They came along looking for another 10,000 cwts. We could not give them.  Deputy Dillon mentioned another case.  He said he knew a man in the County Monaghan who brought his pigs into the factory. They were Grade A.1 pigs.  He took them away and brought them back to the factory in three weeks' time when, according to the Deputy, he got less for the pigs than he would have got on the first occasion.  I have been puzzling my mind as to how that could happen.  I asked Deputy Dillon to sit down and take pen and paper and give the weight of the pigs on the first occasion they were brought in, and what they weighed on the second occasion.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister deny that his own personal attention was directed to the cases of farmers bringing their pigs into factories in the County Monaghan and of being sent home, the factories declining to accept the pigs, and of the pigs being put into a lower grade when re-presented at the factories?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not deny that, but he denies that the <Col N="2112" /> farmer, in the case I mentioned, sustained the loss that I alleged in the intervening three weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>All that I allege is that pigs of high grade were put into a lower grade, because the factory would not take them on the first occasion on which they were presented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact, as the Deputy should know, farmers will purposely try to put their pigs into a heavier grade and expect to do better out of them, even though there is a lower price per cwt. for them.  Take the weight of a pig on a particular day, and make it as favourable as you can in the Grade A.1 class.  If you brought that pig in the next day, and if the weight of it was 1½ lbs. or so higher, it might happen that you would lose a bit on it, but if you kept the pig at home for three weeks&mdash;I am taking the case that the Deputy had in mind&mdash;I think it would be impossible for what the Deputy has alleged to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister admits that, substantially, the facts are true?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that if a pig gets heavier there is less paid per cwt., but that does not mean that you lose on the pig.  There are, as I have said, farmers who will purposely feed their pigs to put them into the higher grade weight because they believe that by doing so they will get more for them and do better out of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were some other questions raised about bacon which I can deal with when I come to reply to what was said by other speakers.  I would just like to say again that I do not mind being attacked about this bacon business.  It does not do any great harm to this country, not the slightest harm, I think.  If Deputy Dillon gives the impression to the country that I <Col N="2113" /> made a mistake, that, I think, does not do very much harm.  Neither does it do very much harm if he gave the impression to the country that the curers made inordinate profits.  But when we come to the point of saying, and of trying to prove, that it is impossible for producers to produce pigs at present prices, then I believe the Deputy is doing harm.  Deputy Brennan came in here with figures which, I presume, he got from some private source.  He spoke of some lots of pigs that had been fed in some way that was not mentioned.  According to the accounts presented, there was a loss on the pigs.  So far as official figures are concerned, figures which we get from county committees of agriculture or from any of the agricultural colleges, they would not go to prove Deputy Brennan's contention.  The figures that we get from pig feeders who keep accounts, and who know how to feed their pigs, show that pigs are paying.  These feeders will admit that. I think it is a great pity that Deputy Dillon and Deputy Brennan should try to give the impression to would-be producers of pigs in this country that pigs are not paying, because their statements may have the effect of keeping those people from going into pig production.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot see why the small farmer west of the Shannon or anywhere else with two, three or four pigs should not have a better chance of making them pay than the bigger man who has to buy all the feeding stuffs.  The small man has potatoes or something to supplement the feeding, and has a better chance than the bigger man feeding 1,000 or 500 pigs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>He may have some potatoes, or, as somebody has suggested, might have some skim-milk.  I have here a sheet, which it would be very awkward to publish, but I am prepared to answer any question about it with regard to any grade or any price of pig.  This sheet shows the present price per cwt. dead-weight, here and in Northern Ireland, and in every instance, over three or four months, the price of pigs here is higher than in the North.  In the case of the 10 to 11 stone pig the price is 19/1½ higher here than in the North.  The price goes down to the regions of a shilling in certain cases for the 14 or 15 stone pig.  Taking all the pigs here as delivered to the factory, and taking the weight on the average&mdash;because we have a certain percentage of pigs that go into each class&mdash;our pigs at present are fetching 10/- per cwt. more than those in Northern Ireland, yet Northern <Col N="2115" /> Ireland was held up to me in this House as an instance where pigs are on the increase.  It is true that they were on the increase.  I do not think that is so at the moment, but they were on the increase and there were two reasons for that.  It may be due to propaganda or other pronouncements, but there is something in it.  If you have daily papers and spokesmen on county committees of agriculture and in the Dáil saying that pigs are not paying here, that must have some influence.  That is not heard in the North.  Even though they have trouble between the Government and the Opposition with regard to the Pigs Board, they do not say that pigs are not paying.  At any rate, they have some regard for the producer.  They let him go on producing and do not try to stop him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the matter considerable thought, and I say that, on the average, we are getting 12/- more for pigs, but I put the figure at 10/-.  I say that one reason for the position here is propaganda, and, perhaps, a greater reason is want of credit.  Want of credit may be the greater reason, and I will deal with that later.  We were told that the prices of feeding stuffs here are higher than in Northern Ireland.  They are. Take the ordinary mixture for which you go into any of the pig compound feeding stuff merchants or millers. They will give you 5 cwt. of maize meal mixture, 1 cwt. of pollard, 1 cwt. of <Col N="2116" /> bran and 1 cwt. of meat meal.  I put it as simply as I can, because I want to make a comparison.  What is the difference in the price of feeding stuffs? The difference is about 1/3 per cwt. higher here than in the North for maizo meal mixture.  The price is something lower here for pollard and bran than in Northern Ireland.  A simple test is this, that there is no prohibition and no tariff on pollard or bran coming here from the Six Counties, and yet none is coming in.  They are something cheaper here.  Meat meal was as cheap.  I do not think it is as cheap now.  On that basis, for a half-ton the price here would come to about 7/6 more than in the North of Ireland, but if you take 4 cwt. to 1 cwt. of bacon, our price here is more than sufficient to cover the increased cost of feeding stuffs.</P>
      <P>I wish Deputies on the opposite benches would keep off the venom that they have for me and for the bacon curers, and appeal to the producers, by pointing out to them that they can get paying prices for pigs here and, in that way, try to get them to produce more.  I do not think Deputies opposite would lose politically if they did that.  They may think that by being able to point out, in six or 12 months' time that the number of pigs is going down, that is a political advantage, but they should forget that, and try to get the people to produce more pigs, and, at the same time, if they like, come along and get it made right, if the curers are getting too much out of the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been thinking over the question and, from the figures, there is no reason why we should not get bigger production having regard to prices. The prices are sufficient to make pigs pay.  I think one of the biggest troubles is want of credit.  It was the same when I was young, and living on a farm where credit was necessary. There was no great problem then about going to a shopkeeper and getting the meal necessary to feed a batch of pigs, and paying for it when they were sold.  I believe it is not so easy to get that credit now.  Perhaps it may not be the fault of the retailers.  I believe they find it hard to get credit from <Col N="2117" /> others, and so on up along.  The only remedy might be a slow one.  I do not think anyone could suggest a quick remedy.  I do not think any Deputy would suggest that people should go to the retail shops and tell the owners that the Government would guarantee them if they gave out meal for the feeding of pigs.  The only remedy I can see is to try to get a method of co-operation.  Where you have co-operative societies in Cork, Limerick, Waterford, and some other places, these societies are giving credit on a much better scale than could be got elsewhere, and if it was possible, if we tried to push these co-operative stores more generally, in order to give out credit by that means, we might get greater production of pigs.  The same perhaps, might apply to poultry.  I do not know if that could be done very easily.  I do not know whether we are going to have the results that I hope we could have if it was done, because, I suppose, unless these co-operative stores are fairly well or long established they would find it hard to get credit for what they buy themselves. That is one thing that could be done, to try to get credit for the pig producers, and in that way increase pig production, at least to some extent more than prevails at present.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gorey is not in the House at present, but if he was here I would like to say that, while I have heard as hard things said by him as by any Deputy in Opposition against the Government, there is one thing I always found about him, that what he said was, to a certain extent, constructive. The Deputy followed almost immediately on Deputy Dillon, and in his speech he said that there was a great improvement as a result of these regulations, from the point of view of the producers of pigs.  Whatever we might have against the curers for what they have done, or what they have been accused of doing, let us try to put that aside and deal with it, as we hope to deal with it when the new Bacon Bill is brought in.  I appeal to Deputies, for goodness sake, in their anxiety to get at the curers not to spoil the whole pig business, because I think that is the danger from speeches like that <Col N="2118" /> made by Deputy Dillon and other Deputies on the opposite benches.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon spoke about a few other things.  It was hardly necessary to take two hours to say what he said. He referred to fertilisers, and he said that we gave a bounty on fertilisers which went straight into the pockets of Goulding's shareholders.  Remember that statement in view of what actually happened.  Messrs. Goulding had issued a list-price of manures.  We gave Messrs. Goulding's, amongst others, a 10/- bounty on the production of phosphate manures.  We said that there would be a condition that a discount of 10/- would be given on the price already issued.  That was done. I suppose it is not necessary to pay compliments to people in trade because they are well able to look after themselves. The discount was given.  In some cases the price was even reduced by 12/6, so that the subsidy that was given came off the price list, and, coming off the price list, the shopkeeper who got the manures could sell them to his farmer-customer for 10/- less than the list price.  What is the justification for Deputy Dillon saying we gave a 10/- subsidy for artificial manures which subsidy went straight into the pockets of Messrs. Goulding's shareholders?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I think everybody will admit that I showed great for-bearance in listening to Deputy Dillon for two hours without interrupting him.  I have the excuse that he hardly made a tangible point on which I could interrupt him.  Practically all his statements were nebulous.  Deputy Dillon said that he could not save onions in Mayo.  I should not like an official of my Department to say anything derogatory of a Deputy.  I mentioned to an inspector of my Department that I heard a person say that he could not save onions in County Mayo.  I did not say who said it.  If I had, the inspector would have been more respectful.  His comment was: &ldquo;Pure nonsense.  Some of the best onions produced last year were saved <Col N="2119" /> in County Mayo&rdquo;.  Having got that opinion from an expert, I interpret it as meaning that the weakness is not in the soil or climate of County Mayo but in Deputy Dillon's own management.</P>
      <P>We heard from Deputy Dillon and another Deputy a complaint that the Department did not push sufficiently the keeping of shorthorn bulls in County Roscommon.  That allegation was hardly fair.  I made inquiries into it.  I found that the County Roscommon Committee is the most difficult committee with which we have to deal on that problem.  I do not say that the committee itself is to blame because the committee may have its difficulties with its own people, but we find it almost impossible to get them to take a large share of shorthorn bulls in that county.  It may be impossible for the committee to place the bulls.  The Department has made every effort in past years to induce County Roscommon to take more shorthorn bulls and fewer Aberdeen-Angus and Hereford bulls.  The complaint was also made&mdash; I think it was Deputy Brennan who made it&mdash;that the Department were putting out &ldquo;special-term&rdquo; bulls which were not up to premium standard.  The bulls we buy at the bull sales here and elsewhere are of premium standard and I do not think it can be alleged that we have put out bulls under the &ldquo;special-term&rdquo; scheme that are below that standard.  We all have our own opinions about the standard of bulls. Some people may say that a particular bull is not up to premium standard and others may say that it is.  In the opinion of the inspectors who buy these bulls, these animals are up to premium standard.  From my reading of files of correspondence between the Department and the Roscommon County Committee, I gather that it is very hard to get them to take shorthorn bulls.  In the majority of cases, they would probably say that a bull was not up to premium standard because it was a shorthorn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brennan spoke of a scheme for day-old chicks.  Other Deputies also mentioned it.  There is such a scheme. When you have Deputies so very solicitous about farming conditions, it is <Col N="2120" /> a pity that they are not familiar with the different schemes available under the Department and the county committees of agriculture.  One would think that they would study these schemes and recommend that they should be put into operation for the benefit of the farmers.  There has been a scheme for the last couple of years for day-old chicks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  We have been very anxious in the Department for the last couple of years to push any of these schemes with regard to the rearing of day-old chicks, loans for brooders for farmers and the provision of poultry houses, in the endeavour to get a better class of fowl for laying in the winter period and producing more eggs&mdash;particularly at the time they are valuable.  Deputy Gorey spoke a good deal about the rabbit pest and other Deputies also referred to it.  I am afraid that Deputy Linehan is right.  He said that it appeared, when we did make a serious attempt in one year to get rid of a lot of rabbits, that in the next year they appeared to be more numerous than ever.  I am afraid that is the fact.  It is not an easy problem with which to deal.  We have given attention to it from time to time.  As Deputies know we had a bounty on the export of rabbit skins at one time.  The tariff was taken off rabbit skins going into Great Britain as a result of the Agreement.  That should not have lessened the value of rabbits exported from this country but the export of rabbits has gone down very seriously this year.  There appears to be a big increase in the import of rabbits from Australia into the English market and that has cut the prices very badly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gorey referred to the question of minor drainage.  He has spoken on this matter consistently on the Agricultural Vote for nine or ten years.  He has urged that the scheme <Col N="2121" /> he advocates would relieve unemployment and, at the same time, give the farmer an opportunity of improving the quality of his land, increasing its fertility and its production.  We are examining the matter at present with a view to seeing whether we could evolve any scheme&mdash;it is not an easy thing to do&mdash;by which we would pay a subsidy to farmers, for the employment of those at present unemployed, for minor reclamation and minor relief schemes on their own land.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies advocated the revival of the heifer loan scheme.  I would like to tell the House that it is true that the collection of the instalments under that scheme has been very satisfactory; but it must also be remembered that in the third year when we had that scheme in operation it was almost entirely neglected.  Very few applications came in for heifers.  They amounted to only 2,000 for the whole country.  As a result of the very disappointing reception for the scheme, it was dropped.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There may possibly have been defects in the way the scheme was worked.  It was not so easy to work it.  Deputies here advocated that instead of the public auction the Minister for Agriculture should get inspectors to buy the heifers and send them out to the farmers.  I wish the Deputies who spoke had some experience of trying that sort of thing on the farmers. About 90 per cent. of the farmers would say, &ldquo;That is not the sort of heifer I want at all,&rdquo; and they would send the animals back to us.  I can visualise the sort of letter we would get from the farmers.  They would tell us that it was a pity we did not get someone who knew something about a <Col N="2122" /> heifer and so be able to buy the proper type instead of sending out a man with a collar and tie.  That is the sort of answer that I would get if I sent out inspectors to get the heifers and distribute them.  The only possible scheme is to let the farmer buy his own heifer. I know that this is one of the questions that are being considered by the Agricultural Commission, and it is possible we will have a report on that particular matter in the very near future.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies spoke about fruit.  I do not think they can make a complaint about the kind of fruit coming in here.  Deputies were dealing principally with the fruits used for jam-making, mostly raspberries.  Let us take raspberries, black currants, gooseberries and strawberries, used for jam-making.  About this time of the year the Department makes up its mind what proportion of the home production will go to the jam-makers.  We have to make allowance for the proportion of raspberries to be used for dessert purposes, and the same will apply to the majority of our strawberries. We make up our minds what is the amount that is likely to be available for jam-making.  We then see the jam-makers and ask them what is going to be the production for the year.  We have a check on the production for last year and the year before, and if there is any big change in the estimated production we try to find out why.  We then allot the quotas for imports.  I do not think we could do it in any other way.  If there are more raspberries or black currants or strawberries&mdash;especially strawberries &mdash; produced, there is room for them here for jam-making.  We are almost at saturation point in the case of gooseberries and black currants.  We import very little, but we import quite a lot of strawberries for jam-making, and some raspberries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bennett said the price of milk was not good enough.  Deputy O'Donovan and other speakers said the agricultural prices were good on the whole, but that the reason the farmer could not live was that what he had to buy was too high.  Deputy Bennett took a different line.  He said <Col N="2123" /> the price of milk was not good enough. Last year the average price paid for milk by the creameries in this country &mdash;I am not taking into account what the townspeople had to pay, because it is much higher&mdash;was 5¾d.  I think the actual figure was 5.72d.  That was paid for milk with a skim milk return.  That is not such a bad price.  The Fine Gael Party in 1936-37 issued a manifesto telling the farmers, the unemployed, the civil servants, the teachers and everyone else what they were going to do for them if they got back into power.  They had a programme which was going to cost £20,000,000 and, among other things, they promised the farmers 5d. a gallon for their milk.  In a Utopia under Fine Gael, one that would cost £20,000,000 in addition to what the country is being run for, they were going to give the farmers 5d. a gallon, and yet Deputy Bennett tells us now that 5½d. is not enough.</P>

He could do that from his own experience, but he does not do it, and I think it is a pity.  I think Deputy Hughes should not follow Deputy Dillon and others into the region of higher economics, such as we have spoken of here.  He might talk about his experience on his own farm.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a satisfactory increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I admitted that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a satisfactory increase, but it is nothing like what it should be.  If we had three times the amount of artificial manures used, it would be all to the good.  At any rate, we are going up a bit.  The Deputy asked about the concentrated artificials.  I do not know if I could say that we have actually had an experiment with the concentrated artificials. The Department has some information on them.  They have considered the matter, and from the information I got I think one thing is sure, that per unit the price is higher for the concentrated than for the ordinary artificials.  Against that the Deputy may say that the transit would be lower.  That is true.  Another difficulty which I am sure the Deputy will admit is a great difficulty, is that of distributing a very small quantity of manure over an acre of land, or whatever land you may have.  I know the Deputy has had the experience of trying to distribute a cwt. of ammonia over an acre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that that is a difficulty.  You can use 1 or 2 cwts. and mix them with your grain seed and sow through an ordinary modern drill, and you will be putting it deep into the soil and not amongst the weeds.  It is the non-fertilising of the weeds that is the big consideration. You should carry out experiments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out that it does appear, at first sight, to be dearer per unit.  There was another <Col N="2125" /> thing I gathered from what the Deputy said in the course of his speech.  I am sure he will admit that what he said was that Denmark, for instance, is increasing all the time in production and in exports.  He said they had been increasing up to last year, while this country has not made any progress or rather had, if anything, gone back.  I do not think that is altogether true. Somebody handed me extracts from a report issued by the British Consul in Denmark.  These reports can be got in the Library.  They are issued by the various consuls in the different parts of the world to which these consuls are attached.  In this report the British Consul in Denmark says that bacon exports from Denmark to the United Kingdom in 1936 were lower than at any time since 1923.  So there we have the fact shown that bacon exports have not gone up.  The year 1937 shows that this has been continued. The exports of bacon from Denmark to all countries in 1936 were less than half those in 1931.  There we have the fact shown that Denmark has gone down in its bacon production.  Everything is fairly well regulated in Denmark and they purposely cut down production there.  How would Deputies opposite feel if they were in the Danish Parliament facing the Danish Minister for Agriculture who had actually cut down production?  I suppose they would tell him that he has broken the Fifth Commandment just as they told me some years ago in the matter of the calves.  At that time they told me it was an unnatural offence when I ordered the slaughtering of calves. But there is Denmark and her exports have been actually reduced from the year 1931 to 1936 by more than half. Of course, it was necessary and it could not be helped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also the statement in this report from the Consul in Denmark that &ldquo;the movement in Denmark from rural to urban districts continues and especially into the provincial towns&rdquo;. So there is the flight from the land there too.  In that way the British can see that Denmark, which has been held up to us here as a model country from the agricultural point of view, <Col N="2126" /> has reduced its exports of bacon in the last six or seven years by one-half and in that country there is also the flight from the land to the towns.  We are not alone in our troubles.</P>
    <P>From Sweden, which is supposed to be a country which is the least affected by any depression or slump of any kind in the last ten years, there comes this report from the British Consul there: &ldquo;The figures indicate that the movement of population from the country to the towns continues&rdquo;.  So again we have the flight from the land not only in Denmark but in Sweden.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes asked about the grass seeds.  What happened was that some time ago we tried to give some encouragement to the farmers on this side of the Border in the growing of grass seeds.  Grass seeds are principally grown in Monaghan and to some extent also in Louth and Cavan.  Our own growers here grow all the perennial rye grass seed we want but not all the Italian rye grass we want. We had to tariff grasses coming into this country.  That has been changed now.  The arrangement we have with the British on that question is that whatever amount of grass seeds we allow in here they must allow the same amount of grass seeds out.  Fortunately we have the privilege of saying the first word as to what we will allow in.  We have not allowed any in and the result is that our growers are getting more for their grass seeds than the Six-County growers are getting.  We have troubles to some extent, at any rate, in preventing grass seeds coming in through illicit channels.  I cannot speak without inquiry and some investigation, but I have been told that this thing was worked for a year or two and that the handlers or cleaners at this side of the Border were not charging more than the cleaners at the other side of the Border.  Unfortunately the price of grass seeds is higher here but if that is so the benefit is going to our own growers.  At the present time we could import grass seeds at a good deal lower price&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Hughes comes from the County Carlow.  The farmers there grow a certain amount of beet and wheat.  If I were up in the County Monaghan I am sure the farmers there would say: &ldquo;We get no benefit from the wheat and beet growing&rdquo;.  To that I would reply: &ldquo;You are getting benefit from the grass-seed scheme, for example, in Carlow.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, we are producing between 30 per cent. and 40 per cent. of our grass seeds and there are also mixed perennial and Italian seeds grown and they are still mixed when sown.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No. I made inquiries into the prices on the very day that this Estimate started&mdash;that was last Thursday.  The price that day in Belfast for perennial rye grass, 28 lbs. to the bushel, was 35/- wholesale.  The wholesale price in Cork was 36/-.  The retail price in Belfast was 40/-; the retail price in Cork was 41/- to 42/-. I got these figures from a firm which has a branch in Belfast and in Cork. The price of Italian in Belfast was 31/- wholesale, and in Cork 38/6. The retail price in Belfast was 35/- to 36/-; in Cork the retail price was 41/- to 42/-.  So that in the case of Italian rye grass there is a difference of 6/- to 7/6 between Belfast and Cork but in the case of perennial the difference is only 1/- to 2/-.  These were the prices last Thursday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, I will be glad to get them.  I did make inquiries <Col N="2128" /> after this scheme had been working for a year or two to see if the people who are handling this business were getting more than a fair market.  I was told that they were not getting more than their colleagues on the other side of the Border, so that any figures that can be supplied by the Deputy will be welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>From the figures I have quoted there is not a lot in it.  As the Deputy is aware, there was also a figure quoted by Deputy O'Donovan and supported by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, showing that the cost of seeding a statute acre with a mixture of seed for permanent grass was 75/-.  I thought that was far too high.  I said that I personally had bought some grass seed which, from recollection, I thought had not cost more than about 34/-.  I got the catalogue since, and I find that is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true; Deputy Hughes did not agree with that, but there was a mistake made.  In that statute acre there is about 22 lbs. of perennial and about eight or nine lbs. of Italian, and the difference between the prices I quoted will not come to a lot in four or five acres of seeding. Deputy O'Donovan asked me about allowing in a serum for white scour in calves.  It is true that that is not allowed in; it is not allowed in under the Therapeutic Substances Act.  The reason why it is not allowed in is that in the case of some of those serums which contain live bacteria there is a grave danger of introducing foot and mouth disease.  As a matter of fact, I believe that one of the worst attacks which occurred in Great Britain was due to one of those serums coming in. I should also like to add that, as far as the veterinary opinion at my disposal goes, this serum is of very doubtful efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Jeremiah Ryan referred to the transferred suppliers.  There is a <Col N="2129" /> certain doubt about the position legally and we did hope to bring in the long-promised Co-operative Bill which would make that right.  I do not think that under the present law&mdash;that is, the 1928 Creameries Act&mdash;the supplier could compel the society to issue shares to him even though he had paid the £3 per cow.  We did intend under the Co-operative Bill to make that right, and I hope that Bill will come along in the near future.  A statement has been made here so often during the debate that I am afraid people will begin to believe there is a lot in it.  It is not true to say that there has been a disastrous fall in the number of cattle, pigs, poultry, or anything else in this country.  There has been some decline, admittedly, in the number of poultry, some decline in the number of pigs, no decline&mdash;in fact, an increase&mdash; in the number of cattle, and an increase in the number of milch cows. The total number of cattle in this country in 1931, which was the year before this Government came into office, was 4,029,000, and now it is 4,056,000, so it has gone up slightly. The total number of milch cows has gone up from 1,222,000 to 1,281,000, so that in both cases there is an increase. I suppose we cannot always say that the figures we get from the census are absolutely correct, but we always assume that the error is about the same, and, on the figures, we must at least accept the fact that there has been no reduction in cattle in the last seven or eight years.  If anything, there has been an increase.  The total number of pigs in June, 1938, was 958,000.  In 1931 it was 1,227,000.  That was the top of a cycle.  If you take the year 1929 it was 945,000, which was lower than 1938.  If you go back to 1928, which is the top of a cycle again, it was 1,182,000.  There is no disastrous drop.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1938 it was 1,826. Again going back to 1929, it was 1,855.  That is not a very big difference. In 1931 it was 2,149.  Taking those graphs, I think you will find there is only a ten per cent variation <Col N="2130" /> at any time in the last 13 or 14 years. Largely, they have gone in cycles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>Which the Pigs and Bacon Act was supposed to correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite admit that we had hopes that the Pigs and Bacon Act would improve things considerably. The total number of poultry&mdash; taking turkeys, geese, ducks, and so on, all together&mdash;was 19,630,000 last June.  In 1931 the figure was 22,782,000.  Taking fowl over six months, which would I suppose be regarded as hens and cocks, the number went from 10,400,000 to 9,400,000, so that again there is about a ten per cent. variation there.  It is not an alarming fall.  It is a regrettable fall, I quite admit, and I wish to goodness the trend had been in the other direction, but we should not allow ourselves to fall into despair as we might be inclined to do if we listened to the speeches from the Deputies opposite, because the Deputies opposite seem to take it for granted that we have absolutely gone out of production, that our cattle are all gone, that our pigs and hens are all gone, and that we cannot get them back again.  There is no alarming situation like that at all.  There has been a slight fall, as I say in pigs and poultry, and a slight increase in cattle and milch cows.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister recall the figures for egg export?  I think there was a decrease from £2,300,000 to £800,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I have not got all those figures up to date, but there was a big fall in the value of our exports in eggs.  That is quite admitted.  I do not know whether or not the feeling can be supported by figures, but it is felt at any rate that the consumption of eggs in the country has gone up considerably. Deputy McGilligan&mdash;I was very glad indeed to see him&mdash;came in and made a speech on the Agricultural Estimate. I knew, of course, that there was going to be something out of the common, and he did vent his feelings on the curers.  Well, I think the <Col N="2131" /> curers are well able to take care of themselves, and I am not going to defend them, but Deputy McGilligan ought to know that I have no power to charge the curers with any crime. They may have done wrong, but what they did is not a crime in law, and Deputy McGilligan ought to know enough about the law to realise that unless I have the law behind me I cannot charge those men with a crime. There is no use in coming in and making a speech of that kind, asking me whether I am going to charge them with certain crimes.  Whatever they may have done, it was hardly fair to use in connection with them the epithets which Deputy McGilligan used under the protection of this House.</P>
      <P>However, that is his own look-out, and I suppose it is their look-out too, but there is one thing on which I am definite, and that is that it certainly was not fair to mention the Monaghan Curing Company.  I said that the case was <i>sub judice,</i> but Deputy McGilligan said it was not, and went on to refer to it.  I find it was <i>sub judice.</i>  As a matter of fact, that company were not charged with keeping two sets of books, as Deputy McGilligan said. They were charged with failure and refusal to make certain returns.  The judge gave no decision yet, therefore the case is <i>sub judice.</i>  I said that the case was <i>sub judice,</i> but Deputy McGilligan told me he was certain it was not.  I think he took a very unfair advantage of the privilege of this House in speaking of a case which was <i>sub judice.</i></P>

      <P>It was not brought to a conclusion.  I am informed as officially as I can be on that particular question. The case was not brought to a conclusion. I may say that I expect to hear fairly straight and bitter things from Deputy McGilligan when he <Col N="2132" /> comes into this House, but I do not expect to hear anything stupid from him.  I think it was very stupid of the Deputy to say that we put a levy on home produced butter in order to give cheap butter to the English people. That may have been the result of our scheme, that we gave butter to the English people at a lower price than that paid by the consumers here, but the Deputy knew well that that was not the purpose of the scheme.  I do not mind a back bencher of Fine Gael making a stupid remark of that kind. Some of them may not have very much intelligence on these matters, but a Deputy who is rather particular should be careful that he does not make such stupid statements, whatever else he may say, as that we put a levy on home consumed butter in order to give cheaper butter to the English people. That was a most stupid remark.  We wanted to give a better price to our home producers.  The Government, of course, could have taken the butter that was surplus to home requirements and dumped it into the sea.  Instead of that we said: &ldquo;Let us get what we can for it on the English market or on the German market, and we can pay a bounty on the surplus exported, so as to bring the price up to an economic figure.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>There is an old saying that you cannot feed a dog altogether on butter.  In the same way, you cannot feed a Christian altogether on butter.  Our people could only consume a certain amount of butter, and we exported the remainder and got what we could for it.  As I say, we could have dumped it into the sea, but we sold it at a price that was prevalent on the British market and the German market, and we gave, in addition to that, a sum sufficient to make up an economic price for the producer.</P>

Deputies opposite, Deputy McGilligan amongst them, accepted as a fair proposition that we should make consumers here pay what we regard as a fair price to our producers, and that if we had to export any quantity over and above what we required for home consumption we should try to provide subsidies on that out of the Exchequer. That was accepted as a fair proposition by the opposite side.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mongan said that it would be a good thing if we could get a veterinary surgeon to live in Connemara.  I should like to say that Deputy Mongan and others are familiar with the efforts that are being made to establish veterinary dispensaries and to get veterinary surgeons to live in these areas.  It is not easy, however, to get that done but every effort will be made to provide these services if we can do it.  Deputy Esmonde and <Col N="2135" /> other Deputies spoke about sums of £5,000,000 £8,000,000 and £10,000,000 being spent on Defence, adding that we could not spare a few pounds for agriculture.  That is hardly putting the case fairly.  I suppose it is too much to expect the case to be presented fairly by Deputies on the opposite side. It must be apparent to Deputies, after hearing the Budget to-day, that the amount spent on Defence is nothing like £8,000,000 £5,000,000 or even a £1,000,000 more than was spent last year.  The Deputy also said that we could not provide a scheme to give manures in County Wexford.  The Chairman of the Wexford County Council is here and he can bear out my statement that the Wexford County Council brought in a scheme to provide manures for farmers in the county. After setting up their organisation and going to the trouble of advertising the scheme, they got only about 20 applications.</P>
      <P>Another question raised by Deputy Esmonde was the closing of the Kilcarbery rehandling station for tobacco. Deputy Giles raised a similar question about the closing of the Randalstown station.  It was felt we had too many rehandling stations for the amount of tobacco we smoke.  These two stations were not the only once that were closed.  They were rehandling an extremely small quantity of tobacco, something less than 10,000 lbs each, and it would not be an economic proposition to keep them going.  We made up our minds that we would have to reduce the number of rehandling stations if we were going to get this work done in an efficient manner and at an economic price and that is why we reduced the number of stations.  Deputies opposite generally may condemn our policy of growing wheat, beet and tobacco but individually they agree with one or other of the items in our programme. Even Deputy Dillon would agree that we should grow onions.  Last year he wanted us to grow French beans but he would not have us grow wheat or tobacco.  Deputy Giles, on the other hand, wants us to grow tobacco.  I think a good deal depends on the constituency which a Deputy represents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2136" /> Deputy Childers made a very original speech, a speech with which I certainly agree to a great extent.  I might not agree with some of the views he put forward but to a great extent I agree that some of the things he mentioned, particularly regarding deposits in banks, loans to farmers from banks, and the incidence of taxation in case of derating should be all re-examined and checked up.  Deputy Fagan made a typical sort of speech.  He said that the subsidy on manures was no use, because even with the subsidy of 10/-, the farmer could not pay the other £3 for a ton of manure.  But when he got away from that he advocated a subsidy for agricultural implements. Therefore, the farmer who could not buy a ton of manure because he had no money, could buy implements all right if he got a small subsidy, according to Deputy Fagan.  Deputy Flynn raised a question as to the restocking of the mountainy areas in Kerry with sheep. I answered that question before, and I stated that the number of sheep in Kerry had not gone down.  He mentioned a scheme in Wicklow.  That scheme I am afraid was practically not availed of at all.  The Agricultural Credit Corporation brought in a scheme for the restocking of the mountainy areas in County Wicklow with sheep and it was scarcely availed of at all.  However, the Kerry position is being looked into to see, first of all, if it is as Deputy Flynn suggests, and, secondly, if anything can be done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Belton stated that we killed 500,000 calves and that if they were alive to-day that they would be worth £15 or £20 each.  Of course, if some of them were alive to-day I do not know what they would be like.  There has been so much talk about this scheme that I am afraid I shall have to go back on it again, although I have dealt with it often.  The position was that at one time the British quota for cattle was a bit too low for the number of cattle we had and we had to take certain measures.  One of them was to kill a certain number of cattle and distribute the meat to those who were receiving unemployment assistance and home assistance.  Secondly, I said to the Dáil at the time that if <Col N="2137" /> we could get the people here to consume veal, as they do in other countries, we would not have the same trouble.  I instanced France and Germany, where they are self-sufficient in respect of butter&mdash;they have almost sufficient butter anyway for their own use&mdash;yet, they have not too many cattle.  By the consumption of veal they have not any problem about exporting cattle.  I said that if we could get a certain amount of veal consumed here instead of beef it would settle the balance and prevent a surplus of cattle.</P>
    <P>I said at that time that the only way I could think of inducing butchers to buy calves and sell veal at a price at which the consumers would buy it was to give a bounty on calf skins.  There is nothing immoral in that.  I was told by Opposition Deputies that it was unnatural and immoral.  I asked the theologians on the other side was it a sin to kill a year-old calf, and they said no.  Then I asked them was it a sin to kill a nine-months-old calf, and they said no.  I could not get them to draw the line where the sin commenced; but they said it was a sin to kill a calf.  I do not know whether they have decided since where the sin commences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in some places.  In Macroom they kill them at a day old and eat them.  I was often told that anyway.  I say that the scheme we brought into operation was, first of all, a scheme to induce butchers to buy calves for veal by saying: &ldquo;We will give you 10/- for every calf you buy and sell for veal.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>If the skin weighed so much.  Of course the calf should be killed young.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite right.  It was not done in that way.  The farmers killed the calves&mdash;I was told they fed them <Col N="2138" /> to hounds, and sometimes buried them &mdash;and sold the skins.  That was not my fault.  In any case, as I have said often before, I did not compel anyone to kill a calf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I never spoke to Deputy Keating about anything yet that I did not convince him and I think I will convince him now.  The total number of calves in which the bounty was paid was 500,000.  The last year the scheme was in operation we paid on 120,000 skins, and no Deputy could say that there was a single calf killed&mdash;they were all natural deaths. There were not so many calves killed at all under the scheme.  If the 120,000 calves which died a natural death in 1936 were alive now they would be worth £15 or £20; but there was always a natural mortality.</P>
      <P>Deputy Belton made another interesting observation.  He said, &ldquo;If you derate agricultural land, you will benefit the small farmers as well as the big farmers.&rdquo;  He pointed out that I said at one time that by derating agricultural land you would not confer any benefit on the small farmers, but in fact would cause a loss to them. The reason I said that was that if a small farmer is paying £1 per year in rates and if agricultural land was derated and the money was raised by taxation on sugar, which was suggested by Fine Gael, the increased tax on the amount of sugar used by that man and his family would cost him more than he would gain by derating. Deputy Belton said, &ldquo;That is all right, but if the small farmer has a beast to sell, the big farmer, because his land is derated, will pay him more for it.&rdquo;  Is not that false?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It could be reasoned by Fine Gael, but I do not know that it could be reasoned by anyone else.  The Fine Gael Party have always held, and it is one thing on which I agree with them, that the price you get for the surplus exported will settle the price all round.  Therefore, if you have a yearling to sell and the export price is £11, it will be exported unless a farmer at home gives you at least £11 for it. The export price therefore will rule the price of cattle whether you derate agricultural land or not.  When Deputy Belton says that the large farmer will give more for a beast to the small farmer if agricultural land is derated, is he making out that the large farmer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Anyway Deputy Belton has a solution for the problem of wheat growing.  He says that wheat growing is all wrong, and that he is going to solve it.  What is his solution?  To make the lecturer in plant breeding a professor?  How would that make any difference?  You would have the same man all the time.  If he were made a professor instead of a lecturer, Deputy Belton says everything would be solved and wheat growing would be a success, which it is not at present.  I may be wronging the Deputy, because he may have intended to go on and say something <Col N="2140" /> else, but he did not.  As a matter of fact, I told Deputy Belton before that the first time I ever heard him speak I thought he was a great man. That was at a Fianna Fáil Convention in the Rotunda in 1926.  Deputy Belton made a speech there on wheat growing which was one of the finest productions I heard from any man.  It was a most convincing speech.</P>

      <P>It was a fine speech on wheat growing, and I was convinced by it like everybody else.  It is extraordinary how the Deputy has turned against wheat growing since he want back to Fine Gael.  Deputy Belton told me&mdash;and I think Deputy Brennan agrees with him&mdash;that I should be ashamed to say that we could import food at a cheaper price than the price at which we could afford to produce it here at home.  That was in connection with beef from the Argentine, and wheat, and so on; and I said that that applies to everything else.  Deputy Belton then told me that I should be ashamed to say that.  I think that everybody knows that we could bring in Argentine beef here at a much cheaper cost than our own.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The important thing is that you must produce the calves.  Of course, we could bring in beef from the Argentine, mutton and lamb from New Zealand, and eggs from China, much cheaper than we could afford to produce them here.  I think everybody will admit that.  As a matter of fact, we have a sixpenny tariff on the import of lambs at the moment, but notwithstanding that tariff, these lambs sometimes come in from New Zealand.  Supposing you were to take that tariff off, where would you be with regard to the production of your own farmers?  We could bring in eggs from China and from other countries at much cheaper rates than we can produce them here. I think everybody knows that, but Deputy Belton says that I should be ashamed to say it.  Later on, of course, Deputy Belton said that he approved of the increased wages and the better <Col N="2141" /> prices for foodstuffs, but how does he propose to arrange that these good prices and good wages should be given if we are to allow everything to come in from other countries free of duty?  I think that Deputy Belton will have to revise that speech of his.  He says that he disapproves entirely of the more extensive growing of wheat.  Well, all I can say is that it is a pity that we cannot refer him to the speech he made in the Rotunda in 1926.</P>

      <P>Well, of course, I did not go into the report of the Prices Commission very fully here, because, as I said, a Bill will be coming before the Dáil which in my opinion, will attempt to make things right, and I <Col N="2142" /> thought that it would be better to defer discussion on the report of the Prices Commission until that Bill comes along.  As far as I am concerned in the drafting of that Bill, my object is to see that no undue profits will be taken by the curers in future. Deputy Coburn said that the cattle dealers in this country were a very decent lot of people, and I myself always thought so, although Deputies on the other side of the House did not seem to think so.  At any rate, Deputy Coburn said that they had played the game during the economic war and gave the best price that they could give.  Now, when I was giving out licences for the export of cattle during the economic war, I used to point out that the giving of these licences was meant to be a benefit to the farmers of this country, but I was always told by Deputies on the opposite benches that the farmers did not get that benefit. Well, if the dealers are decent men, why did not the farmer get the benefit?  If the dealers were such decent men, the whole of that benefit should have been passed to the producers, less, of course, whatever would be a fair amount of profit for the dealers themselves.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I believe it was.  I used to say, before there was any question of a bounty or anything else of that kind, that the cattle dealers went out and competed with other buyers and paid to the farmers what they could afford to pay, leaving them a sufficient profit for themselves.  Why, then, should there be any difference just because they got 30/- extra?  Why do Deputies say that these men put that money in their pockets, and, assuming that they did put it in their pockets, why did they not do that before?  Of course, I admit that when quota restrictions came in, competition was killed to a large extent, but Deputy Coburn says that when it came to the question of giving out export licences we gave them to the greatest rogues in the country.  Well, all I can say is that we gave the licences to the same people who had always been <Col N="2143" /> doing business in that way, and whom Deputy Coburn describes as a very decent body of people.  As a matter of fact, we did give these licences to the producers, and I want Deputy Coburn to know that.  I think, as a matter of fact, that this matter of licences first arrived on the 27th December, 1933.  It was a black day for me, at any rate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and I must say that I did not get much help from the opposite benches in that connection. However, at that time, I called the cattle traders together, and they all came, or at least I had a roomful of them.  There were about 30 of them present, and it seemed to me that they were very hopeful men.  I asked them to send in their returns for the previous years, and told them that I would put an advertisement in the papers.  I told them that the distribution of the licences would be on the basis of the numbers of cattle they had exported in the years 1932 or 1933&mdash;the previous years.  Now, Deputy Coburn has described these people as being the most decent fellows in the country, but he then said that the people who got the licences were all rogues, but the people who got the licences were the very same body of men.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">

      <P>I was asked by Deputy Browne why our eggs are getting less than Northern Ireland eggs.  He says our eggs are as good.  There is no doubt about their being as good, and we hope to make them better, but the reason is that the Northern Ireland eggs are not stamped while ours are, with the result that the British consumer believes, when he gets an unstamped egg, that he is getting a fresh egg from the farmer.  I agree with Deputy Browne that if we carry out the provisions of the Eggs Act strictly, and improve the quality of our eggs, the stamp may be an addition to us later on, because the consumer may come to realise that the stamped egg is better than the unstamped egg and we may get a better price.  As a matter of fact, I think I can say definitely that <Col N="2146" /> we are coming nearer to the Northern Ireland price than we have been, so that it is perhaps possible that the consumers on the other side are beginning to realise that our eggs are very good.</P>
      <P>Deputy Linehan asked if it is a fact that we had to import bacon to make up a deficiency here.  No, that is not exactly true.  Under the British Agreement, we settled with regard to quotas. Last year, so far as I remember, we got a bacon quota for export to Great Britain of 600,000 cwts., and we gave them a quota of something like 2,400 cwts.  It is 3,000 cwts. this year.  It may look rather foolish that we should be sending bacon to Great Britain and that they should be sending bacon to us, but there are traders on the other side who say they have a connection here for a certain class of bacon, and, seeing that we were getting a quota of 600,000 cwts. from them, we could not refuse them something in return.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The system is exactly the same on both sides.  The British send us quota certificates for the month and we distribute them to the curers.  We send them certificates for bacon coming in here.  We do not inquire to whom they give them, but I understand that about half the bacon goes to the Border counties and the other half to Dublin.  I was asked also if the bacon that came in was cheaper than the bacon here.  I believe it was.  It is true that our bacon is getting less on the British market than on the home market. The British bacon coming in here, sold at home, was getting about 88/- or 90/-, and it was sold here at the same price, so that it would be so much cheaper.  Deputy Linehan also said that beet was not a suitable crop for North Cork.</P>

      <P>In any case, the Deputy said it was difficult to get labour.  That is rather unfortunate, if it is true, because we have been hearing for the last three or four days that the farmer and the labourer in this country are quite willing to work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Another point raised was the question of the price paid by the Dairy Disposals Company in their creamery, and as to its being lower than that of the surrounding co-operatives. The policy adopted by the Dairy Disposals Company from the beginning is not to give what would be regarded as a remunerative price, following out their own accounts, but that which the surrounding creameries were paying, if they could afford it, to pay more because they might take the milk from the surrounding co-operatives, and they would object very strongly.  They do try to pay the same price.  I have heard from time to time that they were paying too high a price and, at other times, too low a price, but they have tried, as far as possible, to pay the same.  There may be a difficulty where they are surrounded by three co-operatives, because these three may not be paying the same price, so that it would be difficult for them to fix a price.  I did not hear the suggestion as to education of farmers through the radio, but sometimes announcements are made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did suggest that we might do something through the schools, and we have more or less decided on a scheme of getting our leaflets distributed through the schools.  I do not know whether it will <Col N="2148" /> be a success or not.  We have tried to get school-children to bring out a list of the leaflets we have to their parents, and to ask them if there are any subjects upon which they would like a leaflet, and, if so, the teacher would help the pupil to write a letter to the Secretary of the Department, asking that that leaflet be sent to his father or brother.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I put a question to the Minister?  The reason I want to ask it is that I take it that the Minister was speaking from conviction, and I think it right to ask him this question with regard to derating. He referred to derating and said what a foolish thing it was for people to think that if a large farmer got derating and, consequently, had not to pay a very large sum in rates, he would be able to pay a bigger price for live stock to the small farmer.  He described that as ridiculous and said that the Opposition held that the export price ruled.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £404,000 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1940, for Export Subsidies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three items in this Estimate. The first is £434,000 for subsidies on exports of dairy produce, which provides for the assistance of the dairying <Col N="2151" /> industry by means of subsidies on exports of dairy produce.  The provision has been fixed to provide for an average value of 134/- per cwt., f.o.r. on creamery butter production during the main season, and 145/- per cwt. during the winter months, based on the following figures:&mdash;Estimated production in 1939-40, 800,000 cwts.; estimated home sales, 410,000 cwts.; and estimated exports, 390,000 cwts.  I would like to say that last year we budgeted for a price of 130/-, but we actually achieved 135/-, because prices on the foreign market turned out somewhat better than we anticipated.  This year we anticipate 135/-, and that is on the basis of a net price for our butter on the foreign market of 108/-, that would be a gross price of 112/-.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>Is there to be a levy this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be a levy for some time, but by every shilling that the export price improves on that figure, 112/-, the levy will go down by 1/-, and it is quite possible that the levy will be very small.  I think the subsidy on creamery butter will cost £370,000, and the subsidy on other items of dairy produce will cost £64,000; that is a total of £434,000.</P>
      <P>The second item provides for subsidies on exports of eggs of £160,000. This provides for the payment of 1/- a great hundred on 3,000,000 great hundreds and 9d. per great hundred on pullets' eggs.  The number of pullets' eggs will be, of course, very small.</P>
      <P>The third item is a subsidy on exports of potatoes&mdash;£12,000, that is for the export of seed potatoes to markets other than the British market.  The British market has been more or less closed to seed potatoes and that has had the effect of diverting a certain amount of seed potatoes from that market to others where we are getting a foothold, and it is in order to enable our exporters of seed potatoes to hold what they have and, possibly, to increas what they have in those other markets that we are providing the export bounty.  It does not apply to seed potatoes exported to the British market but only to markets outside the British market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three matters to which the Minister has referred. The subsidies on the export of dairy produce will amount in this year to £434,000, and the Minister forecast that, if there is any levy, it will be a very small one.  He also thinks his price for butter more than sufficient to produce 5d. a gallon for milk.  I think I am correct in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be about 5.7d.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>More than sufficient to produce 5d. a gallon for milk.  I ask the House to remember that on a previous occasion we went deliberately to the country and said that we foresaw a trend in the butter market which would enable us to save the people of this country, and that with a modest contribution from the Exchequer we would be in a position to guarantee the farmers of this country. 5d. a gallon for their milk, without imposing any burden on the consumers of butter in this country.  The Minister for Agriculture went down to Wexford and produced what purported to be a calculation made out by the experts of the Department of Agriculture, to prove that what we had undertaken to do would cost the Exchequer £2,000,000, I think.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The forecast we made has now come to pass, and, in fact, we are in a position to give the farmers of this country 5d. a gallon this year without any contribution from the Exchequer or any levy on butter, and with the contribution here envisaged, about £400,000 from the Exchequer, we are in a position to give them 5½d., or rather over it.  I mention that fact in order to remind Deputies of the reckless and unscrupulous kind of fraud that is practised on the people of this country.  If a responsible Minister goes down and, speaking as a Minister, with the expert knowledge which he alleges is available to him from the experts of our public Departments, and deliberately misleads the people, and misleads them on the authority of what he says is official information, the <Col N="2153" /> people of this country are going to come to the conclusion that no public man in Ireland can be believed upon his oath.  And if that conviction spreads&mdash;and, God knows, there are certain gentlemen sitting in front of me at the present time who give ample grounds for that belief&mdash;it is going to react upon us all because it is going to give force and substance to the contention that democratic politicians are frauds, self-seekers and chancers whose stock-in-trade is misleading the voters of this country.</P>

      <P>I have been challenged a thousand times, and flattened the man that challenged me every time.  If the Deputy wants to issue any challenges let him go and tie a wet towel around his head and make out the challenges, and then we will deal with them. In the meantime, the Minister for Agriculture here to-day tells us that not only is 5d. available, but 5.7d. is available, on the assumption that there is a bounty of £400,000 given to dairy products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well that the House should bear that in mind and evaluate accordingly the solemn pronouncements of the Minister for Agriculture on future occasions, and realise that, although we are afficted by a Minister for Agriculture capable of making a statement of that character in public, there are also, happily, men in the public life of this country who see a little further than the end of their noses and who can give the people a reasonable, intelligent forecast of what the future holds and, being able to do that have the capacity intelligently to plan for the contingencies that the future may bring upon us.  It is the folly of Fianna Fáil, who have staggered along <Col N="2154" /> from day to day, from one disaster into another, that has brought us to where we are.  They have never tried to look ahead or anticipate events. They have never tried to make provision against the things that were about to come.

      <P>Sub-head B of the Estimate deals with the bounties and subsidies on exports of eggs.  To-day we had presented to us by the Minister for Finance a statement in which credit was taken for the bounty contained in the Minister for Agriculture's Estimate. We were told that it formed part of a sum of £10,250,000 that it was proposed to provide for the agricultural community of this country.  Under the heading of &ldquo;eggs&rdquo; in the tables in connection with the Financial Statement for 1939&mdash;Table 8&mdash;there appears the statement: &ldquo;Eggs&mdash;Increase in the value of egg production as a result of State intervention, £290,000&rdquo;.  Now, the fact is that prior to the blight of Fianna Fáil descending on this country we were exporting to Great Britain eggs to the value of £2,300,000 per annum.</P>

As I have said, we were in a position to export eggs to the value of £2,300,000 per annum, but after six years of Fianna Fáil administration our exports are valued at £800,000.  Therefore, we have reduced the value of our export of eggs during the last six years by nearly 60 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>So long as I remain relevant I have no doubt that I can be assured of the protection of the Chair. The bounty here suggested is £160,000. It is designed to retain the remnant of our export of eggs to the British market, a remnant which has been created by the wicked folly of the Minister who is responsible for this Vote.  That wicked folly has been represented by his colleague, the Minister for Finance, here to-day as being a benefit conferred by him on the egg business of this country.  Is it not hard for any rational man to keep patient while fraud of that kind is employed in this House to justify the unspeakable record of the Government that at present afflicts this country?</P>
      <P>In regard to sub-head C, incongruously enough, it has something to recommend it.  There is no doubt whatever that the seed potato industry which has grown up in this country, notably in the neighbourhood of Athlone, is a valuable industry.  It is one that we ought to develop, and if there are transient difficulties, I think the Minister is amply justified in any attempt he makes to overcome them until they are dissipated by the course of events.  I understood the Minister to say that while our markets in countries other than Great Britain had been damaged by supplies that were diverted from the British market into those other countries, we still retain the market in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2156" /> These bounties are designed not to help our exports to England but to the other foreign countries where we have got markets recently.  I think that is amply justified.  I hope that in a short time these export bounties will no longer be necessary.  I have no hesitation in concurring with the Minister, so long as they are necessary in order to retain the position we have won for these seed potatoes, that it is wise to ask the House for such a sum as will enable the producers of potatoes to retain those markets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the statement made by Deputy Dillon tonight should be allowed to go unanswered. When speaking about butter he raised the question of the price of milk to the creameries.  Deputy Dillon and his Party did go down the country, and they gave that guarantee, but the farmers were too well aware that two years previously the Party with which the Deputy is now associated marched into the Lobby here and by their votes declared that in their opinion three-halfpence per gallon was sufficient for milk.  That is why the people did not believe Deputy Dillon or his Party when they went down the country. Deputy Dillon has made this an excuse for saying that it was due to wild and untrue statements by the Minister.  Deputy Dillon forgets that the Butter (Prices Stabilisation) Bill cost the country close on £800,000, and that in the following year we were able to give the farmers 3¾d. for their butter because the price of butter in the English market at that time, after we had paid the tariff on the butter going over, was 70/- per cwt.  We may thank the war mongers that the price of butter is what it is to-day.  We are able, without any subsidy, to pay 5d. per gallon for milk to-day, and if we are the only people we have to thank for it are the war mongers.  Deputy Dillon tried to get away with something else.</P>

      <P>Two points were raised by Deputy Dillon.  I do not admit at all that the statement I made on one occasion was a reckless statement.  As a matter of fact, if the Deputy cares to go back and to look it up he will find that I stated &ldquo;on the present price of butter.&rdquo;  That is how it was calculated.  It was the cost, whatever was said.  If the Deputy says it was £2,000,000, I accept that &ldquo;on the present price of butter.&rdquo;  It may be that the Deputy had more foresight, and did forsee a rise in butter in the world market.  If so, good luck to him. The statement was not a reckless one. I would be very sorry indeed if I should make a reckless statement which would have the effect of lessening the belief of the Irish people in his statements, or which might destroy the ingenuity and intelligence of a public man.  That would be a pity, no doubt.  I will try not to injure the reputation of the Deputy in any way, either indirectly or directly.  With regard to eggs, there is a statement, which was issued by the Minister for Finance, and he talked about State intervention.  It mentioned that we were paying so much on the export of eggs.  We had the matter up already. It was accepted that the price of our export surplus regulates the price at home.  If therefore we raised the price of eggs exported by one shilling a dozen, naturally we raised the price of eggs at home by one shilling a dozen. That is what the Minister for Finance stated, and it is a safe way of getting the figure.</P>
