    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he has protested to either the Government of Northern Ireland or the British Government regarding the wholesale arrest and imprisonment without trial of Irish citizens resident in the Six Counties; and, if so, if he will state the result of such protest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative.  The second part, accordingly, does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach say whether he proposes to take no action in a situation in which citizens of Eire are being detained by the Six-County Government without any charge whatever? Does he think it fair or desirable that citizens of Eire should be allowed to be incarcerated by the Government of the Six Counties without any charge having been proved against them?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy had asked me why I have not made such representations, I would have told him that I would regard such a protest as futile.  I know, and the Deputy knows as well that, as long as Partition lasts, and there is a Government governing an unwilling population, this sort of thing is going to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach not think it desirable to make a protest on behalf of this State against the detention, without any charge, of citizens of this State by the Six-County Government, so as to demonstrate that, at least, we are not acquiescent in that type of tyranny?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle (for Mr. O'Neill)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he is aware that in recently issued passports the name of His Majesty King George V (deceased) has been used instead of His Majesty King George VI, to describe the King of England, in whose name the passports are issued, and also that the words &ldquo;Irish Free State (British Commonwealth of <Col N="3" /> Nations)&rdquo; are used instead of &ldquo;Eire&rdquo;; and if he will take steps accordingly to have the necessary changes made; also, if he will provide that in future such passports are issued bilingually so that the Irish language may get its rightful precedence in international documents of this nature.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (the Taoiseach) Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (the Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the matters referred to in the first part of the Deputy's question.  The question of the form of the passport generally is under consideration.  As the Deputy should know, the request page is drawn up in the Irish as well as in the English language and the remainder of the passport form is in three languages, namely, Irish, English and French.  The existing application form, which must be filled in by every applicant for a passport, is itself drawn up both in Irish and in English, and applicants are at liberty to fill up the application form in the Irish language if they so desire. Where that is done the practice of the passport office has hitherto been to fill in the descriptive details in the Irish language under the appropriate captions in the passport itself.  I have given instructions that henceforth the descriptive details should be filled in in Irish in all cases even when the application form is in English only.  It may also be necessary in certain cases to fill in the details in a third language.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hoped to be in a position to submit legislative proposals for the introduction of the managerial system to county administration before holding local elections in this year.  It has not been possible to do so within the time available and, in the circumstances, I am satisfied that it would not be desirable to postpone the local elections for a further period.  The <Col N="4" /> elections will, therefore, be held in the present year towards the end of June.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is determined to introduce a Bill dealing with the extension of the managerial system in rural Ireland which, I think, we will certainly all heartily welcome, will he not consider further the desirability of postponing the local elections, or is his mind irrevocably made up to hold them this year?  It seems foolish to have the expense of holding local elections this year if, on the passage of a Bill, entirely different bodies will be required to carry on local representation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No one knew until to-day that the Minister had a Bill in draft altering the system of local elections, and I cannot conceive any rational man wanting to hold local elections this year, and local elections again next year, if the terms of the Bill made it necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

      <P>Arising out of that highly illuminating reply, I would like the Minister to revert now to a language in which he is somewhat more facile and say whether he proposes to remedy this very grave abuse of having indigent persons in West Donegal sued in the Dublin District Court for bills which are alleged to be due, by merchants who have sent canvassers down to West Donegal and induced the people there to enter into purchase agreements which they are subsequently unable to fulfil or do not want to fulfil and then suing in the Dublin District Court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the practice has grown up under a relevant section of the Summary Procedure Act whereby a canvasser goes down to a remote part of Ireland, Kerry or West Donegal, and there enters into an agreement with a resident. They then have on paper a note that this agreement will not be completed until it has been accepted in the office of the selling firm.  They accept the bargain at the office of the Dublin selling firm and, under the Summary Jurisdiction Act, they are entitled to sue in the area where the bargain was completed, with the result that these poor people are sued in Dublin and cannot afford to go to Dublin to defend the suit.  They are decreed and the bailiff is put in to collect the money. That is clearly a situation calling for attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce what is the <Col N="9" /> rate of Customs duty at present levied on linen thread; and if he can state if the firm manufacturing this product in Eire have recently farmed out their monopoly to the Linen Thread Company of Glasgow, against whom the tariff on linen thread was originally imposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The rate of Customs duty levied on linen thread is 100 per cent. <i>ad valorem</i> on all thread except thread manufactured in the United Kingdom or Canada, on which the rate of duty is 40 per cent.  While the Irish Thread Manufacturing Company, Ltd., is at the moment the only firm in this country manufacturing linen thread, it has not been granted a monopoly of this industry.  There can be no question, therefore, of &ldquo;farming out their monopoly,&rdquo; as the Deputy phrases it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that behind the tariff of 100 per cent. the Irish Linen Thread Company established itself in this city and that the tariff was raised to 100 per cent. on representations being made to the Minister's Department that if it was not fixed at that figure the Linen Thread Company of Glasgow would dump thread here?  The tariff was raised to 100 per cent. and a circular issued on the 31st January by the Linen Thread Company of Glasgow states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Irish Thread Manufacturing Company, Ltd., and ourselves have come to an agreement whereby we will be the sole selling agent for their threads, shoe threads and twines in Eire and this arrangement will take place as from 1st of February, 1939.  We solicit orders for their threads and also for our own threads and should be obliged if in future you will address all orders for linen threads, shoe threads and twines to our Dublin warehouse, 10 South Anne Street, where they will have our very careful and prompt attention.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <P>(c) Contracts were made for sufficient supplies of potatoes to maintain the factories at Labbadish and Cooley in full production during the current potato season; it was found impossible <Col N="12" /> to make contracts for sufficient supplies for the remaining factories.  In fact, however, the contractors are unable to supply the quantities contracted for and with the possible exception of Cooley it will not be possible to keep the plants in production during the present potato season.  The current price for deliveries to the factories of potatoes of 16 per cent. starch content is £2 per ton with an addition or deduction of 2d. per ton for each .1 of 1 per cent. above or below 16 per cent. of starch.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that any serious results have followed or should follow in the hosiery industry in County Donegal consequent on the registration of a wages agreement for <Col N="16" /> the industry.  This agreement was entered into by bodies substantially representative of employers and of workers interested in the hosiery industry and was presented and accepted for registration in accordance with Section 50 of the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936.  The principal hosiery manufacturers in County Donegal were stated to be members of the employers' organisation which negotiated the agreement.  The circumstances under which the industry is carried on in County Donegal were fully considered before registration was effected, and I understood that the rates of wages laid down were fixed on a lower basis than would otherwise have been agreed because of the inclusion of County Donegal in the area to which the agreement relates.  Certain workers in County Donegal have protested against the low rates fixed, but their case seems to be adequately covered by the provisions of clause (e) of sub-section (4) of Section 50 of the Act.</P>

      <P>They own the machines in Dublin and Cork and want to take the work from the Gaeltacht.  All I am trying to do is to retain the Gaeltacht workers in their jobs.  I may be wrong, but all I am asking the Minister is, if they come to him to state their case, will he meet and discuss it confidentially with them?</P>

      <P>Has the Minister not received representations from workers, apart from the employers, who are losing money by the proposed agreement? Has he received representations from workers in Donegal to the effect that the proposed scale is going to cut down their wages for years? It may come all right when they have served so many years&mdash;five, six or seven years&mdash;but in the meantime where are they going to?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state in respect of the years 1935 to 1938 inclusive the quantities of (a) wool flock and (b) cotton flock imported from Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the value of such imports.</P>

      <P>The official import list provides a description for the imports of flock, but does not require it to be separately declared as of wool or cotton.  Prior to May, 1935, all kinds of flock imported were not entirely separable from imports of textile materials under general headings.  All available figures in relation to the years 1935, 1936 and 1937 were published on page 113 of <i>Trade and Shipping Statistics</i> for the year 1937. In the year 1938, 3,528 cwts. of flock, valued at £10,787, were imported from Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Vote for Agriculture contains provisions for numerous schemes for enabling live stock of various descriptions to be leased or sold at reduced prices and to aid the farming community in many ways.  In the congested districts and other poor areas, seed oats, potatoes and wheat, as well as artificial manures and lime have for some years past been made available at specially reduced rates, the provision in the current year's Estimates being seeds, £32,500; and manures and lime, £22,500.  It is also proposed. subject to the approval of the Dáil, to make available for farmers generally at reduced rates during the current season certain types of fertilisers at a cost to the Exchequer estimated at £88,000 and, in addition, to provide £30,000 in the coming financial year for the purchase of lime. Moreover, loans by the Agricultural Credit Corporation at a reasonable rate of interest are available for the purchase of stock, seeds and manures. Having regard to these facts, there is, in my view, no necessity for the Exchequer also to render financial assistance by providing money at specially reduced rates of interest for the purposes which the Deputy has in mind.</P>

It was pointed out on that occacion that sanitary authorities have not been unreasonable in their demands on dairymen and that any premises which are well constructed and clean can, with little alteration, conform to the regulations.

Could not money be found at a cheap rate of interest, or without interest, in order to give these farmers a chance to put their cowsheds in proper order?  At one time it seemed that the Minister was delighted that the cattle were going, and I think he said, &ldquo;Thank God, the cattle are gone, and gone for ever.&rdquo;  Is he aware that, if we do not <Col N="29" /> get some kind of subsidy for our stall-fed cattle, the farmers must be helped in some way to provide for farmyard manure, and is he also aware that they have not proper accommodation for those cattle?  I am sure there can be a lot done by the Government to help that industry.  The Minister is aware and the House is aware, that the industry has suffered&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Representations in this matter were received from the County Cavan Committee of Agriculture, and I caused inquiries to be made locally with a view to ascertaining the position. These inquiries go to show that, whilst a small proportion of the potato crop which remained undug was seriously damaged by frost, and a portion of the crop which was stored suffered damage, these difficulties have led farmers to conserve supplies to a greater extent than usual and, accordingly, it is not at present anticipated that there will be a serious shortage of seed in the county.

      <P>Members of the House will recollect with regret the death shortly before Christmas of Deputy James Walter Beckett.  The <Col N="86" /> late Deputy was a worthy member of a family which has for many years held a distinguished place in the commercial life of Dublin, and he himself at all times took a keen and practical interest in the affairs of his native city. During the many years of his membership of this House, he attended conscientiously to the interests of his constituents and assisted the House by his wide experience of business matters. His kindly presence will be missed by all of us.  I ask you, a Chinn Comhairle, to convey to Deputy Beckett's widow and family the sincere sympathy of Dáil Eireann.</P>

      <P>A matter arises in that respect about which I would make a submission.  It is a well-established practice that Ministers have a discretion to make regulations and to do <Col N="87" /> certain other matters which shall be valid, and all things done under that regulation are valid unless they are reversed within a given time by Dáil Eireann.  I assume that the House assumes that if one of these regulations is demurred to by a responsible member of the House, early opportunity will be given for hearing the demurrer and the Government answer, and the House then can decide.  If this motion, which relates to a regulation at present in operation to the grave detriment to certain people, in our opinion, is not dealt with for six or twelve months, as could happen, a very grave injustice would be done.  I submit that where you have a specific resolution of this kind, the Government ought to provide a reasonable time, which could be arranged through the usual channels, to discuss the matter and to dispose of it.  I suggest to the Tanaiste that this is a matter for which Government time ought to be provided, as opposed to the ordinary kind of Private Members' motion for which provision is made on Wednesdays and Fridays.</P>

      <P>This Bill flows from the new Constitution.  There was a Treasonable Offences Act in operation here, the Act of 1925, and that Act, under the Bill now to be brought before the House, will be repealed. Certain sections may be adapted and re-enacted.  Section 39 of the Constitution, as Deputies will note, provides:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Treason shall consist only in levying war against the State, or assisting any State or person or inciting or conspiring with any person to levy war against the State, or attempting by force of arms or other violent means to overthrow the organs of government established by this Constitution, or taking part or being concerned in or inciting or conspiring with any person to make or to take part or be concerned in any such attempt.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The long title of this Bill gives some indication to the House of what it is intended to provide for. I do not propose, I do not think it would be proper for me, at this stage to go into any details of what the <Col N="90" /> measure is going to contain.  It will deal with certain sections which were in the Treasonable Offences Act, 1925; it will deal with unlawful associations and organisations; and will provide certain powers for the purpose of dealing with those.  It will also provide for the setting up of special criminal courts to deal with offences which it is considered cannot be adequately or properly dealt with by the ordinary courts.</P>
      <P>As to the necessity for the Bill, I do not think there is anybody in the House who is not conversant with things which have arisen in the recent past which showed the necessity for dealing with a situation such as we recognise has arisen.  I want to refer to one matter, and again I want to emphasise that I do not consider that this is the proper stage of the Bill to go into any details, or to give in any extensive way the reasons for the Bill in a very short statement.  As Deputies are aware, a proclamation was issued, on 8th December last, by a certain body which purported to hand over what it maintained it held, that is, certain Government functions. It described itself as a Government and it purported, under that proclamation, to hand over to the Irish Republican Army, as they call it, those functions of Government.  That is a position which the Government is not going to tolerate and that matter will be dealt with, amongst others, under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that our position in this matter is that there is no set of circumstances within the country which justifies the introduction of this unusual type of legislation and the exceptional type of court which the legislation foreshadows? The country has been peaceful, and particularly peaceful, during the past two years.  There is no set of circumstances at present before the House which justifies resort to these exceptional measures.  The fact that the Minister quoted a proclamation does not justify the introduction of this type of legislation at all.  If people do issue proclamations of that kind now, it is because they were encouraged, in other years, to believe <Col N="91" /> that the title of this House was faulty; but there is no necessity at this stage for the introduction of legislation of this kind.  Whatever powers may be necessary to deal with any abnormal situation are already in the hands of the State.  There is no evidence that there is any necessity for these powers or that any abnormal situation requires to be dealt with.  In the absence of any evidence showing the <Col N="92" /> necessity for this special type of legislation, we oppose the motion that the Bill be given a First Reading.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The convention applies to persons who work in successive shifts in necessarily continuous operations in the works in <Col N="98" /> which sheet-glass is manufactured by automatic machines.  Such persons must, under the convention, be employed under a system providing for at least four shifts of a maximum of eight hours a shift, 42 hours a week, with certain exceptions.  The terms of the convention are in accordance with the regulations made under the Conditions of Employment Act, after consultation with the representatives of the employers and workers concerned in the manufacture of sheet-glass by automatic machines in this country.  Accordingly, the ratification of the convention will involve no change in our law, and the regulations appear to provide adequately for implementing the provisions of the convention.  I accordingly ask the Dáil to agree to the ratification of the convention.</P>

    <Title>Local Authorities (Combined Purchasing) Bill, 1938&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Minister for Local Government (Mr. O Ceallaigh) Minister for Local Government (Mr. O Ceallaigh)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This is a Bill to amend the Local Authorities (Combined Purchasing) Act.  It is introduced to replace the Act that has been carried through from year to year under the Expiring Laws Act, since 1925.  The system of combined purchasing originated at the session of Dáil Eireann in 1920, and practical steps were taken in December, 1921, to carry out the decision that was, at that time, arrived at.  In 1925 the Local Authorities (Combined Purchasing) Act, 1925, was enacted for a period of three years, but since 1928 it has been continued from year to year under the Expiring Laws Acts.  The system has, therefore, been in operation for a period of 17 years.  In the present Bill the main features of the Act of 1925 are retained.  In some respects extended powers are sought.  The prime necessity for the successful administration <Col N="102" /> of a system of combined purchasing is complete co-operation by all local bodies.  Although it is generally recognised that the system has been advantageous to local bodies, there is still not a little distrust of it on the ground that it involves the removal of control from the local to a central body.</P>
      <P>This view of the position is not warranted.  The present Act is administered in co-operation with representatives of the local bodies and representatives of industry and commerce. It is the local advisory committee that examines the tenders for supplies that are obtained at fixed intervals on written specifications, and makes recommendations to the Minister for the appointment of official contractors.  There is, therefore, a large element of local control in the administration of the system.  It has also been advanced by some opponents of the system that it tends to a concentration of contracts for supplies in the more populous areas.  This impression is also not well-founded.  Contractors in the smaller towns can and do compete successfully with those in the larger centres of population.  The existing contracts are distributed throughout the country.  Besides the four county boroughs there are official contractors for supplies in at least 26 other areas.</P>
      <P>The current list contains 2,164 items, and the names of 230 contractors. Tenders are not invited for perishable commodities or for commodities which can generally be obtained with greater or equal advantage locally, e.g., cement, coal, and many items of building material.  Further, commodities of a highly specialised and technical character, as also those which do not form part of the regular requirements of local authorities, do not come within the ambiz of the scheme.  The system of combined purchasing has been helpful in some instances to the establishment of native industries, and in most cases to their development and expansion.  It is expected that the changes which are proposed in the Bill with the object of fixing definite quantities to be supplied over a specified period will lead to an advancement of this policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="103" /> The main differences between the present Bill and the Act of 1925 are in respect of the provisions of Section 6 under which an official contractor may be appointed for the supply of commodities to a particular class of local authorities or to particular local authorities; Section 10 which deals with the revocation of the appointment of an official contractor; Section 12 which regulates the procedure to be followed in regard to substitute commodities; Section 13 which requires the submission by local authorities of estimates of their requirements; and Section 14 which contains provisions prohibiting the ordering of supplies by any member or officer of a local authority from any person other than the official contractor.</P>
    <P>As regards the provision in Section 6 dealing with the appointment of official contractors it is thought advisable to have wider powers in connection with the supply of commodities to a particular class of local authority or to particular local authorities, and the provision in sub-section (5) of the section is designed to meet the position.  The provision would permit of the formation of special economic areas if it is found that the adoption of this course would enable the smaller industries that could not meet the needs of all local bodies under a general contract to tender for the supply of commodities for such special areas on competitive terms.  The existing Act does not enable the Minister for Local Government to cancel the contract of an official contractor even if he proves to be unsatisfactory as regards quality and delivery of supplies.  Section 10 of the Bill has in view only an official contractor whose retention of the contract would entail serious inconvenience for local authorities if being unable to obtain delivery of supplies at contract prices, they had to purchase commodities at higher prices without any prospect of being able to recover the additional cost from the official contractor.</P>
    <P>As regards Section 12 of the Bill there have been instances of local bodies when inviting tenders for supplies <Col N="104" /> having made variations in specifications for commodities or alterations in conditions of supply so that their requirements not being specifically provided for in the combined purchasing list could be obtained from non-official contractors.  In reality the requirements of these bodies would be adequately met by commodities obtainable from an official contractor, and to prevent the continuance of such a practice the Bill empowers the Minister to declare that another specified commodity be deemed a substitute for the original commodity, and, therefore, subject to the same regulations as the original commodity.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in Section 13 to enable estimates of the commodities required during the contract period to be obtained, so that intending contractors may be given an estimate of the quantities of the commodity or commodities for which they tender. When such contractors know that such quantities will be definitely taken off their hands, and when the contract is thus a firm order, they will be in a position to cover their risks, and, in the case of textile manufacturers, contract at a fixed price for their raw materials.  On the other hand, they will not be called upon to supply at the contract price more than the estimated amount of the commodity or commodities&mdash;a great advantage to the contractor in the event of rising prices. At present an institution may during the last week of a contract period give the official contractor an order&mdash;when the market prices have considerably risen&mdash;for a quantity of commodities which he would order normally during the next contract period.  Against the liability of such orders the contractor has in the long-run to protect himself by a higher contract price at the beginning of a contract period.</P>
    <P>Estimates will only be required for commodities of a stable character and which are in regular and recurrent demand.  It is not contemplated to apply this section to miscellaneous articles and those for which the demand is not of a recurrent character.  It will apply to such commodities as blankets, tweeds, suits, shoes, tea and tobacco. Even if a local authority exceeds its <Col N="105" /> estimate it incurs no undue hardship as the articles can be used in the next contract period.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most important section in the new Bill is Section 14, which prohibits dealings with persons who are not official contractors.  As I have already indicated the prime necessity for the successful administration of a system of combined purchasing is complete co-operation by all local bodies. In fact, Section 12, which I have explained is not possible without the prohibition of dealings with non-official contractors.  I shall endeavour to explain as fully as possible the reasons for Section 14.  Should the market price of a commodity rise during the contract period, orders for such commodity may be substantially in excess of the quantity estimated for by contractors with consequent diminution or loss of anticipated profits unless contractors have discounted this possibility and covered the risk in prices tendered. Should there, on the other hand, be a falling market, quantities of stocks may be left on the hands of contractors with consequential unexpected loss unless they have discounted such a possibility in prices tendered.  Hence, if contractors were in a position to know the quantities of materials for which they would be likely to receive orders prices would be lower and ratepayers would benefit.  Further, manufacturers by having the articles manufactured by them for local authorities fully disposed of during the contract period, would be able to manufacture these articles during their dull periods and thereby help to even out their employment of labour throughout the year.</P>
    <P>If local authorities were to have the option of purchasing materials locally, the Department would not be in a position to give prospective contractors any idea of the quantity of material likely to be ordered from them and consequently the best possible prices would not be generally obtained.  Instances can be cited of unsuccessful applicants for official contracts having subsequently canvassed local authorities that require large quantities of materials, and quoted lower prices than those submitted in applications for appointment as official contractors.  This under-cutting <Col N="106" /> is facilitated by the fact that the applicants hope to get firm orders for large quantities, and have not to include in their prices the extra cost and expense entailed by the supplying of small orders to small institutions, at irregular intervals, and at remote places which involve higher transportation cost per unit.</P>
    <P>The official contractors in such cases lose the more valuable orders, whereas they have to supply the less valuable. Naturally, successful contractors have to cover themselves against this emergency by tendering higher prices than they would tender if they were assured that the valuable as well as the less valuable orders would accrue to them. The official contractors who deliver to the less profitable areas must be protected against piracy or &ldquo;creaming the traffic&rdquo;.  The creaming of such traffic is liable to result in higher prices for all areas and in depriving the local government institutions, as a whole and in the long run, of lower weighted average prices.</P>
    <P>The provisions dealing with tests of commodities supplied contained in Section 12 (1) (e) of the Act of 1925 have been amplified so as to make the results of the tests evidence and also so as to require payment by local authorities applying for tests.  In the proposed Bill the Local Supplies Advisory Committee has the same constitution as that laid down by Section 9 of the Act of 1925, save that one representative of employees (paragraph (d)) is added.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Michael Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea behind this Bill originally was sound. It is the same still, but when the Minister is endeavouring to tighten up the machinery, we ought to be very careful that we are not stepping from a small evil into a greater one. Apparently, the Minister has found great fault with under-cutting.  I wonder why?  After all, that is what we are looking for, as far as prices are concerned.  The feeling was abroad, and there was a lot to justify it, that the articles supplied to local authorities were not of standard quality, and that possibly, to a large extent, tenders were being cornered locally.  There was good reason for that feeling and, in <Col N="107" /> order to safeguard the interests of the ratepayers, the principle of combined purchasing was introduced.  Let us be careful, now that we have safeguarded against the possibility of local cornering, that we are not lending a hand to central cornering.  That is my opinion. After all, output is limited in this country, as the number of manufacturers and large suppliers is limited, so that it would be much easier to corner prices now than it was in the past. Speaking as a member of a local authority, who always felt that the principle behind combined purchasing was right, I should like the Minister to ensure that the prices submitted by suppliers or potential contractors are right; not alone the lowest but that they are reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lot to justify the feeling that is there at present, that prices of a lot of commodities are most unreasonable, and that that has resulted in forcing the cost of living beyond the capacity of the people to pay.  There must be some reason for that state of affairs.  If we are going to give any help, we must ensure that suppliers are not put in a more unassailable position to force up prices.  We should be very careful to see that we have some machinery to deal with such a position. There may be commodities in the supply of which only three or four people may be concerned.  It is not enough for the Minister to be satisfied that the lowest tender got the contract. He must be satisfied that the price is reasonable.  I am not questioning at all the standard quality of the articles. I think that is all right, though there were complaints about the quality of some articles.  When looking for these extended powers the Minister should be sure that there is no loophole for undercutting, and a chance given local people as against centralisation. If we are going to do that we should, at least, have an assurance that not alone is the quality and the price right, but that, from the competitive end, the matter has been examined and the price found to be reasonable.  In the past there was a good deal of sympathy with local suppliers who were ratepayers with large interests in the different counties.  We are depriving them of <Col N="108" /> much of that business by this Bill.  To a large extent they have been deprived of it, but now they will not get in at all.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The difficulty is that the number of suppliers may be very small.  I do not know that the Minister is wise in ensuring that there will be no loophole for some one to come in and cut down prices, unless he has assured himself that the prices will be right.  I do not know how he will be able to do that.  I do not think the Minister has made a case for this new Bill.  If there has been a certain amount of back-sliding on the part of official contractors, the Minister did not tell us if he had reports from auditors or inspectors to the effect that local authorities were being fleeced or wronged.  We had complaints in Ros common about certain supplies, and I remember that some of them had to be sent back to the contractors on more than one occasion.  If that happened again what are the local authorities to do if this rigid Bill is passed?  There should be some way out.  Naturally, the Minister will reply that he has the right to take away contracts from those who do not supply what is required. That is not good enough and, perhaps, would not meet the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to draw the Minister's attention to another matter in connection with hospital and medical and surgical supplies.  During the past year the doctor connected with Roscommon Hospital complained to me that he could not get supplies which were absolutely necessary, through combined purchasing, in time, and would not be allowed to get them elsewhere. Eventually he had to buy them out of his own pocket.  I am sure the Minister does not want a state of affairs like that to exist.  These things were of such a nature that a large supply could not be kept in stock, because the requirements varied with the class of case.  The Minister should see that some provision is made whereby local authorities in such cases could get what they wanted.  I cannot see any reason for Section 18 (5), under which the local <Col N="109" /> authorities, apparently, are to be saddled with the responsibility of providing whatever pensions are necessary for those engaged under the combined purchasing scheme.  The sub-section reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>The expenses of the Minister shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to include such charges in respect of superannuation and other allowances and gratuities payable on death or retirement as the Minister shall, with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, determine to be proper.</P>
    <P>Does that mean that an amount will be demanded from local authorities year by year under the heading of &ldquo;combined purchasing&rdquo; to include the items mentioned?  After all, that should be a State charge.  It may be argued that combined purchasing is in the interests of the local authorities, but, as the positions are State positions, it is manifestly unfair to impose on local authorities an obligation to pay yearly any recurring charges for pensions.  I do not know if that is the intention.  If it is, I should like the Minister to tell us the exact meaning of the sub-section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone listening to the Minister's remarks would think that this Bill was introduced from the point of view of contractors, rather than of local authorities.  I agree with Deputy Brennan that I do not consider the Minister has justified several portions of the Bill.  Section 12 may be accepted, but on Section 13 there are all sorts of possibilities.  I take it that the combined purchasing department would require probably three months' notice from local authorities of their annual requirements.  That means that local authorities will have to forecast 15 months ahead.  There is a further provision that, if the forecast is inaccurate in any way, they are to be penalised. If they underestimate they have to pay an excess price unknown.  The Bill refers to a prescribed percentage.  I do not think it says who is going to prescribe it or what it is likely to be. They are going to be penalised by that prescribed percentage on the excess goods they have to buy.  If they overestimate, <Col N="110" /> in order to avoid that, they are going to be penalised by having to take the amount of their overestimate. The Minister said that it will not refer to perishable goods.  That is, obviously, under those circumstances, essential. If it referred to perishable goods it might create a serious loss to the local authority.</P>
      <P>The Minister gave us a list of the articles to which it is suggested this section shall apply.  There is nothing in the Act preventing the Minister or his successors applying it to a whole lot more.  To my mind this section, combined with further sections later on, opens possibilities which would be very unfortunate for any local authority.</P>
      <P>There is a portion in Section 14 which seems to me to be something new, and that is where it declares that a payment shall be illegal, and instructs the auditor to surcharge.  I do not know whether it is new to instruct the auditor as to what he should do.  I was always under the impression that an auditor was left to make up his own mind as to whether a certain thing was or was not illegal, and whether he should or should not surcharge.  Then there is on that same section the case or cases similar to that mentioned by Deputy Brennan.  Where the supply of something which may be on the combined purchasing list is urgently required, such as Deputy Brennan mentioned, under that section, if a member of the local authority or an officer thereof decides that he must have it and hang the consequences, if he then does as Deputy Brennan's doctor did&mdash; buys it out of his own pocket&mdash;apparently all well and good, but if he should try and get that recouped from the local authority, he is liable to be surcharged and fined £20.  I certainly think that the Minister must give some attention to that aspect of it in order to improve on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the present Act there is, I think, a permission given to a local authority to buy outside the combined purchasing list, if necessary, provided that they make a minute of their reasons for so doing.  I would suggest to the Minister that he might consider the carrying on of that into this new <Col N="111" /> Bill which would enable such a thing to be done.  Admittedly, of course, Section 15 does give permission to apply to the Minister for a regulation allowing a local authority to buy outside the list, but if an effort had been made to buy the dressings which Deputy Brennan's doctor wanted in a hurry, in this way, I think, the patient would have been long dead before any reply was received from the Department of Local Government, according to the delays which take place in that Department at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the question of tests.  There again, at the present moment, there is considerable delay in forwarding the results of those tests.  I hope that under this Bill the Minister will take some steps to have the testing department speeded up.</P>
    <P>There is also reference in this Bill to the Government of Saorstát Éireann. I do not know where that authority exists or what power we in this House have to legislate for any other Government but our own.  Later on in the Bill also there is further reference to Saorstát Éireann.</P>
    <P>Other matters arising out of my criticism can be dealt with on the Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the principles embodied in the original Bill were sound and that at one period there did appear necessity perhaps to safeguard the ratepayers, and, if possible, some local bodies, against unfair prices for commodities, but, as Deputy Brennan said, we ought not run away with the principle to an extravagant extent.  To my mind, this Bill establishes centralisation in a very definite way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to emphasise what Deputy Benson remarked as to the contractor's position in this Bill.  The contractor is the main person, as far as I can see, protected in this particular Bill that we are now discussing. There may be some interest in the ratepayers, but the main provisions of the Bill are definitely settled to govern the contractor, to protect him in every possible way.  Whatever the result will be on the ratepayer or the local body, <Col N="112" /> his position is going to be made secure. If there is going to be an increased cost for raw materials after his contract is made he is going to get the benefit of it.  He is going to get the benefit of everything in every way.  He is going to get beforehand, before he actually enters into the contract, an estimate from all local bodies as to the amount of specified commodities they will probably require.  They will make known to the Minister what they require, and he can manufacture his prices on that basis if he likes, if we like to use the word &ldquo;manufacture&rdquo;. If the local bodies afterwards require a little bit more than they said, the contractor can take due benefit, and I suppose the tendency will be to charge more for whatever little extra they require. There will not be any great tendency on the contractor's behalf to reduce prices if the local bodies find that they do not require more.</P>
    <P>The point I want to emphasise more than anything else is this, that we are doing altogether away with any idea of competition.  There may be reasons, or there may have been reasons to introduce legislation specifying that local bodies must take their commodities from certain specified contractors.  For myself, although I may have seen some good in it, I do not think I would have been prepared to vote straight out for such a proposition.  I see definite objections.  I fail to see how any provision can be made by anybody to safeguard absolutely against unfair prices or unfair quality.  It will be almost impossible.  There may be a good case made for the original Bill, and there certainly was a good case for it as applied to numerous districts in this country.  There were various districts in this country where they found it impossible to obtain goods under contract or any other way at a fair price, but there were very many districts in this country, in Cork, Limerick, Waterford and other places where it was possible to obtain specified quantities of anything you required at a fair price and of a good quality, and the local bodies who did purchase goods in that way were always in the position that they had the contractor readily available, within reach of them, to make any remonstrance they liked.  I remember <Col N="113" /> in my own particular time, when I was a member of a local body, we did find difficulties in the operations of the Combined Purchasing Act.</P>
    <P>I remember one case where tobacco was supplied at a price at which it could be got from any local provider. At one period the supply for a mental hospital was such that any ordinary smoker could see that it was absolutely below sample.  Complaints were made to the Local Government Department, which were referred to the particular contractor without any result except that there were no grounds for the complaint.  On the particular body concerned there were 99 per cent. of smokers, who knew what they were talking about, and they unanimously came to the conclusion, after testing this tobacco which was going to be forced on the unfortunate inmates of this hospital, that it was not up to standard.  But the whole thing came to nothing, and they were compelled to take it.  That is one of the difficulties which I see with centralised contractors who are chiefly in Dublin or some place contiguous.  If the members of a local body make a contract, and the supply, in their opinion, is not up to what is specified, a whole lot of elaborate machinery has to be gone through before they can get any redress, and, possibly, in the end they get none.  They are told that the Minister, or somebody on his behalf, has investigated the matter and is satisfied that the contractor sent the goods specified.  That could not happen with local contractors.  You could refer the matter back to them, and if necessary, produce the goods to them, and you had some satisfaction to get for your complaint.  That is one of the things that I think it will be impossible to safeguard ourselves against if we are to have wholesale centralisation.</P>
    <P>Another thing which strikes me in connection with this Bill is that there might be some little liberty given to local bodies.  It is stated specifically in the Bill that when a local body specifies the probable quantity of any article required, the Minister approaches the contractors and they specify the price.  If, later on, any council wants a little more than they <Col N="114" /> specified for, the contractor is to have the power to charge them any price he likes for the extra quantity.  I suggest that if any local body gives the Minister an estimate of what they probably would require, and the Minister makes a contract for them on that basis, and afterwards they require something extra, they should be at liberty to approach any person they like for the extra amount.  In that way there would at least be some semblance of opposition to the contractor. The Minister will probably answer that in that case there would be unfair competition, inasmuch as some contractor might wish to knock out the present contractor and cut the price. That might arise, and I can see the difficulty there.  Nevertheless, it would open up to local bodies an avenue of competition to the existing contractors.</P>
    <P>I am not altogether pleased with this Bill, and my inclination would be to vote against it.  But we have been carrying on this combined purchasing for a number of years.  Various complaints have been made against it, but satisfaction has been expressed in a good many cases at the operation of it.  I should like to see the Bill limited somewhat in its application.  I would like to see less protection given to the contractor, and something more in the way of protection for the local bodies and the taxpayers in general.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not opposed to this measure by any means, but I should like to know from the Minister what is the procedure for getting names on the combined purchasing list.  The reason I ask that is that quite recently the Cork Corporation had correspondence with a firm in Dublin who gave a list of their prices, which were lower than some of the prices given by one firm on the combined purchasing list.  That firm's name was not allowed on the combined purchasing list.  Therefore, I am anxious to know what the procedure is.  Is any person entitled to become registered on this list for these contracts? If that is so, I am not opposed to the measure.  As to the point made by Deputy Brennan about medicines, my experience on public boards is that <Col N="115" /> the medical officers, in making their demands, do not provide sufficiently for the future.  If the local authorities, and particularly the medical officers, took more care in specifying their requirements over a period, they might be able to get those things.  All I am concerned with is whether there is any restriction on people being put on this list.</P>

      <P>I should like to see the Bill postponed.  This Government of ours has an endearing habit of learning everything too late.  I think there might be a good deal to be said for this Bill if the present system of local government is to continue.  I remember a time when the present Minister for Local Government wept salt tears in this House when it was proposed to put in managers in place of certain county councils that were not doing their job.  He is now putting in managers in place of all the county councils.  I heartily congratulate him on that decision.  The only trouble is that he learned six years too late.  But, having made up his mind to embark on that eminently desirable reform, he introduces a Combined Purchasing Bill designed, apparently, to remedy the abuses that have arisen under the existing system of local government. I hope, and I anticipate, that under the new system of local government, which is long over-due, we will have very much more efficient local administration.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  I hope he will give them wide powers.  I presume the Minister is not going to go to the trouble of drafting a completely new system of local government if it is going to be a cod like many other Government schemes.  I think in the last six years he has learned that most of the schemes have been a cod; that it is time to consult us and get good schemes, if he is bothering about bringing in legislation.  I take it this is going to be a good one and we will help him to get efficient administration by the local authorities.  To do that the county manager, or whoever will take the place of the authority in much of our present jurisdiction, should be given ample powers.  If that is his intention, surely he should not be trying to centralise in the Custom House functions which could be manifestly much better discharged by a competent local authority who knew his own district and its requirements. I apprehend that he is approaching this problem of combined purchasing with the mentality of the existing form of local government when, in fact, he is in pickle with a completely revolutionary form of local government, and this very process of centralisation, in my judgment, is going to react very seriously against many of the improvements which we might have reasonably expected to flow from efficient local administration, because we are going to take from the local administrator the very thing that makes for his efficiency in the exercise of his duties both from the point of view of the ratepayers and of the beneficiaries of the social services in his own district.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How can an official in an office in the Custom House in Dublin know the difficulties and needs of the people in Roscommon better than the person who lives in Roscommon and who is in daily touch with the people and their problems and difficulties?  While I do not by any means disparage either the efficiency or wisdom of the permanent officials of the Department of Local Government and Public Health&mdash;indeed, I am often moved to considerable <Col N="117" /> admiration for them&mdash;none the less, I think it is ridiculous to ask them to do from Dublin what your local administrator, or your commissioner, or your burgomaster, or whatever you like to call him, is peculiarly, or ought to be peculiarly, fitted and equipped to do, living right in the midst of the people whom he is charged to serve.  Therefore, I think that this Bill should be postponed.  I presume that six years hence the Minister will discover that he ought to have postponed the Bill, but since I cannot hope that he has yet acquired sufficient wisdom to abandon the Bill now, I must, therefore, come down to the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>If we are going to pass this Bill, I want to direct attention to Section 10. Under sub-section (3) of Section 10 there is a provision that before revoking the registration of an official contractor, he is to be notified by the Minister and to be given an opportunity of making his case.  Now, three times in this House I have raised the case of the contractors, Messrs. Dixon, of the Erne Soap and Candle Works. I have mentioned their name and ventilated fully the circumstances of their case, and yet I never got a satisfactory answer as to why they were removed from the register.  My information is that they were offering goods of excellent quality, and I can speak with authority, because a firm dealing with them has dealt with them for the past 70 years&mdash;one of the oldest in the country and one that was producing excellent commodities before ever there was any question of a tariff at all.  They never sought tariffs or anything else to enable them to operate, and they were able to do an excellent business in this country.  They themselves have been in business for I do not know how long &mdash;over 100 years at any rate&mdash;and suddenly they are removed from the register of approved contractors.  So far as I am aware, they have never been offered any opportunity of discovering why they were removed or who removed them.  They asked repeatedly for an opportunity to make their case.  After great delay, I succeeded in getting an undertaking from the Minister that he would furnish me with the charges, and he did so very courteously.  I forwarded that to the <Col N="118" /> firm, and nothing has been heard since. Will this firm be given an opportunity of seeing the Minister and laying before him their answer as to any allegations against them so that they may be restored to the position of profit they once had and to which I think they are amply entitled?</P>
    <P>Now, I should like to direct attention to Section 13.  That, in fact, is the section designed to fortify existing tariff preferences extended to Irish manufacturers.  The people, who are going to pay the expenses of this Bill, ultimately, are the ratepayers, who pay for the supplies.  Those ratepayers are the ordinary small farmers of this country and, through their local authorities, they must buy equipment for the county hospital, the county home, the mental hospital, and the other institutions for which the local authority is responsible.  I am just taking four items that these bodies ordinarily have to buy: flannelette, sheeting, enamelled goods, and flour. In the case of each of these articles there is an ample tariff in existence&mdash; in my opinion, a grossly excessive tariff in existence.  The local authority, if it wants to purchase these articles, must pay that tariff if it wants to buy goods outside Ireland.  Take the case of flannelette.  It is an article which the poor buy largely and which the poor in the local institution must use for their clothing, night clothing, underclothing and so forth.  I tell this House now that I am charging the country people of this country a shilling a yard for the flannelette that used to sell for eightpence a yard, and I am doing that because there is a tariff on flannelette from Great Britain and I cannot buy it.  I have to buy it in Ireland or else pay the tariff on the flannelette that comes in.  The result is that for what they ought to be getting at eightpence a yard they are paying a shilling, and paying 1/6 for what used to cost a shilling before the tariff went on.  Those are the facts. What the people used to pay fourpence for, they now have to pay sixpence for, and the result is that they have to go in poor clothes or worse clothes than they used to be able to afford.</P>
    <P>Nobody who is comfortably off, or who has a large income, buys this kind <Col N="119" /> of flannelette, but almost every poor person uses it extensively and depends on it very largely for warmth and comfort in the winter months.  Every one of those people at present are paying a tax of approximately 50 per cent. on the flannelette they buy.  Of course, immediately there will be an answer from the opposite side that there is not a tax of 50 per cent.  I do not believe it is 50 per cent.  I believe it is 30 per cent., or so.  That is a tax on the cost price, but when the flannelette is costing sixpence and you pay 30 per cent., it is costing you about 8? pence.  In fact, it costs 8? pence, which is a little better, and you charge a shilling for that because the shopkeeper takes a profit, not on the cost price of the article in Manchester, but in his shop, and if he has to pay out money to the Revenue Commissioners in duty on an article coming in, he has got to get his profit on that, because he is out of money so long as the stuff remains on his shelf. Accordingly, a duty of 30 per cent. really means, for the person buying the article for consumption, a tax of from 40 per cent. to 50 per cent.  I mentioned this item of flannelette time and again here in this House because I am well acquainted with the subject. When I stand behind my counter and sell flannelette, I know well what it costs and I know the circumstances of the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Sir, but the local authority has to buy that flannelette. I am putting the case that, as a result of this Bill, what will happen is that not only is the local authority going to pay the tariff but that it is going to be further constrained now to buy the article from a particular individual and give long contracts to particular individual manufacturers in this country&mdash;further to protect the very vested interests that have been built up by the tariff I have described.  If the tariff is going to put an increase of 50 per cent., what is the tariff, plus the protection <Col N="120" /> afforded in Section 13, going to cost?</P>
      <P>The consumer in this country is the same individual whom I have been describing.  The consumers are the ratepayers of the country.  I submit with respect that the trouble about this House is that we do not apply our minds to the day-to-day conditions of the people in the country.  Everything is discussed in a vacuum.  Nobody ever follows out in his mind the ultimate effect upon the individual citizen of what we do here.  We slap a tariff on an import or we pass Section 13 but no one ever follows out the workings of Section 13 on the individual whom the section affects.  It is only we who are down in the country seeing how Section 13 operates who are in a position to report to the House on the practical results of this kind of legislation. How may Deputies know if they put a tariff of 30 per cent. on an ordinary article of daily use in the household, that this tariff of 30 per cent. is going to operate to raise the cost of the article 50 per cent?  I do not think any Deputy would expect that to happen.  The last person to guess it would be the Minister for Local Government and Public Health. The reason is that he has no experience of these things.  You take, for instance, sheeting and you know how large that bulks in the daily cost of the average householder.  Now I do not think I exaggerate when I say that the ordinary consumer is paying 1/6 a yard for sheeting which is not worth more than 11d. per yard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>They do.  That is the trouble with the Minister.  He is depending on a body of civil servants who have very little knowledge of these things themselves.  They are sitting in the Custom House and would not know flannelette from sheeting.  When they need one of these articles they tell their wives to go out and buy it.  If they had to go out to buy these things themselves they would come home with Turkish towelling.  The Dublin Board of Health does not buy flannelette across the counter.  It buys larger quantities of flannelette than Clerys. They really buy it in larger quantities and they pay the tariff.  But under Section 13 they will pay an additional charge which the producers will be able to levy on them.  I think I have made my point clear, and the Minister's intervention has stressed that.  Section 14 has been referred to by Deputy Benson. I have no doubt the Minister will meet Deputy Benson there.  In the event of an emergency presenting itself it is not right to ask the doctor to make himself criminally liable, under sub-section (2). The purpose of the Act is clear, and local authorities under the legislation anticipated to-day are not going to do something that the Bill directs them not to do except in special circumstances. I suggest that the Minister should either withdraw sub-section (3) of 14, or else put in a further sub-section providing that sub-section (3) will not apply in any case where the medical officer or the other responsible official certifies that a general emergency exists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>When this legislation was first introduced in this House it had my fullest support.  At that time, which is now some years ago, I was fully conscious of the fact that the intention of the Department of Local Government and Public Health was to safeguard the position of the local authorities, and to try to secure for them fair and healthy competition for the sort of articles they would require during the year at a price which they could meet.  It strikes me now that this Bill concerns itself more with protecting the contractors than with protecting the local authorities.  But now under Section 13 the position of local <Col N="122" /> authorities seems to be disregarded altogether.  And the Minister is concerning himself with the contractors. On the question as to the estimate of the local authorities of what their requirements should be at certain times of the year, I submit to the Minister that so far as the comparatively small local authorities are concerned, it would be absolutely impossible for them to estimate what their requirements would be over a period of 12 or 15 months ahead.  Let us take one small example.  Say a local authority in an ordinary year were to get a certain number of picks, shovels and spades.  In all probability they would be estimating on what they had got for the corresponding period previously. But if, during the course of that year for which they were asked to estimate their requirements, they found that certain moneys were given by the Government in the way of relief grants, it would then be necessary for the local authorities to get perhaps five or six times as many of these particular articles such as spades or shovels as they had in the previous year.  Under Section 13, if the local authority underestimate their requirements, and if it is found that more of a particular article is required, the contractor is given <i>carte blanche</i> to charge any price he likes after the estimate which the local authority, through the Minister for Local Government and Public Health required, is fulfilled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, when the estimate is high and the local authority does not need all that they contracted for, the contractor can dump down the full estimate, and the local authority must take it whether it needs it or not.  I think that sort of legislation should not be passed.  Under another section the local authority is prohibited from taking any goods of a certain kind through a local contractor.  This system generally speaking, was accepted by the public as being a good system so far as the local authorities were concerned. Up to now the local authority could purchase goods at the same price as quoted by the contractor to the Combined Purchasing Board, or at a lesser price, the local authority was permitted to take these goods from a local merchant.  That permission is now <Col N="123" /> being removed through the medium of Section 14 of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I believe that there is going to be an outcry amongst local ratepayers because of this fact.  For that reason I would ask the Minister to reconsider the situation which is being created by the adoption of this section.  To my mind that provision was a sort of safety valve to prevent rings being formed by certain contractors to the Combined Purchasing Board.  In some cases only two or three contractors would be able to supply a certain commodity, and one can conceive rings being set up in a case of that kind.</P>

      <P>I suggest that the effect of the local authorities being permitted to purchase from local traders where prices were equal to or less than the prices quoted by the Combined Purchasing Board has had the effect of keeping prices at a fairly low level, and it is a pity that the Minister is not permitting this to continue.  I repeat that this Bill shows more concern for the contractors than for the local authorities.  Generally speaking, the principle of combined purchasing is a good one, but this Bill is too drastic in its provisions, and should be amended on the Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been a supporter of combined purchasing from the period since it was introduced, and during the same period I have also been a member of several local boards. I became a supporter of the principle because I was led to believe that combined purchasing would be of great benefit to the country and to the small industries we had here at the time. We were told then that the system would help to keep those industries going, that it would be the means of giving more employment, and of providing a reduction in rates for the ratepayer.  In spite of all that, what I find is that since the system was introduced, practically all our small industries that were expected to receive so much support from it have dwindled away, and are being replaced by bigger industries.  The latter are being subsidised by the State, and are <Col N="124" /> obtaining the contracts to the local institutions.  That is the position in the West of Ireland.  I think that is most unfair to the shopkeeper and merchant in the country town.  He has to pay, first of all his share of the subsidy that goes to those bigger industries, and they in turn compete against him in his business.  As a matter of fact, those bigger industries have a monopoly now in the supply of articles to the different public institutions. That has another drawback in this way, that there is an increase in unemployment, due to the disappearance of the smaller industries which were in the country when combined purchasing was introduced, and that have since disappeared.</P>
      <P>What I would suggest is that a preference be given to articles produced in a particular county or province and supplied to particular institutions.  That is not being done, but I think it should be.  It would have the effect of providing additional employment in the areas where these institutions are situated, and would afford some measure of relief to the people who are providing for the upkeep of these institutions.  I hope the Minister will bear that point in mind. I would like to know from him what percentage of the fish supplied to public institutions in Éire is taken from Irish waters.  Communications which I have received from West Galway indicate that the fishermen there cannot get a buyer to take the fish from them, with the result they have to dump it back in the sea again.  I had a letter to that effect within the last month. That is a sad state of affairs, in view of the fact that we are supposed to have a Sea Fisheries Association active in that part of the country.  I have never seen that body show any activity. I think I only saw their fish van in the rural areas in the West on six occasions. I would also like to have some information on that point from the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is the Minister's duty to do so.  I take it the position is that when the inmates of <Col N="125" /> those public institutions are not supplied with fish taken from Irish waters, they have to be supplied with rice instead.  That should not be, and I think the Minister should take steps to remedy that situation.  Whatever Department of State is concerned should certainly see to it that those public institutions are, as far as possible, supplied with fish caught by Irishmen.  It may be that they are, or it may not, but if they are not, then something should be done to remedy the situation.  Even if to do so costs a little bit more, I do not think the ratepayers will grumble because it will mean keeping more men in employment in the fishing industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Section 13 of the Bill reference has been made to the fact that it is going to give additional protection to Irish industry over and above that already afforded by tariffs.  I would remind the members of the Opposition that we are engaged at the present time in the work of industrial development, and that we are only a very short time engaged in starting a number of industries, all of which require an experimental period of at least ten years before their success can be assured.  One of the things that enables an industry to succeed is to have substantial orders for goods from local authorities.  If there is anything in the Bill which prevents industries from receiving these substantial orders, the result, I submit, will be that the cost of production will go up in respect of the articles which are required by local authorities.  It is to be hoped that the effect of the Bill will be to assist the general programme of industrial development which has been approved by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the matter of compelling local authorities to purchase Irish made goods, it has been the experience of associations like the Industrial Development Association, which has a record and a history of 33 years behind it, that, long before the period of high tariffs and the period when industry had adequate protection, local authorities showed a very considerable prejudice in the matter of purchasing goods of Irish manufacture.  That prejudice remains still.  It is one of the <Col N="126" /> most undesirable features of our national life.  One of the things for which additional protection is required, over and beyond the protection required to start industry, is in virtue of the differences in the cost of production in industry here and in England. Section 13 will enable industries to function and to overcome the prejudicial effects of that undesirable feature in our national life to which I have referred.  It will afford them the protection that is absolutely essential as far as that particular matter is concerned. As regards flannelette and sheeting which are bought by local authorities, there is a new industry established in Athlone for making these commodities.  It has one of the finest plants of any industry in the country. The industry is immensely complex and requires years to become successful&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and if there is any industry which should receive additional protection to the ordinary protection of tariffs, I submit that it is that industry.</P>
      <P>Again, with regard to industries of small size&mdash;Deputy Broderick mentioned industries which employ very few people&mdash;there is no evidence in the Census of Production to show that there has been a wholesale decline of small industries in the country.  During the Great War, a number of the handcraft industries in the West of Ireland and in Donegal manufactured, at a very high rate of production, articles of more or less inferior quality&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Broderick Mr. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>And the local authorities bought from them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but after the war there was a normal decline in production. In addition, the prevailing habits and tastes have changed which made it difficult for several of the small handcraft industries to survive. So far as industries employing 20 or under employees are concerned, however, there is no evidence in the Census of Industrial Production that industries have been affected by the provisions of the Combined Purchasing Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of monopoly, if I were to examine, in detail, for the <Col N="127" /> benefit of the House, the articles purchased by local authorities, in respect of the vast majority of them, it would be found that they have quite an extensive choice and a number of factories from which they can purchase.  In the case of some of the newer industries, where the market is small, they may have a rather limited choice.  There, again, the point arises that these industries must be given an opportunity of supplying substantial orders, if they are to succeed, and if the cost of production is to be maintained at as low a rate as possible.  I submit that Section 13 of the Bill is absolutely essential, if it is to be in conformity with the general industrial policy of the country which was approved at the last election.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very interested in the debate on this subject.  I have been interested in this question of combined purchasing for a great many years.  I had no hand, act or part in its inauguration in 1920.  It was inaugurated, to the relief of many representatives of local authorities at <Col N="128" /> that time, by the present Leader of the Opposition in the first Dáil, and I was very pleased when I heard of it. I had been a member of some local authorities in Dublin for a number of years and I sat, with others, on supplies committees of various public institutions in the city.  I had experience over a good many years of how rings were formed by contractors for a variety of goods that were used by local institutions and how, in that way, prices were forced up.  With regard to some items, the quality of the goods, more often that not, was as low as some of the contractors dared to supply, and there was very little remedy.  It was probably having all that in mind that Deputy Cosgrave, and those who acted with him in 1920, introduced this system.  Deputy Cosgrave had also considerable experience of the working of local authorities in the City of Dublin and he would not have introduced it at that time unless he believed that this system, or some other system of the kind, was necessary and would probably remedy the situation which members of local authorities were up against so far as contractors were concerned.</P>
      <P>This system has been in operation for 18 years.  It started some time in 1921 with some local authorities and gradually they were all brought in. There are loopholes in the Act which has been in operation since 1925.  One section, particularly, leaves it open to local authorities to purchase goods locally, provided they do not have to pay a higher price than that offered by a contractor to the combined purchasing system.  Our experience has shown that if we leave that section in and leave the road open to local purchase, the combined purchasing system will not, and cannot, be as efficient as we believe it should be.</P>

We believe that it has worked to the benefit of the local authorities, their inmates, the ratepayers and also to the benefit of Irish industry.  We are absolutely certain that all these have benefited from the combined purchasing system.  Nobody, I must say, has attempted to discuss this in exactly a Party spirit or from that point of view, except that Deputy Dillon had to get in a few welts at the tariffs.  He is entitled to that, although I agree with the Ceann Comhairle, if I may say so with respect, that what Deputy Dillon said on tariffs was entirely out of order.

In respect of every article, it gets better value for an institution, and, generally, at a price less than that at which the ordinary article was supplied to local institutions.  That is the history of combined purchasing.  In varying degrees, anything from 5 to 40 per cent. of the goods are of better class and the price is lower.</P>

      <P>We offered him the opportunity of writing or being heard, and we heard nothing from him since. He will have an opportunity in another week or two of submitting a tender again, and I shall be largely guided in respect of it by the committee of members of local authorities, who are my chief advisers in this matter. Deputies will see that there is a strong case for giving contractors, especially for goods like flannelette, tweeds, sheeting, etc., an idea at the commencement of the year, when they are being asked to send in their tenders, of the amount they will be required to supply.  The committee who examined this matter were satisfied in that regard.  They made recommendations with regard to the amendments to be included in this Bill, and they considered that it would mean a saving to the contractors if they were told in advance the amount they would be required to furnish.  If contractors have that information, and know that the goods will be taken off their hands, they are prepared to meet local authorities to the extent of bringing about a reduction in price.  As ordinary businessmen, they must guard against risk.  Any risk we leave them means an increase of price.  At present, many of the well-managed institutions in different parts of the country do make estimates and give contractors an idea of the amount of goods they will require.  With long experience, many of them can forecast very accurately the amount of their requirements.  In case they use up more than usual of a particular article during the year, they can order again. If they see a fall in price they may wait until the next contracting period.  If they leave material on the hands of the contractor, the Minister has to decide what percentage they may have to pay in addition.  They might have to pay an extra 5 per cent., but the Minister will be there to safeguard the local authority against being bled by any contractor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the standard of the goods supplied, I should like to emphasise <Col N="133" /> that the reports we have got from local authorities and from the committee, whom we meet a couple of times a year and sometimes more, show that the standard has improved wonderfully since the introduction of combined purchasing.  Deputy Brodrick was interested in some of the smaller industries.  I could produce a list of small industries which have been kept alive by combined purchasing in the West of Ireland.  Some small industries may have disappeared, but their disappearance had nothing to do with combined purchasing.  Some industries have been established, some kept alive, some improved and some have been given increased production as a result of the combined purchasing system. The committee have been helping and encouraging them, and an endeavour has been made to secure that they got a fair share of the contracts, where that was possible.  The committee have gone out of their way, where they felt they could legitimately do that, to help small industries by dividing contracts, and other Ministers for Local Government, as well as myself, have endeavoured to help the smaller industries.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bennett spoke about a local contractor supplying tobacco that was of poor quality, in the opinion of somebody who used it. If the local authority were absolutely satisfied that the tobacco was not up to the standard, there was nothing to prevent their buying proper tobacco and charging the contractor with the extra cost.  They have power under the Act of 1925 to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Brennan who raised a question about prices, making certain that the prices would be right. I have already said, and I repeat it for the Deputy's benefit, that when we <Col N="134" /> had an idea that there was an effort being made, by rings or otherwise, to keep up prices and make the local authorities pay more than we thought was a reasonable price for certain goods, we took steps to defeat that, and we did successfully defeat it in every case that came under my notice since I became the Minister.  That is one thing that the committee keeps a very close eye on.  There is power given, I think it is under Section 15, to a local authority or its officials, to purchase goods in an emergency.  There is power given to the Minister to make regulations to provide for that, and I have never heard of a case, where goods were bought from other than an official contractor in an emergency, where an official was penalised, provided everything else was all right.</P>

      <P>I was very sorry to hear Deputy Bennett emphasising that the contractor was being made secure and the ratepayer was not being given much thought or security. The whole purpose of the Bill is to get better value for the ratepayer. That has been achieved in the past and it will be achieved to a greater extent under the new Act.  The contractor also is getting something in this Bill, a certain amount of security for the contracts he will enter into, that the stuff be taken off him and there will be security with regard to price.  But the whole purpose of the Bill is to get better value for the ratepayer and taxpayer, for patients in the institutions, in hospitals and county homes, in mental hospitals and in other institutions all over the country. They get better butter, better tea, better tweeds, boots, and everything of the kind that is purchased by the local authorities for the inmates of these institutions.  Goods of all kinds are improved by anything from 5 to 50 per cent. and the cost, generally speaking, is less than it used to be when purchases were made through local contractors.  There were many other questions raised, but I think <Col N="137" /> they were more appropriate to the Committee Stage of the Bill, on which stage we can go into them in greater detail.

      <P>&ldquo;That this Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a Bill to continue the Trade <Col N="138" /> Loans (Guarantee) Acts of 1924 and 1934.  Those Acts, as Deputies are no doubt aware, empowered the Minister for Industry and Commerce, subject to certain conditions and the sanction of the Minister for Finance, to guarantee or grant loans proposed to be raised for the purpose of carrying out a capital undertaking or carrying on a manufacturing undertaking where the expenditure of such loans in the manner proposed was calculated to promote employment or were loans the application of which was calculated to promote a reduction in the retail prices of essential commodities. As Deputies are possibly familiar, no case of the granting of a loan arose and such loans as were guaranteed were for the first of the two purposes I have mentioned.  There was no case of an application which had any bearing on the question of retail prices. The powers conferred to grant or guarantee loans expired in June last in accordance with the relevant section of the Act of 1933.</P>
    <P>Following the general lines of the earlier Acts, the Bill now before the Dáil proposes to revive the powers which were exercisable under these Acts and, after consultation with an advisory committee and with the concurrence of the Minister for Finance, again to empower me as Minister for Industry and Commerce for a period of five years to guarantee or grant loans for the same purposes.</P>
    <P>I presume that, in moving the Second Reading of this Bill, it is necessary to refer to the fact that the majority report of the Commission of Inquiry into Banking, Currency and Credit, recommended the repeal of the trade loans system on various grounds.  The majority report of the Banking Commission was a valuable document in many respects, but I think many of those who read the section relating to the Trade Loans Guarantee Acts will agree with me that it was unconvincing and that the facts adduced do not appear to lead at all to the conclusions which the majority of the members of the commission reached.  They supported their recommendation to repeal the trade loan system on various grounds.  They said <Col N="139" /> that the high rate of loss falling on the Exchequer had led them to the conclusion that such machinery is unsuitable for handling industrial loans in a manner that provides adequate safeguards for the interests of the taxpayer and that such business should be left to the ordinary financial organisations, although it is quite clear from the body of the report that ordinary financial organisations do not regard that type of business as coming within their sphere of activity.  They said, further, that the trade loan guarantee system amounted to a State guarantee of banking accommodation which was, in the opinion of the majority of the commission, peculiarly objectionable, so long as loans for working capital were made available.  Thirdly, they argued that the operation of the system resulted in the Government having a direct financial interest in industries, the success or failure of which might be largely dependent upon the exercise of Ministerial powers, which would be a source of embarrassment when decisions which should have regard to the general interest, or the public interest in general, had to be made.  I should like to deal with these points in order.</P>
    <P>With regard to the first point, I think I should point out that the losses which have so far fallen on the Exchequer, since the coming into operation of the 1933 Act, constitute a very small percentage indeed of the total aggregate sum, in respect of which guarantees have been given.  Since 1933, I have given guarantees in respect of loans amounting approximately to the principal sum of £847,500, while the amount lost to date in respect of principal and interest does not exceed £13,000.  As against that loss, I think it is fair to mention that there are at present, or there were at the end of 1938, the latest date for which figures are available, 66 industrial concerns being actively carried on, in consequence of the facilities available under these Acts.  The total number of persons employed in the industries concerned exceeded 5,600 and the salaries and wages paid for that year exceeded £500,000.  The number employed and the wages fund in the assisted industries, <Col N="140" /> would appear to be a very good justification for any risk assumed by the State in the past in guaranteeing loans.</P>
    <P>It is quite true, however, that the net loss to the Exchequer in respect of guarantees given prior to 1929, under the first Act, were very heavy.  The total amount lost was £195,000 out of guarantees amounting to the principal sum of £334,000.  That very heavy loss was due almost entirely to three cases which I think are familiar to Deputies &mdash;the Irish Glass Bottle Company, Alesbury Bros., and the Fresh Meat Company.  The circumstances of each case were debated here in the Dáil and I do not think it is necessary to refer to them again.  I suggest, therefore, that there is little foundation for the objection to the continuation of this system in the financial results to date. In any event, it is clear that some arrangement must be made which will permit of industries of a particular type getting financial accommodation within this country.  The great majority of our industrial concerns are comparatively small.  I mean that they are not of a size which would permit of their going to the public for capital and, where those immediately associated with the conduct of the enterprise, or the friends of those people, are not in a position to put up the capital required for their conduct from their private resources, some means must be found by which the additional capital can be made available. The banking and the financial institutions of the State contend that it is not their function to provide financial accommodation of that kind and, in the absence of a trade loan guarantee system, there would, in fact, be no arrangement for the provision of that accommodation.</P>
    <P>It is true, of course, that the type of case, in respect of which trade loan guarantee applications are made, are more speculative than those in respect of which no approach to the Department of Industry and Commerce is considered necessary, consequently some percentage of loss has to be anticipated. I think, however, our experience to date is sufficient to enable us to come to the conclusion that the percentage of loss at any time is not líkely to be so great as to offset the very substantial <Col N="141" /> advantages which have accrued so far, and which will accrue in future, from the operation of the system.  The commission's conclusion that State machinery is unsuitable for handling industrial loans in a manner to provide adequate safeguard for the taxpayers is I think, therefore, unsustainable and their contention that such business should be left to existing financial institutions is pointless in the absence in the country of any financial institutions which regard the making of such loans as their business.  In our endeavours to establish new industries and to extend and develop existing industries, we would not have met with the measure of success attained if there had not been available machinery of the type provided by the Trade Loans Acts.</P>
    <P>I have already pointed out that the banking houses and other financial organisations of the State have made it quite clear that they do not as a rule regard as acceptable applications for loans expressed to extend over long periods of repayment.  The majority of the loans so far guaranteed by the State are for periods up to 12 years, and, therefore, would not be dealt in at all by the ordinary financial organisation without the State's guarantee. Further, the matter of security has to be taken into consideration, and it will be readily appreciated that in many cases, particularly in those cases where industries new to this country are about to be established, the promoters would not have been able to procure all the capital required if they had not at their disposal the services of the Trade Loans Acts.  Ordinary financial institutions will not advance money except on adequate security, which is not always available in such cases, and that in itself was proof of the necessity for reviving the trade loans system. The commission's objection to the guarantee or granting of loans for working capital is a purely theoretical one, and even the theory is open to question.  I can only say that since 1933 such borrowers have in the main found no more difficulty in repaying their annual instalments than has been the case where loans were guaranteed solely for the carrying out of capital works. When the terms of the legislation were <Col N="142" /> framed to debar the giving of guarantees in respect of loans for working capital, our predecessors had to devise tortuous ways and means of getting round that legal provision in order to give the assistance they wished to provide in the cases that came before them, and the rather bad financial results of the operation of the trade loans system in their term of office cannot be entirely separated from the existence of that limitation upon their freedom of action.  In any event, the matter was debated here in the Dáil at considerable length in 1933, and the Act of 1933 gave power to guarantee loans for working capital.  I propose that that power should be continued.</P>
    <P>With regard to the commission's objection that the operation of the trade loans system resulted in the Government having a direct financial interest in industries whose success or failure was largely dependent upon the exercise of Ministerial powers, which might prove a source of embarrassment when decisions had to be taken, I can only say that in deciding such matters as industrial protective policy no embarrassment was experienced, nor was the public interest disregarded.  It is, in fact, rather difficult to know where the majority of the Banking Commission got the information that any such embarrassment was caused, or likely to be caused.  Certainly, those who have read the minutes of evidence will find nothing therein which would justify the commission in arriving at that conclusion.  So far as the public is aware, they had before them no information which would justify them in reaching it.  In any event, we consider that in the circumstances of this country it is necessary that those powers should be retained.  Cases will inevitably arise where industrial projects of reasonable soundness will be unable to get capital subscribed by the public for various reasons, the main reason being the relative smallness of the amount of capital required, or will be unable to get their capital by reason of the fact that their existence depends upon the maintenance of Government protection.  There will be other cases where new industrial projects will be unable to get capital subscribed in the ordinary way here by reason of the <Col N="143" /> novelty of the enterprise in this country. Even if there were no other reasons, those alone would, I think, justify us in our decision to continue this system.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, however, there is a type of cases in which it may be necessary to take into account factors other than purely financial factors.  The view was taken that in the case of companies whose loans are guaranteed by the State, the trade loans system permits of the extension of accommodation or leniency in the occurrence of arrears to a greater extent than the administration of a public organisation would permit.  Again, the majority of the loans guaranteed in recent years have helped industrialists to capture portion of the import market, and that was and must still be an important industrial objective.  A further important reason for reviving the trade loans system is to be found in the type of case where the location of the industry is, because of social considerations or Government policy, fixed in a rural area, where purely financial considerations would dictate its location in Dublin or some other large centre.</P>
    <P>The whole matter has been very carefully considered, and the Government is satisfied that the wiser policy is to continue this trade loans guarantee system for another period.  The Bill now before the House proposes that such revival should be given legislative effect, that is to say, that for a period of five years guarantees may be given or loans granted, and that a sum not exceeding one million pounds be fixed as the limit up to which guarantees or loans shall be given or made under this new Act.  The Bill, with the exception of certain clauses relating to the provision of any moneys required to fulfil guarantees already given or those which may be given under the proposed new Act, the payment of certain sums into the Exchequer, and the statements of accounts to be laid before the Oireachtas, follows the lines of the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts of earlier years. I consider that it is very desirable that the proposals embodied in the Bill should receive legislative sanction as speedily as possible, so that the rendering of any further financial assistance <Col N="144" /> required by an industry may proceed without delay.</P>

      <P>The speech the Minister has made is a very disappointing one.  Recently, as he indicated, we had the report of the Banking Commission, and part of the work of the members of that commission was the investigation of the whole ground of the capitalisation of industry.  The Minister proposes the adoption of a continuance of a policy that the members of the Banking Commission recommended against.  The Minister suggested that the majority of the Banking Commission recommended against, but, as a matter of fact, there was only one voice raised in favour of the continuance of the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act, and that was the voice of the chairman of the Industrial Credit Corporation, who simply made the recommendation that it should be continued, without going out of his way to make any case at all for it, or to deal with the particular point of objection to the Trade Loans (Guarantee) system by his colleagues on the commission. We do not propose to oppose the Minister's proposals in this measure, but we think this was an occasion on which the Minister should deal thoroughly with the matter.  The only object in introducing this measure is to help to provide capital for the development of Irish industry, either to establish new Irish industries or to provide capital for existing industries, where additional capital is wanted. The commission pointed out that there were two things necessary for the provision of capital for industries, the availability of capital, and the desire of the people to put it into industry, and the machinery for doing so.</P>

    <P>The Minister complained that for providing capital for certain classes of industry there is no machinery, except the machinery that is either provided or introduced by the presence of an Act empowering the Government to give a guarantee.  The attitude, as I understand it, of the members of the Banking Commission was that the Industrial Credit Corporation was practically entirely capitalised from the State, to the extent of about £812,000; by only a few pounds from any other source; that <Col N="145" /> all risks were borne by the State; that the machinery itself ought to be able to deal with whatever capital was required for any industries that gave any promise of satisfactory development or stability here; and that it should be able to supply additional capital to existing companies that wanted it.  It is because of defects in that particular situation, that the members of the Banking Commission consider should be remedied by some action of one kind or another, that the continuance of these powers are tolerable. Indeed, they are only tolerable. The Minister attempted to make the case that the State has not recently suffered any great loss as a result of the operations of the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act.  I think in view of the presentation of the side of the case that has been made public the Minister ought to be more explicit.  The Banking Commission have pointed out that under the Act for the first period&mdash;that is the period before the present Government came into office&mdash;a substantial sum of money was lost.</P>
    <P>On page 279 the report indicates that outside guarantees given in respect of the Harbour Commissioners of Dundalk and Waterford guarantees to the extent of £240,840 were given.  In the same paragraph it indicates that the State had to pay in principal and interest in respect of which there was default £194,549.  If we eliminate from the total amount of loans given and guaranteed in the first period, the total amount of loans guaranteed to these two bodies, the amount of loss to the taxpayers was 82 per cent. of the total amount of capital guaranteed.  If we turn to page 3 of the Minutes of Evidence, question 24, the Secretary of the Department for Industry and Commerce in reply to a question said: &ldquo;I do not think I am at liberty to express a personal opinion.&rdquo;  On the same page, in answering question 19, he said: &ldquo;I do not think that there is anything in the present procedure which would lead us to expect a lower ratio of liability; but, of course, I should say that any conclusion about ratios in a matter of this kind may be entirely fallacious.&rdquo;  The Secretary, in reply to another question, would hold out he hope that the proportion of <Col N="146" /> failure would be lower than in the past, and this view would seem to be corroborated by a certain tendency in recent policy in this connection.  As to any thought out expression of opinion on the matter, we have it in the report issued in December last, that the Secretary of the Department was not at liberty to express a personal opinion. Therefore, we must imply it is his official opinion that the proportion of failure was not likely to be less than in the past.</P>

      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy, but when he says that the Secretary of the Department, in his evidence, said that he did not express a personal opinion, that was in relation to a particular matter that was dealt with in the previous question, as to whether any defects in the system, as operated up to date, could be remedied in some reasonable way.  He replied that the Minister was satisfied generally with the position as it exists at present, and said: &ldquo;I do not think there is any defect that he thinks calls for legislative remedies.&rdquo;  It was in relation to that matter that the Secretary of my Department was asked if he had a personal opinion, and not in any relation to any other matter, on which very frequently he would have his personal opinion.</P>

      <P>Then there is question 202, by Mr. Sweetman:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;You told us earlier that you were unable to anticipate any very considerable improvement in the immediate future in the amount of failures under these loans.  Is not that right?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The answer was &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  The only thing we are left in doubt about is whether it was the personal opinion of the Secretary of the Department of Industry and Commerce, or whether it was the official opinion he gave, when he said, as recorded in the Report, that he could not hold out any hope that the future proportion of failures would be lower than in the past.  It is an unsatisfactory position for the House, concerned as it is with the satisfactory provision of capital for Irish industries, and for the secure <Col N="147" /> development of industries, and the increased employment that would result.  The report indicates that the important thing is the question of facilities for linking up capital with the necessities of Irish industries, and the psychological factor in the industrial or economic situation here, that will induce people to invest in industry. They point out that it is the psychological factor is the important one.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister intends the Industrial Credit Corporation to make a contribution to the building up of Irish industries.  What else is it there for?  What else was £812,000 put into the Industrial Credit Corporation for? The Minister is aware, as is pointed out in the report, that no interest has yet been paid on any capital put into the Industrial Credit Corporation. That is one reason why I feel, while sharing the opinions of the Banking Commission Report on the objections to the Trade Loans (Guarantee) system, that I cannot oppose this. There is nothing but State money in the Industrial Credit Corporation, and there does not seem to be any factor in the situation that would induce loose capital to filter through the Industrial Credit Corporation into Irish industries.  Another factor in the situation is that there are onerous regulations to be kept by people accepting a guarantee under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act.  In some cases there are even more onerous and more objectionable conditions to be complied with when money is got from the Industrial Credit Corporation, in that the Industrial Credit Corporation very often insist that they will nominate members of the board carrying on the industry that applies to them for assistance, and may, in that way, interfere with the mentality and interfere with the direction of the people originally applying.  So that, what the Minister has to deal particularly with at the present time, if Irish industry is to be established and put on its feet, is the psychological aspect of the situation. I think he should be more explicit and make clearer to the House what is meant by the opinion expressed by the Secretary to the Department with regard to the future proportion <Col N="148" /> of failures.  I have said that in the past for the loans guaranteed in the first period the State had to pay in defaulting interest and principal 82 per cent. of the total loans that were guaranteed outside those given to public bodies.  The Minister says that he has only lost, since 1933, £13,000. I took it to be £13,000.  I know an industry at the present time that is going to lose the Minister about £8,000 of a loan guaranteed for £10,000.  I thing it is an industry that others in industrial life in the country who have been affected by it complain that it has been the cause of the Minister's interference with them, and has interfered with the safety and the security of their industries.  So that, the Minister's figure of £13,000 is fantastic as an estimate of the losses that have been sustained since 1933 in the light of what, in the first place, some of us know, and, in the second place, the opinion given by the Secretary to the Department.</P>
    <P>I think that the House should get some explanation from the Minister as to what are the conditions that have to be fulfilled by companies who get a guaranteed loan.  It would be essential that we should have from the Minister information as to how the companies are expected to so operate their finances as to keep money in their industry after the loan has been paid back.</P>
    <P>One of the things that has been said in favour of the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act is that it enabled industries of a particular type to get a loan of a percentage of the capital that they had already invested when they might not easily be able to get it outside.  I think somewhere in the report or in the evidence one particular company has been specially mentioned as having benefited materially by the fact that it was able to get a guaranteed loan under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act of an amount that was a substantial amount but that was only part of its capital.  I take it that every company that gets a loan from the Minister under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act is expected so to conduct its business that by the time that loan is paid back there will have been <Col N="149" /> added to the amount of capital in the company an amount equal to the amount that was guaranteed by loan. So that, on the guarantee side of things alone, I think the Minister has a lot more information to give the House and I think it would be essential that he should give it.</P>
    <P>But, there is another aspect of this matter.  The Minister suggests that it is only the more speculative businesses that are going to take advantage of trade loans. I do not see how that squares with the suggestions he makes to the House that there is no other way in which industries as a whole can capitalise themselves, except this particular way.  I would like to hear the Minister review the sources from which he expects Irish industry to get capital outside this particular machinery because it is certainly a fact that the greater part of the capital that will be got, say, in the next five years for Irish industry must be got outside the trade loans guarantee system.  The very fact that he says it is the more speculative type that are going to come looking for a trade loan makes us ask him to explain very fully and very completely to the House what he has in mind and to say what range of industry he contemplates is likely to be financed under this Bill in future because the taxpayer or the ratepayer is not going to be able to bear any substantial losses in the future.</P>
    <P>It seems to me an extraordinary thing that the opinion of the Secretary to the Department should be given in this particular way because, while the losses that were occasioned pre-1932 were occasioned by firms who were working under a moderate tariff, and some of them under no tariff at all, the companies that have been assisted since 1932 have been assisted inside a wall of big tariffs, quotas, restrictions, every blessed kind of protection and assistance that could be thought of.  The question arises as to whether that type of assistance is going to be continued or not but there again, bearing on the psychological factor in the situation of financing Irish industries, I think this occasion <Col N="150" /> also should have been taken by the Minister to develop the statements that he has already made on several occasions that he foresees substantial development of Irish industries in the near future.</P>
    <P>There are a number of things affecting the people who have capital at the present time and it is naturally the people inside Ireland who have capital that the Minister should be looking to to assist Irish industries. There are various sources from which we can get capital.  We can get capital by repatriating some of the Irish capital that is abroad.  We can get capital by the surplus of the agricultural industries.  We can get additional capital by the profits of our manufacturing companies here and we can get some of the capital that is loose and free in the hands of people at the present time.</P>
    <P>Now, a leading article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> this morning points out that since 1933 there has been a fall in our external assets of £21,595,000, and that the Banking Commission Report draws attention to the great undesirability of reducing the amount of capital that we have abroad if we are going to make any systematic way to avoid the bad influences on this country of the continuing adverse trade balance that we have.  So that we cannot expect any considerable amount of capital to be repatriated from outside in order to build up Irish industry in the future.  We cannot get much from the surplus profits of agriculture at the present time.  The trade agreement with Great Britain was made in the early part of last year.  If the Minister examines the trading accounts for the exports of live stock and live-stock products for the last six months and compares them with the exports of live stock and live-stock products for the year 1931, he will see that for the half-year alone in the export of these products we are over £4,000,000 short of what we were in 1931, although normal agricultural trading relations were established with the British under the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>
    <P>The depression that hit the world in 1929 and 1930 hit agriculture in this country only in 1931, and hit it to its <Col N="151" /> greatest effect in 1931.  That only reduced the export of live stock and live-stock products between 1930 and 1931 by something over £2,000,000.</P>
    <P>With the income of our farmers from the export of these matters £4,000,000 better the year of the deepest depression, we cannot expect any definite substantial contribution from the surplus moneys made in agriculture to assist Irish industries.  We are dependent upon influencing the people who have loose money internally in the country to use that money for the building up of our industries here, and except the Minister deals systematically and thoroughly with the matter and takes both this House and the country into his confidence as to what he foresees in the sound development of Irish industry in the next five years, he will not get over the shyness that people have about investing capital in Irish industry.  I think the Minister is aware that people are very shy about doing that at present, and one of the reasons is the atmosphere that has been created around those sections of the agreement made with Great Britain in the early part of the year as to the position of price control here.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister, both from the point of view of getting clear his policy in dealing with the British, and standing on solid ground from the point of view of encouraging people with capital to continue to develop and foster Irish industry, to give us, or if he is not in the position at present to give us, to set about giving the country clear ideas as to the particular direction, the particular branches of Irish industry that he hopes to stand over, foster, and secure here in such a way that will give us sound Irish industry without people feeling they are being robbed, fleeced or sat upon by a monopoly.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of encouraging him in that direction I should like to draw his attention to the position that exists between Great Britain and Australia. In the agreement made between Great Britain and Australia at Ottawa there were a number of clauses that might be said to be analogous to the clauses that are causing concern to Irish <Col N="152" /> industrialists and, as a matter of fact, to a large section of the people.  That Treaty was entered into in 1932.  In the summer of this year, and after the agreement between Great Britain and this country was signed, Australian Ministers and British Ministers had to meet again for the purpose of discussing a break down in their joint outlook on what the Treaty of 1932 actually meant.  When they came to discuss the matter the British, at any rate, signed a document agreeing that for the future they would accept the Australian opinion on what these clauses meant; that they would not, in fact, seek to impose on the Australians the British interpretation of these clauses.  In fact, the clauses which were supposed to embody some principles governing their mutual trade were found to be impracticable and they set about seeing whether they could find a new principle to enshrine in a new clause that would be practicable.</P>
    <P>This statement occurs in Section 7 of the agreement signed between three British Ministers and three Australian Ministers on 20th July, 1938:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They realise that it cannot be adopted without determining, subject of course to an exception in favour of manufacture of defence materials, as to which no ruling could be laid down in advance, what lines of development of secondary industry will be followed by Australia during the next few years&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>So that they allowed Australia to interpret the clauses with regard to price control and fair competition which are included in the 1932 agreement and they said that they could not adopt new principles and, therefore, could not come to any definite new agreement for trading until the Australians had decided what lines of development of their secondary industries would be followed by them during the next few years.</P>

      <P>What is the Trade Loan (Guarantee) Act for if not for <Col N="153" /> the purpose of building up and making industry here secure?  Are we out of order in discussing the lines upon which the development of Irish industry should be made secure?  What use is a Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act. guaranteeing the taxpayers' money, except an atmosphere is created which will enable industrialists, on the one hand, and men with capital, on the other, to make up their minds that the position here is such that they will have a chance of building up industry here?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it is for the purpose of asking this House to accept risks in order that capital may be provided to set up industries here, and I submit to you, Sir, that the industries that are going to be set up are the important things that require to be discussed here, because we would not be discussing capital at all, and we would not be discussing the risks we are asked to undertake here about that capital, if it were not that we wanted the industries. I am speaking here on the text in the opening of the Banking Commission's Report.  I shall read it out. Paragraph 418 says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;... There are at least two elements in this problem.  In the first place, it is necessary that owners of savings should have the disposition to invest them in domestic enterprises.  Secondly, it is necessary that, given such disposition, facilities should be readily available to enable the would-be investor to place his investment. While it is true that, to some extent, the provision of facilities for investment may create or stimulate a disposition to invest, it is clear that the psychological factor is the more important of the two.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How is the Minister catering for the improvement of the position so far as the psychological factor is concerned? He is introducing a measure here against the Banking Commission Report, and he is controverting, without doing it in any kind of a satisfactory way, the statement given by the Secretary of his Department that the losses that may be anticipated in the future in this particular way are not likely to be less than in the past, and he is telling us that it is only the more speculative industries that are likely to be developed in this particular way. He has also told us that there is no other machinery for capitalising industry except this particular way.  I am arguing here that, both for purposes of this particular Bill and for purposes of clearing the air in the country for the people whom we expect both to carry on industries and to finance them, he ought to clear the minds of this House and to clear the minds of the people as to what branches of industry he wants to concentrate <Col N="155" /> on in the next few years.  I am encouraging him in this by drawing his attention to the fact that the Australians, who made in 1932 a trade agreement somewhat similar to what we made in April last with the British, were, after six years, driven to meet the British, driven to get the British to accept their interpretation of the clauses that were in that agreement, driven to agree that they were really impracticable, and to find another principle, and, for the mutual benefit of the two countries, they themselves abandoned it and induced the British to sign an acceptance of the situation that they could not get that principle until it was known in what way Australia was going to develop the secondary industries in the years that were immediately coming.  In relation to that, they signed also this particular clause which, I think, should be quoted in full:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In making such an inquiry, the Commonwealth Government proposes to have regard to, <i>inter alia</i>, such important factors as&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the necessity for increased Australian population;</P>
    <P>(b)  the economics and future growth of primary production in Australia;</P>
    <P>(c)  the necessity, on national and economic grounds, for a continued development of Australian secondary industries;</P>
    <P>(d)  the defence needs of Australia;</P>
    <P>(e)  the maintenance of United Kingdom-Australian trade by effective preferences to the United Kingdom in Australia and to Australia in the United Kingdom;</P>
    <P>(f)  the need for new markets for Australian exports, and for foreign trade arrangements.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, a considerable amount of industry has been developed recently in this State since 1922.  It has been built up in a quick way and there are many unsatisfactory aspects with regard to it.  Both owners of industries and employees of industries, as well as the consuming public, are vitally interested <Col N="156" /> in what is going to be the future of these industries: their maintenance from the point of view of the conservation of the capital invested in them and the continuance of the employment in them; also the consumers, from the point of view of whether the goods to be turned out by these industries are going to be economically turned out, so far as the purchasing public is concerned.  The Minister is quite aware that there has been considerable, shall we say, irritation, and considerable difference of opinion, as well as, perhaps, a lot of general misconception and misrepresentation with regard to much of the recent Irish industrialism. It is perfectly well known that some companies are taking elaborate profits and that some of them may be in a very weak position: that some of them are not giving value for the money, but that, with a little attention, they might give more value for the money and be more secure. When, however, the Minister turns his mind to any aspect of providing capital for industries in the future, apart altogether from the way he is doing it, his mind should turn to the psychological factor of the present situation, and his mind should turn to clearing out of the situation, at the earliest possible moment, those doubts and misunderstandings that at the present time are injuring the Irish situation more than the want of capital.</P>
    <P>There is much more demand in the minds both of Irish workers and Irish industrialists for some kind of confidence in the continuance of their industries as they are at present than there is a demand for additional capital going into Irish industry.  I want to repeat that the capital we want is the capital that exists with the Irish people here inside in Ireland: that the Industrial Credit Corporation ought to be the type of machinery that would finance Irish industry, but that, while the condition exists that no public capital can be attracted to the Industrial Credit Corporation under the circumstances that exist, the Government stands responsibility for the whole of the capital that is in it; that the conditions under which the Industrial Credit Corporation work are, in many <Col N="157" /> instances, onerous and objectionable to people who have the management of industry here.  Apart from the question of the continuance of the present machinery, we do ask the Minister, even inside the small area that is covered by this Act, to give the House, even there, something that would give them more confidence in the general proposals.  He ought to disabuse the minds of the House and of the country of any misconception that may have been caused by the evidence given by the Secretary of the Department before the Banking Commission.  He ought to re-examine the things that he did examine and brought into the House to tell us that, since 1933, only £13,000 had been lost as a result of guarantees given under the Trade Loans Act.  He ought to recapitulate to the House what the regulations of his Department are in respect of bodies who take guarantees under this Bill, things that are calculated to make these companies financially sound when the hand of the State is taken away from them.  He might tell us what steps are really to be taken to prevent speculative projects such as he speaks of bringing additional costs to the ratepayers of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, I welcome this Bill.  I welcome it because I see one underlying principle there.  By a sensible and reasonable expenditure of our moneys, we are proposing to create and continue very necessary employment in this country.  I think any of us who looks ahead must realise that we are going to face, perhaps in a few short months, and certainly in a few short years, a very serious situation here with regard to unemployment unless things change.  There are in existence at the present time in the country a number of schemes such as the digging of sewers, the building of houses, and so on.  These schemes have absorbed into employment and are keeping in employment at the present moment a very large number of our population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy sure of that?  Does he not know that there was never more unemployment in the building trade than there is now?</P>

    <Col N="158" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>These schemes cannot go on for ever.  They are now gradually coming to an end, and we have to envisage a future where employment must be provided for our people.  In so far as this Bill is an attempt in that direction I welcome it.  But there are two matters in respect of this Bill to which I would like to draw attention. It is proposed that certain moneys be guaranteed or certain loans granted to corporations, companies or individuals. I would like to see some limitation by which Irish money, if advanced and guaranteed under the Bill, will fall into the hands and under the control of citizens of this country and not into the hands of people from outside this State.  I do not want the word to go around in other countries that if you have a speculative factory to start or a speculative industry to establish, Ireland is the place for it, because you have only to go there, see the Government, and they will give you what you want.  I welcome this Bill if the control of the money and the industries started under it are in the hands of our citizens alone.</P>
      <P>The second matter is in relation to the definition section.  The section setting out the persons to whom this money is to be made available is not broad enough in its direction.  Since this type of legislation was first introduced in 1924, followed by the various other Bills which were passed from time to time, culminating in the last Bill which expired last June, the definition section has been gradually expanded, and it has come now to include&mdash;I do not know whether it did so in the last Act&mdash;the advance of money and the guaranteeing of money for the purpose of building houses. That is a very excellent scheme, and one that may help to reduce unemployment, but unemployment in this country will always exist and continue to exist until the Government and the Minister recognise that apart from small factories and the building of houses, there is one great industry in this country which needs sustenance and assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If anybody is to get advantage out of this Bill, that advantage must come through some additional employment <Col N="159" /> being created.  It says that in the preamble to the Bill&mdash;&ldquo;calculated to promote employment&rdquo;.  Why does the Government exclude from the provisions of the Bill the biggest industry in this country, the only staple industry, the agricultural industry? Why are not the terms of this definition extended to the agricultural industry? Is the one industry in this country that is not to get a loan the industry carried on by the prospective employer of labour on the land?  Why should not that person be put in the same position as the person who wishes to start a small industry or factory in a country town?  Imagine the farmers of this country opening their papers to-morrow morning and, after all they have gone through, and the time that they have had this past winter, reading that there is going to be £1,000,000 of their money supplied for the purpose of starting little industries here and there, while their own farms are unstocked and while they have not got the wherewithal to purchase seeds and manures for the present season.  That is how this Bill is going to react upon the farming community.  That is how they are going to feel about this Bill.  Yet they represent the biggest industry and the biggest trade in the country.  That industry if properly handled and if legislation were properly introduced in its favour, would go a long way towards relieving unemployment.  I am not asking the Government in connection with this Bill to introduce legislation, except to put the farmer as a prospective employer of labour on the same terms as a person coming here to manufacture, say, tin cans or wireless, or anything else of that kind.  The man who is living on the land and who has been here for generations and generations should at least be put on the same level as the man who comes from some part of Europe into this country to start a factory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have preferred that my colleague, Deputy Mulcahy, when speaking on behalf of this Party, had said that they would oppose this Bill.  We have now for 17 years our own Government in this country. During all that time, to a greater or <Col N="160" /> lesser extent, industry has been spoon-fed. There are few industries on behalf of which a huge protective wall has not been raised in order to give them a monopoly in the home market. But a monopoly for these industries places a burden on the other industries that are not so protected.  I notice the distinction drawn by the previous speaker, Deputy Esmonde, when he referred to agriculture.  He referred to it as a staple industry.  He did not say it was a stable industry.  He need not be a bit afraid with regard to the suggestion that he made about the agricultural industry being given the benefits of this Bill.  Agriculture will not and cannot be given the benefits of this Bill, because one cannot lend money to a bankrupt.  One cannot lend money to an industry that during the last few years has been made bankrupt by the Government.  During the last six years I have warned the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he, above all Ministers of the Government, should look after agriculture and see that it is prosperous, because it is the profits arising out of agriculture that are going to make industry profitable. A famous European statesman said on the eve of the European War a remarkable thing about agriculture.  Prince Von Bülow, addressing the Agricultural Council of Germany on that occasion, said&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but he spoke sense and I listened to the Minister for Industry and Commerce when he was introducing this Bill and he spoke nonsense.  I will now try to speak a little sense to the Minister.  It will help him along the road even though he brushes aside the productive words of the investigations of the Banking Commission which his colleague set up.  Prince von Bülow said and it is no harm to quote it for the Minister, that</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Agriculture is the mother of the nation's wealth which industry employs.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No wonder that agriculture here, in view of the history of the past six or <Col N="161" /> seven years, is not able to provide the capital which industry now requires.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes to lend a maximum of £1,000,000 to industry, and the Minister has admitted the money is to be lent to doubtful industries&mdash;to industries that nobody else would lend money to.  Why?  There is one industry, the building industry, to which this Bill applies that I can speak of.  I am associated with a firm that, in the last ten years, has put up buildings to the value of in or about £500,000.  We never found any difficulty in getting money to finance the industry, provided we honoured our bond.  I do not believe there is an industry in this country that our banking institutions will not finance if they are satisfied that there is a fair prospect before it, and that the men connected with it are people who will honour their bond.  It is time that we got down to realities in this matter of industry.  What we want in this country is to start economic industries and not political industries: to start industries in localities that are suitable for them, and not in a locality or district suggested by a Fianna Fáil club.  Industry is not going to flourish if started by political resolutions.  If you want industry to succeed you must start it in a district suitable for its development by men of honour and honesty.  If those conditions are present we do not want a Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the objections made by the Banking Commission to the continuance of this trade loans system.  His comments on the reasons set forth in the report of the Banking Commission on that matter were laughable.  Are we going to treat seriously the report of men whose profession is finance?  If not, why did the Government go to the expense of setting up this commission to consider the financial position, and to report thereon?  The Banking Commission reported against the principle embodied in this Bill.  Yet the Dáil is being asked to pass something that financial experts have advised against. I think the House should be very slow to do anything of the kind.  The losses sustained under this trade loans (guarantee) legislation, both <Col N="162" /> under the previous Administration and the present one, have been so high as to sound a note of caution.  I would advise the Minister to be careful in the matter of financing people in industry who are purely speculative because such people will not put their backs into industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that money will be made available for the building of houses.  I would remind him of some of the utility societies who set about building houses.  I know of one which proposed to put up 500 houses. It offered a price for the land and its development that no business man would offer.  It had no money of its own, but was counting on what it would get under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act.  That particular scheme did not come off.  Why?  Not because any snag was discovered in it but because the local authority did not do the impossible.  I do not want to go into the case in any detail because it is not my desire to say anything about it that might give people the opportunity of being able to identify it.  I am sure the Minister has it before his mind's eye.</P>
    <P>As regards the building industry, I want to say that it requires no money. Builders will be got to build houses and to develop land if there is money among the purchasing public who want houses to buy.  As a builder who has 400 acres of land ready for building at the present moment, I would give this advice to the Minister: give no builder money to build houses, but give purchasers the facilities they need to buy houses.  If the Minister does that, the builders will build and the purchasers will buy; so that instead of having 1,500 or 1,600 carpenters idle in the City of Dublin to-day, you will soon have every one of them working.  No matter what amount of money you pump into the building side, you will not put a score of those carpenters working, but if you make money available for the thousands of people who want to buy houses, the builders will look after the rest, and you will soon have no unemployment in the building trade.</P>
    <P>I notice that the amount here is limited to £1,000,000.  At the moment, <Col N="163" /> building schemes promoted by the Dublin Corporation are held up for the want of money.  A proposition which the corporation put up is before the Minister for the past three months, asking him to guarantee a loan for their house-building scheme, but no reply has yet been received.  We here, and those who will not investigate beneath the surface are told in this: &ldquo;Here is the Government going to make money available for the building of houses; now we will have work.&rdquo;  I say it will not put a man working.  This measure may be availed of by a few speculators who have not a bob of their own to put into the industry, or a few strangers from some part of Europe may come and rest here, and get their naturalisation and citizenship papers in an easy fashion.  They may start some bogus industries, and may even start building houses with some of this money, but no genuine builder wants the money.  The people who do want money are the thousands of families anxious to purchase houses.  If you do that, the builders, as I have said, will do the rest.  I do not want any money; neither does any honest builder want any money to enable him to carry on his trade.  What the builder requires is purchasing power.  Therefore, abolish your old Trade Loans Act and give the people who are the consumers of your manufactured goods the wherewithal to buy them.  The natural market for industry in any country is the agriculture of that country.  The only market for the industry of this country is Irish agriculture, but you have it impoverished by a six-years economic war and you then gathered up all the capital that was in the country, £10,000,000, and shipped it to Britain to meet a debt which you swore was never due.  That has improverished agriculture and has impoverished industry here.</P>
    <P>As regards the conditions under which industry will thrive, there is nothing that will frighten capital away from industry so quickly as uncertainty and unstable conditions.  What are the conditions in Irish industry to-day? On the radio last week, we heard that the Prices Commission sat&mdash;a Prices <Col N="164" /> Commission at which the representatives of two English glass concerns gave evidence as to why there should or should not be tariffs on glass goods coming into this country.  What right have they there, if we have fiscal freedom? Is it not enough to make the bones of Arthur Griffith turn in the ground when the very freedom to which he consecrated his life, and which he finally achieved, has been thrown away by those who howled him down as having sold the freedom of this country, and British interested manufacturers can sit at what is called a Prices Commission conference and supersede this House, which is the Parliament of the country and which was handed to us by Griffith and Collins?  Who is going to put money into Irish industry which is built up on tariffs when the Prices Commission may be summoned at any time, and British interested parties may come in and give evidence at that conference table, and their case cannot be brushed aside without very good reason, according to the Agreement signed last March by the delegation which travelled to London.  Where is the stability in that industry, and who is going to put money into it? The very fact that this Bill has to be introduced is proof that the people will not put money into it.</P>
    <P>What in essence is this Bill?  It is a means of extracting money from the people for investment in concerns in which the people of their own free will will not invest.  This is where the Banking Commission must join issue with the policy of the Government.  No banking institution or financial house will invest its deposits in a concern in which its depositors themselves will not invest.  It is contrary to all the principles of finance.  There is in the Minister's Party&mdash;I think he is a member of the Minister's Party&mdash;a gentleman who was a member of that commission and he wrote a Minority Report.  I should like to hear him on this and I should like to hear him justify the financial principles involved in this Bill in the light of the fact that nobody, bank, Government or any other institution, will do with other people's money what those other people will not do with their own money.  They will not invest it in industry.  Of course, they cannot. <Col N="165" /> I should like to ask the Minister where is his five-year plan?  Where is the election plan?  Will he, as a preamble to this Bill, say: &ldquo;Here is our plan for industry for the next five years, as unalterable as the laws of the Medes and Persians&rdquo;?  Can he say that?  Of course, he cannot, in view of the agreement come to last year by which our fiscal freedom was given away.  Because of that, there is no stability in the industry and because of the poverty of agriculture, there is very little market for our industry.</P>
    <P>In the Bill itself, I find a very peculiar provision which I cannot square with any financial principles that I know of.  The Minister for Finance proposes to borrow money, but he reserves to himself the right, as I read the Bill, to lend that money in each particular case, according to conditions he himself will prescribe for each case.  I think there should be a safeguard embodied in the Bill to provide that if money is to be borrowed in the open market and lent out to industry&mdash;it should be borrowed on the best terms possible, of course&mdash;it should not be lent out so that the Exchequer will incur a loss because of failure to charge an adequate rate of interest.  Some regard should be had also to the length of time for which the loan is granted, and a maximum, as well as a minimum, period should be prescribed, because the administration of these loans is going to cost the Government something and the loans should not be for ridiculously short periods.  There should be a maximum and minimum period for which these loans will be issued, and a rate of interest charged which will ensure that the Exchequer will not lose by granting them.</P>
    <P>I understood the Minister to say that this is the only way to capitalise these industries.  Surely, he must not feel comfortable about the industrial position, if this expedient has still to be continued, seeing that he has given a monopoly of the Irish market to industry.  I would be glad to be in an industry where I had a monopoly. What staff and what experience are behind the Government in granting these loans?  Let the Government have the best will in the world, what trained <Col N="166" /> staff have they to decide for or against the granting of these loans?  The Minister, I am sure, is aware that one man can go into a bank, or financial house, put up a business proposition and be rejected, and that another man can go in and put up a precisely similar proposition and be accepted.  Why? Because people who are trained in reading the public and have long experience, such as bankers, grant a loan primarily on the personality asking for it.  If people who were never in industry and have nothing behind them&mdash;I will not say the loan would be given for political reasons, because I do not think the Minister would do that; he is too much of a realist to do it and he knows the danger&mdash;cannot get accommodation from banking institutions in this country, does it not speak very badly for the personnel in the van of the industrial revival?</P>
    <P>I am sorry this is not opposed, because it would give me far more pleasure to oppose this Bill than to support it.  Whatever might be said for the Bill six or ten years ago, after 16 or 17 years of protection for Irish industry, if the Minister for Industry and Commerce has to come into this House and, say: &ldquo;We have Irish industries, but we must finance them with the taxpayers' money because nobody outside will take up their share capital and no banking house will advance them working capital&rdquo;, surely there is something wrong with the industrial and economic policy the Government is pursuing.  In conclusion, I suggest to the Minister that he should reconsider the whole industrial policy, because, if it can be continued only by this expedient of taxing the people, in the first instance, to give a monopoly of the home market to Irish industry while&mdash;according to the Minister's statement to-day&mdash;it is only resting on the surface and has not driven its roots into the soil, it is time to stop spoon-feeding these incompetent industrialists by pumping capital into their industries and providing them with a monopoly market in which to sell their wares.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with this Bill, I want to refrain, as far as possible, from making anything in the nature of a political speech.  I want simply to remind the House that the <Col N="167" /> difficulty of procuring capital for industries here&mdash;particularly, small industries&mdash;is principally a technical one.  This country has always been associated with the British capital market.  There has been no capital market available to the small industries and there has been no machinery available for providing that capital. The agricultural population in this country have been accustomed to invest their very hard-won savings in British or Irish guaranteed securities. There is none of the atmosphere and none of the psychological background with which to provide small industries with working capital or capital for development.  Speaking on behalf of small industries in general, I submit that this Bill must be considered in the light of providing capital for two kinds of industry.  The first of these is the perfectly respectable, non-speculative industry, requiring from £25,000 to £40,000, established to produce articles which have received protection from the State, from the production of which there is every possibility of making reasonable profits.  I am personally aware of industries which, at the present time, are earning reasonable profits, producing good articles at prices very little in excess of the British prices, whose promoters have had to pledge their own personal credit and mortgage their own private houses to provide sufficient working capital to carry on.  Yet, they are successful, so far as one can judge, and are able to pay a small percentage on their capital.  The promoters of these industries are not able to continue development, to replace obsolete machinery or to take advantage of any new tariffs unless they receive further capital.  Trade loans have been valuable in helping, from the point of view of this country's industrial policy, the perfectly normal industry of non-speculative type to secure further capital for their advancement. We are not able to help otherwise because, owing to our tradition, it is difficult to procure capital for industry. Nobody can blame the agriculturist for deciding to invest his savings in trustee securities but, if we are to carry out the policy of the Government, <Col N="168" /> which is a balanced economy, in an agricultural-industrial nation, as Arthur Griffith described it, we must make working capital available for these industries.</P>
      <P>We know&mdash;we need not be ashamed to admit it&mdash;that, in the last six years, many industries were started for which very little skilled labour was available. People started to make articles they were not accustomed to manufacture, and some of the directors may not have had very long experience of manufacture. Their profits may have been very small.  They may not have been able to save very much from their profits for re-investment in new machinery. Equally, it should be noted that industries started before 1900 had very low taxation and were able to provide themselves with gigantic reserves.  No industry can possibly provide for reserves now because taxation in this country, as in all countries, is too high to make that possible.  As a result, industries are unable to re-finance themselves in the ordinary way, as was done in the nineteenth century by other industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I pass to the type of industry which the Minister happened to mention in a phrase which the Opposition has taken up and wrongly used&mdash;speculative industry.  This country has a number of mineral resources, for the development of which the ordinary finance houses might not be willing to make reasonable advances, because it would be a matter of speculation whether the work would succeed or not.  For this type of industry, where there is a certain amount of doubt but where sound businessmen feel there is some reason for development, the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Act should provide adequate facilities for procuring capital.  So far as the effect on the consumer is concerned, there is no doubt that a small industry, working with reasonable success but which lacks adequate working capital, inevitably raises the cost of the material to the consumer, partly because it buys the raw materials in small quantities at inflated prices instead of being able to buy them in large quantities at reasonable prices and partly because it is unable to extend to the wholesale and retail trade the credit they were accustomed <Col N="169" /> to receive when they imported the article from England.  From the standpoint of the consumer, it is essential that the smaller industries should have adequate working capital in order that they should provide articles at as reasonable a price as possible.</P>
    <P>I should like to add one more comment to the discussion on this Bill&mdash; that is, that this is not the only country which provides capital by State guarantees for industry.  To mention a few, in Sweden, England, France and the United States, large amounts of capital are guaranteed in one way or another by the Governments, because they found that they had to extend aid to industries not able to receive capital through the normal channels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill, and I do so as a farmer.  Now that it has been decided to devote £1,000,000 to the development of industry, I hope it will be also decided to employ a proportionate amount for the development of the most important industry&mdash;agriculture. It gives me some satisfaction to find that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, in introducing this Bill, has torn up and trampled underfoot the report of the Banking Commission, because it confirms my belief that the Government attach no importance whatever to the reports of the commissions they set up.  It shows the depth of the imbecility of those who believe that anything useful is ever derived for this country from commissions set up by the Government.  We must view this question of trade loans from the broad national standpoint.  We must ask ourselves whether we wish to see Irish industry develop or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we wish to see Irish industry developed we must support a measure of this kind, which seeks to provide the necessary capital for industry.  If we do not support a measure of this kind it simply means that we have no confidence in, no hope whatever for the future of this country, because there is absolutely no economic or political future for the country as a separate political and economic unit unless you have industry developed in conjunction with agriculture.  Therefore, there is <Col N="170" /> no reason why any Deputy, whether he be an agriculturist or an industrialist or anything else, should oppose a measure of this kind.</P>
    <P>Taking a broad national view of this question, the Government must also take into consideration the question of putting industries on a sound economic and financial basis, and establishing a certain amount of confidence amongst those engaged in industry.  So far as I can judge at present, there is a good deal of uncertainty in regard to the future of industry.  There is a strong feeling amongst those engaged in industry that the recent trade agreement between Great Britain and Ireland will, in due course, bring about a termination of certain industries.  It would be well if the Government would remove that impression.</P>
    <P>There is another important factor in regard to the development of industry to which the Government must give primary consideration, and that is providing a market for industrial products. In this connection, the principal consumers of Irish industrial products are the people engaged in the agricultural industry, and if we examine statistics we will find that the number of people residing in rural Ireland is every year declining.  Therefore, the market for industrial products is declining.  The output of the agricultural industry and the income of those engaged in the industry are declining, thereby cutting off the purchasing power of the people and cutting off future prospects for industrial development.</P>
    <P>It should be the duty of the Government, having decided to set aside £1,000,000 of public money for the development of industry, first of all to establish confidence among the industrialists, give them an assurance that their industries will be permanent and that no trade agreement or anything else will affect the security of their industries.  Further, they must set about providing a remunerative market for industrial products by setting aside sufficient capital for the development of agriculture and by putting the agricultural industry on a sound economic basis.</P>

      <P>I think the majority of the Deputies who have spoken merely <Col N="171" /> did so for the purpose of making speeches that they were anxious to make, regardless of their relevancy. Perhaps Deputy Childers alone was the one who confined himself to the Bill. I can understand the anxiety of Deputies to get steam off after the long recess and they will, I am sure, excuse me if I do not follow them over the very wide field they covered and deal with the various points raised.  I was particularly amused to notice the progress of Deputy Belton.  I hope he will pardon me if I say that his sudden conversion to a firm belief in the sacredness of financial experts is altogether unexpected.  It is not ten years since Deputy Belton was campaigning through the country for the public expulsion or the execution of every bank director and financial expert who ever offered an opinion on Irish economic conditions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my trouble. The Deputy quoted some remarks of mine when introducing the Bill and he quite clearly missed, just barely missed, the exact meaning of either the section or the remark and consequently he was going further astray the more he proceeded.  Quite clearly Deputy Belton had not the remotest idea of what the Bill was about until Deputy Childers spoke.  I am sure he would admit that if it were politically wise for him to do so.  It is necessary to provide, in connection with industrial development in this country <Col N="172" /> certain machinery, and a lot of other things are necessary, too.  When machinery is arranged by which the capital available for investment in industrial enterprises can be invested in those enterprises, these other things will be of no value.  These other things are a disposition on behalf of our people to invest in industry, a feeling of confidence in the future of industry and also a reasonable prospect of industrial success.  These things are essential, but equally essential is the existence of ways and means by which the desire of the public to invest in Irish industrial enterprises can be made effective.  One of the main difficulties of promoting industrial development here until recently was the absence of that machinery.  The Deputy will go back and read the document he once suggested should be publicly burned, the Report of the Banking Commission of 1926.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will find set out there that there were no means by which Irish industrialists could reach Irish investors except through the London market.  We had to change that.  When we contemplated a large-scale industrial drive here, it was necessary to change that situation, to create new machinery by which Irish industrialists could reach the Irish investors.  The method of providing capital for industry through public investment can be applied only in respect of large-scale concerns.  The Industrial Credit Company was set up for that purpose.  Deputy Mulcahy inquired why that company could not serve the function that the Bill proposes to serve.  The answer is that it provides a limited amount of money, not for the purpose of directing permanent investment in Irish industry, but to facilitate public investment in Irish industry.  The function is to take up the shares of companies who sell them to the public.  There may be a lapse of time between the purchase and the sale, until public confidence is sufficiently created.  Again, the Industrial Credit Company needs a large capital at its disposal. <Col N="173" /> Primarily, it is not the intention to purchase shares with the intention of holding them, but to act as a medium through which public money may be made available for the investment. There is a larger number of concerns &mdash;and from the national point of view a much more important number of concerns&mdash;which are not large enough to get capital through public investments. If you divide the industrial concerns into three classes, you get the one-man industry which depends very largely on the organising and industrial ability of the individual managing it and who has himself directly, or through his family, provided all the capital required for it.</P>
      <P>At the other end of the scale you get the public company, the big concern, with a capital of £100,000 or £200,000 that can go to the public and seek from the public whatever additional capital it may require.  In between, there are concerns which are too big to be financed entirely from individual funds, but too small to justify direct approach to the public and it is in relation to these concerns which in this country are really important and constitute the main bulk of our industrial organisation, that there exists, outside the trade loans system, no machinery whatever by which capital could be made available when required.  Deputy Belton says that the banks will do it.  The banks will not do it.  The banks have publicly declared that they regard it as no part of their function to provide capital of that character.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of their being bitten.  The banks exist for a different purpose! The banks will provide industry with money on a day-to-day basis.  They will provide an overdraft but the provision of long term loans on a 10 or 12 years' basis, to be repaid, not on demand, but by fixed regular sums, is not a function to which the banking system of this country is adapted.  They do not regard it as part of their business. They have agreed to finance that business if, and only if, their security is <Col N="174" /> protected by Government guarantee. Even in that connection, they have made it clear that a stage might be reached when, even though advances of that kind were secured by a Government guarantee, the amount of money taken up in loans of that kind, might be excessive and they would have to curtail their advances.  That situation might arise.  It probably would not arise in 100 years at our present rate of progress, but it is, nevertheless, a situation which could conceivably arise, having regard to the unsuitability of the banking system of the country to finance enterprise on that basis.</P>

We are free, when that agreement terminates automatically in the course of a couple of years, to tear it up, to refuse to renew the agreement on that basis but, if we take that attitude, it is open to the British Government to take a similar attitude.  We think it is a good agreement but that is a matter of opinion.  This argument that we sacrificed our fiscal freedom, that we threw away the freedom won for us by Arthur Griffith and Michael Collins, assisted by Deputy Belton, is just blithering nonsense.  We, in the exercise of our free choice, made the agreement.  It <Col N="175" /> was open to this House to reject it and it will be open to the House again to refuse to renew it.  It is idle to describe that process as a sacrifice or to say that we voted away our fiscal freedom.  In any event, the Deputy need not be in the least apprehensive that our industrial progress, the industrial progress that was so strenuously opposed by Deputy Belton, is going to be retarded at all as a result of that agreement.</P>
      <P>To come back to the Bill, let me say straight away that there is nothing in this Bill which limits its scope to manufacturing industries.  There is nothing in it that debars us giving a guarantee in respect of a loan raised for agricultural purposes.  I think most farmers would probably find that the system of financing, for which this Bill provides, is not entirely applicable to the circumstances of agriculture, but there is nothing in the Bill which precludes a farmer or a group of farmers, or somebody working a limited company for some agricultural purpose, seeking accommodation under the Bill if they think that that accommodation is suitable for their purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same applies in respect of housing. This Bill is not a solution of the housing problem.  I agree with Deputy Belton, and I am sure anybody who knows anything about the housing question will also agree, that the extension of housing activities by private builders rests almost entirely on the financing of house purchase.  The function of the Bill is to provide capital where it is required and it occasionally might happen that some large scheme of development by a private individual would require temporary accommodation or working capital.  There was only one case of a loan given for a housing scheme under these Acts.  That was the loan given in the case of the Mount Merrion scheme.  That loan was entirely repaid and it is a matter of significance that those who got a loan guaranteed by the State for that purpose, discharged the loan almost immediately.  Perhaps they found that that system of financing did not suit their purpose.  In any event, the State's liability was wiped out in a very short period after the Government guarantee was given.  As a result <Col N="176" /> of the giving of the guarantee, however, a large scheme of housing development by private enterprise was provided. That is the type of housing development that could be contemplated under this Bill.  Any other form of assistance for housing is not primarily a matter for the trade loans guarantee system or the Department of Industry and Commerce but the Bill is framed so as not to preclude us from giving a guarantee in respect of loans for some such large-scale development in the form of housing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy thought that I should have dealt more fully with the financial consequences of the operation of this system here, and he referred to the report of the Banking Commission, and particularly to the evidence given by the Secretary of the Department of Industry and Commerce before the commission.  I am anxious that there should be no misunderstanding as to what the Secretary of the Department said.  He was asked: &ldquo;Can one say that there is anything in the procedure now or any other matter affecting the situation, that should result in less liability in the system, as now administered?&rdquo; His reply was: &ldquo;I do not think there is anything in the present procedure which would lead us to expect a lower ratio of liability, but, of course, I should say that any conclusion about ratios in a matter of this kind may be entirely fallacious.&rdquo;  That is question No. 19.  Nobody can say that we are likely to suffer a lower ratio of loss in the future than in the past.  There is, however, the fact that we have suffered a much lower percentage of losses.  It is impossible to foretell the future, and we must, in preparing estimates for the future, base these estimates on the experience of the past.  But up to 1929, under the old Act, when our predecessors were in office, the total amount guaranteed in respect to which losses occured&mdash; that is, the total amount guaranteed in all cases in which ultimately a receiver had to be put in, and the assets disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer&mdash;amounted to £181,000. Since 1933 the total amount of the loans guaranteed in respect of which there was default was £20,000.  That is merely a fact.  I do not want to draw <Col N="177" /> any firm conclusions from that fact.  I mentioned that included in the £181,000, amongst the very heavy sum lost by our predecessors in the short period during which they were operating this system, there were three very large sums, amounting between them to £168,000, lost because of the failure of three enterprises.  When one talks about the ratio of loss, one may have regard to the total amount lost as against the total amount guaranteed, or to the number of cases in default against the number of cases in respect of which guarantees were given.  Again, let me refer to the loans which have been given since 1933.  The total amount in respect of which there was default was a very small fraction of the total amount guaranteed&mdash;£20,000 out of a total of £850,000&mdash;but there was included in that £20,000 a number of cases which involved small amounts.</P>
    <P>There are other guarantees outstanding of very substantial size.  Take the Peat Fuel Company in respect of which a trade loan guarantee of £90,000 was given.  That was a type of case such as Deputy Childers referred to, and such as Deputy Belton refused to admit existed, in which obviously private enterprise would not be interested at all.  We have taken a risk there, a substantial risk, in order to have carried out here an experimental development which, if successful, will be of immense benefit to this country, but which if unsuccessful is going to involve us in the loss of that amount. Clearly, one such failure as the failure of that company would increase out of all proportion the ratio of loss.  Consequently, it is impossible to make any firm estimate as to what the ratio of loss is likely to be, and the only safe course to follow is to take it that it is going to be the same in the future as it has been in the past, even though we know there were special circumstances in the past which do not now exist.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputy Mulcahy noticed the number of occasions on which the members of the commission hearing evidence on this matter made a distinction between the period before 1932 and the period after 1932, and whenever they did so they always made it quite clear that the purpose of that <Col N="178" /> distinction was something other than the actual thing that was in their minds, to our own knowledge.  They said they made that distinction because there was a gap during which no loan was given before 1932; that they made that distinction because the Act before 1932 was of a different character to the Act after 1932.  But we all know, although they were at pains to conceal it, that they made that distinction because a new Government came into office in 1932.  That was an important factor.  Having regard to the nature of the inquiry they were carrying out, the one factor they should not leave out of account was that there was a change in policy, and surely a change in policy must have a very direct bearing on what the ratio of loss is going to be under any system of trade loans guarantees. When our predecessors gave a substantial guarantee in respect of a loan to the glass bottle factory they were taking a risk which the present Government would not be taking in similar circumstances, because they were not prepared to protect that industry, and in the circumstances of 1929 it was almost inevitable that the money would be lost.  It was lost, but in the new circumstances&mdash;the circumstances in which there is a Government following a different policy&mdash;the prospect of loss, either for the State which guarantees the loan or for the private individual who puts his money into Irish industry, is substantially reduced.  That is the important factor which the members of this commission refused to take into account, and certainly were at great pains to leave out of account, when they were making their recommendations.</P>
    <P>The number of cases outstanding at the present time is quite substantial. I do not know what particular case Deputy Mulcahy could have been referring to, of which he said he had personal knowledge, that is to say, the company which got a guaranteed loan of £10,000 and was likely to default to the extent of £8,000.  Looking over my list here I cannot see any company which got a loan of £10,000 in respect of which a receiver has been appointed, or which is even in default in any way in the payment of principal or interest. <Col N="179" /> There is a side of this picture which both the Banking Commission and Deputies here left out of account.  We talk about a default of £20,000 because companies that got guaranteed loans amounting to that sum failed to make good and involved the State in a loss. We guaranteed loans amounting to £115,000, which have been repaid in full, and that is a much more important factor than the other one, because it means that, as a result of the State taking some risk in respect of those undertakings, permanent progress has been made, permanent employment has been given, and a new source of wealth has been created in the country.  By the companies that were facilitated under this Act there are employed at the present day nearly 66,000 people. Those industries paid out last year nearly £500,000 in wages, and the creation of that situation was worth taking the risk of the loss of £20,000. We spent nearly £1,500,000 on unemployment relief schemes.  Surely it is much better to risk a smaller sum in trying to create permanent employment which will be productive and give a new source of wealth to the country than to spend a much larger sum on the unproductive work on which relief workers have usually to be occupied.</P>
    <P>I do not think there is any other matter which calls for particular reference on this occasion.  I agree fully with Deputy Esmonde that in giving guarantees under this Act we should have due regard to the nationality of the applicants, but I do not think it is necessary to make any special provision to that end, because the Control of Manufactures Act gives us sufficient safeguards.  It is in fact impossible for anybody other than a person of Irish nationally or a company conforming to the conditions laid down in the Control of Manufactures Act to carry on a manufacturing enterprise here unless licensed, and licences will not be given unless it is clearly in the national interest that it should be done.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulcahy referred to a leading article in the <i>Irish Independent.</i> The <i>Irish Independent</i> is a propagandist organ.  Its intention is to make propaganda against the Government, <Col N="180" /> and Deputy Mulcahy should have due regard to that fact, particularly when reading its leading articles.  It had a leading article this morning which referred to the decline in the value of our external assets in the current year as compared with 1933.  I think the very fact that the <i>Irish Independent</i> picked 1933 should have caused Deputy Mulcahy to smell a rat.  Obviously there must have been some reason why they picked 1933 for purposes of comparison instead of the previous year, or three or five or 10 years ago.  There was an obvious reason.  In 1933, by reason of the financial insecurity that existed throughout the world and particularly in the United States of America, a very large amount of external assets were transferred to the Irish banks for security, for safe keeping, until the financial crisis had passed, and particularly until financial stability had been restored in the United States.  When that financial stability had been restored those external assets were taken back again by the people.</P>

      <P>No.  It would increase them in 1933 as against 1938.  I am prepared to admit that there has been some diminution in the value of the external assets held by our banks. Not merely did we pay out £10,000,000 last year to the British Government in accordance with the financial agreement, but there has been a repatriation of capital for investment here.  In fact, I think we must contemplate a much <Col N="181" /> more substantial repatriation of capital, if the full capital requirements of our people are to be provided for. The Dublin Corporation is looking for capital at the moment, and if it is to get the money it wants, there must be some repatriation of capital now invested abroad; some diminution in the value of external assets held by Irish banks.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy had the same regard for it we might get agreement. The main point is that this Bill is a machinery Bill.  It is quite true, as Deputy Mulcahy stated, that machinery alone does not meet our problem; that, to attack our problem, there must be created the psychological situation in which Irish investors will be prepared to invest in Irish industries. The problem associated with the creation of the proper psychological conditions need not be discussed now.</P>

      <P>I agree that they are of equal importance to the provision of machinery.  The provision of machinery is itself essential, but with the best will in the world, without some means specially provided for the purpose, Irish investors could not get their money into industrial enterprises here. There was a period when they could not do it, because there was no means of doing it.  Means having now been created, I do not think we can afford to do without this particular means. A time may come when we can do <Col N="182" /> without it, but that time is a long way in the future.  Certainly, within the next five years we will need the same facilities that we had in the past.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dáil views with concern the failure of the Government recently disclosed to provide protection for our people against possible attack from the air, and is of opinion that a select committee be set up immediately <Col N="183" /> to inquire into, take evidence, and report on the causes of this failure.</P>
    <P>That the committee consist of 12 Deputies to be nominated by the Committee of Selection, and that the quorum of the committee be four.</P>
    <P>That the committee have power to send for persons, papers and records.</P>
    <P>I may say that this motion was handed in in the early weeks of October, and the word &ldquo;recently&rdquo; refers to the situation as it existed in September and previous months.  I propose to keep strictly to the terms of the motion, not to attempt to discuss conditions as they are now, or as they may be next month or next year. Everybody recollects the appalling condition this country was in last September. Nobody, I think, appreciated it more fully than the Taoiseach when he took over the charge of the Department of Defence.  We had a world on the eve of war.  We had a general impression amongst the people of this city, amongst the members of the Executive, and, above all, in the mind of the Taoiseach, that we were within hours or minutes of war, and that in that war, whether our attitude was neutral or not, we had got to expect and to prepare for air attacks on this country.  We had a situation in which every Government in Europe, small and big, gave evidence to the public of the serious way in which defence had been taken by the responsible Minister.  We had the armies at the pitch of efficiency, according to their means, and their armaments, stores, supplies of equipment and ammunition purchased and hoarded, as against the day of war.  We had the various broadcasting stations of the world reassuring and allaying the anxiety of the people, and the anxiety of mothers for their children, advising them what to do in the event of this or of that happening. We had every defence department in Europe facing up to its responsibilities, and allaying the fears of the population, with the one exception of this country, that used its broadcasting station once, and once only, during those days of crisis, when it was used to broadcast for a missing officer <Col N="184" /> from the North of Ireland, who was required for the defence of Ulster.  With that one very conspicuous exception, there was no advice given to the people, no protection, no plan, no policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence was absent on holidays, and there was no Taoiseach, as he was away in Geneva. The Army was left without a lead and without a plan, because there was no policy.  It was left without a Minister, because he was absent.  The soldiers were left there with empty rifles, the artillery was left without shells, the people without gas masks, and the public even without advice, and that eight years after a Minister was given an absolutely free hand with regard to the Army.</P>
    <P>Remember, the last eight years cannot be confused with the previous five years, when the Army was a political subject, debated here with bitterness and vindictiveness.  When we came to this side of the House, one of our earliest decisions was that we would not follow the bad example of our predecessors in opposition; that there were certain State services which would and should be left outside the political arena, and for eight long years there was never an Army Estimate challenged, criticised or voted against in this House.  Considerably more money was asked for every year than was ever handled by the Government's predecessors.  By our action here we did as far as example could go, educate the people to put the Army outside politics, and to have confidence in the Army, and the head of the Department.</P>
    <P>Many things could have been criticised. Many excuses could have been made for voting against Army Estimates year after year.  No such opportunity was ever availed of and no obstacles were ever placed in the way. For eight long years no obstacles were ever placed in the way of the Minister having an efficient, well-equipped Army with carefully devised plans for the protection of the people, if and when an emergency should come. Eight years after that, with more money being voted every day, we had panic-stricken mothers in the City of <Col N="185" /> Dublin looking in vain to the Department of Defence for even advice as to what they should do.  We had officers and soldiers openly saying that they were ashamed to wear the uniform in public because, when the testing time came, they were not there to stand between the people and danger.</P>
    <P>I do not want anybody to take my view or my words for the conditions and the picture I am painting.  Early in the weeks of October the most impartial bodies in this country were found expressing in the columns of the Press their disappointment with the scandalous unpreparedness of the Army to give either advice or protection to the people of this country.  We had people, such as the chief of the St. John Ambulance Brigade, who had given a lifetime in the service of humanity and who could certainly not be accused of being a political partisan, anxious only for the welfare of the people, writing to the public Press in the early days of October to express his regret at the deplorable state of unpreparedness of Ireland's Army, to point out that there was no advice even to be given to the people and not a gas mask to be issued.</P>
    <P>You had bodies like the Executive of the Irish Medical Union, which might be charged with many things but which could certainly never be charged with political partisanship or with being opposed to the Government politically, writing their editorial in their journal in the early days of November and they, like Sir John Lumsden, pointing out that the first approaches to them towards bringing into being even the beginnings of a scheme for the protection of the people or for the reassurance of the public was after the crisis of September was passed.</P>
    <P>We have got to remember that an army in any country is not an expensive toy for individuals to play with or is not an expensive pedestal on which to erect any expensive figurehead.  The Army is not an institution for 6,000 or 7,000 men to be well paid for looking after one another efficiently.  The only justification for an army or a Department of Defence in any country, rich or poor, is that it is an expensive instrument maintained in days of peace to stand between the people and <Col N="186" /> danger in times of war.  If an army, here or elsewhere, is so badly equipped that it cannot fill that particular gap in times of danger then there is no justification for asking the taxpayer for as much as one penny for its maintenance. If the idea is allowed to get into the minds of army officers or soldiers that their job is merely to look after one another and that it is none of their jobs to look after the people, then that country would be better off without an army.  But the money was voted freely year after year for eight years and, far from taking political advantage of a Minister who might be unprepared, when it became clear to us in the closing days of 1937 that danger was ahead and that apparently no steps were being taken to meet that danger, I put down a question here addressed to the Minister for Defence, in November, 1937, to know if he had taken any steps or proposed to take any steps to protect the people from the danger of invasion or attack from the air and his answer was that it was under consideration and would be done.</P>
    <P>Twelve months later we had the crisis on top of us.  We had the emergency. We had the uneasy and panicky people but we had no plan and no steps had been taken.  There was casual disregard for the responsible office which was held and, clearly, I lay the responsibility at the door of the Minister for Defence but lest I might be wrong in that assumption I put down this motion asking for a committee from the whole House, a committee on which the Government would have a majority, to inquire into the matter and assess the blame.</P>
    <P>The blame lies somewhere.  It may be with the Minister.  It may be with the Department of Finance.  It may be elsewhere, but we will show a callous disregard for our responsibilities to the people and our functions as Deputies in a Parliament under which the Army functions, if we are to allow the situation as it existed last September to pass without the fullest and most thorough investigation.  When we have assessed the blame and found the cause then we must remove the delinquent and remove the cause. What happened in countries that were much better prepared than we were but <Col N="187" /> that had a small gap here and there in their defences, countries with a Parliament that was conscious of its responsibilities to the people and conscious of the people's helplessness if the Army was not at a high pitch of efficiency?  In every second country where only a small gap was found the Minister was removed from office, not because of gross negligence but because a small gap existed.  Practically everywhere Ministers were removed because there was not 100 per cent. efficiency. Here, where we had 100 per cent. deficiency, where there was no such thing as a gap, but where we were wide open, where soldiers had enough small arms ammunition to keep them firing for less than two minutes, where no piece of artillery could bark for 20 minutes, where we had one little nest of anti-aircraft guns that could only operate at one point, and where we had not a gas mask for any unfortunate in the whole country, the same Minister comes calmly back to ask for another half-million pounds to misspend like the previous £12,000,000, and, presumably, with the same result. But, he will get the money as he did in the past, and when the danger comes he will have nothing to show for it.</P>
    <P>What is the biggest evidence that this Dáil could have as to the real gravity of the danger last September and the real deficiencies in the Army?  That the Acting-Minister for Defence, when he came up against the bald unpleasant fact, felt bound to throw up the sponge and refused to take further responsibility. The Taoiseach took over. If the Taoiseach took over a fully-equipped machine, with an adequacy of stores, what was the explanation for every second officer and civil servant being sent over hot-foot to England, the officers going by rail and sea, and the civil servants going by air, with blank cheques in every hand, each of them hammering at the doors of the War Office and the Admiralty in a mad stampede to try to get some kind of stores at the eleventh hour, just before Hell would be let loose and bombs would begin to fall?  Is it a fact that ammunition was practically non-existent and that stupendous purchases <Col N="188" /> were put through by order of the Taoiseach, in the absence of the Minister, to replenish the stocks that should, according to the money voted, have been there to purchase artillery and planes, to purchase ammunition and air-craft?</P>
    <P>If the Army was properly equipped and properly prepared, if Army stores were ample, then there was no justification whatsoever for those huge and panicky purchases of last September. But, if there was good, sound and sufficient reason for spending hundreds of thousands of pounds in order hastily to equip our defences here, then those responsible for the lack of equipment and ammunition should have resigned their offices after another man had come along to attempt to do in eight weeks what the Minister had failed to do in eight years.  Hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of equipment, a completely new scheme of organisation, civilians, doctors, businessmen, workers and others called in in order to try to devise the beginning of a scheme of A.R.P. a month after the crises.  Were people and persons, officers and civilians in the Department of Defence living in blissful ignorance of the world they lived in for 12 months before?  Could they not see any of the danger signals? Must they wait while every other country organised?  Must they wait to look for supplies when no country had supplies to spare?  Must they wait until the enemy is knocking at the door before another man comes and takes over?</P>
    <P>If Mr. Chamberlain had not saved this country last September, we would be in a pretty state by this.  It is a very poor state of affairs, after the millions that have been thrown out, thrown into the Department of Defence pool, that when danger came our eyes had to be fixed abroad to protect us, and when we looked for protection here at home we found silence, absolute silence, failure to give a lead, failure to reassure, failure to put courage into the people, decent officers expressing their humiliation at finding themselves in an Army in such a state, and each one blaming somebody else. Is it unreasonable, in view of these facts that are known to every Deputy, <Col N="189" /> to ask that the matter should be inquired into?  Picture the situation last September if even a few planes came over Dublin.  People were not even advised whether to go in or to seek the open spaces; no protection against gas or any other form of attack; one little nest of anti-aircraft guns to operate from this to Donegal and from this to Cork.  If such a small group of guns could bring a plane down to land, it would be the greatest miracle since the whale landed Jonah.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of instrument for which the people were paying for the last eight years; that is the result. To-day we have the same Administration and the same Head coming back to ask for more money.  Because the job was not done, or because the position was not taken seriously for the last eight years, the taxpayers have got to put up more money now to make good the deficiency.  For years past money went on every kind of expensive toy.  We were not satisfied, with a little Army of 5,000 or 6,000 men, to have a common uniform for all.  We had to squander hundreds of thousands of pounds so as to have one group of soldiers wearing different uniforms from the others, so as to differentiate the type of organisation that came into being under one Administration from those who were there before.  In order to try to put a political stamp on one section of the Army, hundreds of thousands of pounds had to go; and because hundreds of thousands were spent in that direction obviously there was no money for the real work of the soldier.</P>
    <P>If the danger had come,if the threatened danger had materialised, presumably the soldiers would fix bayonets to their empty rifles and the officers would draw their swords, and the public would pray to God&mdash;there was nothing between them and the danger.  The tragedy of it is that there are in this country the best soldiers and the most highly-trained officers in the theory of war to be found anywhere in Europe.  But no army can devise a plan except in accordance with a policy.  If there is failure at the top to enunciate a policy, the best officers in the world cannot devise a plan.  That was one of the riddles <Col N="190" /> always set to Army officers&mdash;that Army policy would not be laid down.  Therefore, a proper plan and an Army to fit into that plan could not be designed. Even when outside bodies were called in to co-operate in air-raid precautions there was the same bankruptcy of policy, or the same refusal to enunciate policy, so that no group of men could formulate a feasible plan.</P>
    <P>We are asking in this motion that investigation should be carried out fully and thoroughly into the position.  If the position was bad, as stated by dozens of impartial pens, as found, and clearly found, by the Taoiseach when he took over, as evidenced in the memory of every impartial Deputy, then we should find out the causes of its badness and the responsibility for its badness, and then try to make the best of what is left.</P>
    <P>But I, for one, must say this clearly, that after the disillusionment and rude awakening of last September, speaking as a person who has never refused one penny to the Army since I came into the Dáil, and never voted against an Army Estimate, if it is the desire of Parliament to provide more money for the Army, if it is the desire of all over here and all over there to have the most efficient type of Army that can be got within our means, if more money is wanted, public money cannot be given where there is neither trust nor confidence, and that after an Administration has been tried and found wanting, someone else in whom the country has more reason to have confidence should be put in charge if you are to come and ask for more money.</P>

      <P>Yes, Sir, but the Minister was questioning me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>I second the motion, Sir, and first of all I should like to say that I think the Minister has been rather leading away from the terms of the motion in the discussion he instituted with Deputy O'Higgins.  One thing the Minister asked for was a description of the word &ldquo;adequate&rdquo; which does not occur in the motion at all.  As Deputy O'Higgins suggested, this motion, of course, sounds, in a way, out of date when the word &ldquo;recently&rdquo; appears in it, but I think that nobody can doubt that at the time this motion was put down, there were, to all intents and purposes, no preparations for air raid precautions in this country.  It is possible that, pigeonholed somewhere in the Department, there was a scheme, but as far as the public at large are aware, it existed purely and simply on paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are, of course, those who contend that nothing has been done since then, but of my own knowledge I know that that is not so because the local police station rang us up about two months ago to know the area over which our steam whistle could be heard.  We hear also that courses are being given to individuals at the present moment, and I think that, very largely, these deal with the question of gas.  There is no statement, however, from the Government of what has been done, what is being done, or what they propose to do, and I think we may take it from that, that very little has been done because, if anything substantial had been done, my view would be that it is the duty of the Government to inform the public to that effect in order to allay the undoubted feeling to the effect that we were so totally unprepared should the danger have arisen in September last.  Of course, there are those who hold that no preparations are necessary in this country&mdash;that we have nothing to fear.  I wish I could subscribe to that, because it must be an extremely happy frame of mind in which to be, but I cannot subscribe to it.  I am satisfied that if war should ever break out on the Continent, we would be a target, and to a certain extent I think that the effectiveness of <Col N="193" /> our preparations will vary the possibilities of our being actually attacked. If an enemy is aware that we are fully prepared, then it is obvious that the moral effect of any attack will be considerably reduced by that preparedness. Others say that preparations should go on behind closed doors, so to speak, but that nothing should be said to the public at large lest it should create panic.  Any panic which could possibly be created, however, by the publication of the Government's plans, could not possibly be compared with the panic which could be caused in this city by the dropping of one single bomb on a population entirely unprepared.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins's indictment of the Government was based very largely, I think, from the point of view of the Army.  Speaking, however, as one who has been bombed, and who has no desire to be bombed again, my concern is more from the point of view of the civilian population.  There are, of course, in my view anyway, two forms of protection, firstly, what might be called the active and, secondly, the passive. In the active I would include the provision of planes and anti-aircraft guns, and in the passive the provision of shelters, auxiliary fire-fighting services and respirators.  As to which of these is to be the most important I think it is purely a matter of opinion; it is one man's opinion against another's.  There is nothing very definite on which to base a statement. My own view is that the most important of these is the auxiliary fire-fighting services.  An incendiary bomb is a very light bomb.  A very large number of them can be carried by a single plane. If that single plane were to arrive over this country and drop incendiary bombs it is obvious that the present fire-fighting services would be terribly inadequate to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The point has been made in conversations that this motion, or possibly the reason behind this motion, will increase taxation in this country.  But we have to take the larger view on that.  Our point is that the existing amount of money which is voted would, if it were laid out in a different way, provide a large number of necessary services, and that any increase necessary to expand the programme would not mean a very <Col N="194" /> great amount.  These, anyway, are digressions from the real motion before the House.  I certainly say now that the statement that no preparations are being made must be taken as a statement of fact.  There is certainly no evidence to the contrary.  The only point, therefore, that arises out of this motion is as to whether this committee is or is not to be established.  I think that the feeling of the House must be that such a committee is most desirable, and that this country must certainly have such services as a protection against possible attack from the air.  Any other view would apparently only indicate a sort of Rip Van Winkle idea, that the person who puts it forward must have been oblivious for quite a long period as to the things that are happening in the outside world.  I myself would think that to have allowed the country to have got into the unprepared state in which it was last September does call for an inquiry such as is suggested in this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Aiken) Frank Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Aiken)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad indeed that attention has been called to the problem of air-raid precautions. Deputy Benson mentioned here to-night that there was a number of people in Dublin, as well as throughout the rest of the country, who held that nothing should be done.  There is a very big number indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>I said there were some people who held that view, not a great number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I say there is a very big number indeed.  The Deputy says there are some.  Nobody knows that better than I and the people in my Department who are trying to organise air-raid precautions.  Deputy O'Higgins holds himself forth to-night as somebody who has the very opposite point of view&mdash;that instead of nothing having been done, that everything should be done&mdash;that, as a matter of fact, everything should have been done years ago. The Deputy proposes to set up a committee to find out why everything was not done prior to last September.  I think the time of the Fine Gael members who, the Deputy proposes, should sit on this committee, would be much <Col N="195" /> better spent and a much more valuable return got, if their Party were first to get an agreed policy amongst themselves on this question of defence generally.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Higgins said that he never refused a penny for this work but Deputy O'Higgins is not the Fine Gael Party and he does not speak for all members of it.  I say that because other members of the Fine Gael Party have strenuously opposed my efforts to get more money here for Air Raid Precautions and the extension of defence generally.  It was not years ago that they opposed it, but even within the past nine months, when the European situation was getting more serious than it has been for years. When I asked in recent months for £600,000 to be spent on defence purposes generally it was opposed.  We were asked to drop it.  We were told that we should not spend any more money on it.  I was bitterly accused of having increased the Army expenditure by £420,000.  The Deputy's leader, the leader here in the House, at any rate, said we should do nothing, that we should abolish the Forces that we have.  Deputies will remember Deputy Dillon's speech on the Defence Vote last year.  He said that the only defence we should have was the threat that if anybody came in and threatened to bomb us here, we would resist with another 700 years of war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it would be a very good idea if the members of the Fine Gael Party, whom Deputy O'Higgins would ask to sit on this committee, would sit down and evolve an agreed policy of defence to be stood over by that Party.  They are the second largest Party in this House and they, at least, should have a definite line of defence and a definite policy on the matter. It is a big enough issue for the Party to discuss; the House should know what is in the Fine Gael minds about it.  But we have Deputy O'Higgins, when it suits him, saying that he never refused a penny for Army expenditure, and at other times, and when it suits them, we have other members of the Fine Gael Party, including their leader here in this House, saying that not a single penny <Col N="196" /> should be spent on this service.  I hope when we are discussing the Supplementary Estimates, that some member of the Fine Gael Party will be authorised to disclose here the official policy of that Party in regard to defence&mdash;whether it is that we should spend nothing on defence measures, or that we should spend very much more than we are doing.</P>
    <P>When I asked Deputy O'Higgins here to-night what he meant by protection in regard to A.R.P., he said I should know that myself.  When I pressed him further, he said that it meant adequate fighting planes, a sufficiency of anti-aircraft guns, advice for the population how to act, and gas masks for everybody.  If we are to guarantee safety for every one in this country and take the precautions that are necessary to ensure that that guarantee would be effective, and that no one is going to get hurt in an air raid, what is it going to cost?  If we could get the people to devote all their energies to preparations, I am sure it would cost something in the nature of several thousands of millions of pounds in order to make that guarantee effective.  That is no exaggeration. If we are to guarantee the people that no one is going to get hurt in an air raid, we would have to build our towns and houses fifty feet below the earth, and have them properly air conditioned, and as well start building our factories under the ground in the same way.  Now the people are not prepared to face that situation, in my opinion, because it would mean that they would have to take so much precaution against dying in case of war, that life would not be worth living. It would become oppressive.  But I do believe that we can, with a fair amount of expenditure of our energy and money, give fair protection to the people against air raids.  Over a number of years we have been studying the problem in the Department of Defence, and we have been making plans to give the people the best protection we can with the expenditure of the minimum amount of money.  Back in 1937, I introduced in this House, for the first time in an Army Estimate, a sum of £1,000 for A.R.P. purposes.  It was a beginning.  When that Estimate was <Col N="197" /> framed back in 1936, there was no fuss such as we had last September.  I explained, at the time, that we were providing this sum in order to make a beginning with this service, so that we would have some knowledge of the problem, and so that we would be able to extend it should the occasion require.</P>
    <P>After that Estimate was put through the Dáil, we set up a branch in my Department consisting of senior and highly efficient civil servants, and of a number of military officers, who were put on the study of A.R.P., so as to get all the information they could at home and abroad.  Last year we started to extend the knowledge that we had to the general public.  Now, there was no use in starting by distributing handbooks to the general public.  We had to train instructors, and we started on the training of instructors long before Deputy O'Higgins thought of putting down this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure it is the Deputy's humility that forces him to that conclusion.  However, because of Deputy O'Higgins, we started a couple of years ago to deal with the A.R.P. problem, and we reached this position before September: that we have a number of civilian instructors who were passed as being fit to instruct the general public.  September came along. It helped the development of A.R.P., while it may have frightened a lot of people.  It helped the branch in my Department which was dealing with this question.  It got the general public to take a much more lively interest in the work, and got a number of them, who were willing, to come forward and help.  The result was that before the end of last year we had 400 or 500 instructors, public officials and others, trained as instructors.  Those men are <Col N="198" /> now actively engaged in conveying their information to the people who are being organised as A.R.P. services. In the City of Dublin, the Dublin Corporation have set up an A.R.P. department.  They have appointed a director, who has appointed air wardens. A number of corporation officials has been trained as instructors.  They are holding classes at the moment, and will continue to hold classes until a sufficient number of people are trained in Dublin as air raid wardens, auxiliary firemen, decontaminating squads, first aid parties, and so forth.  It may have been that all that should have been done back in 1932, or back in 1926.</P>
      <P>However, it is being done at the moment, and if Deputy O'Higgins wants to hold me responsible for not having it done up to the present time, well and good.  It seems to me, however, that the same sort of complaint, that Deputy O'Higgins is making here to-night, is not a new one in the world. It has been made in every country in the world, practically, in the last few months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The same sort of speech that Deputy O'Higgins made here to-night has been made in practically every country in the world, within the last three months: that adequate precautions were not taken, and that everything was wrong.  As I say, if we <Col N="199" /> want to guarantee the safety of the people, to give the guarantee to them that no one is going to be hurt, that is going to mean the expenditure of a great amount of money, and to the spending of that amount of money the Deputy's colleagues would object, if he himself did not.  They have strenuously opposed the spending of money here on this purpose in the past, and I have no doubt whatever that they would oppose the spending of further sums for the same purpose.  Whoever is responsible for the situation in which we find ourselves, that A.R.P. is not organised properly, either in Dublin or throughout the country, I think that it would be a good result of this resolution, or of any other discussion, if it secured that something more were done.</P>
      <P>A number of people are unduly afraid of air raids, and some people are so inconsequent, and have such little imagination that they do not fear them at all.  If, however, the citizens, in towns likely to be attacked, only spent a fair amount of their leisure in training as auxiliary firemen, air raid wardens, decontamination personnel or first-aid personnel, I feel that the casualties in connection with air raids could be reduced to such an extent that there would be no knock-out blow inflicted on us by air raids.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose, when I come to the Estimate, to deal with the steps we are taking for the active portion of our precautions against air raids.  To-night, I want to concentrate on the passive end of it, that is, on what should be done by the people themselves in order to reduce the casualties to a minimum. There are three things which we have to fear&mdash;gas, high explosive bombs and incendiary bombs.  With proper masks and instruction, gas would not overcome us completely.  We can deal with gas if the people know how to recognise it and take the proper precautions, and if there is a sufficient medical service properly trained in order to deal with any casualties that might occur. The high explosive bomb is a very different problem.  If we were to make sure that nobody could be hurt by a high explosive bomb, as I have said <Col N="200" /> already, we would have to build our cities 50 feet below the ground.  However, the casualties from high explosive bombs can be reduced to a minimum if ordinary precautions are taken against splinters, or blast.  With a little expenditure of time and material, every person who has a garden or back-yard available in the city can build a trench or protection against blast and splinters.  I think that every man who has a sense of his responsibilities, even though he might not agree that war is going to come to Europe, or that, if it comes to Europe, it will come to us, will take the precaution of building an adequate, or fairly adequate, trench or other protection against high explosive bombs.</P>
    <P>The third thing we have to fear is the incendiary bomb.  These, though small, are very effective.  If there were a large number of incendiary bombs dropped, and only a very small number of people to deal with them, they could create great destruction indeed; but if the citizens of Dublin and other large towns will join the A.R.P. organisation, when called on, and spend a little of their leisure in getting to know how to deal with incendiary bombs, they are not going to cause very great destruction.  They can be dealt with effectively.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The people in the flats, like the people in houses, will have to get into air-raid shelters.  The Dublin Corporation at the moment are setting up their A.R.P. staff, and we have asked them to get an engineer at work to inspect the various new flats and other buildings in Dublin to see how many of their basements can be used as shelters in time of air-raid.  We are making a start in Dublin with the organisation of A.R.P., because it is our most difficult task.  It is the biggest target and, as anybody can see, it is the target most likely to be aimed at in the country.  The Dublin Corporation, as I said, has appointed a director and that director has appointed air-raid wardens.  These air-raid wardens will be asking for volunteers to join the A.R.P. organisation, and I <Col N="201" /> hope the citizens of Dublin will join that organisation.  If they do, they will be ensuring that the citizens generally will be organised so as not to panic, if an air-raid should ever, unfortunately, take place here, and they will be ensuring, by the training of our citizens, that casualties and the destruction of premises will be reduced to a minimum.</P>
      <P>My Department has been in touch with the City Manager in regard to the expenses in connection with A.R.P., and, through the Manager, we have made a certain offer to the Dublin Corporation.  We have told them that the Government is prepared to meet a certain portion of the expenses in connection with A.R.P.  We have a few hundred thousand gas masks held in store, which the Government has purchased and which it is proposed to issue free to the civilian population who have to remain in the city in time of war or emergency.  We have told the corporation that we are prepared to meet a certain portion of the cost of additional fire-fighting equipment, and of any expenses the corporation might incur in changing over the lighting system of the city, so that lights could be blackened out quickly upon receipt of warning.  We have told the corporation, also, that we are holding a number of gas protection suits and a quantity of decontamination material, and I am glad to say that the manager and the staff have been co-operating with us in an enthusiastic manner.  I hope that, before a very long time has passed, we will have, here in Dublin, a properly organised air-raid precautions service, which will include air raid wardens who will be in charge of a certain number of streets to instruct the people how to don their gas masks, how to deal with incendiary bombs, how to make trenches for protection against high explosive bombs, and to advise those who can get out of the city in time of war to do so and to get out further into the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are also closely engaged in making plans for the evacuation of children, of the aged and of invalids. We hope that those who can evacuate their own families, if their presence in Dublin is not necessary, will do so, <Col N="202" /> and send them to the country, and thus not be putting the responsibility on the State and on the public authorities for doing what they should do themselves.  The success of air raid precautions largely depends on the people themselves.  If we were to spend £100,000,000 on the organisation and staffing of air raid services by paid officials, it would not be half as effective in saving our people from casualties and saving our property from destruction as if all the intelligent citizens spent a few hours learning how to protect themselves.  I do not propose to go any further into the question of air raid precautions to-night.</P>
    <P>While Deputy O'Higgins said he was prepared to deal with Army expenditure in a non-partisan spirit, he gave a demonstration to the contrary.  I propose to ignore what he said with reference to myself.  It is not worth dealing with, but I do want to object to the impression he tried to create to-night that if a crisis had occurred last September, the Army could not have given a good account of itself.  He said that the rifles could only bark for two minutes, and that the artillery could not bark for more than 20 minutes.  That is absolutely untrue.  Over the past six or seven years, since I went to the Department of Defence, we have been increasing each year the amount of money that went into war material.  Prior to 1932, when I took over, the average amount spent on war material was much less than 5 per cent. of the total Army Vote.  I raised that proportion, as well as I could, by degrees, with the sanction of the Government, until in 1937 I got the percentage up to 12½ of the total Army Vote.  I grant that the total amount of war material we were able to provide, even with that 12½ per cent., was very small if we take the standards of the big continental countries.  But the increase to 12½ per cent. of the total Army Vote resulted in our building up a reserve both of small arms and artillery ammunition which was several times as great as the reserve I found in the Department when I went there.  If a war had taken place last September, and if we had been involved in it, we should have <Col N="203" /> been able to give a ten times better account of ourselves than we would have been able to do had a war broken out in 1932.</P>
    <P>I think that Deputy O'Higgins knows that situation as well as I do.  Here to-night, for purely partisan and Party purpose, he made allegations in regard to the unpreparedness of the Army that are absolutely without a shadow of foundation.  I resent those allegations.  On behalf of the officers of the Army, I resent also the allegation made here to-night that those officers were going around the city saying what the Deputy attributed to them.  The officers of the Army and I know perfectly well that we have not the equipment possessed by huge continental countries.  They know that we have been spending very much less in this way than other nations of our size, but what we did spend during the last few years we spent to the best possible advantage.  We spent it in order to build up an Army which would give a good account of itself, and a good account of the material placed at its disposal.  The Deputy alleged that we spent hundreds of thousands of pounds on different types of uniform which should have gone to the provision of gas masks and other equipment. I presume the Deputy was alluding to the Volunteer uniforms.  The Volunteer uniforms are no more costly than ordinary service dress, and no extra money was, therefore, spent on them that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Are there no ordinary uniforms in store?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Even at the moment we have not a sufficient reserve of uniforms for the standing Army and reserves. The balance of the old service uniforms that were in reserve&mdash;overcoats&mdash;we used for the Volunteers.  The only reserve we had of any account was in overcoats, and they were used for the Volunteers.  Therefore, it is untrue to say that we spent money on Volunteer uniforms that should have gone to other purposes.  They were no more costly than the ordinary uniforms.  That statement of the Deputy is similar to a number of other statements which I <Col N="204" /> do not propose to answer in the same detail.  I wish the Deputy would live up, in the House, to the statement that he wants to treat Army affairs in a non-partisan way.  He says that in one breath and, in the next, he comes to the conclusion that he wants a change of administration because of the Army. He is using the Army simply as a weapon to discredit the present Administration. He is using the Defence Votes in a partisan way.  I wish we could get to the stage that the Army Votes would be approached in a national, instead of a Party, way.  I may have said offensive things often here in the House, when driven to it. I am not always in the same state of grace as I am to-night, please God, I will not be until I get my own back on Deputy O'Higgins.</P>
      <P>I have tried, when dealing with the Army Vote, to deal with it in a non-partisan way, and if we can only be met by Deputies on the opposite benches in the same spirit, we can have a national policy in regard to defence. That is what we want.  Allegations, statements without foundation, such as were thrown around here to-night by the Deputy, abusive language of the type that he used, exaggerated statements, are of no help either in framing an army policy or getting our citizens to co-operate in building up our defences.</P>
      <P>We are going to ask the people for more money for defence purposes, and, when we ask for an increased amount, I hope that Deputy O'Higgins will get his Party to stand in with the Government in imposing whatever taxation may be necessary in order to get adequate material and sufficient personnel for the Army.  The Deputy is not going to have it both ways.  If, when we bring in an Estimate asking for more money, making provision for an increase in the Budget, he or any member of his Party objects, then I will remind him of what he has said here to-night when he advocated that more money should be provided in relation to air raid precautions and other services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We have just witnessed an exhibition of the type of mentality that resulted in the <Col N="205" /> appalling situation that existed last September.  We had a speech from a person holding a responsible position that was at best a glib, cheap, political speech, padded with an amount of utter nonsense.  As a speech from a Minister for Defence, in a world perturbed with wars and rumours of wars, it was about the most unworthy exhibition that was ever listened to in any Parliament.  In so far as it was an attempt to evade the motion, it was rather cunning, and in so far as any man, in a Parliament that is supposed to exist along the lines of decent courtesy, can think that any motion or any speech is met, and adequately met, and fairly met, by a Minister standing up from a Government Front Bench merely to characterise every utterance of his political opponent as being untrue, that is scarcely fair either to the Parliament, to the State or to the Army which he represents.</P>
      <P>Surely, we should have reached the point in Irish public life that, even if we have got to disagree on policies and not always accept the statements of another, we can meet it in some other way than by baldly characterising it as being untrue.  I could say the same with regard to statements of the Minister in reference to the situation in Ireland last September and there would be at least this difference between us, that I was here last September and the Minister was missing. There would be at least that much substantiation for my statement <i>vis-á-vis</i> his, but it would be an entirely unworthy and undignified argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main proof of the justice and the truth of the motion is the rather lengthy attempt of the Minister to avoid discussing it.  We had an account of what was done in 1936, and we had a rather long and interesting lecture on A.R.P., which can be heard any day in Griffith Barracks.  We had a long and interesting account of what was done since October, but we had no reference to the point in the motion about the conditions that existed in September.  There the Minister showed his wisdom, but he merely showed his vindictiveness when he got up to characterise every statement <Col N="206" /> made as untrue.  I know the Minister, and I know that if the statements made were untrue, he would gaily accept the terms of the motion and he would appoint a committee to find the statements untrue.  When Deputy McGilligan once made a statement on this side of the House that Ministers opposite thought was untrue, within 24 hours there was a committee set up to inquire into it and establish the truth or otherwise. It is the same Ministry that is opposite still, and if there was anything untrue or inaccurate in the statements made by me, and justly made by me,the Minister would be greedily anxious to prove the falsity of those statements.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is, and I repeat it, that since the Minister became responsible for the Department of Defence there was no Army Estimate, not a single one in my recollection, voted against in this House. Anything he asked for every year, increasing though it was one year on top of another, was granted without a bitter debate, as was previously the fashion, and without bell-ringing or a vote.  Every Estimate went through year after year for eight years and, at the end of eight years, with no criticism, no opposition, no vote, no trouble with regard to getting money, we had nothing to show when danger threatened.  All the abuse of Deputies over here that the Minister is capable of uttering will not alter the facts and will not disabuse or fool the people who lived through the month of September in this city.</P>
    <P>It would be a bolder and more honest course to come and say that things were bad in September, but that you hope to have them better in the near future.  In that attitude you would get assistance and co-operation. But neither assistance nor co-operation nor money will the Minister get without opposition from here if we are to be treated as dupes, simpletons and fools with no sense of responsibility towards the taxpayer who is providing the money; if we are expected to accept the scandalous and deplorable state of affairs last September without investigation, without examination, without analysis, and to ladle <Col N="207" /> out hundreds of thousands of pounds more to be handled or mishandled by the same Administration that had nothing to show last September.</P>
    <P>It is all very well to make a speech here with the majority behind you and characterise the utterances of an Opposition Deputy as being untrue. There is a parliamentary procedure that can easily settle the truth or the untruth of the statements made.  All the Minister is asked to do in this motion is to investigate the truths or untruths, as the case may be, by means of a committee in which his Party will have the majority.  In spite of his glib phrases with regard to falsehoods uttered from here, he proposes, without investigation and without examining into the truth of the statements made, to come back here in a week's time and look for £500,000 more, to send good money after bad.  He proposes to send some tons of gold to be mishandled and misspent after the tens of tons that have gone before.  That is the position in one of the poorest countries in Europe, a country emerging from a state of affairs that bent the strongest man in it.</P>
    <P>Whatever the Minister's views may be, I would imagine that there is enough sense of responsibility in the Executive as a whole to decide, after the deplorable exhibition of conditions last September, that before Parliament would be asked to put up a huge sum by way of addition for expenditure in the Army, that the advisability of a change would have struck even the simplest person following political affairs, the advisability of putting in somebody in whom the people and the Parliament would have confidence, to ask for more money.  But when one has been given a free hand, has been tried and found deficient, the idea of leaving the same person here to come back, merely relying on a majority, to get more money is not either treating <Col N="208" /> the Parliament or the country properly.</P>
    <P>As I said to the Minister, no money has ever been refused since he went over there, or we came over here, but until there is some gesture by the Government that when things are not right, or when the public are firm in the belief that things are not right, the fears of the public will be at least considered before more money is asked for and that a full, thorough, searching and comprehensive commission or committee will inquire into affairs, and if they are wrong, fix the responsibility and make a change, he cannot expect co-operation from us.  That is what is asked for in this motion.  This motion refers most explicitly to conditions last September.  He would be a very wise man indeed who, listening from beginning to end of the Minister's statement, could guess to what motion he was speaking.  September was avoided as if it were an evil month.  He dealt with 1936 and 1937, with December, 1938, and January and February, 1939, but the one month to which he dared not refer, the one month to which he was clever enough to avoid referring, was the month referred to in the motion, the month when people were alive and awake to the reality, the awfulness and the imminence of war, the one month in 15 years in which the eyes and the minds of the people turned to the Army and, when the eyes and the minds of the people turned in that direction, they found neither solace, comfort nor protection. It is not unreasonable, with that conviction in the public mind, that somebody in the Dáil should suggest that at least there is something there to be inquired into.  It is not unreasonable to suggest that a committee appointed by the Selection Committee of this House should inquire into it and report back to the Dáil before further moneys are demanded from the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he will state (i) in respect of the first week of each month in 1938, the number of men employed on rotational relief schemes (including land reclamation schemes), and the average number employed daily throughout the year; (ii) the average daily rate of wages paid to such men; (iii) the percentage of those so employed in respect of which (a) health insurance; and (b) unemployment insurance cards have been stamped, and the average number of stamps credited to each such worker.</P>

      <P>(i) While a weekly return is kept of the total numbers <Col N="77" /> engaged on all employment schemes, there are very great difficulties in the way of ascertaining the precise number of workmen employed on the rotational system.  The table below sets out in respect of the first week of each month in 1938 the total numbers of men engaged on employment schemes (including land reclamation schemes) and the estimated number of these who were employed on the rotational system.

    <P>The arrangements made for the repayment of moneys advanced for the purchase of the holdings are those which are applicable to ordinary advances under the Land Acts, 1923-36 i.e., land purchase annuities are set up at the rate of 4¾ per cent. on the amounts advanced on resale and these annuities are revised under Part III of the Land Act, 1933.  In calculating the <Col N="83" /> amounts of the advances on resale, allowance is made for the value of the occupation interest in the migrants' old holdings.</P>
