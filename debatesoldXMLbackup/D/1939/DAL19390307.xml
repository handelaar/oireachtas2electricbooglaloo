      <P>I am aware that 37/3 per cwt. has been charged for cleaned <Col N="1484" /> Italian ryegrass seed f.o.r. Dundalk; but I cannot confirm the statement that the current quotation for 21/22 lbs. cleaned Italian ryegrass seed f.o.r. Lurgan is 26/- per cwt.  The restriction on the importation of ryegrass seed has been imposed in the interests of farmers, mainly in County Monaghan, who grow ryegrass for seed purposes, and, in the circumstances, I am not prepared at this stage to take steps to permit cleaned Italian ryegrass seed to be imported.</P>

The tenant, Mark Mellett, is dead, and has been succeeded by Joseph Patrick Mellett.  It is now proposed to discontinue proceedings for the resumption of a portion of the holding in Gortanieran townland, and to institute proceedings for the resumption of a portion of the holding in Kilscohagh townland, and a notice of the intention of the Land Commission to do so will be published at an early date.

      <P>Certainly. The Treason Bill as read a Second Time contemplated punishment for treason as defined in the Preamble&mdash; that is, as defined in the Constitution. Amendment No. 1 seems to prescribe punishment for a form of treason not identical with the form set out in the Constitution and is, therefore, not in order.  Were I to pursue another aspect, I might say that the Constitution can only be amended by an express Act.</P>

      <P>Might I suggest that this Bill is to implement the Constitution and the Constitution sets certain limits beyond which the Bill implementing it cannot go.  I put it to you, Sir, that the amendments proposed by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney do not go beyond the definition of treason that is given in the Constitution.  They do not interfere with the definition that is given in the Constitution.  They seek to limit the application of some of the words and, therefore, I submit that amendment No. 1 is quite within the four walls of the Constitution.  If it were an amendment that went beyond the Constitution then it could be ruled out of order on the ground that it exceeds the Constitution.  My contention is that the Constitution does not lay down anything about treason.  It says it can only consist in that.  It does not say it must consist in that.  It says that it cannot consist in anything more than that.  In that definition, the phrase &ldquo;levying war&rdquo; is used.  The purpose of the amendment is to restrict the power given, but not imposed, by the Constitution.  Constitutionally, there is no necessity for this Bill being introduced.  The Bill does not make its introduction necessary but, when the Government undertakes to implement the Constitution, it may, I suggest, go the full length of the powers granted in the Constitution or fall short of them.  The purpose of the amendment is to fall short of these powers and, in view of these considerations, I ask you to revise your decision.</P>

      <P>As to the Deputy's contention that it was not necessary to introduce this measure, the Chair has nothing to say.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, in the course of a fairly long exchange of notes, backwards and forwards, on Friday night, admitted that the offence of levying &ldquo;constructive war&rdquo; would go unpunished, according to his amendment. This Bill contained a certain principle, approved on Second Reading.  In my opinion, the purpose of the Bill is to define the punishment for treason, as set out in the Constitution. To limit that definition now would be to go against the principle of the Bill.  For that reason, I have ruled out the amendment.  The amendment would prescribe punishment for offences different from those in the Constitution, to a certain extent, and I might go further and say that it would mean the redrafting of the Bill in other respects.</P>

      <P>May I suggest that, in the amendment which the Taoiseach has down, there is the possibility of dealing with other offences. Secondly, when the House assents to the Second Reading of a Bill which provides punishment for what I might call direct treason and constructive treason, as this Bill does, it is surely within the power of the House to strike out one of these&mdash;namely, constructive treason&mdash;leaving the real treason to stand.  The purpose of the Bill would still remain.  Article 39 of the Constitution is purely negative.  It says it shall consist only of that.  It does not say it shall consist of that but, rather, that it cannot consist of anything more than that.  Even if this amendment were accepted, we should still be keeping the purpose of the Bill which, with all respect, I understood from the Taoiseach, to be to provide against real treason.  The case made was not that the other treason was unimportant but that &ldquo;constructive treason&rdquo; would not be so interpreted by the courts.  The purpose of the Bill is to deal with real treason.  The purpose of the amendment is to see that it does not deal with something that, we gathered the last day, was not the purpose of the Bill&mdash;constructive treason.</P>

So far as I can recollect, this is the first Bill in which we have had an ornamental preamble of this kind.  After line 21 we have the words &ldquo;Be it therefore enacted by the Oireachtas as follows.&rdquo; Is the Oireachtas enacting lines 10 to 21 or is it only enacting what follows line 21, because we have no definition of &ldquo;treason&rdquo; in this Bill?  We have got a definition of &ldquo;treason&rdquo; in a negative sense in the Constitution.  Are we incorporating in this Bill the decision that treason means the negative thing it does mean in the Constitution or is the transference into this Bill of the substance of the Constitution intended to be an interpretation of &ldquo;treason&rdquo; for the <Col N="1494" /> purpose of this Bill?  The House ought to know whether it is enacting lines 10 to 21 or whether it is enacting only what follows, the other portion being merely an ornamental preamble.</P>

      <P>In my opinion, the House would enact the whole Bill from line 10.  As to the point raised by Deputy O'Sullivan, the Chair cannot go into the niceties of real and constructive treason.  That is a matter for argument between constitutional lawyers.  It is not within my province. In my view, it is not legitimate either to narrow or to widen the main purpose of this Bill, which is to punish treason, defined.  The House approved on Second Reading of that definition and the amendment submitted by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney differs, to a certain extent, from this definition and would leave certain forms of treason unpunished.  For that reason, I feel obliged to rule the amendment out of order.</P>

      <P>I accept your ruling, but I suggest that by that ruling you are deciding the question of the distinction or non-distinction between real and constructive treason. I understood you to disclaim any such intention, but in practice that is what your ruling amounts to.  It means that we cannot separate them by amendment and rule out one of them. I also ask you to reconsider your <Col N="1495" /> general statement that we are bound to exercise to the full extent the powers given in any Article of the Constitution. I suggest that there is an effort here to go short of the full powers by making a distinction between real and constructive treason and I further make the point that there is no positive definition of treason in the Constitution.  The Chair may remember a celebrated occasion when a lawyer was consulted by those who are now the Government as to whether a certain oath to be taken implied any such thing as an oath.  If there was any foundation for that argument I submit that there is a great deal more foundation for the argument that there is no positive definition of treason in the Constitution and that there is no definition in this Bill.  You may say that that is a matter for the Government.  I am not denying that, but really this will make for difficulty in dealing with any Bill ever brought in to deal with the Constitution.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to point out our main objection to Section I as it stands, and I am sorry that the Taoiseach and the Government could not see their way to meet the reasonable case that was made out.  As I understand the section as it stands, it uses technical words, words which have been given a technical sense, and interpreted in the courts&mdash;both the Constitution and the Bill do that&mdash; namely &ldquo;levying war.&rdquo; It was pointed out clearly here the last day that those technical words have been interpreted by the courts to embrace a large number of offences which nobody in this country in normal times would suggest should deserve the penalty of death. Take a type of offence which was known when I was a very young man, say 30 or 35 years ago so as to avoid all recent controversy.  Take the offence of cattle driving.  As I understand the decisions of the court, if a number of people engage in cattle driving, not to interfere with the rights of John Browne, but if they engage in cattle <Col N="1497" /> driving so as to bring pressure to bear on the Government to alter the law, they are guilty of levying war.  I am not going into the phrase as to what treason means.  I am going into the phrase as to what levying war means, and levying war has been ruled by the courts as embracing a case of that kind.  If one person or three or four people do an illegal thing of that kind, use force, even merely, say, cattle driving for the purpose of bringing undue pressure to bear on the Government to change the laws, be they social, political or economic laws, they are guilty of levying war.  It was pointed out here on the last day that this and similar offences have been ruled by the courts to come under the technical phrase &ldquo;levying war.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Levying war&rdquo; is a technical phrase, and it has been interpreted by the judges.  I hold that the House is not at liberty to assume that it will be interpreted otherwise by any other set of judges.  We were fully in accord with the Government in prescribing the supreme penalty for a real case of treason, but, as there is an opportunity of bringing legislation up to date and into harmony with modern conceptions, there should be a distinction made in the Bill and in the section between real levying war and constructive levying war.  It may be said: &ldquo;The judge will not decide that; the juries will decide that.&rdquo; I think the judges will feel themselves bound to interpret according to the precedents that have been set before them.  I do not think an ordinary judge will conceive that he has any other option.  But leaving that aside, there is another aspect of the case which possibly has escaped attention. With a certain amount of relevance on the last day when discussing the Second Reading of this Bill the Taoiseach, by anticipation, referred to another Bill, and pointed out the close relationship between the two Bills. Under Part V of that other Bill, special courts may be set up, and any of the ordinary offences may be scheduled if the Government is convinced that the ordinary courts cannot deal with them. Any of those offences may be scheduled by the Government, and will come before the special court.  Therefore, it <Col N="1498" /> may be the special court which will be enforcing the penalty so far as this is concerned.  I understand that the special court can deal with offences and impose the penalty which is prescribed by law for those offences.  We are now prescribing by law what is the penalty for the technical offence known as &ldquo;levying war.&rdquo; We say that that penalty is death, and no other penalty.</P>
    <P>Now, as I said, what levying war is can only be decided by the precedents, and they were quoted here by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney on the last day.  It may be said, of course, that if it went before the jury they would throw it out.  But it may not go before the jury; it may go before the special court.  Therefore, for the offence, say, of cattle driving, if the Government chooses&mdash;the Government can bring other charges&mdash;to bring that charge, legally it would seem as if we were enacting that those people should be tried for treason.  The charge can be brought, and if the charge is brought there is only one penalty prescribed. I admit that in 99 cases out of 100 the Government would not do anything of the kind; they would not bring a charge of this kind which would involve the penalty of death for the offence, but we are legislating to that effect.  That is my objection, and at any time it likes any Government could do that.  That, Sir, is altogether too drastic.  Whilst we are in full agreement with the Government so far as real treason is concerned, we think it is highly regrettable that when opportunity offered a clear distinction of that kind was not made.  I doubt if there is any definition of treason that could be administered by any court.  That is a matter for the lawyers and not for me, but I doubt if there is any definition of treason which could be administered by any court.  There is only repetition of the Article in the Constitution and that is purely negative.  I am assuming the Bill is not futile and that, therefore, the court will have to interpret this as being the definition of treason.  I do not know what it will interpret, but the court will take the words &ldquo;levying war&rdquo; in the only sense in which <Col N="1499" /> it can take it, and the penalty in that case will be death.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion we discussed this Bill a difference of opinion arose between the Taoiseach and myself as to whether, in fact, the Treason Bill did not go much wider than the Treasonable Offences Act of 1925.  I then contended, and still contend, that the new Treason Bill goes much further than the Treasonable Offences Act of 1925, because in the new Bill treason consists, amongst other things, of levying war.  When we come to interpret what levying war is we get no assistance from the Bill.  I should like to know if we are thrown back as to what levying war means, to British statutes or British legal judgments.  If we are, levying war then can consist of a variety of things, and shall not consist of the overt act of levying war in a positive fashion.  The whole question of what actually constitutes levying war is a matter on which there is need for a considerable amount of clarification in the Bill.  Levying war in the Bill is treason, and is punishable by death, but in British statutes and British judgments levying war, in fact, means offences which are punishable in the Offences Against the State Bill, lesser than actual death.  Is it possible, for instance, for a person who incites any member of the military or police forces maintained by the Government to mutiny to be charged with levying war for the purposes of the Bill?  British statutes and British legal judgments would indicate that it is possible to charge a person who incites to mutiny in the case of members of the police or military forces with levying war. A person tried under the Offences Against the State Bill could be charged with levying war and might have to suffer the penalty of death. Under the 1925 Act, that person could not suffer the penalty of death, because it prescribed that levying war constituted treason.  A person could also be indicted in this Bill for misdemeanour under a separate section, and the punishment was much less than death.  I should like the Taoiseach to say where exactly we <Col N="1500" /> stand, and what constitutes &ldquo;levying war.&rdquo; Does it include in this Bill a sentence that is less than that in the Act of 1925?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we get more involved about this, perhaps we should make our minds clear on a couple of points.  First of all, there is Deputy O'Sullivan's interpretation of Article 39 of the Constitution and the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; which occurs in that Article.  My interpretation is that &ldquo;treason shall consist only...&rdquo; and there is reference then to a number of matters.  Treason is defined as meaning these things, and these things only.  I take it that the definition in the Constitution is the exact definition and does not merely prescribe the upper limit.  There is an upper limit and a lower limit.  The definition excludes anything but the things referred to as constituting treason. That is the first point as to the meaning of the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; in Article 39.  The next point is, if treason is defined in the Constitution can we vary the definition here?  This Bill is intended to prescribe the punishment for treason and nothing else. Therefore, we have definitely in it punishment for the offence which is described as treason in the Constitution, and none other.  Are we to interpret the Constitution here?  I say we cannot do so.  That will have to be left to the courts.  Deputies can interpret the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; in different ways.  Different Deputies take different interpretations.  Strangely enough, we heard nothing of these different interpretations when Article 39 was going through in a previous Dáil.  There did not seem to be any question then as to what levying war meant.  We seemed to be satisfied with the definition, and it went through without much discussion. That could not be said of many other Articles in the Constitution.  It may be possible to interpret this in different ways, but, ultimately, the courts will have to interpret it and say what is the right and proper meaning to be attached to the words as we find here. An interpretation would be given by the courts of the phrase &ldquo;levying war&rdquo;.  I would take it that a modern <Col N="1501" /> court interpreting the words would bear in mind what the Parliament was that passed them, the conditions under which they were passed and approved, and the people who enacted them.  I would say that judges interpreting the words would interpret &ldquo;levying war&rdquo; in the plain, common-sense meaning, and would not be fishing up decisions of 200 or 300 years ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably most of the cases referred to on the last day were based on decisions 200 or 300 years old.  As far as I know they were 200 or 300 years old.  Are the courts going to give to the words &ldquo;levying war&rdquo; a meaning which the average person would not give to them?  On the other hand, if we take the direct levying of war, I think there might be as much discussion about the meaning of that expression and of the full significance of the word &ldquo;direct,&rdquo; as there might be about the phrase &ldquo;levying war&rdquo; by itself.  We have to leave that to the courts, and the less we try to tamper with it here the better, from the point of view of plain common-sense interpretation.  As to the suggestions about the meaning of constructive levying of war as suggested by old court decisions, I think we are on far safer ground if we take the definition in the Constitution for what it is, and leave it to the courts to say what the meaning is, and, I think, they will inevitably decide, according to the plain meaning of the words, and would not be constrained or bound by old decisions.  It might be informative and interesting, from the point of view of legal history, to go back and consider these things, but I do not think that they would be regarded at all as cases which would constrain the judges of the present day, in the present circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the point that has been made by Deputy Norton that this is wider, I do not think he has made any case whatever.  If he read the Treasonable Offences Act, 1925&mdash;I sent him over a copy the last day&mdash;he would find that &ldquo;levying war&rdquo; occurs in <Col N="1502" /> that and that any interpretation given to it in the past would, if anything, be narrowed down by the new set of circumstances in which these words were enacted by the people as a whole. In the enactment of it the meaning they were naturally going to attach to it was the broad, simple meaning, which has not been questioned.  It was not questioned here when it was being passed and it was not questioned in the country.  The plain meaning of &ldquo;levying war&rdquo; is what the Deputies would understand by the direct levying of war.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of its being too wide, all that was done in the Constitution was to condense the part that referred to treason and to make sure that offences which, under the old law, and before the passing of the Constitution, might possibly have been held to be treason will not in future, from the time of the passing of the Constitution, be regarded as such.</P>
    <P>I think, therefore, that there is no need whatever for the amendment that is put forward.  That is the advice that has been given to me by the legal department: that there is no need whatever for it, and that, in fact, it would be full of dangers of various kinds to try to modify the Bill by breaking up treason into a lesser and greater treason or anything of that sort, or by retaining only a reference to treason in a restricted sense.  I think I have nothing further to say on the point.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach met all sorts of suggestion continually asked for in a calm and reasonable spirit by not making the slightest concession. I wonder does he ever read the law reports and is he under the impression that judges are not bound by previous decisions because they happen to live at the present day?  I wonder is his knowledge of Irish history so confined as to think that the Fenians were active 300 years ago?  And yet, one of the cases cited by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney had reference to the Fenians. That was not 300 years ago.  The main case cited by him actually was with reference to the Fenians and their activities against Scotland Yard.  I may not know much about the Fenians, but I do know of Scotland Yard by reading detective stories and I wonder whether that was 300 years ago.  We have not got out that an attempt to blow Scotland Yard up by nitroglycerine goes back 300 years, but, at least, we have got one thing out.  All through the debate on the Constitution I was left under the impression&mdash;I am glad now to see erroneously&mdash;that the judges were not the people to interpret the Constitution.  I think it was put forward here by the Taoiseach that it should not be the function of the courts to interpret the Constitution.  Interpreting the Constitution is a political business.</P>

      <P>No; it was the President said it then, Sir.  I know that nobody can help misinterpreting him, but I have certainly stood up in this House again and again and pleaded that the judges were the people who would interpret this Constitution and could only take a certain meaning out of it.  I understood at the time that the line was taken up by the then President, the present Taoiseach, that, after all, it should not be the courts that interpret <Col N="1504" /> these things.  But the courts, despite what the Taoiseach says, may be bound by precedent.  They may consider themselves bound by precedent. Why not legislate against that possibility? He says he does not know what the judges are going to decide, but his whole conduct in regard to this section is that he does know what they are going to decide.  They are bound by precedent and they may decide that levying war must be interpreted in that way, if that is put before them.  But the Taoiseach gaily gets up and says that no modern judge would do that. But why not take the steps to see that they cannot do it?  It is our business, when we are passing laws which are to be interpreted by a judiciary, to make things as clear as we can and limit the things as much as we can so that an extraordinary variety of judgement may not be possible.  The most that the Taoiseach can say is that they may not interpret according to precedent, but against that, equally well, they may. Why not put it out of their power to give that too broad interpretation?  The Taoiseach says that that is amending the Constitution.  It is doing nothing of the kind.  In that case if you bring in implementing legislation, you could never add or take away from the actual words of the Constitution.  What we want is to define a certain word that is in the Constitution, namely, &ldquo;levying war.&rdquo; The Taoiseach says that the word &ldquo;direct&rdquo; will not do it.  Let him do it in any other way then, so long as he defines it.  But, it is a new idea of interpreting the Constitution that, once the Constitution is passed, the Legislature dare not define any of the terms in the Constitution.  That is more or less the line taken up now by the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>As regards the word &ldquo;only,&rdquo; supposing the Taoiseach leaves the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; out of Article 39, how will the interpretation differ from the one he has given now?  Not at all; will it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It would then read, &ldquo;treasion shall consist in levying war against the State, or assisting any State or person or inciting or conspiring <Col N="1505" /> with any person to levy war against the State,&rdquo; and so on.

      <P>Therefore, it means that it cannot be more than that. The Taoiseach gave his definition, which is not the definition of an ordinary man and is not interpreted in the circumstances of the ordinary use of English.  It is only the Taoiseach making a political statement, and, as he knows perfectly well, in time to come he will have ten different explanations of what he meant by this word &ldquo;only&rdquo; and will be asking for power to put them into the records.  So, at last, there will be a printed record of what he really said and really meant.  But he is not at all meeting the point deliberately now, even when his attention is called to it.  He says, &ldquo;What happened in 1925?&rdquo; and what happened in 1925 was good enough for us.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear it.  I will leave that aside.  I am not going to give the opportunity to the Taoiseach of explaining what he meant in 1932.  He need not think I will.  I am doing nothing of the kind. I know perfectly well that he would be much more fluent on that than in interpreting an Article of the Constitution or a paragraph in the Bill.  I refrain entirely from giving him that opportunity and, if he brings it in, I am not responsible for his bringing it in.  I want to make that perfectly clear. What we want is to give the Government power to deal with real treason and not to give them absurd powers that could easily be put aside, at least, that they need not claim and can avoid getting by defining the words &ldquo;levying war.&rdquo; Again and again we have been asked here to help the Government, to give it support.  Never have I known any reasonable case put forward by these benches, when we accept principle, even for the slightest modification, that has never been anything else <Col N="1506" /> except trampled on by the Taoiseach. He has done nothing to get the support of a general body of public opinion behind the things that he professes to be interested in.  I hold, Sir, that this is an illustration and I see no good in prolonging this discussion because I know perfectly well from experience that the more reasonable the case that is put to the Taoiseach the more unreasonable will he make it appear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach says, when he is quoting British legal definitions of what constitutes &ldquo;levying war&rdquo; that these decisions are 300 years old at a minimum.  It is not 300 years since the Treason Felony Act was passed in Britain.  It was passed in 1848 and John Mitchel and Michael Davitt were tried under that Act. There is also the case of another Fenian, Gallagher, having been tried in 1883 under the same Act, and one of the charges against him in connection with his indictment was that he &ldquo;levied war against the Queen to compel her to change her counsels and to intimidate or overawe the House as a Parliament.&rdquo; That was levying war in 1883, approximately 56 years ago. The trial judge in that case said that if what the prisoners did was to compel her Majesty or her Ministers by force to change the present Constitution, or to alter the relationships between England and Ireland, or even to set up a separate Parliament in Ireland, it would constitute an indictment on that count: so that, even in 1883, levying war consisted of much less than the overt act of actually waging war against the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have that type of definition of the phrase and the Taoiseach tells us that he feels sure the judges would interpret it in the light of the circumstances existing to-day and of the circumstances under which this Bill was passed; but what the House is really being asked to do is to pass the present Bill and to allow the judges, who have no responsibility whatever to the people, to tell us what constitutes treason.  The judges may be perfectly estimable citizens, well versed in law and learning and culture, but the judges of this country have no power <Col N="1507" /> whatever to prescribe for the people of the country what constitutes treason within this country.  That is a task for the community, acting through its legislative assembly.  This is its legislative assembly and it is the task of this legislative assembly to say what it will punish for treason and will not punish for treason.  It is not the task of a judge to prescribe what treason is, nor to prescribe the punishment for treason. That is the function of the Legislature and we ought to write down in black and white, in clear and simple language, what we mean by treason and what punishment we will prescribe for it, and let the judge then try whether, in fact, a person is guilty of treason as set out in an Act of the Oireachtas, and deal with the case in accordance with the punishment prescribed.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach asks us; &ldquo;Enact this Bill and leave it to the courts.&rdquo; He feels sure that the judges will not do this, or will not do that, that they will not be guided by musty old British judgements, but will have an up-to-date look at the legislation and see in what circumstances it was enacted and what the Taoiseach said when it was being enacted.  That is not the way we ought to pass legislation here.  We ought to be precise and definite as to what constitutes treason and what the punishment is for treason, and we ought not to be relying on ancient British definitions of the term.  When this Bill is passed and the judges are left to interpret it, we will find that the judges&mdash;and judges in what may be described as the English-speaking countries in the main inevitably draw inspiration from previous judgements in British Courts, in the Privy Council and the House of Lords&mdash;will incline in that direction, unless we prevent them from doing so by defining &ldquo;levying war&rdquo; as constituting something other than the ancient definition as evolved by British Courts down through the ages.</P>

      <P>It is very hard to deal with Deputy O'Sullivan because he goes round and round and round, until in the end we do not know where <Col N="1508" /> we are.  I stand on the interpretation of the word &ldquo;only.&rdquo; I think it is a commonsense interpretation which any man who reads the paragraph will take from it.  &ldquo;Leave the word out,&rdquo; the Deputy says.  Because, since it is put in, it must add something.  Sometimes words added do not add a great deal, but in this case&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not a bad hand at it either.  This word does add something.  It adds emphasis because treason might, on account of the older interpretation and connotation of it, suggest a number of other things.  We say that it consists of these things, and these things only. Surely that is the ordinary common-sense interpretation of the word &ldquo;only.&rdquo; With regard to the cases of treason felony to which reference has been made, it was a statutory offence. It was not treason at all, in the proper sense of the term.  There are relatively few cases in modern times of treason.  These were statutory offences. We also have this question of what the courts will do.  The British themselves regard these old cases in law as obsolete and not binding, and I am informed that writers of textbooks, Roscoe, for example, hold definitely that they would be regarded as obsolete and would not be accepted as a basis by modern courts.  The Deputy tells us that in cases of this kind, we ought to make sure.  I accept that principle.  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney tried his hand at it and it was not able to pass the Chair.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear to anybody who approaches the matter seriously that you have a definition in the Constitution, and if you try to deal with that definition by modification or anything of the sort you begin to interpret it.  You constitute the Legislature as the body to interpret the Constitution.  That is an obvious difficulty.  There is only one direction in which the slightest glimmer of hope was held out, and that was to provide punishment for certain of the offences mentioned in the Constitution, and not to implement the Constitution in regard to others.  In other words, it was suggested that, having defined a most serious offence in the Constitution and got it passed by the people, we should make a dead letter of it by not implementing it.  I do not think that is the proper way to treat the Constitution.  I think we can depend here on the judges in interpreting the Constitution in the plain sense and plain meaning of the terms, and judges who have not hesitated to put aside recent decisions will not go back 200 <Col N="1510" /> or 300 years in order to find out whether levying war would be something different from what the words would convey to an average person at the present time.</P>
      <P>The Deputy finds fault with us because we do not take amendments from the Opposition, as he says.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to bother now about the differences.  I am dealing with this Bill at the moment, and apparently there is a difference of opinion on the part of the Opposition as to what should be in this Bill, a difference between what they think and what we think, and they want us to give way to them.  We believe that they have not made a good case, and I do not believe in giving way to a person when a good case has not been made.  We have no set views about this; it is simply a question of implementing the Constitution in a straightforward way.  Deputies on the opposite benches, however, want to bring in a certain point by way of amendment and cannot do it, but apparently they want us to do something at which they themselves tried their hand and failed in doing.  We do not see any reason at all&mdash;and no case has been made for it&mdash;for interfering with the Bill as it stands in regard to this first section and the definition, which is really a repetition of the definition in the Constitution. Consequently, even if the amendment had come along here and had passed <Col N="1511" /> the Chair, I would have been constrained to oppose it.</P>

We learned that in connection with every Article of the Constitution when it was going through.

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with what &ldquo;levying war&rdquo; means, and I was quoting a case dealing with levying war.  I wanted a definition of that, and that was dealt with in a case in which the Fenians were being tried, and the definition was laid down there <Col N="1512" /> in that case by the Lord Chief Justice. But, of course, having said that it was 300 years old, according to the Taoiseach, the Fenians must have been tried 300 years ago.  What are the judges to do, according to the Taoiseach?  First of all, he is practically sure now that the judges will not be bound by previous judgments.  That is an extraordinary view to take.  If they are, if they do look at them at all, they will not be influenced by them. My case is met if they are even influenced by these judgments.  I do not undertake to say for certain that they will be bound by these judgments, but they may be bound by them, and we ought to prevent them from being bound by that particular definition of &ldquo;levying war.&rdquo; That is what we are arguing for.  According to the Taoiseach, the only interest the present courts have here is that these previous decisions are, as I understand him, objects of archaeology for them or objects of historical interest.  I cannot take that view of the way the laws are being administered here; it would be against the whole system of law and the whole administration of the law, and I do not know on what the Taoiseach bases his view that the judges will ignore the whole practised training they have got&mdash;why?&mdash;merely because, in the month of July, the people of Ireland passed or gave their assent to this Constitution and read the thing so very carefully that really they knew what the word &ldquo;only&rdquo; meant in Article 39.  If the judges have to try to decide, not what this House meant, but what the ordinary people of Ireland meant, in the plebiscite of 1937, I do not envy them their job in that particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the Taoiseach says that this is not a proper way to treat the Constitution. First of all, what has been done?  He has laid down the principle that we cannot interpret two words in the Constitution, namely, what &ldquo;levying war&rdquo; means.  Because it is in the Constitution, it is uninterpretable by the ordinary man or by the Legislature. That is the proposition we are asked to agree to&mdash;that once a thing gets into the Constitution, we cannot interpret it.  That is an amazing position <Col N="1513" /> to take up.  Secondly, the judges, apparently, are the only people who can do that.  We are to give them no help as to what we mean.  If the Taoiseach is afraid that interpretating two words in the Constitution is unconstitutional&mdash;because that is all it can mean&mdash;that you must go before the court to find out what &ldquo;levying war&rdquo; means before this House can take it upon itself to say what is the meaning, because these words are in the Constitution&mdash;surely, that is not the way to treat the Constitution.  In addition, another thing that the Taoiseach has done is to bring in an unamendable Bill.  He says that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney tried his hand at amending the Bill and that the reason he could not do it is because the Bill is unamendable.  I do not believe that the Bill is unamendable. I do not think it is beyond the power of the Parliamentary draftsmen to draft an amendment framed to meet the wishes of the Opposition in this particular matter.  As long as the section stands as it is, I can only take it&mdash;I am speaking now of my interpretation which, from the point of view of commonsense, I suggest, stands at least as high as that of the Taoiseach &mdash;that the Government is determined to include, in the phrase &ldquo;levying war,&rdquo; a much wider circle of offences than have been mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows full well that nothing we have said justifies that.  Quite the contrary. Everything we have said indicates that we believe that &ldquo;levying war&rdquo; means what the average person would take it to mean and that it would be so held by the judges.  When I have spoken about this Dáil interpreting the Constitution the Deputy should clearly understand what I meant.  If he does not understand what I meant, perhaps I should represent it to him in another form which will make it clear. If the House does take upon itself the interpretation of the Constitution, that interpretation will not be binding as against the interpretation which the courts will make of the Constitution. The Constitution is the fundamental document, and any interpretation, narrowing or expanding it, <Col N="1514" /> which we may attempt to make here, would be held to be null and void ultimately.  Again, with regard to the courts interpreting the Constitution, surely I never said that the courts would not interpret the Constitution. Will the Deputy get the phrase or the place where I said it?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure if he did the Deputy would not find that.  All I said, if I spoke about the interpretation of the Constitution by the courts, was that I held that they would not adopt the same strict method of dealing with the Constitution; that it would be interpreted more liberally by them than an ordinary Act of Parliament. I believe that is true.  In other words, that what I have called several times to-day the plain, commonsense meaning would be taken.  In regard to Acts of Parliament, there would be probably a stricter line taken.  Of course, I knew the courts would interpret the Constitution.  Who else was there to interpret it?  But I did hold, and do hold, that in interpreting the Constitution the courts would approach it in a different frame of mind.  Their attitude would be different from the attitude in which they would approach the interpretation of the ordinary law.  If we here attempted to define or limit the Constitution in any sense in which that definition seemed to differ from the Constitution, the courts would hold that the Constitution is the fundamental document, and we could not here by simple legislation modify it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only glimmer of a line in which one could meet the points made by the Opposition would be to avoid attaching a penalty to what was regarded by the Constitution as a crime.  We have not stated that what the Deputies call constructive treason was, in our opinion, treason, or that it was a kind of crime for which the death penalty was prescribed.  My argument has been that that was an attempt to use &mdash;and I repeat it&mdash;two or three-century-old cases that had been <Col N="1515" /> decided in the courts with respect to treason and try to apply them in the conditions of to-day.  I do not think it would be done.  I do not think there is any use in speaking any more, so far as I am concerned, in the matter.</P>

I am trying to interpret his refusal to do a certain thing, and that is why I say, and repeat, that for the constructive levying of war we are legislating that the penalty shall be death, and that is the only penalty.  The Taoiseach speaks of what the ordinary man means by certain things.  We have had an interesting illustration of it this evening, namely, the Article of the Constitution.  To him it is plain as meaning one thing.  To me, I can assure him, it is equally plain as meaning something else.  Neither of us is a lawyer.  I would be the last person who would like to be offensive to the Taoiseach, but I must take it that these two ordinary common-sense and conflicting meanings are the real meaning of the Article.  That is a bit too much to ask of me, even to please the Taoiseach&mdash;to believe that two conflicting common-sense points of view like that can both be true.  There is the same thing about the section itself.  I am judging the Government's intention by their action, not by the web of words with which the Taoiseach tried to wipe out the whole business.  I hold that the Taoiseach has given no reason whatever; he has not attempted even to meet the case put forward.  I shall not deal with the other matter I referred to.  It was not touched upon. In my opinion, it is not a judge who may interpret this.  It may be the special tribunal that will interpret this.</P>

      <P>I stress the point that in 99 cases out of 100 in which a knotty question is submitted to the judiciary they are guided by the previous interpretations or decisions of the courts.  The technical phrase, &ldquo;levying war,&rdquo; has one meaning and <Col N="1516" /> one meaning only, and that is anything that can be construed as doing something that is liable to upset or compel the Government to do something that the people who are levying war want them to do.  Deputy O'Sullivan has pointed out that cattle driving to compel the Government to change the law would be levying war, and that it has been so interpreted.  When a case arises it will be referred to the Attorney-General to frame the charge, and the first thing the Attorney-General's Department will do is to take down old tomes, some of them 300 years old, to see exactly how the charge should be framed.  I have gone through it myself and I know something about it.  There will be half a dozen alternative charges prepared, but they will be sure to put in the one under which the biggest penalty can be imposed, and that is treason.  There will be a charge of treason, then treason felony, and there will be alternative charges right down the line.</P>
      <P>We are told that the judges will interpret whether it is a minor or a major offence.  But it is possible that the Government of the day in its wisdom may decide that the case is to be tried by a military tribunal or the equivalent of it, and the result will be that there will be no difficulty in their deciding what constitutes levying war If they find that a person is guilty of levying war, they must automatically find him guilty of treason and, therefore, the only punishment is death; because, having found him guilty of levying war, he is found guilty of treason.  I think that is an astonishing attitude for the Government to take up when there can be no question about it.  I hold that the Oireachtas is supreme and that it can make its decisions on a question like this different from the British decisions, and that there is no reason why it should not. Therefore, I think that the definition of treason should be very positive and not left in this nebulous form&mdash;that a judge is to decide what the Taoiseach thought on this or that particular day, or what Deputy O'Sullivan thought was the intention of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>Is there any real difficulty <Col N="1517" /> on the part of the Taoiseach in saying what exactly in his view constitutes levying war?  I asked him whether an attempt to overawe Parliament constitutes levying war. I asked him whether any incitement to mutiny on the part of members of the military or police forces constitutes levying war.  These are categories of offences which have been described as levying war under previous British legal decisions.  The Taoiseach said no, that these were not levying war within the meaning of this Bill.  Therefore, apparently, the Taoiseach has no difficulty whatever in making up his mind on what exactly constitutes levying war for the purposes of the Bill.  The one way in which we can make sure that the judges will not go back to the hoary vistas of British legal judgments is to set down what exactly we think constitutes levying war in 1939.  I should like to know from the Taoiseach, as he is able to give a ready answer to two very important aspects of what constitutes levying war, why he would not make an effort to set out what in fact does constitute levying war for the purposes of this Bill.  There can be no real difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach does not want any ancient conceptions of the levying of war.  The Taoiseach does not want conceptions of levying war which consist of taking cognisance of a situation which now happily no longer exists here in relation to our imperial master of other years.  The Taoiseach wants to take a view of levying war based upon conditions as they exist here to-day.  What, therefore, is the difficulty in making an effort to say that levying war consists of so-and-so in the light of present-day circumstances, instead of making it possible for some very old and liverish judge&mdash;they can be both, you know&mdash; to come along and say, &ldquo;In my opinion, so-and-so constitutes levying war.&rdquo; According to British legal judgments, it was treason at one time if, having decided to make love to the king's eldest daughter, you decided afterwards that you would not do so. That constituted treason at one time under British legal judgments.  I do <Col N="1518" /> not say that there is the possibility of anybody being arraigned by the Attorney-General on that charge to-day. But we ought to make sure at any rate, before turning away from that point.  We can do it if the Taoiseach makes an effort to set down what &ldquo;levying war&rdquo; means.  So far we have not seen any effort made to do that.  We are told &ldquo;trust the judge&rdquo;; let the judge decide it.  That is what we are told.  I am opposed to giving that function to the judge because that is not part of the functions of a judge.  It is the job of the Legislature to protect itself.  There is no case for allowing a judge, responsible to nobody, not even to those who appointed him, to decide what constitutes treason.  I am strongly opposed to giving a judge that power.</P>

      <P>There is a great complaint from the Opposition.  They complain that the Government will not &ldquo;accept our view.&rdquo; I have repeatedly told Deputies and assured them that there was no question of any personal bias in connection with this matter. The instructions were that we wanted to implement the Constitution and have the crime of treason based on the Constitution and no further back.  The points that were put up by the Opposition on a previous occasion were discussed with our law advisers.  I have given you the substance in what I have said to-day of the arguments <Col N="1519" /> that we used against those put forward by the Opposition.  I constituted myself for a moment the judge between the two of these.  That is my responsibility. I believe that the arguments put forward by the legal advisers to the Government are sound.  Might I say to Deputy Norton as a final statement that we cannot define treason here.  Is not that clear?</P>

      <P>Wait a minute now. Any definition of treason that we give here may not possibly be substituted for treason as defined in the Constitution. That is clear.  The definition in the Constitution is the definition that will go.  I can understand the Deputy if he means that we are to leave aside the implementation by refusing to provide punishment for anything that might be regarded in the Constitution but for which we do not wish to have the penalties of treason.  That is a line of country we are exploring, because it is the only line I see open to meet the point.  But the moment you explore that line of country you get into new difficulties such as those regarding the use of the word &ldquo;direct.&rdquo; Suppose you say &ldquo;direct levying of war.&rdquo; I say to Deputies that it is very much easier to say what a thing is not than what a thing is.  Take the particular case. I ask &ldquo;Is that a pen?&rdquo; and one can say straight off &ldquo;It is not.&rdquo; It would be very difficult for me to give a definition of a pen which would be all-embracing and which would meet every case.  It is easy enough to have a certain test, but Deputies must remember that &ldquo;levying war&rdquo; would be interpreted in a particular case in the light of all the circumstances attending it.  It will not be a case of defining it in a vacuum or in a general abstract way.  When a judge is dealing with a particular charge of treason, say, a charge made against a particular group of individuals who are indicted for treason, there would be a particular set of circumstances there <Col N="1520" /> in the light of which it will be decided whether there was, in fact, a levying of war or not.  I think it is very much better to leave it in that position, depending upon commonsense and the fact that the Constitution was passed here in 1937.  The definitions referred to are held by English legal authorities as obsolete.  I do not fear the things that the Opposition seem to fear in this.  I do not see any way of remedying them without introducing other difficulties which would be just as serious. That is why I am suggesting that we leave the matter as it is.</P>

      <P>I did not intend to intervene in this debate.  It is beyond me and a bit beyond the ordinary Deputy in this House to usurp the functions of a Constitutional lawyer. But the Taoiseach did invite us in this House, on the Second Reading of this particular Treason Bill, to suggest improvements; he said that if we offered any fair criticism we would be met.  He said he would meet any reasonable objection put forward by the Opposition.  We had objections. To the non-legal mind, the main objection was that the penalty of death might be enforced for certain offences, for which, in fact, we did not think the penalty of death should be enforced.  The Taoiseach said that treason cannot be defined and a number of other people say the same. There is the definition of treason in the Constitution.  Treason is defined here in the Bill as in the Constitution and it is defined amongst other things as levying war.  The Taoiseach says that we cannot even define levying war.  So the position is that we can define neither &ldquo;treason&rdquo; nor &ldquo;levying war.&rdquo; During this debate the Taoiseach has been good enough to say that certain things did not constitute &ldquo;levying war.&rdquo; Might I suggest to the Taoiseach that, in order to meet some portion of our objections, if he or his legal advisers cannot define what levying war is, that they can at least define, as the Taoiseach has admitted, certain things that are not levying war?  Will he bring in a section to this Bill to say that certain things are not levying war so that we may be sure that there will be some <Col N="1521" /> things, at any rate, under the head of treason, or under the head of levying war, in respect of which a person will not incur the death penalty if convicted of it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to what the Taoiseach said on the matter of being out-of-date, may I quote two lines from Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's speech?  &ldquo;I shall read from Archbold Criminal Law, 1934 edition.&rdquo; I am afraid that the legal advisers of the Taoiseach must have read the figure &ldquo;9&rdquo; upside down, and thought that the edition was 1634 and not 1934. To suggest that a view of the law that is put down in a well-known textbook in the year 1934, two years after the new dispensation came in here, is obsolete, is absurd.  All that one may say is that the Constitution is nearly as obsolete in that case.</P>
      <P>What is the new line taken up by the Taoiseach and the legal advisers of the Legislature, so far as we are concerned?  It is &ldquo;we do not know what we mean, but we will ask the judges to know what we mean.&rdquo; That is what the argument amounts to.  The Taoiseach says that the word &ldquo;treason&rdquo; is defined in the Constitution, and then makes a virtue of the fact that we do not define it.  His attitude is we will leave it to the judges to know what we mean both in this measure and in the Constitution.  The whole thing is absurd.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an aspect of this Bill on which I would like to have some information from the Taoiseach. I am wondering whether the phraseology used has any special meaning.  We find that in sub-section (1) of Section 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Every person who commits treason within the State shall be liable on conviction thereof to suffer death.</P>
      <P>And this is how sub-section (2) of the same section is phrased:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Every person who, being an Irish citizen or ordinarily resident within the State, commits treason outside the State shall be liable on conviction thereof to suffer death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1522" /> The English language is, surely, not so restricted that it is impossible to combine these two types of offences &ldquo;within&rdquo; and &ldquo;without&rdquo; in the one section.  Would the Taoiseach tell us what the phrase &ldquo;commits treason outside the State&rdquo; means in the case of an Irish citizen, or a person not being an Irish citizen ordinarily resident within the State?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if there is any use replying time after time.  I pointed out before that you had the same thing in the 1925 Act. The obvious meaning is that a person can commit one of these offences of treason outside the State, whether he is an Irish citizen who does it, or a person who is ordinarily resident here and is outside the State when he is doing one of the things set down as treason in the Constitution.</P>

      <P>At the risk of annoying the Taoiseach, I want to try to get some enlightenment from him as to where exactly this carries us.  On the last occasion that we discussed this I said that the King seemed to be, if not actually an organ of government, at least to be closely related to the organs of government, and that, in fact, he was as much as organ of government as the Revenue Commissioners or any other body functioning as part of the machinery of government. The Taoiseach denied on that occasion that the King was an organ of government established by the Constitution, but the fact remains that in 1936 a Bill was very definitely passed here&mdash;in my view, as I then said, I think it was passed with indecent haste&mdash;constituting the present King as King for the purposes for which the previous person was King.  We were told then that the King, in his new capacity, was an organ of our external relations; that we have, in our external relations, to appoint Ministers to different States, and that we receive credentials from Ministers appointed by those States to represent their countries here.  We have passports issued to Irish citizens entitling them to travel in various States with which we are not at war, and protection is afforded to our citizens&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to show that this gentleman, the King, in fact functions as an organ of government in our external relations.  What I want to ascertain from the Taoiseach, seeing that we are passing a Treason Bill, is whether, in fact, the King functions in that capacity: as an organ of government in the <i>de facto</i> sense, or as an organ of government established by the Constitution, and really exists to the extent that an Irish citizen who is engaged in a war on behalf of another power levying war against that King, not perhaps in his function as King here, but in his function as King of some portion of the Commonwealth, is capable of being indicted and charged with treason.  In other words, to put it more succinctly: is it an offence against the King, and, to the extent and in so far as we use it, treason within whatever definition of treason exists in this Bill?  I want to make sure that it is not possible for any of our people to be charged with treason for an offence against the King, whether it consists in levying war against him in his capacity of King of some country in the British Commonwealth, or whether it consists, according to the ancient British legal decisions, in refusing &ldquo;to remain constant with his eldest daughter.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I beg to move amendment No. 3, standing in the name of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 47, after the words &ldquo;so engaged&rdquo; to insert the words following: &ldquo;or that he was constrained so to do by a reasonable apprehension of death or of serious bodily violence to himself or some other person residing with him or of grave destruction of his property.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment needs no explanation; it is clear.  It really only means that the person shall not be punished if, in addition to the reason for non-punishment given in the section, &ldquo;he was constrained so to do by a reasonable apprehension of death or of serious bodily violence to himself or some other person residing with him or of grave destruction of his property.&rdquo; It is a question as to whether the Government will accept that or not.</P>

      <P>We think that the first part of this amendment is unnecessary because, I understand, in law it would be regarded as a good defence that a person's life was in danger or that he was in grievous bodily danger.  The rest of the amendment is wider.  It is questionable whether we should attempt to bring in the principle that possible danger to one's property or to somebody who might be living in the house should be regarded as a good defence.  Taking it on the whole, we do not see any reason why the existing position should be changed in regard to that matter.  We think that any defence of that sort would naturally be taken into account when all the circumstances of the particular case would be before the court deciding the matter, but we do not think that we would be justified in introducing a new principle such as would be involved in this question of danger to property or to any person living in the house.  We do not intend to accept the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to argue the matter or to express surprise <Col N="1528" /> at the Government's attitude. The Taoiseach believes that the courts would take these circumstances into account, as the law stands, but far be it from him to see that the courts will take them into account! &ldquo;They may or they may not; we give this up.&rdquo; Am I seriously to be told that when the House puts in an exception here, namely, that the accused person did not know or had no reason to believe that the person whom he harboured was engaged in committing treason, that other exceptions, though not mentioned, will also be considered by the courts?  Still, it is necessary to put in lack of knowledge.  I take it for granted that the Government is convinced that it is necessary to put in lack of knowledge as a ground of being acquitted.  It is necessary to do that, but the Taoiseach would not think it necessary to put in a threat to the person as an excuse.  Unfortunately, we are laymen in this House.  Unfortunately, it is the duty of laymen in this House to pass legislation.  I hold it is all the more necessary then to state explicitly the exceptions in this section. There is neither rhyme nor reason in the attitude taken up by the Government.  A threat to the person is dealt with by the ordinary law, we are told, but if there is a threat to his wife or children it is not wise to have that dealt with here.  They are classed as property according to the new Constitution we are implementing.  It would be unwise to do it, we are told.  First of all, I cannot understand the Taoiseach's interpretation of the ordinary law in view of the provisions of the Bill.  Secondly, I cannot dismiss the wife and family of the person in question as airily as the Taoiseach has done.  &ldquo;It is not worth while making provision for them&rdquo;&mdash;that is clearly what he says.  As regards the individual himself, that is an offence against the ordinary law.  Ignorance is not, but fear is.  A very interesting interpretation, if it will stand.  It is not our business to make the Judiciary clear as to what we mean! That is the attitude taken up here.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the remarks made by Deputy O'Sullivan, <Col N="1529" /> I take it that the case the Prime Minister has made against this amendment is that the ordinary law of duress would furnish the excuse that is stated specifically in this amendment.  Speaking generally, so far as I understand the Prime Minister's point, it was that no offence would be committed because there had been duress.  I should like to point out in that connection that we are here creating a statutory offence of a type somewhat different from anything that existed before, and even though the point made by the Prime Minister might have some substance in it, it will certainly not take away from the force of this section if this amendment be accepted.  I rather think that it will weaken the defence of duress, if such a defence is put up, that it is not mentioned in the Bill as an excuse, particularly having regard to the fact that there is one specific excuse mentioned in the section, and it can be argued that because one excuse is mentioned, another excuse left out, therefore it was not intended that the excuse left out should be taken into consideration at all.  There is a well-known Latin maxim dealing with that, with which I need not worry the House. That is a serious objection to the Prime Minister's point, but I think it should be taken into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given serious consideration to that already.  In my statements I distinguished between the two parts of the amendment.  One part was covered by the ordinary principle of duress and I said that the other was too wide.  There is, of course, the point made that when you mention one exception specifically, you are excluding others.  I was going to use that as a reason for not putting in other exceptions.  Here the particular exception mentioned is of such an obvious character, that it simply makes the person not guilty at all.  It is not a question of knowing a thing and then weighing up one set of consequences against another.  The amendment puts the individual concerned in a position in which he would have to weigh up the consequences of engaging in a treasonable practice which might result in death and against the <Col N="1530" /> danger of immediate bodily harm.  In the other case, I think everybody will admit that the exception mentioned is one which would make a person absolutely not guilty because, when the thing was happening, he was not aware of it but you put upon him the responsibility of satisfying the court that he was not aware of it.  With regard to &ldquo;grievous bodily harm,&rdquo; the proposal seems to be too wide.  The reference to a person in the house might include more than a member of one's family&mdash;wife, mother or child.  As regards the question of property, one has to consider where to draw the line. Would these things not be properly regarded in a particular case as being a justification?  It seems to me that, in so far as the act was not a completely free one but one which was forced, that would be taken into account in a particular case.  It is better to have the particular set of circumstances considered in that way than to limit the matter here.  It seems to me that our limitations will either go too far or not go far enough. Having considered the matter, our view is in favour of leaving the thing as it is.</P>

      <P>I should like the Taoiseach to let us know whether any consideration was given, in the drafting of this Bill, to the position of a wife <i>vis-á-vis</i> her husband in respect of sedition.  Under the 1925 Act it was provided that&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;every person who commits any of the following acts, that is to say... (c) conspires with any person other than his or her wife or husband....&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, you pass on to Section 8, where there is a similar exemption.  In this Bill, it appears that a wife can be charged with treason and, probably, with the offence of comforting her husband and sentenced up to a term of imprisonment for 20 years although, under the 1925 Act, there was an exemption in her favour.  There has been a fairly well accepted position that the wife under such circumstances acts under duress.  It seems to me that she cannot plead duress under <Col N="1531" /> this Bill.  I should like to know what induced the Taoiseach to omit that provision of the 1925 Act, seeing that he copied it so faithfully in other respects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

If that can happen, I think it is a piece of savagery.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In practice, I think there would be no difficulty in a matter of that sort.  I am informed that husband and wife cannot conspire together in the ordinary, legal sense. Having heard the views expressed and having discussed the matter with our legal advisers, I have come to the conclusion that there is no need to make a change, that the provision in the Bill as it stands is reasonable and that the courts will deal with it in a reasonable way.  If we take up the attitude that the courts are going to be unreasonable and that we have to constrain them to act reasonably, the task will be impossible.  In a case of this kind, you have to define the crime and the punishment and, in the individual set of circumstances, the courts will have to determine whether a person is guilty or not guilty.  If you commence to make exceptions, you will have a very long list.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous Government was probably advised by law officers of the same standing as the law officers of the present Government that an exception of that kind was necessary, because it was embodied in the <Col N="1532" /> 1925 Act.  Now, we copy the 1925 Act so far as punishment is concerned and we do the same thing in the Offences Against the State Bill, but we are leaving out this provision which acts as a safeguard for the wife.  A wife would not be human if, in such circumstances as those, she did not extend some measure of comfort to her husband.  Is it proposed to institute a prosecution against a wife in such circumstances and have her sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only in the Deputy's imagination that could happen.  Husband and wife are regarded as a unit, apparently, even from the legal point of view.  Having examined the matter, we came to the conclusion that it was completely unnecessary to provide this exemption in the 1925 Act, that it would be quite as good if it had been omitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot agree with the Prime Minister in that statement of the law.  It is only for a very limited number of topics that a husband and wife are, under the existing law, regarded as a unit, to use the Prime Minister's expression. It must be remembered that this Bill is going to create a new offence.  We are not dealing with what I might describe as the common law offence of treason or harbouring persons who committed treason.  In such cases, definite principles apply and we know precisely where we are.  Here, we are creating a new statutory offence of harbouring&mdash;a new kind of treason.  I think the Prime Minister should fully appreciate what is being done in this Bill.  In the Constitution, treason is defined specifically as consisting only of certain acts.  In this country, treason no longer consists of anything in any statute or in the common law as adopted by the previous Constitution or this Constitution and none of the former principles applies to it.  Therefore, in case there ever is a prosecution for treason, it will be confined strictly to the four corners of this Bill when it becomes an Act.  You cannot go outside it.  Therefore, taking this newly created statutory offence, under Section 2, I think it is unarguable <Col N="1533" /> that that would cover the case put by Deputy Norton.  A wife can be prosecuted for harbouring her husband.  I think there cannot be any doubt whatever that the wife or husband respectively can be convicted of &ldquo;harbouring&rdquo; under that section, because this entirely new offence is created.  It is no defence to say a husband cannot conspire with his wife, or that a wife cannot conspire with her husband. This is not conspiracy.  If there was a charge put in of conspiring to commit the offence created by Section 2, then there could not be a charge against a wife for harbouring her husband, but I think on the newly created offence under the section there could be a charge against the wife for harbouring her husband.</P>
      <P>The Prime Minister spoke about taking into account the fact that the courts will act reasonably.  I think the Prime Minister should appreciate that, when a court of law has to consider a statute, the question of the reasonableness or unreasonableness of the interpretation does not enter into the matter. The ordinary plain grammatical meaning of the section is what is taken first of all.  If that is clear, then that is the construction, and it is no part of any judge's duty in defining what a section of an Act of Parliament means to say whether it is reasonable or unreasonable, because then he would be trenching upon a domain which is not his domain&mdash;the domain of policy. The courts have laid down this principle, that they will take a statute to mean what it says if it is plain in its ordinary grammatical meaning, irrespective of the consequences that may accrue from giving it that plain meaning, and even though it may be in the teeth of what the legislature intended. The Prime Minister should not, therefore, approach this topic by considering whether or not the courts are going to be reasonable or unreasonable.  They are going to act in accordance with well-settled and well-known canons of construction.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy, a lawyer, stands up and makes a case here, as a lay-man I am not able to go into the details and say that what he is putting forward is definitely wrong.  All <Col N="1534" /> I can say to the House in a case like that is that I will have the contention examined.  If, on examination by our legal advisers of the point which has been made, there is even a doubt in the matter&mdash;unless I am met with certainty of the opposite&mdash;I will see whether the point can be met.  It is possible that in this case a distinction may be made.  I do not agree with the Deputy on the question as to whether we are creating a completely new statutory offence.  These are offences which are not unknown&mdash;as far as I know, anyhow&mdash;to the ordinary law.</P>

      <P>No.  The two Deputies now sitting side by side can have a nice little chat.  I leave it to Deputy Costello to convince Deputy O'Sullivan, because I have been arguing all the morning exactly as Deputy Costello has been arguing about the position we are in, but I am arguing that those offences are not quite unknown; that we are not creating, as it were, a completely new thing.  We are based on the Constitution; that is the root of what we are doing, but I do not think that the offences which are contemplated and spoken of here are quite unknown.  Although you cannot deal with them as if there were tested cases, and accepted decisions, there is no doubt that consideration of such cases will be of value.  However, what I have to say at this stage is that I am not accepting this amendment in its present form.  With regard to the point raised by Deputy Norton, I will have that matter examined.  It has been supported by Deputy Costello.  I will have the matter examined, and, on the next stage, we will see what the position will be.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach bear in mind that, even when the exception was made in the 1925 Act, it was made notwithstanding the fact that the language used in the section was &ldquo;conspires with any other person.&rdquo; In both cases where the exemption is provided for the wife or the husband, the word &ldquo;conspiracy&rdquo; is used in describing the offence.  In this particular case <Col N="1535" /> there is no question of conspiracy involved at all; it is &ldquo;encourages, harbours or comforts.&rdquo; Even if it were not necessary in the case of conspiracy to provide for exemption, it must be remembered that there is no conspiracy here.</P>

I have just asked him about it, and I wish to correct the Prime Minister on that point.  Apparently the Prime <Col N="1536" /> Minister is again at his old failing, if I may respectfully put it that way, that whatever he thinks this Constitution means the courts will also think. I approach this with a completely unbiased mind.  I am looking at it strictly as a lawyer, and I have no doubt that something new has been created by this Constitution, and something new is going to be created by this Bill under Section 2.  The fact that similar offences are not unknown to us is of no relevance whatever in considering the content of the new offence which has been created.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>No medical practitioner or hospital nurse or any person connected with any hospital for the cure of the sick shall be convicted under the provisions of sub-section (1) of this section solely because of comfort or relief given to a sick person engaged in committing any offence to which section 1 of this Act applies.</P>
      <P>It is extremely difficult to think that this amendment would not be accepted.  It is in connection with Section 2, and seeks to make provision to safeguard certain people who, on humanitarian grounds, will be brought into touch, with those who may be guilty of treasonable practices of various kinds, destructive or otherwise. It would be exceedingly wrong if we did not make the exception it is proposed to make by the amendment. We know perfectly well that at a very critical period in our history the attitude actually taken up by the medical profession, whatever their political opinions were, was a refusal to give away those that came to them for medical help.  I put forward the amendment on the grounds of general public policy, and no&mdash;I was going to call it &ldquo;frivolous&rdquo;&mdash;Bill of this kind should interfere with what is a much more valuable principle of public policy, namely, the trust that ought to prevail between the medical profession and their patients.  I find it almost an insult to argue the acceptance of this amendment and I do not want to be told that it is too wide.  If it is, it is the business of the Government to make the necessary changes.  They have draftsmen at their disposal that we have not.  To suggest that amendments can be rejected because they are too wide is no argument whatsoever against the acceptance of the principle of the amendment and the proper drafting of the amendment if the principle is accepted.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I will have to disappoint the Deputy.  It is true, of course, that the mere statement that something is too wide is not an excuse, if there is something that can be met, for not attempting to meet it, but when you approach matters of this kind, as the legal department have approached it, from the point of view that it is desired to get something which would be satisfactory, we are up against the position that it is not feasible to do it.  The Deputy has again illustrated how difficult it is to do anything of this sort by confining it.  There are other obvious things that you should include too.  Take the case of a elergyman who might be attending to a person who is engaged in these activities.  The practical difficulty is to get the Bill drafted so as to include all the cases that ought to be included because, again, if you do not, if you proceed to enumerate some, the supposition will be that you have enumerated all that you wish to make exceptions of, Faced with the practical difficulty of doing that effectively, our advisers have come to the conclusion that it is again better to leave the Bill in its present form and that in a particular case, where the circumstances will be properly appreciated and known, we will have to allow considerations to operate which in the past have operated in cases of that kind.  They may not be regarded as absolutely good, legal defences, but they will, in fact, be regarded as mitigating or exonerating, as the case may be, a person charged, if the circumstances <Col N="1539" /> are of the type which the Deputy intends to cover.  There is the practical difficulty of envisaging ahead all the possible sets of circumstances that you should safeguard against.  If you make a list, and the list is not complete, it will have the effect, possibly, of ruling out a case which the legislators would have wished to be considered if they had foreseen its possibility.  That is the principle upon which we have been dealing with practically all these amendments.</P>
      <P>I do not want to pretend that, if it could be done, there is not a good deal to be said for the point of view taken by the Opposition, that is, that we ought not leave any of these things to chance.  But, in fact, all legislation is of that kind.  There are certain extenuating circumstances which are taken into account, and will be taken into account, and I think that in this case we are safer in leaving the Bill as it stands, from the point of view of having due consideration paid to circumstances of the kind envisaged here or suggested here, not so much these that are mentioned here as other ones that would require to be mentioned. There is the obvious one, which I have suggested, but which did not occur to the person who drafted this amendment. It is nearly impossible to envisage all the possible cases that could arise.  There would be undue hardship created if it were suggested that because you have not enumerated a particular set of circumstances which ought to be taken into account, you meant to rule them out.  You would be loading the dice against the proper consideration of that case.</P>

      <P>May I point out, after the attitude taken up by the Taoiseach on the amendment we have just disposed of, it does require a certain amount of aplomb&mdash;I am afraid the word &ldquo;neck&rdquo; would not do&mdash;to come in and argue that because you mention certain exceptions, it rules out others.  On one amendment the Taoiseach mentioned a certain exception that did not rule out the others, now he comes down and argues the very opposite.  I am not surprised.  I do not <Col N="1540" /> pretend to be.  But I am surprised that there is any difficulty about accepting this amendment.  If he has a difficulty, if he thinks the case of the priest is lawful, certainly put it in.  We would only be delighted, but I must object to the suggestion that this House is bound to accept the views of the legal advisers.  The Taoiseach says, &ldquo;I have been advised that it is better to leave the Bill as it is.&rdquo; I think we have heard enough of that.  I have not heard that the legal advisers are the legislators here and I have protested against it already.  If the Taoiseach has any reason to defend the Bill let him defend it on the merits and not go behind the legal advisers.  If he wants to legislate so that judges can interpret it, put something before them that they can interpret to show that our meaning is clear.  I think it is our business to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am rather surprised, after all we have heard about the humanitarian views of our Constitution, that it is beyond the power of the draftsmen to make a humanitarian provision of that kind that does not involve all sorts of consequences that they cannot even guard against.  I find it extremely difficult to believe that the draftsmen have not that competence if it is put up to them seriously to provide for this humanitarian provision.  If you think it will carry you beyond it, provide against that contingency and provide against the inclusion of one thing ruling out others.  Why cannot that be done?  I think it is our business to consider legislation on its merits and not to be told continuously that our legal advisers think so and so; that it is better&mdash;that is the phrase used&mdash;to leave the Bill as it is.  It is our business to consider whether it is better to leave the Bill as it is or not. I must object to the idea that all we can hope for is that if a case of this kind is brought before a court the court will kick us out.  That is not the way to legislate&mdash;to hope that the judges will behave that way if a case is brought before them.  It is quite conceivable that a case might be brought before them, and it is a most unreasonable attitude to take up that the confidence that ought to prevail <Col N="1541" /> between certain people and those with whom they come into contact should not be respected and legislated for.</P>
    <P>This is the ordinary law, applied from day to day, when there are no disturbances in the country.  I presume that is the idea.  It is not a portion of the exceptional legislation. I notice that my reference to the possibility of its being pulled into the machinery of the exceptional legislation was never dealt with.  I am not dealing with it now, as I have already dealt with it, but I am pointing out that it was not answered.  Here is a piece of the ordinary legislation in peace times, and yet the Government cannot find any means of making a humanitarian provision of this kind. Once more, I let the amendment stand as it is.</P>
    <P>No medical practitioner or hospital nurse or any person connected with any hospital for the cure of the sick shall be convicted under the provisions of sub-section (1) of this section solely because of comfort or relief given to a sick person engaged in committing any offence to which Section 1 of this Act applies.</P>
    <P>You can put in &ldquo;priest&rdquo; if you like. The Taoiseach cannot do it.  It would trouble the draftsmen too much.  It is beyond their capacity.  Why should we trouble the Department of Justice to meet the demands of the Legislature in that respect&mdash;much better it is that the Legislature should take the view that it is better to leave it as it is.  That is legislation under the new Constitution! Surely if ever there was a case to be met it is this.  It is extremely difficult to understand the attitude taken up now.  What is your hope?  That if you apply this law as it stands, and bring an action against a medical practitioner, the law being against the medical practitioner, the judge will say: &ldquo;Clear out.  You should be ashamed of yourselves.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>In sub-section (3) of Section 1 it is provided:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whenever a person charged with treason is indicted therefor before the Central Criminal Court, he shall <Col N="1542" /> be so indicted in the same manner in all respects as a person charged with murder is required by law to be indicted.</P>
    <P>A person who has been indicted on a charge of treason must be indicted as if he were being indicted on a charge of murder, but when we come to deal with Section 2, we do not extend to the person liable to be charged with treason the same consideration as we would extend to-day or to-morrow to a person, not merely charged with murder, but found guilty of murder. Suppose, for instance, the court this morning sentenced a man to be hanged and the execution were to take place a month hence.  If that man in the meantime became ill, he would get medical attention in prison and every effort would be made to save his life in order that he should be duly and properly hanged a month hence.  Under the section, however, what do we do? We say that if anybody dares to comfort a person, knowing that that person has been engaged in committing treason, he may be found guilty of felony and may be sentenced to a term of penal servitude not exceeding 20 years; so that if a person engaged in the commission of treason sends for a doctor or priest it will be an offence for the doctor or the priest to attend him, and if they want to avoid being arraigned and having to give an excuse of the kind suggested by the legal advisers of the Taoiseach, what they ought to do is to leave the person to die as quickly as possible.  If he dies, it will ensure that they will not have to go before the court and take a chance on the kind of advice the legal advisers of the Taoiseach give him.</P>
    <P>I do not think you can make a case for that type of legislation at all.  The doctor who is not concerned at all with the offence of treason, who probably bitterly deplores the fact that an attempt was made to commit treason, and the priest, who is probably utterly opposed, morally, politically and ethically, to the commission of the offence, are liable to be charged with extending comfort to what may be a dying man, or a man who is very ill and in danger <Col N="1543" /> of losing his life.  There is no justification in the world for charging people in those circumstances, and no matter what the legal advisers say, no matter what apparent anomalies appear to exist in the section, it is surely not beyond the wit of the legal advisers, in whom the Taoiseach has such confidence, to make sure that, in these circumstances at least, these people will not be charged with an offence. Let us try to cover all the normal exceptions, but if they cannot be covered because of drafting difficulties, let us keep out as many as we can from the possibility of prosecution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I should make clear at this stage that when I refer to the advice given by the legal advisers I do so when somebody puts up a particular interpretation of law or tells me what legal practice is.  We had an example here this evening.  If Deputy O'Sullivan reads what he has said and what Deputy Costello said after him he will see that the views I gave expression to in regard to several matters were the views which Deputy Costello, as a lawyer, holds. Deputy O'Sullivan's position, as it would be mine and the position of any other lay member here, is that commonsense and reason ought to prevail in regard to anything put before us; but if there is a question of legal practice and of what experience we are going to depend on, am I to depend on the experience of Deputy O'Sullivan from the legal point of view, unless his view is able to stand on a basis of reason, independent of experience, or am I to depend on the experience of people who have no reason whatever to give me any advice which they do not think is absolutely right and correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When matters are referred to the draftsmen or to the legal department it is on questions of law and not questions of policy.  When suggestions for amendment are put up here I have to be satisfied, having heard the reasons put forward here by my legal advisers, before I accept their opinion, that the basis of the argument in favour of amendment is not sound.  The Deputy <Col N="1544" /> is altogether wrong in thinking that I want simply to put the views of the advisers before the views he or anybody here may express.  We are ultimately to be the masters of what becomes the law and we are bound to take that into account; but when there is a question of legal practice or the interpretation of law I think he will admit that I have the right and the duty to accept the advice of my advisers rather than opinions that may be expressed, sometimes after a very inadequate examination of the point.  Take all that matter read from Archbold the last day.  The people who advise me have read that, too, and they do not think that the arguments put forward by Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney are sound.  I have to weigh the two and to ask myself which is it to be.  When we have heard the arguments on both sides, if there is a difference of opinion, I am ordinarily, anyhow, going to take the view expressed by absolutely disinterested legal advisers.  I have found arguments put forward from the Opposition Benches on legal matters quite wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to this amendment, I want to have any points that have been put forward examined with the fullest possible care.  There will be offences which people will commit, knowingly, technical offences, which they will commit knowingly&mdash; probably technical legal offences&mdash;because of some other higher motive.  For instance, an example was given to me in talking this matter over.  Supposing I have not a licence for my motor car, and suppose a man was injured on the road just outside my garage and that I had to choose as to whether or not I should take out my car and bring that man to hospital and thus break the law technically, I would certainly make that technical breach in the law and take out the car even though it was not licensed, and hope that I was not going to have any accidents on the road; but whether I had accidents on <Col N="1545" /> the road or not, and even though I was guilty of a technical offence, I would take that person to hospital in my car.</P>
      <P>We will have cases in the future, as we have had in the past, where people will put higher considerations above a technical breach of the law, and will put these considerations in the forefront and act in accordance with them.  That is the commonsense on which we are depending in this particular case rather than on a particular attempt, which may be really a very ineffective attempt, to meet cases of this particular kind.  The point is that there are certain higher considerations which will operate in matters of this kind in which any technical offences that may be committed will be set aside in consideration, so to speak, of the higher dictates of humanity.</P>
      <P>I would have that matter examined again from that point of view if that would satisfy the Deputy&mdash;not with a view to turning down the Deputy's amendment but with a view to seeing if amendments of that sort can really be effectively put into a Bill, and that is what we have always done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there should be any difficulty in accepting the amendment.  As this Bill stands, it will be an offence to harbour or succour or give treatment to any person guilty of these offences. Now, the Taoiseach has pointed out that if a person were injured at his garage door and it was a question of whether or not he was going to take out his car and do the good work of bringing that man to hospital and be guilty of the technical offence of driving without a licence, he would have no hesitation in driving his car in the circumstances.  I admit that is so, but is everybody of that mind?  I had the experience of driving a wounded Volunteer to Dublin in 1920 and, because there was an order that in the case of every wounded person brought in to hospital here the hospital people had to notify the military authorities, the first hospital I came to said: &ldquo;We are law-abiding people and we cannot break the law; if you bring the man in here we must notify the authorities.&rdquo; The second hospital said: <Col N="1546" />&ldquo;We are taking him in and we will take the risk.&rdquo; Still, because the law was there, and because it was a technical offence, certain people were not prepared to take the risk of committing that technical offence&mdash;perhaps, through a sense of loyalty.</P>
      <P>I presume that one of the reasons that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney did not include clergymen in the amendment is that this is a Catholic country and that there is a hope that the Government of this country will be always more or less in that direction anyhow, and that no Government or no Attorney-General or no law officer of this State would dream of prosecuting the priest or the other clergyman who might attend a wounded or sick person.  Every day in the courts, however, we have judges and justices giving decisions in which they say: &ldquo;I am here to interpret the law as I find it; that is what your Legislature passed and that is what I have to give effect to.&rdquo; Therefore, you are going to put a person to the whole trouble of a defence and of getting up and saying: &ldquo;Well, I did it because I thought this was a higher ground or a higher consideration than that.&rdquo; I think there should not be any question at all of doubt in the Taoiseach's mind in accepting the amendment and including clergymen if there is a danger of the creed of this Government ever changing so that they would not have Christianity&mdash;and, mind you, we are travelling so far that there is even a doubt of that at times.  Therefore, I feel that in a case like this, where we are passing a Bill that is to be the ordinary law and the perpetual law of the State, we should take every care that no person who has done a good work through a charitably-disposed mind should be made to suffer any hardship or inconvenience because of it.  I submit that the amendment should be accepted in principle and that the draftsmen should extend it to cover clergymen of any denomination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, what I shall do is to have this matter re-examined. I told the House what the advice and consideration have led to up to the present.  Nobody is against the principle, but it is a question of whether what would be regarded as a technical <Col N="1547" /> offence would be set aside on grounds of humanity in certain cases.  I understand clearly what the Opposition are trying to get at and I shall see whether in fact it can be done, but if, on examination, it is found that any attempts that are being made to get it would be quite unsatisfactory, I take it that it must be up to the Opposition themselves to provide what would be satisfactory.  What I say is that, if we have done our best and if we are satisfied that the best we can do in the matter is quite unsatisfactory and that it would be better to leave the thing as it is, then, when we have admitted that and have done our best, if the Opposition is not satisfied, they must use their own brains and try to do it, because we will have exhausted, as far as I take it, our possibilities of doing it.  That has also been the way with regard to some of these amendments that have come along here.  We have examined them, and examined them, notwithstanding the Deputy's doubt on the matter, with an open mind and a desire, if anything, to safeguard any of these principles which have been referred to, but when we come down in practice to do it we find that we are running graver risks, that the exceptions we want to have considered would not get the same consideration as they would get in the case of a trial, if there were no amendment such as has been suggested. If that is satisfactory, I will try again in the light of the general principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us be quite clear about this, Sir.  I gather that the Taoiseach accepts the principle of the amendment, but refrains from promising to do anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good, then; I am not satisfied, I have had too much experience of the Taoiseach's considerations with an open mind&mdash; absolutely too much experience.  I have not the slightest doubt that what will happen will be that it will be found impossible, as the Taoiseach has <Col N="1548" /> already argued.  Now, let me be quite clear.  I gave no interpretation of the law in proposing this amendment, and the first thing that was flung at me was the Department of Justice, or rather, not the Department of Justice &mdash;I must apologise to the Minister for Justice&mdash;but the legal advisers.  The legal advisers were flung at me like a sledge-hammer.  I did not give any interpretation of the law, either as a layman, a lawyer, or anything else, but the first thing that is flung at me is that the legal advisers will not allow me.  Now, I am not prepared to accept that.  If the Taoiseach says that he will accept the principle and introduce an amendment to give effect to that principle, if he is not satisfied with the present drafting of the amendment, I am prepared to let the matter go and let the officials go on with the drafting until the next stages of the Bill. Otherwise, I would feel compelled to divide on that because I am not prepared to ask a man to commit an offence on the plea that he may get off before the court.  That is not proper. If we do not think it is an offence, we should try to prevent that happening. We have no right to put that conflict of conscience up to any man, whether he is to obey the law or push aside the law in obedience to what the Taoiseach calls the higher morality&mdash;a very dangerous thing.  Within the last two or three years I have seen the higher morality appealed to to trample on every fundamental law of civilisation. I do not want to put any person in the difficulty of being told, &ldquo;You will have to commit an offence and break the law; let us hope that the judge will let you off.&rdquo; That is not proper legislation and I object to wait on that particular ground.  It is not enough for a person to be told that the judge may take a lenient view.  The fact is that the man has committed an offence, according to our law, in that case or in the case of a priest.  That ought not to be legislated, and I am sorry that I must press it to a division, unless the Taoiseach meets us so far as to accept the principle and to promise an amendment giving effect to the principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that the Deputy is pressing it.  I cannot do <Col N="1549" /> what he wishes.  I have told the Deputy&mdash;the Deputy does not believe it, or he will not understand&mdash;why I could not give a promise.  I told the House definitely why we have to approach the Bill from that point of view and why an amendment is open to the danger of introducing greater difficulties.  The Deputy said, &ldquo;Do not create an offence.&rdquo; Suppose you were to put into the law for motor cars that a person must not drive a motor car without a licence unless there is somebody ill on the road and he has to take that person to hospital. If anybody proposes a law like that, is it not obvious that you will jump to the conclusion that there may be a number of cases in which persons might feel justified in using a motor car without a licence?  That exactly illustrates the difficulty in which we are in this case.</P>
      <P>We admit straight off that there are cases of the kind in which a technical offence might be condoned, and would be condoned by a court.  But if we start condoning them in advance there are all sorts of difficulties.  First of all, there will be suggestions to people to commit offences in particular ways so as to escape punishment.  It would be very handy in the case of a motor car. There will be some suggestion perhaps to make up a case that the person in the car was ill, because carrying a sick man to hospital was something which would be an excuse.  I do not want to enter into all the possibilities in a case like this, because they are infinite and there would be no use in attempting it.  This is a practical difficulty which we are up against, which anybody trying to legislate in a matter of this kind is up against.  There is no use saying, &ldquo;Accept the principle and promise to bring in an amendment.&rdquo; If we could do that we would do it.  All I can say is that, if the Deputy wishes, we will have a further examination to see if the difficulty can be solved.  If it can, an amendment will be brought in.  If not, we will have to leave it as it is. If the Deputy is not prepared to take that, we will only have to leave it as it is.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach told us, in justification of his endeavour to resist the amendment, that when discussing the Bill with some other parties he had been told of the difficulty of a man with an unlicensed motor car who has been asked to take an injured person to hospital.  When that case is exploited to its fullest extent and the worst possible complexion is put on it, in the public mind it is a case of using a motor car for the purpose of taking an injured person to hospital.  We all live in this country and know what is happening here.  We all have our roots in the country and can understand what is happening every day.  We know that, in fact, quite a considerable number of motor cars are to-day used on exceptional occasions for taking folk who are not injured at all from place to place.  I am not too sure that it is not one of the things we nationally pride ourselves upon.  In any case, we do it for a good national, athletic purpose. That is all the offence is. Here in this case, if a person responds to that appeal to the higher humanitarian instincts, he will not be charged with using a motor car without a licence, the punishment for which is trifling; he is going to be charged with treason felony, and he is going to be told that, on conviction, he is liable to penal servitude for a term not exceeding 20 years or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or to a fine of £500 or both such fine and such penal servitude or imprisonment.  On the top of that, he has the odium of harbouring, encouraging, or comforting a person charged with treason.  A man in the position of a doctor or a priest will not lightly put himself into a position where he may be charged with treason felony and be liable to a fine or imprisonment <Col N="1551" /> of the dimensions indicated in the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is any comparison at all between the cases that the Taoiseach quoted.  I think the reason given by him is not a valid reason for resisting an amendment of this kind.  My complaint is that the amendment is not sufficiently comprehensive. Other people could, in fact, be legitimately included in the amendment in such a manner as to protect them from the possibility of being charged with comforting a person engaged in the act of committing treason or having recently committed treason.  There is no reason why the Taoiseach should not indicate that he accepts the principle of the amendment, which is perfectly clear, and it <Col N="1552" /> should not be impossible to provide for this definite exception, and also to provide for an exception of the kind indicated in Section 2.</P>

      <P>On the section, in connection with sub-section (1), the Taoiseach mentioned what he considered to be an interesting and illuminating parallel in the case of a motor car, as one reason for not changing this section.  I want to say that if Deputies will look at newspapers to-day&mdash;and I hope that will not be said to be 300 years old&mdash;they will find a case before the courts in which a young man was charged and convicted because, having been debarred from driving a car, that young man, in order to comfort his brother who was very ill, used a motor car to bring that brother holy water.  The Taoiseach said that judges would be reasonable in these cases.  It is rather a coincidence that the report of that case should be on the very same day that the Taoiseach spoke about judges being reasonable about these things.

      <P>If the Minister will pardon me, I happened to be here for the first reading of this Bill and I thought that the whole excuse for it was due to the necessity for repealing the other Bill and putting this one in its place.  When I am now asked to assent to the passing of this Bill, after the repeal of the other Bill I am in a bit of a quandary.  On the First Stage it was said &ldquo;we have passed a new Constitution; the Act of 1925 is out of date, and we will have to put something in its place and we are doing that.&rdquo; But, so far as this Bill is concerned, the Act of 1925 still stands.

The Minister will tell us that in Section 30 of the Offences Against the State Bill provision is made for the repeal of the Treasonable Offences Act of 1925, but unless these two Acts are law on the same day, there is going to be a period when, in fact, we are going to have this Treason Act and the Treasonable Offences Act of 1925 in operation at the one time.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>During the previous discussions on this Bill the Taoiseach, the Minister for Defence and other spokesmen from the Government benches hurled a number of unfounded allegations across the floor of the House at the Labour Party, and alleged that the members of the Labour Party were opposing the passage of this Bill because they were supposed to be in sympathy with outside organisations of a military character that had decided to overthrow this Government.  Now, such allegations have no foundation whatever.  The Taoiseach, in referring to that matter, said that.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;the Labour Party ought to consider the wider aspect of it&rdquo;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the Offences Against the State Bill&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;and, as members of this House, they ought to try to support its authority.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Minister for Defence unfortunately went much further.  I do not know whether he used these words quite deliberately, or had evidence that words had been used by some member of this Party to justify his allegation, when he said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;From certain phrases used by the Labour Party here, it will be taken that they favour a certain armed organisation continuing.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I would invite the Minister for Defence, if he speaks again, to endeavour to justify that allegation by evidence at his disposal, or by words used at any time by any member of the Labour Party in this House. Further on, the same Minister proceeded to deal with the Labour Party and to ventilate his views concerning their attitude.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I hope the Labour Party, as they are concerned or should be particularly <Col N="1557" /> concerned with the people who are the worst off in the country, the people who are in greatest need of assistance, will not, by anything they say throughout the country, create a situation that would help to fritter away our national energy.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is it to be understood from that further statement of the Minister that, from information at his disposal, it is the intention of the Labour Party to go outside this House and encourage some armed body of citizens to proceed to overthrow the authority of this Government?  I say that no Labour Deputy who ever sat in these benches suggested anything of the kind, inside or outside the House.</P>
    <P>When I came into this House in 1922 to the Constituent Assembly with a number of colleagues, we came on the instructions of the governing body of the Labour Party to give effect to the majority decision of Dáil Eireann at the time and help to the best of our ability to frame a Constitution in accordance with the decision of Dáil Eireann in connection with international negotiations.  We came into this House in spite of threats of assassination, dictated probably and directed to us by some of the people who are now making these allegations against us.  I say the allegations contained in the words of the Minister for Defence should be withdrawn if the Minister cannot produce evidence to substantiate them.  Whatever we may think about one another, we should not, at any rate, hurl allegations of this kind from one side of the House to the other; we should not allege that people elected here, a constitutional Party as the Labour Party is, are going to deceive the people to the extent that we will collogue, to use the word used by another Minister, with people outside the House for the purpose of overthrowing the Government elected by the majority of the people.  The allegation is that we are engaged in colloguing.  We would not be worthy of being members of this House if we were in collusion or engaged in colloguing with such people.  There is no foundation whatsoever for any such allegation and I am sure the intelligent, <Col N="1558" /> sensible people of the country are not going to swallow political and unfounded allegations of that kind.</P>
    <P>We are opposing the passage of this measure because the Offences Against the State Bill, or 30 sections of it, propose to take over all the repressive powers contained in what is known as Article 2A.  They propose to take further dictatorial powers in addition to what they have and to make this new legislation part of the normal law of this country.  Whatever might have been said&mdash;and a good deal was said from the Labour Benches at the time&mdash; against the necessity for the introduction of the powers contained in Article 2A, there is one thing to be said for it, at any rate, and that is that the powers contained in that article, in that particular type of legislation, could not be put into operation without the issue of a proclamation, and it had to be suspended in the same way by the issue of a proclamation by the Executive Council. The people who vote for this Bill are going to hand powers to the Executive to make this the normal law and they will give them further dictatorial powers such as were never given before to any Executive by any previous Dáil.</P>
    <P>Speaking on the previous measure in this House, the Minister for Finance who is no doubt an authority on democracy, said that &ldquo;no democratic Assembly and no national Legislature can afford to give uncontrolled powers to the Executive.&rdquo; In opposition in this House at the time was Deputy Lemass who, speaking on the powers sought by Deputy Cosgrave's Party in connection with the legislation I have referred to, defined the rights of the people as the right of free speech, the right of free assembly, the freedom of the Press and the right to be allowed to go at liberty until a charge can be brought and proved.  In addition to the powers contained in Article 2A, this legislation that is now introduced, if it is passed, will take from the people every right which Deputy Lemass at the time described as the right of a free people.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, speaking in this House also, suggested that when they <Col N="1559" /> brought down Article 2A he thought the Labour Party supported them. This is actually what the Taoiseach said: &ldquo;When we brought down Article 2A, I think the Labour Party supported us....  I think they did support us.  My recollection is that we were supported and, I think, rightly supported, by the Labour Party at that time, but what I want to point out to the Labour Party is that they ought not, in dealing with these matters, keep the Party aspect, the political aspect of this question in mind.&rdquo; That is not a correct picture of the position which the Taoiseach and the Government presented to this House in 1933 when they decided to make use of the powers in their possession, namely, the powers contained in Article 2A.  Everybody who wants to remember&mdash;and I daresay it would be good for everybody to forget&mdash;what happened in 1933 will recollect quite clearly that we had a state of armed revolt in this country. You had a body in this country who were going round encouraging people not to pay annuities and who were cutting telegraph poles.</P>

      <P>What I have said is quite true.  We were presented with a certain condition of affairs.  A definite and deliberate attempt on the part of an armed or semi-armed body operating outside this House was made to defeat the Government and prevent them putting their policy into operation. That was the position with which the Labour Party was confronted.  The Fine Gael or the Cumann na nGaedheal Party, as they were described at the time, brought in a motion proposing to censure the Executive Council for attempting to use the powers contained in Article 2A.  That was the position with which the Labour Party was confronted at that time, and it is not right to say that we supported the Government under normal circumstances.  We supported the Government in making use of the powers contained in Article 2A to prevent the Government from being overthrown.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is further proof to the Minister for Defence and to all whom it may concern that we recognise fully the authority of the Government set up by the people, whether it be a Fianna Fáil or any other Government. We will give our support to whatever Government may be in power, just as we gave it to the Fianna Fáil Government at that time, in order to prevent any armed body of people operating outside this House from endeavouring to stop the Government from functioning or from attempting to overthrow the Government of the day.  I make that statement because the Taoiseach, in the words he used, wanted to create the impression that without any justification&mdash;and he did not proceed to give any explanation in support of what he said&mdash;we were prepared in the normal circumstances to support those who wanted to put the powers in Article 2A into operation.  The conditions were absolutely abnormal, and were it not for the fact that we supported the Government in putting down the body who tried to overthrow them, I daresay some of the Ministers over there would not be making the allegations which they made within the last few days against this Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is no harm to mention that when Deputy Lemass, as he then was, was speaking in this House in opposition to the public safety legislation introduced here in 1931, he alleged that certain powers were being given to State servants, such as Civic Guards, at the time, to commit assaults on civilians and to escape the consequences.  I wonder would the Minister for Industry and Commerce take the risk of repeating the allegation in the circumstances of to-day, seeing that the Guards are getting powers additional to those contained in the repressive legislation passed at that period?  For instance, the power to proclaim a public meeting under the powers contained in Article 2A was confined to the Executive Council, but in the particular legislation now before the House, the power of proclaiming a meeting can be exercised by a chief superintendent or a superintendent of the Gárda Síochána.  Is the Minister. <Col N="1561" /> standing over that kind of legislation as part of the normal law of this State?</P>
    <P>Under a certain section of this Bill, as I say, a superintendent of the Guards can proclaim on a Saturday a meeting which is going to be held on Sunday. Of course, there is an additional sub-section in the section referred to, which says that the people proposing to hold the public meeting can appeal against the proclamation but if a superintendent of the Civic Guard proceeds to exercise the power on Saturday to proclaim a meeting which it is intended to hold on the following Sunday, how can those responsible for organising that meeting proceed to hold the meeting in such circumstances?  Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, the ex-Minister for Justice, was so concerned, even after his own experience of the use and abuse of powers of this kind, that he said: &ldquo;I do not believe there is another country in the world, except Nazi Germany, in which sub-section (1) of Section 8 can find its parallel.&rdquo; That is a statement of the ex-Minister for Justice, who has had experience of the use of the powers contained in Article 2A when he was Minister for Justice in the late Government.</P>
    <P>Although the Fine Gael Party are apparently going to vote for the Second Reading of the Bill we have them criticising, and I dare say they have good grounds for criticising, many of its sections.  A remarkable statement was made by Deputy McGilligan when, after a most severe criticism of certain points in the Bill, he said: &ldquo;Take your exceptional circumstances and the exceptional powers you want and operate them as swiftly and as ruthlessly as you can.&rdquo; That is the kind of support which I presume the Minister for Justice welcomes from the Opposition in connection with the passage of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy read what he said about the other part of the Bill?  The Deputy has not dealt with the part dealing with the permanent law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney and Deputy McGilligan qualified their support for the Second Reading by saying that unless <Col N="1562" /> certain sections and sub-sections were deleted, they reserved the right to vote against the final stage of the Bill.  I should like to hear from the Minister for Justice, when he is replying, what is the meaning of &ldquo;State employee&rdquo;?  Is the definition of &ldquo;State employee&rdquo; to be extended to persons engaged on minor relief schemes, afforestation schemes, Land Commission improvement works, or what is the meaning of the term as referred to in Section 6 of the Bill?  Section 6 of the Bill gives very extensive and dictatorial powers to the people responsible for the administration of the measure, in so far as its operations may extend to water bailiffs, sheriff's bailiffs, summons servers and income-tax collectors, and any type of person who can be brought within the meaning of the term &ldquo;State employee.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Section 7 of the Bill proposes to give certain powers to deal with persons who will be charged with intimidating the President in carrying out his duties. May I inquire if the Gaelic Athletic Association, who were recently responsible for expelling our President from the office of patron of that body, could be brought under the powers contained under Section 7 of the Bill, charged and found guilty of intimidating the President in the exercise of his normal duties?  I am asking that question because the President's duties have not so far been very clearly defined in any detail whatever.  I am not sure that bodies like the Gaelic Athletic Association, who are obliged to carry out their duties under the rules of the association&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Section 8 proposes to give power to deal with every person who encourages an employee of the State to refuse to perform his duties, and to make such person liable to two years' imprisonment.  Is it to be taken for granted that that section is inserted in the Bill for the purpose of dealing with persons employed on afforestation schemes, minor relief schemes, or public works of any kind, who may <Col N="1563" /> deem it their right to withdraw their labour in connection with demands for the improvement of wages and conditions of service?  I should like to know exactly what is in the mind of the authorities responsible for seeking such powers.  The same section proposes to take very extensive powers in connection with the printing and circulation of seditious documents.  I dare say some of our daily papers will, when that section comes into operation, be prevented from publishing certain documents from persons like Miss Mary MacSwiney dealing with the activities of the present Government or with those of others with whom she does not agree on political matters.</P>

I do not think they publish these communications in full but I dare say it would be regarded as a very serious matter for the <i>Irish Independent</i> to publish documents of that kind in full as they have apparently been doing in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another section of the Bill which proposes to take power to suppress organisations because they are supposed to be of an unlawful character. If, under the terms of this section as I read it, the proper authority proceeds to suppress an organisation, the organisation certainly has the right to appeal to the High Court against the suppression order but has no further right of appeal.  If the Government, on the other hand, appeal against an adverse decision of the High Court, they have a further right of appeal to the Supreme Court.  The suppressed organisation has not the same right of appeal that the Government has.  I notice that the Minister takes no power to revoke a suppression order.  Once a suppression order is made, it remains, as no power is contained in the Bill to revoke it.  Another dangerous power taken in the Bill deals with the suppression of public meetings.  Under Article 2A, this right was reserved to a member of the Executive Council, or to the Executive Council, but under this particularly repressive measure, <Col N="1564" /> the right to suppress a public meeting is handed over to a chief superintendent or superintendent of the Gárda Síochána.  I should like to know why such drastic powers are being handed over to officers of the Gárda and not reserved to the Government.  What is the reason for extending the powers of the officers of the Gárda in connection with serious matters of this kind?  If the people are to retain their rights of free speech and free assembly under the Constitution, surely such rights should not be taken from them under the normal law by the stroke of a pen of a chief superintendent or superintendent of the Gárda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are opposing this Bill because they believe that, in the first instance, there is no need for it and, in the second instance, because it is depriving citizens of rights and liberties which the Government have no right to filch from them in the present normal conditions.  No case whatsoever has been put forward for the passage of this measure so far as the internal state of the country is concerned. It has been suggested by other speakers that the introduction of this Bill and of the Treason Bill has some connection with certain incidents which have taken place in another country. I do not know whether or not the Minister is prepared to admit that, but, at any rate, neither he nor any of his colleagues has given any indication or intimation or evidence to show that there is any likelihood of any threat to the Government from the citizens of this State.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the introduction of these two Bills is going to do a great deal of damage to international trade and is going to frighten away from this country, during the course of the present year, thousands of tourists who would otherwise come to our shores. The mere introduction of legislation of this kind gives people outside the impression that there is something radically wrong in the country and that there is danger in coming to it. I should like if the Minister for Justice would, in his reply, endeavour to remove the bad impression created by the introduction of this Bill and its brother-in-law, the Treason Bill.  In the opinion of some people, this Bill <Col N="1565" /> will also have the effect of justifying &mdash;if any justification can be forthcoming&mdash;the activities of the Craigavon Government in regard to the imprisonment and internment of Irish nationals in the Six-County area.  It will, certainly, not have the effect of hurrying the Craigavon Government in meting out decent treatment to the citizens of the Six Counties or releasing, in the near future, those whom they have thrown into prison.</P>
    <P>I am of opinion that the real reasons for the introduction of this measure have not been given to the House.  I recognise, as do many other Deputies, that the Taoiseach is a very cute and longheaded politician, that he probably sees the possibility of a world war&mdash; perhaps in the near future&mdash;and the possibility of this country being dragged into that war at the tail of Great Britain, whether we like it or not.  In such circumstances, he probably foresees the necessity for having in his possession repressive powers of this kind.  If that be so, the Minister for Justice or some other Minister should come to the Dáil and justify the introduction and passage of the Bill on these grounds or, at any rate, on some better grounds than those advanced by the Taoiseach or any of the Ministers who have, so far, spoken on this particular measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to oppose this measure.  I regret that I cannot endorse it even to the extent that some of my colleagues have endorsed it. Taking up that attitude, there are one or two points I wish to make.  In the first place, I recognise that a Government must have a means at hand by which, in time of emergency, it can govern.  I adopt that principle and support it.  But I oppose this measure because the Minister has not, in my opinion, treated the House fairly.  He has not seen fit to take this House into his confidence and tell us why the measure has been introduced at this particular time.  There were periods in which a case might have been made that it was necessary.  Yet, the Government, for some reason or another, did not take any step or make any move to introduce the measure then. Secondly, I think that the effectiveness <Col N="1566" /> of legislation such as this is reduced by passing it at a time such as this. Remember, the effectiveness of legislation of this type is when the occasion has arisen for it, so that the immediate passing of the Bill brings the position violently to the minds of the persons you want to inform.  Much has been said about the former Public Safety Act, as it was called&mdash;the amendment of the Constitution&mdash;but this must be said for it, that it was effective.</P>
      <P>One of the causes that led to its effectiveness was that it was brought in at the time when it was necessary. I admit all the violence of the Opposition of the time and of the Labour Party, but nobody knew exactly what it was.  Even the I.R.A. leaders down the country at that particular time did not know how much power the Government of the day had acquired, so it &ldquo;put the wind up&rdquo; them, if nothing else, because they had to wait and see what exactly was going to happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This particular Bill is brought in at a time when there is comparative peace.  At least as far as we can see, nothing is happening with which the ordinary law, if enforced, could not deal.  Whoever is responsible, whether it is the Government itself or some Department of State, I must say that I think the ordinary law has not been enforced.  I am perfectly aware of the fact that several members of the Government Party were aware of where arms and ammunition were dumped, but they did not see fit either to inform the Guards or any other authority that would pick them up. Therefore my case is that the ordinary law is not being made use of, and that the necessity for this measure does not arise.  Again, there is enshrined in the Constitution the liberty of the citizen, a very fine doctrine; the sacredness of the home, a very fine doctrine; the liberty of the Press, a very fine doctrine. All are guaranteed.  Freedom of meeting is guaranteed.  But, having done all that, we bring in a measure, to be made an ordinary Statute of the Oireachtas, reducing all those things that are guaranteed under the Constitution. We start off with a great flourish.  We have the Constitution passed by a majority of the electors&mdash; I will not say by a majority of the <Col N="1567" /> people&mdash;and no sooner has that been done than this Bill is brought in to reduce all the things that have been guaranteed under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Davin has pointed out, even freedom of public meeting is being imperilled, where a superintendent of the Civic Guards thinks something; all he has to do is to think that Deputy Victory and I are going to clash outside the gate of some church, and that a row will take place.  All he has to do is to think that Deputy Childers and Deputy Victory are going to have a row.  He is then entitled to suppress the meeting.  I hold that Deputy Childers and Deputy Victory should be entitled to speak even if there were a bit of a row, and the superintendent of the Guards should not have the right to say: &ldquo;Because I think this is going to lead to a breach of the peace the meeting must be suppressed.&rdquo; Therefore I agree with Deputy Davin that the procedure should be at least nothing worse than in the Six Counties, that is, that the meeting should be suppressed by a responsible Minister of State, and that it should not be left to any officer of the Guards, no matter how high he may be, to decide that particular question.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice, as I say, should take the House into his confidence. I admit that the responsibility of government rests with the Government, and that they should be in a position to say: &ldquo;We require this power in order to govern and here are the reasons.&rdquo; Every responsible Deputy would have to weigh that very carefully, and I cannot see any Deputy with any sense of responsibility in any part of the House refusing that power. But the Minister blandly comes in and reads two proclamations, one signed by a number of people handing over to certain other people, and those people issuing a new proclamation.  The only thing I can say about it is that the names may be the names of Plunkett and Russell, but the words are the words of de Valera and Ruttledge. Here is the astonishing fact, that one of those proclamations, signed by those two persons who are now Ministers of State, found in the pockets of one of <Col N="1568" /> those fellows to-day, will render him guilty of an offence under this particular measure.  I have a fairly large collection of all those proclamations.  I have had one in storage for the Minister for Finance for a considerable time, because he challenged me to produce it here in the House, and when the time comes I hope to produce it. But if this Bill passes, and I am coming here to the House with that document in my pocket, and somebody knows that I have it.  I cannot get this far because I will be arrested under the Offences Against the State Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I would not charge him to the extent of saying he would do it deliberately, although, mind you, one of the reasons why I am opposed to this particular Bill is that I hold that the present Executive did not administer the Public Safety Act impartially; that they administered it partially, and with the greatest amount of hardship and political partisanship. I deny the assertion made by Deputy Davin that the League of Youth or the Blueshirts were a semi-armed or military organisation.  They were no such thing.  They were not armed.  There were members of it who held arms under the authority of the State; they held them under a 5/- licence.  They applied for permission to have them, and got the authority.  We know that the Minister for Justice, no matter how great was the sentimental regard for one of these weapons used, perhaps, for protection purposes in days gone by, had it picked up, whether it was a souvenir or not.  I hold that the administration of the Act was not impartial, but was&mdash;perhaps I should not say used&mdash;abused by the Executive.  It could be argued, of course, that that charge could be levelled against those who initiated it.  Like everything else, I suppose that is a matter of opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that the time is inopportune for this measure, and that parliamentary time, that might be better employed on other activities, is being wasted.  Questions of social and economic importance require attention, yet, we are here wasting our time, when everything is peaceful, dealing with a <Col N="1569" /> measure such as this instead of with questions affecting agriculture, and drainage.  A Land Bill which has been on the Order Papers since February the 8th, seems to be in the Limbo of lost things because of the urgency of the Treason Bill.  Therefore, I cannot support this measure.  I feel that the Government should withdraw it, and it a time arises&mdash;and I hope it will not arise&mdash;when they say that they want this power and cannot get on without it, I am perfectly satisfied the House will not deny the Executive whatever authority it requires to protect life and property, and to guarantee the things enshrined in the Constitution.  For these reasons, I must withhold my support from this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge) Patrick J. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the whole I cannot complain of the reception this Bill has got from the House.  One would feel, from some of the speeches heard towards the close of the debate, that the Government was doing something that was going to be popular in the country or very popular, from the Party point of view. Unless the people can be got to realise the absolute necessity for such a measure then the people who oppose it and make politics of it get advantages from it.  The House should realise at the outset that, when we came here with this Bill, we were convinced as to its absolute necessity, and when we have got it through this House we will feel that in putting it through, and leaving it there for the purposes for which we may think it necessary, we will have done something to protect the liberty of this State and the citizens of this State.  I stated at the introduction of the Second Reading that what we wanted was to get the principle of it adopted, and if the principle was adopted, we were prepared to go to any reasonable length to try to meet any feelings or any doubts that might exist amongst Deputies on particular details of the Bill.  That is the attitude we still take up.  The first four parts of the Bill have been criticised, and ridiculous suggestions have been made as to how they might be applied.  I think Deputy McGilligan touched the kernel when he said that they appeared to pivot <Col N="1570" /> around unlawful associations.  There is no intention to interfere with anybody or with any organisations, unless they are clearly unlawful organisations, and I am sure Deputies will appreciate this.  Except in so far as it might be considered by the Executive to tie its hands unduly and unfairly in dealing with a difficult and a serious situation, the Government is prepared to meet the views and fears, which I regard as being groundless, as best we can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two arguments have been directed mainly against the Bill, the first that there is no necessity for it, because there is adequate law to deal with the ordinary situations, and secondly that the country has not been so peaceful for a long time.  There is no use in blinding ourselves as to what the position would be if anything serious&mdash;from the political or semi-political angle&mdash; occurred with the powers we have, at present, to deal with such a situation. When I say political or semi-political angle, I do not mean that in the sense of people in this House.  I mean people operating outside, who believe not in operating on constitutional lines but by means of violence to achieve their aims.  We had Article 2A in operation.  We were reluctant to put it into operation, but when we looked around at a certain situation, to see how we might deal with it, and when we had examined every bit of legislation, and every tittle of law available to us, we found we had no other means at our hands to deal with that situation. Deputies know how we criticised Article 2A at the time it was being enacted, and how we felt about it at that time.  It was with considerable reluctance we had to take advantage of the provisions that were there.  If we had any other law or legislation available to deal with that situation we would not have resorted to that measure.  With the passing of the new Constitution Article 2A disappeared. We were told that we had the Treasonable Offences Act.  Anybody who looks at Sections 1 and 2 of that Act will see, no doubt, that it does not apply.  They know that it is not applicable to the new constitutional position.  If they examine every section of it they will see that they are tainted with the same unconstitutionality.  We find ourselves <Col N="1571" /> now in this position: when we look to the ordinary law to deal with the situation there is neither the Treasonable Offences Act nor Article 2A available.</P>
    <P>Deputy Davin made various suggestions as to the reason for this Bill being brought in at this time.  As I said in moving the Second Reading, we could have two minds about the introduction of such a measure.  That was misunderstood or misconstrued by some Deputies in the House to mean that there was a division in the Cabinet.  I could myself have two minds about this matter.  The two minds were those: whether we were going to ask the House to pass a measure then, as an ordinary precautionary measure, and have it considered calmly here in the House, with no incidents and nothing having happened that might in the ordinary way be considered by some Deputies to be its justification; the other mind might be to take your chance and wait until something had happened.  As I said the last day, we took what we call a compromise attitude and this Bill is the result of that compromise attitude.</P>
    <P>Deputies have emphasised the peace that prevails in the country.  We are all pleased with the peace that does prevail in the country and no one should be more pleased than the Government because they claim that their policy helped to secure that peace.  We believe that we want a Bill like this to maintain that peace.  I know the criticism that has been levelled at those two proclamations. Anybody can make play with them if they want to.  If those proclamations emanated from an organisation that had not arms in their hands and war materials at their back perhaps they could be treated as if they were play-acting.  We know the position in the country.  We know the persons who signed those proclamations and I am not going to accept the view of Deputy O'Higgins when he said that all it meant to him, or might mean to him, was the disappearance of one of two organisations.  I would just like to remind him that the organisation that survived and remained was the armed organisation.  Does any sensible, <Col N="1572" /> reasonable Deputy in this House for one moment believe that those people are play-acting?  Does anybody in this House, who knows anything about this country, suggest for a moment or believe for one moment, that those people are not going to act and intend to act on those proclamations?  No Deputy, I believe, who has lived in this country and knows the history of this country, has any doubt whatever about it.  As I pointed out, we know that these people have arms.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>We have got some of them.  It is all very easy for people to go around any say, &ldquo;Get them&rdquo;. We have got some arms in this country but no matter what efforts could be made along those lines, unless you go around foolishly, raiding here and there for them, and creating disturbances in the country, there is not much hope of getting them, at least in considerable quantities.  I could perhaps recite various matters that come before my notice in the Department of Justice. I thank Deputy Dillon for appreciating the difficulties that exist towards disclosing that information, and I want at once to say that that information at the moment is not of a terribly serious character, but it is sufficient at least to indicate to any responsible Minister or to any responsible Government that, if the situation is not dealt with, then it is going to be a serious situation.</P>
      <P>I want to deal at once with the suggestion made by Deputy Davin&mdash;I think he was the first that hinted at it in the long debate that has gone on in this House&mdash;that there is something peculiar at the back of bringing in this Bill at this particular time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the ordinary law in a moment.  I am speaking now on the fact of bringing it in here at the present time.  I am precluded, and must be precluded, from referring to any incidents that may have happened elsewhere, but the <Col N="1573" /> Deputy knows perfectly well that this Government is not dictated to from outside, and I can say no more than that.  I have heard Deputy Hickey, of Cork, talking about how peaceful it is in Cork.  It is comparatively peaceful in Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>But just take Cork. Deputy Hickey made out that Cork was an exceptional case.  I know you can have peace of a certain kind.  I could take other areas just as well, or certain areas, at any rate.  On the 19th February you had a commemoration at Midleton in County Cork, and you had contingents attending there in military formation and taking military orders. At the close of the proceedings a speech was made by the party in charge.  This is what he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The I.R.A. are reorganising to carry on the fight for the establishment of the republic.  They have not taken any aggressive action against the forces of the State for the past two years, but if de Valera now tries to crush us with his new Coercion Act, then, all I can say is, may God help him.  He will endeavour to enforce his new Coercion Act with the aid of his murder gang and the remnants of Cosgrave's murder gang. They will never suppress the I.R.A. We beat them in 1922, 1931 and 1936, and we will beat them again in 1939.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Before that, there was a party charged in Cork&mdash;and perhaps this is the sort of law the Deputy would like to have obtain&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There could not be evidence if people are threatened like that when certain people are charged.  Perhaps that is the peace that some people would like to have in this country.  I put it to you that it is a very dear peace.  It is a peace that cannot be accepted by any responsible Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to a number of matters which I might, if I so desired, bring in here.  There are various incidents through the country of which I might make a litany, if I so desired.  It is not right to say that I am not candid with the House in not detailing them.  There is certain information obtained from time to time by a Minister which, I feel, he is not bound to disclose, and I accept the view expressed by Deputy Dillon the last day, that, in certain circumstances. you can not only create a bad impression abroad, but very often create a panic at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made to what will happen when the first four parts of this Bill become part of the ordinary law.  There is nothing being asked for under Parts I to IV which every other civilised country has not got.  Every other civilised country, as a matter of protection, has the powers that are there.  Reference has also been made to public meetings.  I do not want to point to particular countries, but there are democratic countries in which public meetings can only be held by permission of the police <Col N="1576" /> force.  There are also organisations which are not permitted to form without the permission of the Government and which can be dissolved by the Government.  I am not now referring to dictator nations.  We are not trying by this Bill to limit the rights of anybody, any association or any organisation, and I think every Deputy who is honest with himself knows that.  We are only trying to deal with those military, or semi-military, organisations that have taken to themselves the right to change the Government of this country by violent means.</P>
    <P>I have indicated that, so far as I can, I will try to meet points which I believe should not be a cause of fear or suspicion to Deputies; and I am prepared to go to any reasonable lengths to meet Deputies in regard to amendments to Parts I to IV of the Bill.  Deputies have talked about making this part of the ordinary law. I should like to put the alternative in that regard before the House.  If you have it there as the ordinary law, it is there as a deterrent against people taking action, whereas if you have not got it as part of the normal law, and if you have to deal with a situation in a certain way, a certain number of things may happen before you will act and deal with that situation.  However, I am prepared to go to any reasonable lengths to meet Deputies in this matter, provided that reasonableness does not become foolhardiness and leave us without the necessary powers to deal with situations that may arise from day to day.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I do not want, in justification of the Bill, to go into a litany of things that have happened in the country.  I do not think I need do so.  I do not think that anybody here can take the change-over that has taken place as some bit of play-acting that a certain group of people are carrying on.  The arms are there; the material is there; and the training, the drilling and the organisation is going on.  I do not for a moment accept the position, and I do not think any Minister has the right to accept it, that before I can come to the House, some murders must be committed in the country.  I do not think it is a position that could be <Col N="1577" /> adopted by any responsible Minister that you must let people strike first, and, then, when a few murders are committed, come in here and ask for legislation of this sort.  We want to have the powers there so that people will see the finger-post pointing at them if they take certain action or do certain things.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes made a reference with which I should like to deal.  He asked which Minister was to be relied on, and said that I had stated that I wanted this Bill passed and that the Minister for Defence stated that, when the Bill was passed, we might not have to use it. There is no difference between the two views.  I hold on to the same hope that when people see that we mean what we say, that we have the necessary legislation enacted and that we are in a position to deal with any situation that may arise, it may not be necessary, perhaps, to put the Bill into effective operation.  I do hope it will not be necessary, and I think everybody in the House holds to that hope.  We are not going out to create any panic in the country; we are not going to start any action that would in any way force a position here that might not otherwise arise; but when I say that, I mean that should the necessity for the operation of the Bill be indicated, the measures we will have to take must be effective.</P>
    <P>I hope that no people outside will misunderstand when I say that I hope these powers will not have to be used. I sincerely hope they will not, but I do not want people outside to get it into their heads that this is merely a threat and that we are not going to take action to make the powers we may get effective, however regretful it may be, if the circumstances demand it.  But I would urge, if any urging meant anything to those people, that they might take stock of the position even now. There is no hope whatever of those people succeeding in achieving anything by any violent means.  A Constitution was enacted here which left everybody perfectly free.  A free election was held afterwards and every opportunity was provided for those people, without inflicting anything on their consciences by way of an oath or test or anything of that sort, to go forward <Col N="1578" /> for that election and to enable them, if they could get the support of the people in sufficient numbers and get a majority, to become the Government of the country and work out what, according to their own judgment and their own beliefs, would be best for the people of this country.</P>
    <P>This part of the country, at least, as everybody knows, is absolutely free, and in those circumstances there is no justification whatever for any body of people setting themselves up and trying to change or alter the position by violent methods&mdash;none whatever.  As well as that, not only is there no reason for it, but there is absolutely no hope whatever for it.  It is going to lead them nowhere.  I heard Deputy Davin referring to something that the Minister for Defence said.  I think it had regard to where the Minister for Defence was referring to Deputy Norton talking about this tyrannical measure.  The Minister for Defence, in answering that, pointed out that the first sufferers would be the poorer people of this country.  We all know that, if there is going to be trouble in this country, it is the poorer people who are going to suffer most for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>If people can call this a tyrannical measure, I suggest that they should weigh their words, because, instead of our allowing a situation to develop that might be dealt with now, if those people outside have the common sense to realise how futile their policy is and that this may be effective very soon, it is much better than to allow a situation to develop which is going to lead to considerable trouble in this country and to considerable hardship on people who are least able to bear it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some points were raised&mdash;small points&mdash;by various Deputies as to various aspects of this Bill.  I think that the easiest way I can answer them&mdash;and I think I have answered them to some extent already&mdash;is to say that we are prepared to go fully into this Bill on the Committee Stage&mdash; there will be plenty of time for it&mdash;and <Col N="1579" /> try to meet as far as we possibly can the views that Deputies may hold in order to make this a more normal measure, but at the same time ensuring that it must be an effective measure.  I would rather see, in the emergency provisions of this Bill, if it could be done, some of the things that at present appear in Parts I to IV.  I shall have that position examined and, if it can be done, we shall go a long way to try to secure it but, as I say, that can only be done when one is satisfied that one can do it safely and can do it effectively.  Some of the reasons I have against that are that, by resorting to emergency powers or bringing down emergency powers, you will create some little panic, whereas, if the powers were there as normal powers&mdash;powers that, I contend, every civilised country in the world has had &mdash;if we have it there as the normal law, then it will be there, I believe, as a deterrent to people who may have inclinations or intentions, or who may have organisations, to do some of those things from which we are now trying to protect the people.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, and, say now, in conclusion, this Bill is not brought in in any panic.  It is brought in calmly because we believe it is necessary. There are sufficient indications to us that such a Bill is necessary, and if the rights and liberties of our people are to be protected they should not be afraid of the provisions in that Bill. No person need have any fears whatever that this Bill will be operated in any way whatever so far as the law-abiding people of this country are concerned that there will be any interference with their liberty&mdash;none whatever.</P>
    <P>Somebody asked why the powers to suppress meetings were being given to a chief superintendent.  I do not want to go into details on all these points, but a real reason for that is this; From time to time, we have had a sort of trick-of-the-loop business of meetings being announced to be held in one place, and then, being held somewhere else.  I do not see how you can have a Minister going around from one place to another issuing proclamations every half-hour to deal with such a situation. <Col N="1580" /> He could not do it.  That is why it is being left to the chief superintendent to deal with such a situation.</P>

      <P>Well, again, I suppose it is one job, and it is one person, but you cannot be everywhere at the same time, and if you get a telephone message that a meeting is going to be held in some part of the County Dublin, and then, half an hour afterwards, the meeting is changed down to Kilkenny or somewhere else, you can not be chasing around the country like that.  The reason for this is simply in order to enable the Bill to operate effectively.  It is intended for organisations of a military or semi-military character, or unlawful organisations or assemblies for unlawful purposes.  It is to deal with that sort of thing that that power is given.  The Labour Party should not be trying to confuse the people&mdash;I suppose they really believe it &mdash;but they should not be trying to confuse the people, and trying to get the idea abroad that this is going to be against trades unions and bodies of that sort.  They know themselves that that is absolutely nonsense, and I say that it would be much better to face the debate fairly, and not be trying to get away with the idea that that is the intention behind this Bill, or that it is going to be operated in that way.  It is not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask for the principle of this Bill on this Reading, and I shall do my best on the Committee Stage to meet the number of points that were raised here. We are convinced that the Bill is necessary.  We are convinced that it is necessary, not merely because some people issued proclamations, but because, behind those proclamations lie a line of policy and a certain direction of activities which, we are told, are now going to be revived.  We are told that certain organisations are being revived, that drilling is going to be revived, and that this armed body is going to be reorganised and revived.  Either it is <Col N="1581" /> to be a question of allowing these people to go on with all this or dealing with the situation, or it means that the Government will be able to carry on, however little, depending only on the sufferance of these people, and depending on their whims from time to time as to whether they will allow the Government to carry on or not.  But if the Government is going to remain and act as a responsible Government, the time has come to act in this matter.</P>

      <P>Before you put the question, Sir, I want to raise a point of order.  We had some discussion on the other Bill regarding the repeal section in connection with the Treasonable Offences Act and the Public Safety (Emergency Powers) Act.  I want to submit that, at the moment anyway, Section 30 of the Offences Against the State Bill is, so to speak, outside the scope of this Bill, in so far as there does not appear to be any provision <Col N="1582" /> made for it in the Title.  Is it the Minister's intention to provide for that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate on this Vote on Account for a sum not exceeding £10,855,000 was adjourned last week, the Minister for Agriculture was performing.  It struck me that the Minister for Agriculture has lately adopted the technique of the Minister for Industry and Commerce and that is to get up and brazen out everything. A thing is so because the Minister says it is so.  I would like to know, but, of course, I will not be told, whether farmer Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party sitting behind the Minister agree with him or not when he states that the farmers of this country are infinitely better off to-day than they were before this Government came into power.  Is it not a fact known to every member of this House coming from a rural constituency and particularly members of the Fianna Fáil Party from rural constituencies that the farmers are so well off that we have beaten a path from this House to the Land Commission Offices seeking to get time for the farmers who are unable to pay their annuities?  There is a daily and hourly trek from here to the Land Commission office of Deputies of all Parties, with the sheriff's notice in their hands seeking time from the Land Commission to enable the farmer to meet his annuities.</P>
      <P>I venture to say that there is not a Deputy in this House, with any knowledge whatever of rural conditions, as they are to-day, at the end of the blackest year perhaps for agriculture in memory, owing to the appalling weather conditions, who would get up and repeat the statement made by the Minister.  We had of course a confirmation of that statement from Deputy Childers.  I will deal with that later on.  The Minister for Agriculture advanced as one of the reasons why the farmers were so well off, that if they were paying £460,000 additional in rates over and above what they were paying in 1931, the Government had made them a present of £2,000,000 worth of annuities.  When I asked him where he got the £2,000,000 he said, of course, that that was a silly interruption. The Minister was careful not to advert to this fact that not only are our people paying £460,000 additional in rates above what they paid in 1931 but that they are paying £9,500,000 additional in taxes and that they are trying to pay these huge sums on an income that has been reduced by one-third&mdash;and I am putting it at a low figure.</P>
      <P>The Minister wandered then a little and he told us about &ldquo;what we had done for the farmers of this country.&rdquo; There is no necessity for any Minister on the benches opposite to tell the farmers what they have done for them. The farmers know it to their sorrow and cost.  They know not only what the Government has done for them but what the Minister for Finance under the new Valuation Bill proposes to do for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we had Deputy Childers backing up the Minister.  One is inclined to make a lot of allowances for a new Deputy and particularly when that Deputy is a very young Deputy.  Those of us who were very young when we came in here know quite well that allowances have to be made and had to be made for all of us.  Deputy <Col N="1585" /> Childers, of course, wanted to assure the House that he had made a perfect study of this matter, and he told us: &ldquo;Coming to the general position of the country I say, unequivocally, that, without any question, the people of this country are better off than they were before this Government entered into office, that the people have a better appearance, have a better life and, in the vast majority of cases, have more money to spend.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Hear, hear!</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>My friend, Deputy Tom Kelly, says &ldquo;Hear, hear!&rdquo; to that.  Deputy Kelly's knowledge of the conditions outside the City of Dublin are apparently on a par with that of Deputy Childers.  I can only come to the conclusion that the man who made that statement that I have just quoted is completely ignorant, not only of the situation in the country generally but of the situation in his own constituency. The Deputy went on to deal with some other matters.  Dealing with the unemployment figures, he said this: &ldquo;You must not think too hastily on this question of unemployment.&rdquo; Anybody who would accuse the present Government either of thinking or dealing too hastily with unemployment must not have much knowledge of what has been happening in our political life here for the past seven years.  The Deputy took great comfort in this fact and advanced it as evidence of the marked improvement which, to use his own words, was to be observed.  He asked the House to look at the appalling position that we were in in 1935 when, according to him; we had 145,000 registered unemployed. To-day, he said we have only 105,000.  Of course, it did not occur to him that in the period of 1935 to 1938 over 80,000 of our unemployed went across to England to seek employment, so that far from being 40,000 better off, as Deputy Childers sought to make it appear, we are really 40,000 worse off as regards the number of unemployed compared with 1935.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can understand a Deputy like him rushing in and making a speech of that <Col N="1586" /> kind for the reason that he is young and inexperienced, and, as I have said, he is in a state of complete ignorance as to what the actual position in the country is.  I cannot imagine a Deputy living in a rural district and in daily contact with the farmers rushing in here and telling us, as Deputy Childers did, that the people are infinitely better off and have much more money to spend than they had seven years ago.  Anyone with any knowledge of the situation knows that that statement is not true.  We were told by the Minister for Agriculture, and by Deputy Childers, all that this Government have done for the country: that they have provided the farmers with bounties and subsidies.  Would the Minister tell us where did the Government get the money to enable them to do all that?  When I interrupted the Minister and said</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Is not that feeding them with a bit of their own tail.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>his answer was</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Did anybody ever hear such a silly interruption?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course, the policy that has been pursued by the Government is, in effect, that of feeding the farmers with a bit of their own tail, but the question arises, how long is the tail going to last.</P>
    <P>I have been driven to the conclusion that either the Minister for Agriculture is the most hopelessly incompetent Minister for Agriculture in this or any other country, or else that the members of his own Party are not telling him the truth.  We know that there are members of the Fianna Fáil Party in as close touch with the farmers, and with conditions in the country, as those on any other side of the House.  They are in a position to give first hand information to the Minister on the state of the country.  Therefore, I must conclude, after listening to the kind of speech we had last week from the Minister for Agriculture, that the members of his own Party, representing agricultural constituencies, are not telling him the truth.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers spoke about people looking better and, in the vast majority of cases, having more money to spend. <Col N="1587" /> The Deputy, I understand, is in fairly close couch with a certain section of people in this country.  He has perhaps a better knowledge of how they are faring than he has of the farmers. If he was speaking for that particular section I have not the shadow of a doubt but that they are looking better: that they are looking much better now than they were before this Government came into office, and that they have a lot more money to spend to-day than they had seven years ago.  But if that is so, it is only because the rest of the people of the country have been fleeced to put them in that position.</P>
    <P>I do not think it will be suggested by anybody now that there is anything in the nature of a campaign to keep farmers from paying their rates and annuities.  I certainly never admitted that there was such a campaign and I do not believe that the people who made suggestions of that kind at one time would dare to do so now.  I can say that farmers, hardworking, industrious men, have recently come to me, as they have to members in other Parties in the House, and admitted that for the first time in their lives they have been unable to pay their annuities and rates.  When the Minister for Agriculture was speaking on unemployment, he said that the number of National Health Insurance stamps sold proved beyond yea or nay that there was a far greater number of people in employment now than under the previous Government.  In ordinary normal circumstances the sale of these stamps is probably one of the best tests that can be applied, but the Minister must know quite well that, with the bringing into operation of the rotation schemes by the present Government, you have not ordinary normal circumstances prevailing.  Therefore, you are not in a position to draw right conclusions from the sale of these stamps, because, instead of having one stamp for a week's work at the present time you have in a great number of cases two stamps.  You have the position that a man is given employment on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday when he is laid off.  Another man takes his place on Thursday, Friday and Saturday, so that instead of having one <Col N="1588" /> card for that one week's work you have two cards.  When Deputy Davin interrupted the Minister and asked him: &ldquo;How much of that was due to relief schemes?&rdquo; the Minister for Agriculture replied: &ldquo;There would not be very much; there were not more than 20,000 on relief schemes.&rdquo; The Minister for Agriculture gave the figure as 20,000, while the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance told the House that, for the same period there were 45,000 people engaged on relief schemes.  That indicates the amount of care the Minister for Agriculture took in preparing his speech on such an important matter.  Little and all as he apparently knows about the state of agriculture, he certainly knows far less about the state of unemployment.</P>
    <P>We have been told of the provision that has been made for the workers, and of all that has been done for them by this Government.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance read a long statement to the House on that subject just two weeks ago.  He spent a considerable time making a comparison of the wages and conditions for men on relief schemes, and the wages paid to men employed in agriculture.  He was comparing, he said, the 24/- a week paid to relief workers with the 27/- paid to agricultural workers.</P>
    <P>Of course there is no comparison whatsoever, apart from the amount paid in each case.  A man who is employed by a farmer is employed from week to week, and is paid his wages at the end of each week.  If a day comes wet, or half a day comes wet, or if there are a few heavy showers, he is not sent home by the farmer, and that day is not deducted from his wages. The man on relief schemes may get two, three or four lays.  If he is lucky enough, the four days allotted to him may happen to be fine days, but how many consecutive fine days did he get during the last seven or eight months? How many men sent out for four days at 4/- a day were able to work even the four days?</P>
    <P>The Deputy told us about the way this money was being apportioned over different parts of the country.  He held forth that there were no complaints received, in particular from the West, <Col N="1589" /> of Ireland.  He said very few complaints were received even from the South.  The men cannot complain. They have no alternative, because, as I said on that occasion, the alternative to rotation is starvation, and if a man refuses to accept whatever work is allotted to him under the rotation scheme, he loses not only that, but is automatically cut off from any payment at the Labour Exchange.  There is no use in trying to boast that he has not received complaints.  Men reduced to these circumstances are not in a position to complain.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Dillon, speaking on this Vote on Account the other night, asked us to visualise the position of a man with a family of three, four, five or six, trying to live on 27/- a week.  He has not very much of a life, I grant you.  I want the House to visualise the hundreds, the thousands of men in this country to-day with families, and without work, without any means whatever, who are entitled to the maximum unemployment assistance. What is the maximum?  It is 14/- a week, and it does not matter whether the men have five or ten children. And remember, they only get that 14/- when they are completely without means.  I want the house to visualise a man in that state trying to exist, with very little more than half of what even the agricultural labourer has.</P>
    <P>That is what we are told this Government has done for the workers and the unemployed.  Deputies know quite as well as I do that those are the conditions. The statements I have made are facts that those of us who go to our constituencies every week and mix with the ordinary people, meeting them on the streets, at the fairs or at the markets, are well aware of.  Those of us who open our correspondence every morning are kept in touch with the conditions in the country.  Every Deputy knows how many requests are made to him to go to the Land Commission for time, to the Agricultural Credit Corporation for time&mdash;time all the time.  I want to say without any hesitation, and I have perhaps as long an experience as any Deputy here, that I have got more requests from my constituency, <Col N="1590" /> from farmers, within the last three months to ask the Land Commission for time than I got in the previous five years.  There are many other Deputies in this House who could say the same.</P>
    <P>I want to go back again to the position of the unemployed.  Deputy Childers thinks it is a marked improvement, a marked advance, that we have only 105,000 unemployed.  Deputy Flinn, who was a Parliamentary Secretary when this Government first came into office, was appointed chairman of a committee on unemployment.  After seven years the position is that, notwithstanding the 80,000 who emigrated during the period mentioned by Deputy Childers, we not only have 105,000 unemployed, but we are told by Deputy Hugo Flinn, the man who is primarily charged with responsibility for finding employment for them, that he does not know hew he is going to do it; that the difficulty now is not merely the difficulty of finding the money, but that it is the difficulty of finding work for them in the country, assuming he has the money.  That, it seems to me, can be characterised in one way only, and that is by saying that it is a policy of despair for the workers, or rather the workless of this country, when you have a responsible Parliamentary Secretary, speaking here on behalf of the Government, telling us that the outlook for the future is black and that even if the Government were in the position to guarantee all the money that was required, he is afraid that he would not be able to find the work upon which to expend that money and employ the men.</P>
    <P>That is the position we have in the country and, in the face of that, we are told by a Deputy and by a Minister that this country and the people in it are better off to-day than they were in the period before this Government came into office; and not only better off, but they are looking better and, in the vast majority of cases, they have more money to spend than they had seven or eight years ago.  Even the most enthusiastic supporter, if there are any enthusiastic supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party left down the country, would not believe that statement.  The Minister is not going to improve the <Col N="1591" /> position by refusing to look at it, and he is not going to improve conditions in this country by refusing to admit that certain conditions exist in the country.  You are not going to meet and deal with, and get over, a difficulty simply by getting up and saying it does not exist, it is not there.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has been trying to do that in this House for the last seven or eight years.  He has got up here and told us that such-and-such is the state of affairs, when every man listening to him, those behind as well as those in front of him, knew quite well that what he was saying was absolutely inaccurate. The Minister's technique was simply to brazen out that this country was getting better and better every day.  We were getting a sort of dose of couéism, as we used to know it, saying &ldquo;You are better off to-day than you were seven years ago; you have more money in your pocket and you are looking better.&rdquo; If you can only keep on saying it, you will convince yourself in the end that you really are.  Mind you, saying that people have more money in their pockets when they have not is not going to deal with their difficulty. There is no use in telling the man with a six-day notice from the Land Commission or a writ from the Agricultural Credit Corporation that he has more money in his pocket and ought not to have any difficulty in paying his debts.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have to face this fact, that the people of this country lost a tremendous amount of money for seven years and at the end of that time they were faced with one of the worst years in memory from the point of view of the agriculturist, owing to the frightfully bad weather; that to-day in this country there is very little feeding for livestock and that what feeding is there is not very much good.  That may not be true of every county, but it is true of a great deal of the country, and Deputies know that as well as I do. You are not going to improve the situation for the agriculturists or for any other section of the community until you are prepared to admit to yourselves that they are in a bad condition and that something will have to be <Col N="1592" /> done to improve that condition.  We have got to face up to the fact&mdash;we should have faced up to it long ago and I should like Deputy Childers in particular to face up to it&mdash;that all your industries in towns or cities&mdash;and I have no objection whatever to industries: I should like to encourage them as far as possible&mdash;cannot exist unless you have a prosperous, agricultural population to support them.  That is so self-evident and such plain commonsense that it should not be necessary to state it here in this House but apparently it is necessary.</P>
    <P>That is the picture as I know it.  I have not tried to exaggerate it in the slightest.  These are the conditions as I find them in my constituency and I come from a constituency where the soil is at least as good as any other part of Ireland, where the farmers have as good a way of working that soil as they have in most parts of the country, where the farmers are as good, as hardworking and as industrious as they are in any other part of the country.  Having done their best fighting against the very adverse conditions of the last seven years, they are to-day far from the position which the Minister and Deputy Childers described for us the other night.</P>
    <P>The future of this country depends on whether the Government will deal with that situation.  The position is certainly a bad one.  It is a very urgent one.  The bad harvest, so far as a great number of farmers in this country are concerned, was the last straw.  Some of them would have been able to survive, would have turned the corner, to use a hackneyed phrase, and have been able to keep their heads over the water, even after the depressing conditions of the previous seven years, if they had a good harvest, but so far from having a good harvest, they had a very bad one.  Their condition is a serious one, one that demands attention, not only for their own sake, but for the sake of the nation as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFagan" hpid="Mr. Fagan Mr. Fagan">

      <P>I was amazed listening to the speech of the Minister for Agriculture the last night on which this Vote on Account was debated, but I was even more amazed at the speech <Col N="1593" /> of Deputy Childers, because I see by the local papers that he and his Fianna Fáil colleague are going down to their constituency and are vying with each other as to who is doing best for the farmers.  After listening to Deputy Childers here the last night, I must say that he knows nothing about the farmers.  He is a city man and he has city ideas.  The same may be said of most members of the Government of the present day.  The Minister for Agriculture, by quoting figures here the last night, tried to prove that the farmers were better off than they were in 1931.  It has been said that you can prove anything with figures, but the facts are there and they speak for themselves.  I frequently move amongst the farmers and I can say it is pitiful to see the condition of some of them at the present time.  I know farmers with seven and eight children in their families for whom they have scarcely a bit.  The worst-off are those farmers whose valuations range from £25 to £50, because they cannot get any help from anybody.  They have to pay doctors' fees and every other expense. The man with a lower valuation has some chance, but the position of farmers, such as I have mentioned at present, is deplorable.  It is no wonder that the Bishops in their Lenten Pastorals should have drawn attention to it.  I had some hope that the members of the Government might have read these Pastorals but, according to what the Minister for Agriculture has stated, they must not have read them.  Many farmers are in need of immediate relief.  I know that for a certainty.  This scheme of providing 6d. or 1/- on a bag of manure is no good to them.  They are not able to buy manure at present nor are they able to buy seed for their crops.  If the Minister wants to know the real position of the farmers let him come down the country with me.  I will take him on a tour round my constituency and I guarantee that he will come back with a sore heart to Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture used the argument here the other night that when the economic war was settled there was a reduction in the price of cattle and that, so far as the price of cattle was concerned, we <Col N="1594" /> would have been better off if they had not settled it.  I must say that the settlement of the economic war was a very welcome development, and I thank God that the Government did find itself in a mood to settle it at last.  No doubt the price of cattle was reduced some little bit after the settlement of the economic war.  Why? Because the Government were so long about settling the economic war. Fianna Fáil Deputies were going down the country telling the people: &ldquo;It will be settled in a week,&rdquo; with the result that every poor fool was rushing out to buy cattle, and in consequence the price of cattle was put up to a false figure.  The English farmers were also buying in anticipation of the settlement.</P>
    <P>I know that thousands of cattle were bought by English farmers prior to the settlement.  I myself bought them for English farmers and parked them in this country for two or three months in anticipation of the tariffs coming off. An English farmer would write to me and say: &ldquo;Buy 20 or 30 cattle and keep them over for a while.  This thing will be settled in a fortnight or three weeks.&rdquo; That is why the price of cattle went up immediately before the settlement of the economic war to a price that was not the real market value.  The result was that when the economic war was eventually settled, there were thousands of cattle in this country that had to be got rid of immediately.  The English farmers found that their requirements were more than satisfied, with the result that there was a drop in price immediately after the settlement.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture also referred to the question of rates.  If some relief is not immediately provided in regard to rates, I do not see how people can be expected to pay these rates.  In my county I was told recently by one man that his present rates were two and a half times the amount they were in 1918, on the same valuation. Does that increase not wipe out any relief farmers got by the halving of the annuities?  I had the pleasure of meeting a farmer from Northern Ireland in the Dublin cattle market last week, and I had a long chat with him about conditions <Col N="1595" /> up there.  I remarked to him: &ldquo;I suppose you are all dying up there to get in with the Twenty-Six Counties?&rdquo; He replied: &ldquo;Indeed we are not.&rdquo; I referred to all the reports that had appeared in the papers recently about the matter, and he then said: &ldquo;Why should we join with the Twenty-Six Counties?  We have far more facilities, as farmers, in Northern Ireland.  I get 3/- to 3/6 per hundred more for my eggs than you get, because they are treated as home-produced eggs on the English market.  Your eggs have to be stamped before they are allowed in there.  Again, if I spend £100 on improvements, I get £75 of that from the Government.  I get at least as good a price for my cattle as you get, and, in addition, I get 7/6 per cwt. of a subsidy on top of that.  Why should we join with the Twenty-Six Counties?&rdquo; I mention this because the Government here frequently states that farmers in the Twenty-Six Counties are as well off as farmers in the other part of the country.  The Government should look into these matters, and should take into consideration the Bishops' Pastorals, which give some indication of the position of people in the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morrissey referred to the question of annuities.  I have been obliged to bring many cases in the last month before the Land Commission, in which people were asking to get time for the payment of these annuities.  No doubt I was met very fairly by the Land Commission, and in every case which I brought before them they gave time.  I must give them credit for that, but the fact that it was necessary to bring these cases before them at all shows the position of the people.  They are anxious to pay, but they are not able to pay.  The Government should take these facts into consideration and provide the help which is so urgently required by the farmers.  I am sorry to see that the amount of money provided for agriculture this year has been reduced.  That indicates that the Government does not intend to provide any further help for the farmers.  The Government have reduced the amount provided for agriculture, while they are increasing the amount provided for <Col N="1596" /> defence and other services.  It would be far better to build up the agricultural community.  That would be the best form of defence we could have in this country.</P>
    <P>If you have not your people well-fed and well-nourished, what good is your defence?  It is a sin and a shame to be spending millions on defence when you consider the position in which the farmers are at present.  There is another matter to which I should like to refer, if I am in order.  It is connected with insurance.  There is some order in force whereby if a man does not stamp his card for a year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Very well.  I wish to impress on the Minister for Finance the desirability of loosening his purse strings so far as the agricultural industry is concerned.  There has been a great deal of oratory at dinners and elsewhere in which it was accepted that agricultural industry is the main industry of our country.  I am glad that the Government have recognised that at last.  They made a mistake during the past five or six years when they omitted to recognise it.  Let the Government practise what they preach, and loosen their purse strings for the benefit of the farmers.  I invite any Fianna Fáil Deputy who represents an agricultural constituency to stand up and ask the Minister for Finance to contribute to the improvement of the farming industry.  If the agricultural industry goes down, the country will go down, and it is going down fast at present.</P>

      <P>I suppose it will be taken that I stand up as a result of the invitation extended from the Opposition back benches by the last two speakers.  While I was interested in the speeches from one angle, I should be much more interested if I had heard any suggestion from start to finish as to how conditions were to be improved.  There was not one word from Opposition speakers as to how that could be done.  The Government was blamed even for the weather. <Col N="1597" /> How can they control the weather? They were blamed about the position of the agricultural industry, but what about world depression?  Does the Government control the whole world, or only this island?  It was suggested indirectly that we could improve prices here if we could surrender the national freedom we have got in the Twenty-Six Counties.  I do not think that many people would stand for that surrender in order to get better prices. I heard, with feelings of regret, the complaints of these two Deputies about the number of times they have to go to the Land Commission on behalf of people who are not able to pay their annuities.  The foundation of the nonpayment of land annuities commenced with the Blueshirt organisation, and we have the reactions of it still.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Victory</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to go occasionally to the Land Commission and, if the path there is beaten, I know where that started.  I know that people in this country were led to believe that by standing out they would never have to pay.  When this Government came in, they, owing to the pressure of the economic war, funded the arrears of annuities for three years and halved the standard annuities.  As a result of the preaching of the Blueshirt organisation, these people thought they would get away with another funding. That is what brought the present position about.  I am ready to admit, with Deputies from agricultural constituencies on the opposite side, that 75 per cent. of the wealth of the country comes from agriculture and that, if this country is to improve, the improvement must come from agriculture.  On that point, I am with them.  Will they tell me what they would do to improve <Col N="1598" /> on the proposed drainage scheme or as regards the Agricultural Commission? Has this Government, since it came into office, not tried to guarantee the price of milk?  I suppose that accounts for the complaint made by Deputy Fagan that there are so many cattle in the country now.  That was an encouragement to the people to keep the cows.  The price of cows was such that farmers were parting with them and the Minister had to improve the price of butter in order to induce them to keep the cows.  Now, the Government is criticised about the price of butter.  Will the Opposition tell us if they are prepared to do away with the guaranteed prices for pigs and bacon. They find fault with the boards.  It is easier to find fault than to discover a better way of doing things.  Will a single Deputy advocate free trade in that case and no subsidies in respect of exports?  These are the things which should concern Deputies instead of finding fault with the weather.</P>
      <P>What we want to see brought about is something that will improve conditions and the question is how far will you go in that direction without making the cost of living prohibitive to town dwellers.  I heard one suggestion from Deputy Brennan with which I agreed.  He talked about subsidising artificial manures and said it would be a good investment if the Government could see their way to pay half the price of artificial manures. I agree with that suggestion of Deputy Brennan because the agricultural community would be producing more, we would have better-fed cattle and, as a result of our increased export trade, we would have more money coming in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was as a result of the invitation I received that I got up.  I now extend that invitation to the Opposition. There are Deputies here more interested in farming, perhaps, than I am, but I live by farming.  There are farmers in a bad way&mdash;particularly those farmers who have bad land. The farmers with good land are not in as bad a position as those who have low-lying land which is half-swamped. I ask the Opposition to give us their help to improve conditions, whether through guaranteed prices for pigs and <Col N="1599" /> bacon, through subsidising dairy produce, through drainage schemes or the Agricultural Commission.  These are the points on which the nation should be built up.  If agriculture represents 75 per cent. of the wealth of the country, we must begin at the bottom and build it up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate on unemployment in relation to agriculture is one that must attract the interest of every member of this House, whether he is an agriculturist or whether he lives in an urban area.  It is extraordinary that the assertions as to the prosperity of agriculture come from members who live in urban areas and who, probably, know nothing at all about agriculture.  The shopkeepers in the urban areas have disastrous proof of the condition of agriculture. The number of farmers who have had to get rid of their men simply because they are unable to pay them is also another proof of the condition of agriculture. The books of the shopkeepers show the debts due by farmers which they are not able to reduce, and if the shopkeepers took drastic action it would simply put the agriculturists out of operation.  I have seen large farmers who are gradually laying their land down to grass because of the present system.  Both in regard to wages and costs of production, as well as in every other item of expenditure, even rates on the land, they are not able to make ends meet.  Some of them are in a very serious financial position, and the banks could tell a tale.  Many of those banks are willing to compound for large debts, which are due by the agricultural community, because the people have no means whatever of reducing those debts even when drastic measures are taken.  The Government must take a serious view of the unstocked lands of this country, and provide the farmers with the means of restocking those lands.  That is one of the directions in which the Agricultural Commission would be able to bring relief to the agriculturists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The high cost of manures, the high costs of food stuffs, the high costs of agricultural implements, the high costs in every direction where the farmer <Col N="1600" /> has to expend money, have a tendency to put him completely out of commission, because they reduce his capacity to give employment.  The first thing on which the farmer economises is the labour on his land.  For that reason, those who have made the interests of labour their special care must take the position seriously, and try to devise means and advise the Government as to how best the farmer can be put in a position to continue employing labour on the land.  Once the peasantry go down, it is impossible to bring them back to the land.  We hear a lot about the employment on the land, and members opposite have deplored the fact that it is not as good as it should be. They have asked for advice as to how best to relieve the agricultural community. One of the best methods of relieving the agricultural community, after they have been given the means of stocking their land, is to reduce their costs of production; reduce the outlay which they have to make in order to keep their farms in a proper economic condition.  Those are the first considerations.  Every item of expenditure has been increased due to taxation, whether it is taxation from the national point of view or taxation for local services.  In County Cork this year our levy will exceed £500,000 after all the reliefs of the rates by way of agricultural grants have been given. That is the highest figure which has yet been levied, and it is one which must be seriously considered by those who represent the people, no matter on what side of the House they may be.</P>
    <P>We speak about the unemployed in rural areas, but when we remember that there is continual emigration from this country across the Channel, and the greatest desire to take up employment in England, then we must wonder why it is that the unemployment figure still exceeds the 100,000 mark.  I think it has now reached 105,000.  Must not that be a matter for serious consideration by the Government, when they see that, in spite of their efforts to reduce it, it still remains at a figure which it should not have reached in this country while the tide of emigration still goes on.  That is simply because the agricultural community are not <Col N="1601" /> able to employ on the land the number for which they at one time found employment.  We have schemes for beet and schemes for tillage, but the beet area is rapidly going down, and it is questionable whether the factories will be able to get an acreage that will enable them to keep an economic production. Those are facts which have to be taken into consideration.  I say that even the large farmers are so financially depressed that they cannot continue employing men on the land. They either have to lay it down for grass or offer it to the Land Commission to divide up among the landless men.</P>
    <P>The increased cost of living is another factor which is seriously crippling the agricultural community.  That factor is crippling to the big farmer, but it is more crippling to the small farmer.  Perhaps the best means of helping the small agriculturist would be to bring down the cost of living, because where he has a large family that is the most crippling burden which he has to bear, but there are other matters, such as costs of production and various other expenses, with which the agriculturist has to contend.  Perhaps, with the exception of the new-milk vendor&mdash;whom I can characterise as in a protected industry&mdash;there is no agriculturist to-day who can be said to be in a prosperous condition, or even to be able to pay his way.  Every shopkeeper you meet has the same tale&mdash; that he is unable to cope with the present state of affairs.  Those shop keepers are really in as bad a position as the agriculturists.  They are in the position that they cannot give any more credit.  When the shopkeeper cannot carry on, when the farmer cannot give employment and is not able to maintain his farm in active production, then definitely that will react on the position of the workers as well.  If the agriculturists and the business community are hit so hard that they are not able to carry on the normal trade of the country, then, surely to goodness, the workers are also going to be hard hit in consequence of that fact.</P>
    <P>We have 12,000,000 acres of arable land in this country.  Would I be right in saying that half of that land is not in production to-day?  I think I might <Col N="1602" /> venture to say that 5,000,000 or 6,000,000 acres of the tillage land of this country have been run out through over-cropping, and that the farmer has not the means to restore them to fertility. Those are factors which we have to take into consideration.  They are an indication of the serious position in which the farmer has been placed.  To maintain our population in this country, emigration had to be stopped. If emigration to England is to go on, and unemployment is still to continue at the same rate as for the past few years, then surely unemployment on the land is increasing, and the only way to stop it is to restore to the agricultural community something like their former prosperity.  You can do that by giving help in the form of loans, by reducing the costings of agricultural production, and also by helping to reduce rates on agricultural land.  These three things would do a lot to relieve unemployment, by enabling farmers to keep labour on the land, because the first thing farmers will do when they have to reduce expenditure is to reduce the amount of labour on their holdings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. M.J. Kennedy Mr. M.J. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been an appeal from both sides of the House for co-operation, in an endeavour to relieve whatever distress exists amongst the farming community. Deputy Brasier dealt with one aspect of the difficulties of the farming community, their bank debts.  He said that many banks were willing to make a composition with regard to these debts. If there is to be co-operation, here is one aspect of farming on which we could all agree.  In every country that I know of in Europe there has been a liquidation of debts.  There has been a Government direction to the banking institutes in these countries to liquidate these debts.  Farmers, like every other section of the community, do not like to indicate to public representatives, or to anybody else, the burdens they are under as regards mortgages on their farms.  Very often the interest charged on these mortgages is greater than the rates and annuities.  Very often, because of these charges, farms have been denuded of stock year after year, until we have a spectacle, which did not arise out of the economic war, but was there long before it, all over Leinster, <Col N="1603" /> in East Connaught, and in part of Munster, of derelict large-sized farms not employing any labour and not carrying any stock.  If we are to have co-operation let there be a national indication to these credit institutions that it is time, a quarter of a century after some of these debts were originally contracted, that there should be a cleaning of the slate.  That will not hurt the stability of these institutions, but it will put land and people into production that have been for a long time out of production.</P>
      <P>The trend of the debate has also been about cattle, the price expected for cattle when the economic war ended, and the price now being realised.  One thing stands out, that the tillage policy of the Government has been absolutely right; that the more subsidised tillage we have the better.  If a great conflict should break out in Europe, the first consideration of this Government, even long before it did break out, should be the sustenance of the human beings that compose this nation, and not the wealth of certain individuals.  The sustenance of the people and food supplies should be the Government's first consideration.  People cannot live without meat, without cereals or vegetables; consequently, it is necessary, as part of our economy, to see that there is enough food here to feed our own population.  The farmer who carries on a mixed economy, who goes in for some tillage as well as live stock production, is on the right lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I live in the country and I know that live stock are a necessary complement to farming.  The farmer who went in for mixed farming stood up best against the economic war.  He was the least hit, and the best able to resist the effects.  Now when prices are fluctuating, and when those who shout most about our dependence on England for our cattle trade are beginning to realise that it is not the Alpha and Omega of our agricultural economy they thought it was, they are awakening to the fact that prices can soar to a point, but that then a point of saturation can be reached, when they will be competing with cattle from the Argentine and the rest of the world, and that English industrialists, miners, <Col N="1604" /> and the rest will only pay up to a certain point.  Consequently, in the Dublin cattle market last week there was a marked drop in the price per cwt. compared with the previous week. I come from a constituency that depends more than most constituencies on the rearing of live stock.  People were told that when March came the price of beef would go to £3 a cwt. but, as a matter of fact, it has to compete with world prices in the markets on the other side.</P>
    <P>The farmer with a mixed economy, who is not really depending on the rearing of live stock is best off.  That policy is also best for the nation.  The Government have been wise in their policy of subsidising tillage.  Admittedly we had a very bad year, and a very bad harvest, but that is no reason why people should go out of tillage.  A bad year should not drive people to give up the production of beet and wheat.  The trend in the past was as cattle production increased, the human population declined.  We could have a state of things here when we could have estancias as large as counties, with a major-domo on horseback, and three or four men, responsible for the exportation of cattle worth millions of pounds, just as Ireland was immensely wealthy at a time when she was sending food across to England while, at the same time, 1,000,000 people died of hunger in the ditches. Give me at any time Gibbstown, County Meath, with houses, families, and shelter, in preference to one of these huge ranches that we hear of.  I would have Gibbstown at any time in preference to the economy advocated by those who believe that all our wealth depends on how much cattle we can produce.  The Government are on the right track.  Admittedly, we had a very bad harvest, especially coming on top of the economic war, but the Government are directing the ship in the right way, and let them keep at it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested in the last Deputy's speech.  It is to me a satisfaction to learn that a number of Deputies in the Government Party have come to advocate the agricultural husbandry recommended by the late Minister for Agriculture, one more cow, <Col N="1605" /> one more sow, and one more acre of tillage&mdash;mixed farming.  That was the policy always advocated from these benches.  There came a time when, from the Government Benches, was launched a reversal of that policy, for intensive tillage.  Evidently, there is now a belated attempt to get a little bit away from that policy.  However, in regard to this particular Vote on Account, what I am particularly interested in is the lack on the part of the Minister to provide additional funds for agriculture.  Deputy Victory, in his short speech, levelled the accusation at us that, while we admitted, and while he and everybody else admitted that agriculture is not in a good condition, we do not offer any particular remedy.  The remedy may be difficult to find, but desperate diseases require desperate remedies and that there is a desperate disease in agriculture at the moment nobody denies, either on this side or the other side. We may offer solutions for its recovery. They probably would not be accepted if we did.  It is the duty of the Government in office to provide the remedy if, as I say, they are satisfied that there is a desperate disease, as there is.  If there is a desperate situation in any other line, if, for instance, there is a desperate fear that this country is going to be in, I do not say immediate, but ultimate danger of war or anything else, the Government gets active in preparations for that ultimate danger.  There is no speech then from the Government side of the House to say who will provide the remedy or where the remedy will come from.  The money is forthcoming.  There is at the moment a fear that this country may be mixed up within the next few years in a war.  I hope there is no immediate possibility but there is a fear that we may be mixed up in a war.  Most of us hope not.  Most of us believe not, but, anyhow, the fear is there and this Government has no hesitation in asking us to spend, within the next 17 or 18 months, £6,000,000 or £7,000,000 to protect this country.  This country needs protection.  We do not deny it. But it is a question of what can be done if the will is there and if the need is there and what must be done if the need is there.  If there is a duty to <Col N="1606" /> protect the citizens of the country from a possible war, it is certainly, beyond yea or nay, the duty of the Government to protect the bulk of the people of this country engaged in a particular occupation from extinction.  That is what the people of this country are rapidly coming to.  Farming is no longer popular or profitable.  People are fleeing from the land everywhere. Why should they not?  It is not a nice job at any time.  It is a particularly desperate job when you are up against it and when your back is to the wall.</P>
      <P>What is the situation?  None of us say that agriculture is in a good position, or that it was in a good position even before this Government came into office, or for years before that.  It is in a worse position now, admittedly. Farmers' receipts are much less than they were ten years ago.  I was interested in comparing receipts of my creamery at home ten years ago and now, and I find that where £26,000 or £27,000 came into that particular village in milk receipts ten years ago, it has dwindled down to £16,000 now.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>For various reasons. World prices may have reduced.  There may be other reasons.  I am not dealing with that.  I am making this point: that so much less money came in when, even if the same amount came in as did come then, it would not suffice to put me or any other farmer in the same position that he was in ten years ago. Not alone does he suffer from a fall in prices, but he suffers, just as every other member of the community suffers, from the increased cost of the essential commodities of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What do we find, looking over the particular Estimates, receipts and other things?  At this moment we have collected in customs in this small State something approaching £10,000,000&mdash; practically £10,000,000 in customs alone.  Remember that when we were governed by a foreign Government, that amount sufficed to run this part of the State.  The amount that is now collected in customs sufficed to run this three-quarters of a State, and we were over-taxed, admittedly.  Our argument was that we were over-taxed <Col N="1607" /> when this country was run for the amount collected in customs alone now.</P>
    <P>The farmer is insolvent.  There are not 10 per cent. of the farmers of this country at the moment that are in anything approaching solvency.  They have nowhere to turn.  We have Deputies one after the other saying that they had to go to the Land Commission to make appeals for farmers, and the Land Commission are sympathetic and willing to give help.  It is no use putting a thing on the long finger if, when you come to the end of the finger, there is no more hope than what you had in the beginning.  That is our position. The average farmer is insolvent.  He has nowhere to turn to get a ha'penny or a penny.  He could not borrow a penny from any source.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Even at the moment, if there was such a thing as a solvent farmer, still he has no credit.  The Government has taken away his credit and any hope of credit he had.  In the time of the previous Government, when he was not altogether insolvent and perhaps not too solvent either, he could borrow.  He cannot now.  Even a man that approaches solvency cannot borrow now.  I had a case last week of a farmer, one of the few farmers I know of in this country approaching solvency, and he is approaching solvency because he has a family of eight or nine grown-up children working for him who should be earning wages and for whom no wages were put down.  This man made a success of his farm during 25 years because he had free labour.  It should not be free, but it was free.  About five years ago he purchased another farm for one of the children and another was married.  He was one of the few what I may call &ldquo;miracle workers&rdquo; in this country, who did all that in a few years and does not owe any man, bank or shopkeeper a penny. <Col N="1608" /> Here is his grievance.  He has six or seven children left and, being the careful farmer that he is, he wants to get a farm for one of the other children.  A farm in his immediate locality is offered for sale.  He has most of the money to purchase it and he wants to borrow a little.  One would have thought that, if there was any case in this country where a man engaged in agriculture could get money, it was this man and, on the credit of the farm which he worked for 25 years and made money, the credit of the farm that he purchased five years ago and a charge on the farm that he is going to buy and his stock-in-trade, he could not get any bank in this country to give him a couple of hundred pounds.  Then the Government state that there is credit for the farmer in this country.  There is neither hope nor credit.  He is no man's child.  He ought to be the Government's, but he is not.</P>
      <P>Somebody asks what is the reaction on employment.  Of course, the reaction is what anybody would expect. If the greatest industry in this country is in a desperate condition it must have an effect on employment, and it has.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>The other way around. The Deputy can argue that, if he likes, and if the Deputy wants any argument in that direction, it is this, that there was only one period, in my recollection, in this country when everybody was prosperous.  Only one, from my recollection, and I am an older man than the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>That is during the War.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>We will not mention the period.  But there was only one period in this country when everybody was prosperous and that was the one period when agriculture was prosperous. We had not the same number of factories then that we have now. There were no smoky chimneys or the munition factories we are going to have, but the old factories were working <Col N="1609" /> to the full and prospering and everybody else in this country prospered. There was no man unemployed who wanted to work and everybody was fairly happy.  I do not say we can resurrect that position with a stroke of the pen.</P>
      <P>We cannot, but every help we give to agriculture, at whatever cost, and it must be at a cost, is going to lead in that direction.  Where is the employment now?  As I said, there is no credit for farmers anywhere.  Possibly, if a farmer had more credit, he might employ more, and he might have some hope of surviving during a lean period, with hope for to-morrow, but he has not got it.  There is only one source of credit, in my county, anyhow, and that is a temporary loan from the creameries. They are sympathetic and they know the position.  They will lend money on a farmer's year's supply of milk.  I can mortgage my year's supply and they will give me the price of a cow, but there is no help in any other direction.</P>
      <P>As I said a moment ago, desperate diseases require desperate remedies. We can find, and we are finding, £7,000,000 to raise an army, and we can, and we should, find £7,000,000, £10,000,000, £20,000,000 or £50,000,000, and it would be well spent, to save the greatest army in this country, the agricultural army of farmers and workers. Any money spent in that direction would be well spent, and it needs must be spent, when, on the other side, we are building up barriers, partly with help from the Government, but mostly from the unfortunate consumers, in the way of tariffs to raise a small arm for this country.  We have been asked for suggestions and the Agricultural Commission is suggested as a way out.  It probably is a way out.  Everybody is glad it was set up, and when it reports eventually, it is going to be a help.</P>

I hope, even though the hope is not general, that something good will result from the investigation of our agricultural industry. I believe that something is bound to come out of it, because I believe it is impossible for any set of men to investigate the present set of circumstances without coming to the conclusion that something must be done in the way of relief.  It is not for me to anticipate what they are going to do, but it is going to take time.  We do not know when that report will come to us; we do not know how long afterwards it is going to take to put into effect whatever recommendations they offer.  If those recommendations are accepted, and legislation is brought in to give effect to them, it will take months, possibly years, and it will be too late for many.  There are thousands for whom it will be too late.  I repeat what I have said 100 times, and perhaps repetition is sometimes useful: We must not wait in a desperate situation; we must do it now and it should be done now.  I know that the Minister for Finance has a difficulty.  I know full well his difficulty as well as anybody else, and I should not like to be in his position.  He will have difficulty in finding £7,000,000 for the defence of the country, and he will have difficulty in finding £7,000,000 or £8,000,000 in defence of the agriculturists, who are much more important, but he could do it with the will and the Government behind him, and, in God's name, I ask him to try to do it.</P>

      <P>The Agricultural Commission was proposed as a cure by the Deputies opposite, and I then made the suggestion, and I believe with Deputy Bennett, that we will not get that cure until it is too late, namely, the economy of this country cut down to fit the agricultural community.  That is the only cure for it.  The outlook of the agricultural community has completely changed during the past 20 years, and I, for one, am glad of it.  I am very glad that there are now very few farmers of the type spoken of by Deputy Bennett&mdash;the farmer with seven, eight or nine children, who worked and slaved and toiled for no wages until they were 30 or 40 years of age, in order that every drone in the country might live on their sweat. That is what has happened.</P>
      <P>That is why the people are leaving the land.  The young farmers' sons of to-day are not prepared to work for nothing, and Jack and Tom, Mary and Kate, are not prepared to stay there until they are 45 or 50 years, and then get a £10 note and the emigrant ship. That is why they are leaving the land. What is the cure proposed by Deputies opposite for keeping anyone employed on the land?  Their shadow Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Dillon, gets up and condemns anything that gives employment on the land, anything that gives one hour's employment on the land, anything that would put a plough and a pair of horses to work.  There must not be any more wheat grown; the plough must stop.  There must not be any beet grown; that must stop, too.  The farmer must no longer be provided with a market for his oats and barley by the admixture scheme.  That has got to stop.  That is the policy outlined by Deputy Dillon for the agricultural community, and that is the policy he has stood over, morning, noon and night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1612" /> Farmers had, I would say, the worst year of their existence in the past 12 months.  This time 12 months the price of cattle jumped in expectation of the settlement, and the farmers in England who bought those cattle sold them for less than they paid for them.  The great English market, about which we heard so much, and to preserve which we were howled at for five or six years, was worth nothing to the Irish farmer. The price of cattle went steadily down from February of last year to October and November, and, from the reports I am getting of the position in regard to both pasture and feeding stuffs in England, I do not think the position is going to be much better this year.  If they are scared enough about a war, they will buy; if they are not, they will not.  The one objection I have to people speaking here for the agricultural community is this: that you have every separate type of farmers trying to cut other farmers' throats, and that does not exist in any other walk in life except the agricultural community alone.  You have the creamery man attacking the new milk farmer.  You have the grazing farmer attacking the tillage farmer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  I have heard it from those benches.  I am sorry for it, but the facts are there.  You have farmers getting up there complaining because another farmer gets a market for his oats and barley through the admixture scheme.  You have that complaint going on there.  It has come repeatedly, year after year from those benches, and I can recollect very easily your attitude and the position which you admitted did exist before the admixture scheme came in, when I saw thousands of barrels of barley down in Midleton that was unsaleable because there was nobody to buy it. You had the same with regard to white oats&mdash;unsaleable because there was nobody to buy that either.  Then we had one branch of farmers getting up here and attacking the other branch of farmers in order to kill that side of it and you had another bunch saying that there are farmers who cannot grow wheat and who cannot grow beet <Col N="1613" /> and asking why are the people of this country to be asked to pay for either wheat or beet.  That has been the position, and that has gathered up pluck enough in the Department of Finance to induce the Minister for Finance to get up and say &ldquo;Very well, we will not put any more on sugar, in order to provide a market for the farmers' beet.&rdquo; That has been the position&mdash;that there is no cohesion and no combination between the agricultural community in this country; none whatever.</P>
      <P>You want to know why people are leaving the land.  It is partly due to the industrial policy.  For instance, down in my constituency, you have the Cloyne Clay factory giving a certain amount of employment; you have the Carrigaline factory doubling or trebling the amount of employment it is giving; you have the waterproof factories giving double and treble the amount of employment; and you have the Blarney Mills employing once and a half the number they employed in 1932.  You have the flour mills giving whole-time and overtime employment now where formerly men were working for one, two and three days a week during the reign of the Party opposite when they were in office.  You have that change.  You have paid out in wages every week in the town of Cobh, which was a derelict town when we came into office, £1,500 a week to-day. You have that change there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally the farmer's son working out on the land for what Deputy Bennett justly called jaw-hire casts his eye around and says: &ldquo;I do not see why I should not get a couple of pounds or 50/- a week inside a factory as well as any of the Jackeens in the cities or the towns.&rdquo; He goes into the town, naturally, and he gets employment, and he can always get it or generally get it in preference to the man from the city or town because he is able to work.  That is what has happened, and if that condition of affairs is to be remedied in this country, you have got to get down to the position where your overheads in this country are going to compare in some way with your agricultural economy here.  You are not going to have a change in the position when <Col N="1614" /> you have Employment Acts being brought in here providing for an eight-hour day in certain jobs and a week's holidays with pay, and so on, while it is a case of a 24-hour day for the farmer.  You have to change that or else let the lad in the city, when he gets his fortnight's holiday, come and work on the farms, and let the farmer get his fortnight's holidays then&mdash;let it be turn about.</P>
    <P>I hear a lot of talk about the depression in agriculture.  I think it was Deputy Bennett who said that the only time the farmer here was prosperous was during the War.  Well, Deputy Cosgrave set up a commission in October of 1922, which was only a few years after the War, and that commission solemnly found that agriculture was in a very depressed condition. That was in 1922.</P>

You got £2,200,000 in relief on annuities; that is, roughly, £1,740,000 of a loan taken off the backs of the farmers as far as those overhead charges are concerned. That is more than one-third derating, but that is the position to-day.  If you take the reliefs given by halving the annuities, and take the extra burden of close on £500,000 increase in rates, one against the other.</P>

You have the farmers, after going through nearly the third time, finding themselves last year with a harvest practically unsaleable, and with cattle, from which they hoped a lot, that are unsaleable still, despite the fact that this Government handed over to you the great English market you were shouting about for the last five years.</P>

No Deputy should have a better knowledge of that than the Lord Mayor of Cork.

      <P>I do not wish to make an attack on any individual, but when the Lord Mayor of Cork challenged a statement I made I had to give a specific instance, of which nobody is better aware than the Lord Mayor.  I could keep quoting instances until 10.30. Deputy Brasier alluded to the derelict holdings.  The sooner the Land Commission get to work on these holdings and divide them up, the better for the community.  In parishes in my constituency you have 2,000, 3,000 and 4,000 acres of land lying practically derelict, on which families could be put and happy homes created.  There are as many superabundant officers in one Department as in another; they are tripping one another up.  Unfortunately, this State started on wrong lines.  It inherited its Civil Service from Great Britain.  It started off with a Civil Service that might suit a big wealthy industrial country like England, but not an agricultural country like this, where in the end the agricultural community have to pay the piper for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the position all over.  The only trouble I see is in this House, where the majority of Deputies representing rural constituencies and the agricultural community come along here echoing the cry of a few city Jackeens outside: &ldquo;Look at the price <Col N="1617" /> of sugar; look at the price of bread.&rdquo; You have the tax cry started by Deputies here who should not support it.  If we have to pay, as we have, something extra for our agricultural machinery in order to give employment to Irish people in Ireland, something extra for our artificial manures in order to give employment here, something extra for our boots and clothes in order that employment might be given here for Irish people, I am in favour of it.  I am quite satisfied with it; but I also say that the agricultural labourers and the farmers are entitled to a fair price for their produce, let it be got where it will.  You cannot, on the one hand, have the man in the factory with £3 10s. 0d. per week and an 8-hour day, and the labourer on the farm with 5d. per hour and a 10-hour day, or, in the case of the farmers and the farmers' sons, a 24-hour day.</P>

If the beet factories get anything like sufficient beet this year, the only reason they will get it is that you have still a number of farmers who believe in making their sons and daughters slave in order that certain drones might fatten out of their sweat.  I say that openly, and with full knowledge of the costings of the beet industry.  Unfortunately, the position is that everybody can be sure of his dividend except the farmer. The farmer is not going to be sure of anything, and that is because of want of cohesion and loyalty amongst the agriculturists themselves.</P>

      <P>I have seen different chances, as the Deputy put it, given here.  The Deputy is not too long here. I am only about 12½ years here, and I have seen five different Farmers' Parties coming here, and each one of them sold out.  The last bunch of them sold out for nothing at all.  Eleven votes in exchange for a shadow Minister.  Those before them got something, <Col N="1618" /> but the last bunch only got a shadow.  At every election until the last election you had a Farmers' Party going up for election.  Then they were collected together&mdash;five or six or seven of them&mdash;and they said: &ldquo;How much, a job lot going cheap?&rdquo; A job lot going cheaply.  Parliamentary Secretary for Posts and Poles! A mark of appreciation ! That unfortunately was the position and that is the position to-day amongst the representatives of the agricultural community.  The man who is in the livestock business, the farmer who is depending largely on live stock for his living does not want anything given to the man who is engaged in tillage. The farmer who is engaged in tillage does not want the live stock farmer to get anything in the way of subsidy. It is a case of Peter robbing Paul and Paul robbing Peter.  The people in the towns, the factory workers and the industrialists are getting all the benefit. That is the position for the man in the country and unfortunately it is a pitiable position.  I hope that Opposition Deputies and Deputies in all parts of the House will note this and take it seriously.  If the agricultural community is ever going to get beyond being hewers of wood and drawers of water they will have to come together, work together and fight together.</P>

You are not going to get ahead that way.  There are Deputies on the Opposition Benches, like Deputy Brasier, who see their constituents being robbed by the policy preached by Deputy Dillon.  Yet they sit dumb behind him; they are far more to blame than Deputy Dillon himself. The constituency that Deputy Brasier and I have the honour to represent in this House is a highly-rated constituency.  The land there is carrying a valuation of 30/- to £2 an acre. <Col N="1619" /> That land was valued as wheat-growing land.  Now we are going to have the position there that the beet price is bared to the bone.  That is the policy that is advocated morning, noon and night in this House by Deputy Dillon, the shadow Minister for Agriculture. Are we to have the wheat policy battered out of existence by Deputy Dillon, morning noon and night, attacking it here and misrepresenting it?  Remember it was on the wheat policy and on the wheat-growing capacity of our land that our lands were valued under Griffith's valuation. Are we to have the market for our wheat, oats and barley wiped out of existence by the shadow Minister for Agriculture coming along here and dinning into our ears morning noon and night everything he can think of about the only policy that can give employment on the land and a living to our agriculturists?  The sad part of it is that Deputies who know that Deputy Dillon is wrong back him out.  In these circumstances I think there can be very little hope for agriculture in this country.</P>

      <P>To my mind the only way in which we can help the farmer is by enabling him to reduce the cost of production.  The way to help the people in the country is to reduce the cost of living.  We hear a great deal about the Pig Marketing Board.  The fact is that every man who is feeding pigs knows quite well that it is the bacon curer who is getting all the profit.  On the one hand the producer is being driven out of existence and on the other hand the consumer is robbed.  We hear a lot about wheat-growing. Now as a practical farmer I advise every man whose land is suitable for wheat-growing to grow wheat.  But let us have protection.  Do not ask the farmer to produce wheat for the sake of enriching the millers. Deputy Victory told us that there would be no question of annuities but for the Blueshirts.  Does the Deputy remember that during the first years of the economic war there was an embargo of £6 a head on fat cattle, 10/- a head on lambs, and so on with everything else produced on the farm? <Col N="1620" /> We have been hearing a lot of talk about the price of cattle here and the price of cattle in England.  Anyone reading the reports in the Press of the British markets will see that first rate cattle in England are making 42/- a cwt. while in the Dublin market they are making 41/-.</P>
      <P>Some Fianna Fáil Deputies ask how cattle can be sent to England at 1/- a cwt.  I will tell them how it is done. The British Minister for Agriculture has given the British farmer a bounty of 7/6 a cwt. on those cattle.  That brings the price of the English cattle to 49/- a cwt.  We farmers in this country who feed cattle have to sell at 41/- and we have to compete with the people who are getting 49/- a cwt. Other Deputies and I have repeatedly asked the Minister for Agriculture to give our farmers a bounty on stall-fed cattle.  His answer to us was that the Minister for Finance would not agree. It is impossible to carry on tillage in this country and give employment if we have to compete against a man in England who is able to buy store cattle here, stall-feed them in England and get a substantial bounty of 7/6 a cwt. on them.  We in this country have been asking to be put on a level with the English farmer.</P>
      <P>The biggest mistake either the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Agriculture made was their refusal to encourage tillage farmers to feed more cattle.  If the Government were to give this subsidy or protection to the farmer who stall-feeds his cattle they would be doing the best day's work they ever did for the country.  It would be the best possible way of helping tillage.  What they are doing now is driving people off the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear a great deal about people flying from the land.  I ask people who complain of this how do they expect that agricultural workers should slave on the land, trying to live on a miserable, paltry wage?  Why should the farmer's wife and his sons and daughters be asked to work for no wage?  Surely the time is overdue when the Government ought to waken up to the fact that if they wish to keep the people on the land they should encourage the agricultural workers. They ought to give the farmer an <Col N="1621" /> opportunity of being able to make a living wage for himself and his family. Let the Government do something to reduce the cost of living so that the married worker who is drawing 14/- a week and his board, will find that when he takes that 14/- home, it will buy him 14/- worth of food and other necessaries of life.  At the present moment, with the cost of living as it is, that 14/- is scarcely worth 7/-.  The man who is really facing the hardest problem to-day is the man who is trying to rear a family on 14/- a week.  I know that some of those people who write to the Press deploring the fact that people are flying from the land, and advocating staying on the land, would not themselves care to stay on the land in the circumstances with which the agricultural workers are faced to-day.  The majority of those people who talk about the flight from the land are people who themselves left the land.  It is time that the Government should waken up and give the farmer an opportunity of making a living out of the land.</P>
    <P>We have been told a great deal about the Land Commission collecting only half the annuities.  Well, according to the case made by the Taoiseach against the British, the farmer owed no annuities.  The Taoiseach at one time said that we owed no annuities to England.  If the annuities are not owed to England, then surely they are not owed to anybody, and they should not be collected from the farmer.  That is all I have to say on this matter.  There has been plenty of talk on it already. We have just listened to a speech from Deputy Corry, but we take no notice of him.</P>

      <P>There is one thing I appreciate highly and that is the patience of An Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle in listening to long speeches.  I would like to see the day when Deputies' speeches would be shortened. I have listened to the points made by the various speakers.  I say that the problem is not so much to find work for the unemployed but the distribution of the goods that we can produce in abundance.  These goods should be distributed to those who need them. Deputy Bennett told us that the most <Col N="1622" /> prosperous period in this country was the period during the Great War.  That was the time when 8,000,000 people were engaged in destruction.  And the Deputy says that was the most prosperous period in our time.  Well, that is a poor commentary on the peace period.  If we could have prosperity during a period when you had over 8,000,000 people engaged in destruction, how much more reasonable is it to expect prosperity in a country when there is no war?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not contradict me, so that I take it he agreed with me.  What was the condition of the poor during the Great War, and since? If Deputies take the trouble to look up the records they will find that infant mortality amongst the poorer classes reached its lowest figure during the period of the Great War.  That applied to the whole country.  It was only last week that I read the report in the newspapers of a statement made by the president of a medical society in Dublin about the condition of the poor in this city.  He referred to the fact that there were 50 expectant mothers under supervision for some time, and that during that period all they had was 3/- a week.  That was their only income to enable them to get food. That gives one an idea of the conditions here.  That doctor said that he would keep harping on the matter with a view to making the public conscience uneasy.  It is matters of that kind that we should be giving attention to, and not wasting time talking on the merits or demerits of the economic war.  The sooner we forget about it the better for the country and for the people who sent us here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, when speaking the other day, referred to his recent visit to Australia and New Zealand.  He referred to the fact that the unemployed in Australia received so much per week, together with a maintenance allowance of 5/- a week for each child in the family.  He pointed out that if the unemployed in those countries were left without the means of getting <Col N="1623" /> decent sustenance they would think it a most unchristian thing, and yet the Deputy, with that experience before him, threw up his hands and admitted that he had no solution for the unemployment problem here.  In Australia, over the past 20 years, they have had such a thing as a minimum wage of £4 5s. 0d. a week for workers, with a family allowance of 5/- for each child up to the number of five.  In New Zealand, agricultural labourers have a wage of £3 a week, with a month's holidays in the year.  Deputy Dillon finished up by saying that he did not know how a man, his wife and five children could live on 29/- a week.  I want to suggest to him that a man in receipt of 27/- a week who has to support a wife and family is not living; he is merely existing.  How could anyone expect a man with a wife and five children to live on 27/- a week; but while that is so, what must be the position of the man who has a family of six, eight or eleven children and who is getting no assistance from the State?</P>
    <P>These are the matters that should be engaging the attention of Deputies, instead of spending their time trying to score debating points off one another.  I listened to Deputy Childers speak about the condition in the rural districts.  He seemed to think that everything was all right and that there was no financial distress.  I would advise young men like him to try living on 27/- a week either in a rural area or in cities like Dublin and Cork.  If he had the experience of trying to support a wife and six or seven children on that wage he would not be so complacent about conditions in the country.  I think if he had such an experience that the views he expressed here the other night would get a bad shattering.  Deputy Kennedy, who spoke this evening, seemed to be of the opinion that, if the banks liquidated the debts that farmers entered into about 25 years ago, things would be all right.  I want to suggest seriously to the House that we may talk as much as we like here about conditions in the country, about unemployment and all the rest, and that we are never likely to get very far until <Col N="1624" /> the Government takes over control of the monetary system of the country. The cry is raised here day after day: &ldquo;Let the Minister for Finance open his purse and give money here and there for this and for that&rdquo;.  My feeling about the matter is that the Minister for Finance and the Government as a whole are powerless to give money to anybody at the present time because they have not control over the credit or monetary system of the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Victory spoke this evening, and as I listened to him I felt that he was really sincere and honest in trying to find a solution for the difficulties that confront us.  He talked about world depression.  I think that the solution that I have put forward is the only one that will bring about a real change for the better.</P>
    <P>Why is it that we have so many unemployed, so many thousands living on a miserable pittance in the form of home assistance?  The number, I think, is about 98,000.  In addition, we have about 104,000 unemployed.  Why is it that we are not able to provide all our people with a sufficiency of the necessaries of life?  In my opinion, all the ills we suffer from are due to the fact that we do not control the credit and monetary system of the country.  I have some knowledge myself of the condition of the farmers.  In my early days I lived on a farm, and during the last 25 years I have been brought into close contact with the condition of the working classes.  I know how they are striving to exist.  I am afraid that enough consideration is not given to the serious problems that confront us in this House.  Too much time is devoted to the things that do not really matter. Speaking for my colleagues, I want to say that we are prepared to give 100 per cent. co-operation to this or any other Government that will make a real attempt to solve the problems that I have referred to.  But I want to say again, that unless the solution that I propose is adopted by the Government, we are not likely to achieve very much in the way of practical results.</P>
    <P>The only solution that Deputy Corry had to offer for overcoming our present difficulties was to wipe out most of the <Col N="1625" /> civil servants.  That, surely, was treating the thing too lightly.  I have not had very much experience of civil servants, but from what I know of them they do their work conscientiously and well.  I do not think it is fair to suggest that the civil servants are responsible for any shortcomings that there may be.  In conclusion, I want to say that, instead of wasting time in this House trying to score points over one another for political purposes, Deputies should apply themselves seriously to the problems that confront the country.  In my opinion, good results would be achieved if they did so on the lines I have indicated, and if we had control of the credit and currency of the country.</P>

      <P>I do not know if the method suggested by Deputy Hickey would solve our problems.  It would not be the simple matter that he seemed to think.  Many Governments who had control of their monetary systems and tried the expedients Deputy Hickey has in mind, viz., inflation, found that they manufactured, or produced too much currency.</P>

      <P>I can name France, Germany and America at one time and there were other countries as well that tried that expedient.  What happened? The first people who were up against it were the labour people.  They cried out that under it the cost of living had gone up so much that the £ was only worth 5/- to them.  In my opinion the people who would gain most in the first instance from a depreciation of the currency would be the farmers, but I am firmly convinced that in the long run, nobody would gain.  I am also of the opinion that the first people to cry out against it would be labour.  It would be easy, of course, to produce paper pound notes, but Labour would soon find, if there was any depreciation of the currency, that the pound note under the old system was about three times less valuable under the new system.  They would cry out against that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>What is wrong with the Deputy?  He has been talking a lot about currency and credit.  In my opinion we need not waste much time in discussing that problem because the people of this country have sense enough to know what tampering with the currency means, and would lead to. Personally, I do not believe it is going to cause much trouble, because some time ago the British £ was on a gold standard and now it is worth only 11/6 and still, looking at it from the farmers' point of view, we are no better off.  If you examine the amount of production in this country you will find that we are consuming twice as much as we are producing and the fact is that the balance of trade is against us.  I think the Deputy should know that.  If you go back to the £, and if you put it on the sovereign basis, the position would be that for the farmers it would reduce prices nearly to half, so that you cannot interfere with the currency, because you upset everything.</P>
      <P>The first trouble came when the Great War started.  We then had an inflation period: prices soared, the cost of production soared, everything soared.  When things got back to normal, the prices of agricultural produce dropped until they were less than pre-War.  Even at the present time, when the economic war is settled, the price of agricultural produce is less than 110 as compared with 100 in 1913. While the price of agricultural produce is almost down to the 1913 level, the cost of production is 200.  That means that the cost of production is actually doubled.  The position in regard to those engaged in agriculture, our principal industry, is that whereas their gross income is increased by about 10 per cent. as compared with 1913&mdash;at the outside it may be increased by 10 per cent.&mdash;their net income is less by the difference between 110 and 200.  That means that the net income is affected by the 90 per cent. in regard to the cost of production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me compare the position of farmers with other classes in the State. Other classes have had their salaries increased in order to keep pace with the increase in the cost of living.  Take <Col N="1627" /> the civil servant as an example.  The bonus of civil servants is fixed upon the increase in the cost of living.  Let me take the average increase given to those civil servants whose position would be comparable to that of the average farmer.  The increase this type of civil servant is getting in the shape of a bonus is something like 70 per cent.  Instead of the farmer getting an increase of 70 per cent. in his net income he has lost to the extent of 90 per cent, on the cost of production. Suppose the cost of production in pre-War times represented 40 per cent. of value of produce that would mean 60 per cent. was profit.  By doubling the 40 per cent. it would bring the figure slightly above 73 per cent. on present cost of production so that the profit or the net income is only 27 per cent. on the whole.</P>
    <P>The fact is that the farmer's income as compared with pre-War has been reduced from 60 per cent. of the total value of his produce to 27 per cent., slightly less than half.  While the income has been reduced to less than half, the cost of living has gone up by 70 per cent.  That is the difficulty in which the farmer is placed.  I do not say it was the economic war that caused that position.  It was the Great War put the first misfortune upon the farmer, the Great War with the resulting inflation and the high cost of living. When costs went up they remained up, but the price of agricultural produce went back to the pre-War level.  There is a bigger difficulty in solving this problem than most people imagine. You have also to consider in relation to this matter, the policy that was put into operation in this country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>In order to relieve unemployment the Government imposed tariffs mountains high.  These tariffs were, no doubt, put on with the best intentions, to create employment, but they had the effect of raising the cost of living, and the wages of the agricultural labourer had to be increased or else he could not live.  Then <Col N="1628" /> the farmer was fleeced by the increased cost of living, because he had to provide for himself and his family, Increases were added to the rates, everything else went up and the farmers were unable to employ men and pay them the increased wages, or pay them any wages, in fact.  That is a very serious difficulty.</P>
      <P>I am glad to see Deputy Corry and Deputy Victory and others are beginning to realise these difficulties and are anxious to do something to help the agricultural community and keep the people on the land.  There is no difference between us as to the end we have in view, but there is a great difference as to the means to attain that end.  Deputy Corry was rather critical about Deputy Dillon's view with regard to the growing of certain crops.  I agree in this instance with Deputy Dillon, although I agree with Deputy Corry in a good many other things.  I agree with Deputy Dillon's view in relation to some of these schemes&mdash;wheat and beet for instance, and petrol and light oils.  I do not approve of these schemes.  The farmers are supposed to be getting millions in connection with these things.  What is the use of wasting the taxpayers' money if it does not bring benefit to the farmers?  The average farmer does not get any benefit from them.  Some of the farmers are losing by the schemes.</P>
      <P>Certain individuals and certain districts may be getting a small benefit. The fact that the benefit is small is proved by the failure of these schemes in most places.  They have proved a costly failure.  At the end of six or seven years we have still only about half enough wheat grown.  Is that not proof that the scheme is a failure?  I think it is costing the consumers and the taxpayers something like £4,500,000 because of the increased cost of flour and the increased taxation in order to subsidise the growing of wheat.</P>
