      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle (for Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will require the Prices Commission to investigate the prices charged for bacon, including hams and gammons, by firms manufacturing or producing such commodity in Éire with special reference to the year 1938; and whether he will indicate, as a supplement to the report (P. No. 3472) already published, if combination for interference with trade competition in the bacon industry still continues, and the extent of the excessive profits taken by curers in that year; and whether the curers comprising the Pigs Marketing Board are still utilising their powers so as to promote curers' interests.</P>

      <P>That a sum not exceeding £2,402 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1940, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Secretary to the President, and for certain other expenses of the President's Esablishment (No. 24 of 1938).</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Flinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate for 1938-39 was £4,048, and for 1939-40 it is £3,602, being a decrease of £446.  Under the Constitution provision is made for the President to receive such emoluments and allowances as may be determined by law.  These emoluments and allowances are charged upon the Central Fund.  In the Vote for the President's Establishment, provision is made for what may be described as the Civil Service side of the President's Establishment&mdash;that is for the salaries and expenses of the office of the Secretary to the President&mdash; together with certain minor and petty expenses and certain capital expenditure which are estimated at £3,602 in all.  The decrease of £446 in the total Estimate is attributable to the reduced provision required in connection with motor car accommodation for the President&mdash;sub-head E&mdash;and to reduction in the sums provided under sub-heads B, C and D.  The total of these reductions, £1,200, is offset by an increase of £754 under sub-head A. Under sub-head A&mdash;Salaries, Wages and Allowances&mdash;provision is made for the Secretary to the President.  This <Col N="486" /> officer's appointment dates from the 29th December, 1937.  A scale of salary has not been fixed for the post, but the present holder has a personal scale of £1,000 &mdash; £50 &mdash; £1,200, plus bonus.</P>
      <P>Sub-head B has to do with travelling expenses.  The amount is £75.  The provision under this sub-head is intended to cover the travelling expenses and subsistence allowance of the staff of the Secretary's office.  Although the President will ordinarily travel by car, for the running or maintenance of which no allowance will be paid to him from this Vote, provision has been made here for the possible payment of expenses when other modes of conveyance&mdash;such as, by train&mdash;may be used by the President on exceptional occasions.</P>
      <P>Sub-head E has to do with motor cars&mdash;Replacement Grant (£300).  Provision was made in the Vote for 1938-39 (sub-head E&mdash;Purchase of Motor Cars) for the purchase of motor cars to be placed at the disposal of the President, and it was the intention that a further annual sum was to be provided in subsequent years as a grant towards a Replacement Fund.  During the past year, however, the matter was further considered and it was decided, in substitution for that arrangement, that the President himself should purchase the cars required for his use; that a grant of £300 should be made in 1938-39 as a contribution towards the purchase of cars, and that a grant at the rate of £300 a year should be made annually thereafter as a contribution towards the cost of their replacement.  The sub-head, accordingly, provides for a Replacement Grant of £300 for the year 1939-40.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the Estimate for 1938-39, the Minister himself suggested in the Dáil that the title &ldquo;President's Establishment&rdquo; of this Vote was somewhat misleading, as the emoluments and allowances of the President provided for in the Constitution, and determined by the President's Establishment Act, 1938, are charged upon the Central Fund.  The point has been fully considered departmentally and, for the following reasons, <i>inter alia,</i> it has been decided by the Minister to <Col N="487" /> allow the existing title of the Vote to remain unaltered.</P>
    <P>The present title is more strictly accurate and covers all items in the Estimate, whereas &ldquo;President's Secretariat&rdquo; would not cover the motor car or train travelling by the President, and would probably not cover telegrams and telephones, which, strictly speaking, are used on the President's business, or other incidentals of that character.  I think that is all that arises on this Vote.</P>

      <P>The Estimate for 1938-39, including a Supplementary Estimate, was £110,750, and the Estimate for 1939-40 is £125,070, being an increase of £14,320. That increase of £14,320 is due to the increased allowances paid to the members of the Oireachtas under the Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) Act, 1938, and for certain other items of incidental expenditure.  I do not know, Sir, if there is any other question which arises on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are one or two minor items, Sir, in connection with the Oireachtas Vote, to which I should like to call attention.  One is in regard to the Post Office facilities available to <Col N="488" /> the members of this House.  Of course, I know that the Post Office in the Oireachtas here can never be expected to be an economic unit in the ordinary sense, such as an ordinary sub-post office in the country might be expected to be.  It must be remembered, however, that it is a great convenience for Deputies or Senators who, having no other office in the city normally, use this House here for ordinary office work.  As things are at present, the post office in this House does not open till 3 o'clock in the afternoon, and that is on the days in which the Dáil is sitting.  Now, as a matter of fact, most Deputies must do their business in the forenoon, since the Dáil meets at 3 o'clock, and it would be a very great convenience for Deputies to be able to transact their business, by the purchase of stamps, and so on, in the forenoon here in the House on the days that the Dáil is sitting.  I do not think it would entail any very great expense, and it certainly would be a very great convenience to the Deputies in transacting their business here in the House. I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to see whether or not&mdash;unless the expense would be prohibitive&mdash;the Postmaster-General could not arrange to have attendance here by a postmaster, on the days the House is sitting, from the morning on, instead of from 3 to 10.30 p.m., as it is at present.</P>
      <P>The second point to which I should like to refer is in connection with the telephones.  On the whole, we must admit that that service does not give any reason for complaint, and I am sure we are all glad to be able to pay a tribute to the young ladies in charge of the switchboard.  Occasionally, however, it happens to Deputies that, when they want to use the telephone, all the lines are engaged.  I fully appreciate that that can easily happen where you have a widely fluctuating demand for facilities, but I suggest that there could be some arrangement to provide against that happening in this House, even during a period of peak demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to draw attention.  It is <Col N="489" /> not a matter of great urgency, but it is one which, I think, is worthy of consideration.  Owing to the restricted space in this House, it became necessary to build the diningroom on top of the boilerhouse.  Now, during the winter months, the conditions resulting from that arrangement are not a matter of very serious importance, but during the summer months the atmosphere in the diningroom becomes, not infrequently, intolerable. Now, for Deputies who have been occupied in this Chamber&mdash;which, undoubtedly, is not the airiest place in the world&mdash;to go from here into the diningroom in order to get their lunch or dinner, is not a very pleasant experience when they find that the temperature of the diningroom is five or six degrees hotter than that of this Chamber, and it is frequently quite impossible to take a meal at all in the diningroom.  One prefers to go without food at all rather than endure the misery of sitting there.</P>
    <P>I am aware that this matter has engaged the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary and he has tried to make improvements of one kind or another.  I now want to suggest to him that it would be a legitimate expense to provide in the dining-room air conditioning. In America air conditioning is now pretty general in every restaurant and even on every railway train.  On most ships that one travels on the dining-room is air conditioned. Our dining-room here is peculiarly adaptable to air conditioning because it is completely cut off from the rest of the house by swing doors.  I am informed by air conditioning engineers that where you have that position it is comparatively easy to control the temperature of one room even though the rest of the building is not dealt with.  I would be grateful if the Parliamentary Secretary would enquire into the cost of air conditioning the dining-room and, if it were not excessive and money became available, put the matter in hand.</P>

      <P>Lest the thing go by default, I would like to suggest that air conditioning or whatever else may <Col N="490" /> be done to make the atmosphere tolerable might be extended generally to the new part of the premises.  The atmosphere is tolerable enough in the rest of the House.  The dining-room conditions are bad enough but in the additions that have been made I think they are even worse.  I notice that Deputy Dillon thinks it is worse in the summer than in the winter.  I do not know whether it is or not.  I would not like to have to say whether it is worse in the summer or in the winter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I have opposed this Bill since its introduction to the House and I do so as a member of various public authorities.  The Minister indicated on the Second Reading that he was of the opinion that this combined purchasing system was highly beneficial in so far as local authorities were concerned. My experience is an entirely different one.  The Act that has been in operation for some years now has been found by local authorities to have been against their best interests and against the interests of the community over which they have jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>When this type of legislation was first introduced to this House, it was pointed out by the then Minister for Local Government that it prevented rings in certain quarters and that, in his opinion, rings were formed in order to secure that certain people should get the custom of local authorities.  I am of opinion now that rings are being definitely formed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>But not by traders within the jurisdiction of the local authority.  I have in mind an incident that happened in Wexford within recent weeks.  The Wexford Corporation <Col N="492" /> wanted certain implements and they were able to secure these implements cheaper in Wexford from a merchant than they could get them from the trade list.  The person whose name was on the trade list was the person who was supplying them to the local merchant.  There certainly seems to be something wrong when something like that can happen.  It goes to show, I think, that some of the particular people who are on the trade list are making huge profits.  Otherwise, they could not sell to local traders at a lesser price than they would supply to local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the legislation that has been in operation for some years past, it was permissible for a local authority, if they could get commodities which they required at the same price or a lesser price than the price for which they could get from the combined purchasing board, to do so.  Under the present Bill that is prohibited.  I appealed to the Minister, both on the Second Stage and on the Committee Stage, to permit the old practice to continue.  There is no use in appealing at this stage unless the Minister softens his heart and proposes something in the Seanad to enable that to be continued.  I do not think it is fair at all to local ratepayers who are contributing rates&mdash;high rates&mdash;to the local authorities, that they should not be permitted to supply certain articles that are locally required.  Under this Bill also an estimate has to be made by a local authority as to what their requirements would be over the financial year.  I submit that, in a great many cases, that is absolutely impossible.  Under the Bill, if a local body underestimates and they have to get more than they estimated for at the beginning of the year, the contractor is permitted by law to charge an extra price for that commodity.  If, on the other hand, an overestimation is made and the local authority only requires 50 per cent. or 75 per cent. of the particular article, the Minister insists, through the medium of this Bill, that the local authority take the goods.  In my opinion, that is handing over local authorities entirely into the hands of rings of manufacturers <Col N="493" /> in this country, and it is certainly very unfair to the local authorities. The men who are on those bodies are men who are interested in local administration and endeavour to do their very best on behalf of the community at large.  This Bill, I suggest, takes away the powers from the local authorities which they are entitled to have.  In my opinion this can be styled &ldquo;Coercion Bill No. 2&rdquo; in so far as local authorities are concerned; and I certainly very definitely oppose it, because of my experience in the different boards of which I am a member.  I am going to vote against the Fifth Stage of this Bill.  I objected to the Fifth Stage being taken last week, because I wanted to delay the passage of this Bill as long as I possibly could.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No reasonable man can controvert a word of what Deputy Corish has said.  Anyone who knows the circumstances fully realises that what he alleges is the strict truth. There is nothing like an example to demonstrate the truth of a general statement.  I am sorry the Minister for Industry and Commerce had to leave the House.  Everybody knows that certain trades in this country have been converted by our Government into effective monopolies which have given rise to rings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two systems by which the ring is worked.  The first system is that a restricted number of persons who are large wholesalers in the commodity manufactured, combine into an organisation which they describe as a wholesalers organisation.  They go to the manufacturer and say to him: &ldquo;You must quote us one price for your product, which will allow us an ample margin of profit for distributing.  You must give that price to nobody else but the individuals who belong to our association; and, if anybody else applies for that price&mdash;no matter what quantity he would take&mdash;you must refer his order back to us, asking whether he is a member of our organisation; and, if he is not, you must refuse to give him the terms that you give to us.&rdquo;  When they get that undertaking from the factory they close the <Col N="494" /> ring, and nobody else&mdash;be he local authority or enterprising merchant or a new man starting in business on his own&mdash;will be let into the wholesalers' ring.  It is closed tightly, and there may be no new entrants, so that they get a complete control of all the supplies of that commodity within Éire. In the old days, before this system of creating monopolies existed, if any group of wholesalers attempted to do that, if a merchant&mdash;a retail or a wholesale businessman &mdash; were refused supplies by the parties that have entered into that agreement he would go elsewhere to get the supplies and thus break the ring.  In the monopolies that are now in force, however, he has no other person to go to since the wholesalers' ring has got control and no one is ever allowed to become a wholesaler thereafter, and the only people who will get preferential terms are the original members of the wholesalers' ring.  They have an absolute stranglehold on the consumer on the one hand and on the factory on the other, and they use that stranglehold to create a closed corporation in which they alone take the profits.</P>
    <P>There is another type of ring, that is the flour ring.  They have an office here in Dublin.</P>

      <P>The matter under discussion is the Fifth Stage of this Bill, and the proper matter for discussion, the only relevant matter, is what is contained in the measure. Reference has been made to the possibility of monopolies not dealing fairly with public boards, but such reference should not be allowed to deviate into a discussion of rings, monopolies of various kinds, or the evils of protectionist legislation.  The Deputy purported to give one example of monopoly.  He is now proceeding to give a second example.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not say it is the Minister's intention.  I am trying to explain to the Minister what is going to happen.  Perhaps, as Deputy Corish suggests, it might be better to say the &ldquo;result&rdquo; of the Bill.  It is to put the local authorities into the hands of the rings.  I am trying to explain why this Bill should be voted against at this stage.  Otherwise, I do not see how the local authority can keep out of the toils of the ring.  I do not want to circumnavigate your ruling at all, but I think it is relevant and I want to submit a picture of what is actually going to happen when this Bill comes into force and the local authority, say, the Roscommon County Board of Health, goes to buy bacon or flour for the County Home in Roscommon.  These two bodies have an office in Dublin and they meet once a week, when they summon to their meetings a representative of every producer of that commodity who belongs to their associations.  They say to their members: &ldquo;If we all stand together we can get any price we want.  Therefore, although you get individual applications from the Combined Purchasing Board in the Custom House, let us agree to-day that when we fill in the figure on the tender all of us will fill in the same figure.&rdquo;  That is the position with which the Minister will be confronted.  In the old days the Minister, if he got a whole series of tenders which appeared to him to be the result of a conspiracy, was entitled to tear them up and say: &ldquo;I wanted to give preference to an Irish firm and tried to do so, but I was met by a conspiracy amongst them to abstain from competition.  Faced with that conspiracy I will go outside, and I will take quotations from Belfast or Liverpool or New York.  I did not want to do it: I tried to give a preference at home and it is only because they conspired against me that I am driven to the other resource.&rdquo;  He cannot do that now, because there is an overriding law prohibiting the importation of flour, and he is face to face with a conspiracy such as I have mentioned. Previous to this, the local authority <Col N="496" /> could go to a local merchant or flour vendor and say: &ldquo;If you will supply at a cheaper price, your tender will be accepted and the miller will be left sitting there.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Now they have to enter into a 12 months contract on the basis of any price the flour miller chooses to put up. Many people in this House will say &ldquo;If the flour millers are in a conspiracy, how are you going to get a better price from the local merchant?&rdquo; In practice you could, but I admit that that is not easy for the average Deputy to understand unless he has had some experience of rural trade, but when you come to the bacon men&mdash; and I am not going beyond this: I stop at these two instances&mdash;it is quite clear that we could at present get a better price, and I want the House to know why.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a ring in the bacon trade representing the larger curers, but there are, as Deputies know, a number of small curers scattered about the country, men who do about 300 pigs a week.  Under the existing system, if the Minister got, as he certainly will get, a flat price from all the bacon curers for supplies of bacon, it was quite open to the Roscommon Board of Health to go to the Ballaghaderreen bacon curing company and to ask them if they would take 5/- or 10/- less for so many sides of bacon than the central purchasing people had fixed as the price, and, in the vast majority of cases, they would have got a cut in the price of bacon.  So much is that so that Deputies will remember that I produced in this House an angry letter from the leaders of the bacon ring addressed to the small curers and remonstrating with them because they were not playing the game.  Do Deputies remember that?  I produced a letter from the big men in the bacon ring addressed to the small men, saying that it was monstrous that they should be cutting the price of bacon, and that if they would only stand fast they could get any price they liked out of the consumer, &ldquo;and,&rdquo; went on the letter, &ldquo;if this does not stop we will take steps to stop it.&rdquo;  Most Deputies, when they heard that letter read, were <Col N="497" /> astonished and shocked that such activities should be going on.  This Bill is going to make it clear to the small bacon curers that it cannot possibly be of any interest to them any longer to cut the price, or to offer the consumer better value because it will do no good.  The central purchasing board, or the local authority, are committed, under the contract, to the ring price and they have got to take it.</P>
    <P>The precise error underlying this whole legislation arises from a confusion of thought.  Before the extreme tariff policy of the present Government, it was considered a patriotic thing to prefer Irish manufacture, and it was considered the legitimate thing to give Irish industry a hand wherever you could in any legislation which you were passing through this House, because it was felt that they were then open to intensive competition and required other kinds of help; but now all these industries have got immense protection, water-tight protection, and we are trying to give them, having given them that protection, the kind of help which we thought it was legitimate to give them before they had any protection at all.  I put it to Deputies that the consumers and ratepayers of this country are entitled to some little consideration.  Every burden imposed by this House is ultimately carried by the ratepayers and taxpayers of the country.  They have to carry a very substantial burden as a result of the protection policy of the Government. Is it right, once they have consented to accept the burden created by tariffs, to pile on top of them a further burden by delivering them, tied hand and foot, into the hands of the rings that have been created behind the tariffs, or should we rather say that having given the industry as a whole adequate protection, it is up to that industry to compete within itself in order to afford the consumer, the taxpayer and the ratepayer a chance to get the best value that efficiency and hard work is capable of producing within the country?</P>
    <P>I submit that it is bad and unjust to the taxpayer and ratepayer to pass this Bill.  I submit that there is even <Col N="498" /> a greater evil than that in this Bill. I submit that this Bill is an invitation to Irish industrialists to be content with the second best.  It is a way of telling them: &ldquo;Even if your stuff is not as cheap as it ought to be, even if your stuff is not as good as you ought to be able to make, we are going to force the people to buy it from you in any case.&rdquo;  That is no service to the industry itself because anyone who is concerned with industry or trade knows that we are all human, and that, if we have no competition, we are inclined to let things ride and do not break our necks trying to improve things, but if we do get a bit of competition we wake up and try to make things better than they were, and when we find ourselves under the necessity to make that endeavour, we go down to the men who are actually working on the bench and say to them: &ldquo;So and so's product is outstripping ours: we shall have to exert ourselves to make ours better and cheaper.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Unless we are in a position to say to ourselves and to the men who work with us: &ldquo;Unless we put a little more effort into this business, we are both of us going to lose our livelihood,&rdquo; you cannot get that increased efficiency which progress demands.  If you go down to remonstrate with your colleagues in any enterprise on the ground that the product is not good enough, with the passage of this Bill, they, in so far as they are supplying local authorities, are entitled to say: &ldquo;It will do.  They will have to buy from us in any case, so what is the use in our breaking our necks trying to make things better when we will get the same price for this?&rdquo;  What answer have you to make to that?  It is perfectly true.  There is no inducement to do things better, and there is no reason why anybody should work a bit harder, or be a little more careful, to produce a thing as well as it can be done, because this Bill is an invitation to produce anything, and get it accepted.  I put it to the Minister that instead of doing Irish industry a service, this Bill is going to do it an injury.  I put it to him that it is going to impose on the taxpayer and ratepayer a far greater burden than he realises, and, on those <Col N="499" /> grounds, I invite the House to vote against it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is all rather an unusual proceeding because I understand that, on Second Reading, the principle of the Bill was accepted. It is a new departure that, on the Fifth Stage, we are going to divide on the principle but, of course, Deputies are free to do as they please.  I do not think there is any justification whatever for what Deputy Dillon has said. The articles he mentions have never been on the list.  Flour, bacon, eggs and butter are not on the list, have not been on the list and are unlikely to be on the list, so that I do not see that there is any point in bringing in matters of that kind.  Other articles, it is believed, as has been the experience of the Local Government Department, can be got cheaper and better under this contract system, because manufacturers, or wholesalers, when asked to supply in quantity on a firm order, are undoubtedly able to supply at a lower price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not surprised that Deputy Mulcahy has left.  He was Minister for Local Government and Public Health for a number of years and I am sure when he heard Deputy Dillon he decided to go and leave the case to Deputy Dillon who did not know what he was talking about.  Deputy Mulcahy, as I have already said, was Minister and he saw this system being worked under his administration.  He, no doubt, saw the loopholes which this Bill is designed to fill up.  This measure will not in any way permit rings to be formed.  If there is any individual ring in operation, Deputies may take it that that ring will be broken up.  If there is even the suggestion of a ring the people connected with it will not be put on the list.  The body that recommends to the Minister and whose recommendations are accepted is an advisory body, made up of two representatives of the Department of Local Government and Public Health, two representatives of the local authorities, two representatives of the employers, and two representatives of the trade unions.  They will, no doubt, <Col N="500" /> deal with anything in the nature of a ring if it is being attempted.</P>

I am not the Minister who introduced the Bill but I believe that it was as a result of the experience of that Advisory Committee and as a result of the experience of the Departmen of Local Government and Public Health that this Bill was brought in. Deputy Dillon has painted a wrong picture altogether.  I cannot understand the attitude Deputy Corish has taken up in this matter about buying locally. If that is to be allowed, if a contractor contracts to produce certain goods and to sell them to the local authorities on the expectation that he is going to get a certain quantity of orders, then it is quite clear, if the local authorities are permitted to buy anywhere they like elsewhere, that it is not fair to the contractor. I am satisfied that if that were allowed to continue the whole thing would break down.</P>

      <P>I have not that particular case before me.  I am not going to say that Deputy Corish is not correct, but I can assure the Deputy that if there is any evidence of a ring or anything of the kind, the Department of Local Government and Public Health will deal with it.  Deputy Dillon has said that would be dealt with as it was on a former occasion. Deputy Dillon said that this was handing the local bodies into the hands of monopolists or rings.  That is what he said.  I have a note of it&mdash;that local bodies will be placed in the hands of monopolists or rings.  The Department of Local Government and Public Health will see that these persons or firms are not likely to be put on the list if there is any evidence of such a thing as a ring.  Deputies can do what they like but it will be a strange thing if Deputies, after having accepted the principle of the Bill, are going to vote against it now.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>The fact is that this is a new principle brought into this Bill. It was accepted after a full debate on the Second Reading that the estimate <Col N="502" /> system was to be a feature in the future, that every local authority was to make a fair estimate of their requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that, but the estimate system is vital to the whole Bill.  If it were not there the thing would be a failure.  The contractor will have to be in the position of knowing what quantity of material we will require.  This is essential if we are to get the full benefit of the cheap prices. But if we are going to let people break away from that, the whole system might as well be broken up.  Why should not local authorities get very close to their requirements when they are estimating?</P>

The contractor may have to charge a higher price; if the cost has not increased he may not have to change his price.  If he could get a higher price he would be foolish not to do it.  The price of materials may have decreased and he may be making a bigger profit by selling more goods.  At all events, it is only fair to him that he would be allowed to supply all the requirements of the local body for which he had tendered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Unemployment Assistance (Second Employment Period) Order, 1939, made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce on the 12th May, 1939, and presented to Dáil Eireann on the 23rd May, 1939, be and is hereby annulled.</P>
      <P>For several years past, it has been necessary to move a motion in similar terms to that which we have set down here&mdash;in fact, since the Unemployment Assistance Act was passed&mdash;in an effort by the Labour Party to curb what we consider is a Ministerial abuse in overriding legislation passed for an important section of the community by the irresponsible introduction of Period Orders such as that with which we are dealing to-day.  The Unemployment Assistance Act was intended to give effect to a very vital principle in the life of the nation&mdash;that the State should undertake liability for the maintenance of people who were willing and able to work and for whom work could not be found.  That marked a vast difference in the attitude of the previous Ministry and was hailed with delight by most right-thinking people.  It was never intended by the Oireachtas, when that Bill was passing through the House, that lip-service should be given to that principle and that it should be abolished during six months of the year by Ministerial regulation.  The Act covers 12 months of the year and the necessary machinery has been provided by the Oireachtas to prevent abuse of the powers conferred by the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister at any time found that the machinery was not sufficient to enable him to check abuses or to prevent people from drawing unemployment assistance when they really had work to go to, a remedy was at his disposal&mdash;to come back to the House. Anybody who has had experience of the operation of this Act will substantiate <Col N="505" /> the statement I am making, that the machinery is more than ample for the purpose of protecting State funds and checking abuses in the application of this money.  There is no Deputy on these benches who will stand for an abuse of State funds.  We stand for the application of this unemployment assistance fund to as small a number of people as possible, but we contend that the spirit of the Act should be given full effect to until the Government is in a position to produce that magical plan by which they were supposed to provide employment for all people willing and able to work and who so far have not got that work.  The ready device of giving out the impression, at the end of the year, that unemployment has abated by transferring unemployed persons from the unemployment assistance roll under the method of these Period Orders misleads nobody.  It certainly does not mislead the unfortunate victims of the Orders because the Minister, with that utter irresponsibility of which I have spoken, has refused year after year to bring forward any evidence as to how many men had actually got work at the period at which he struck them off the unemployment assistance roll.  He says in effect that from June to the end of October there is plenty of work for all single men and men without dependents and that they can go and do it. If he was so confident that that was a fact, would he not, as we have asked from time to time since these Orders were first introduced, have brought forward some evidence to show what has happened under previous Orders and how many of these men had actually got the work which he had promised them?</P>
    <P>My contention, and the contention of my colleagues, is that the number of people who get work at the period these Orders are enforced is negligible, at least in this country.  A good many of them do get work but not inside the shores of Éire.  In fact, these Employment Period Orders have been a potent force in recent years in driving the workers across channel.  My contention to-day is similar to that I made last year and the year before, namely, that if the work is there available, the <Col N="506" /> ordinary machinery of the Act will compel them to take it.  The machinery of the Act will preclude them from getting benefit under false pretences. The Order is unnecessary owing to the efficiency of the machinery for compelling any man in receipt of benefit to take work which is available for him throughout the entire 12 months.</P>
    <P>The Minister really cannot have it both ways.  If the Order is necessary to compel men to accept work which is available for them, then the Minister implies by that that during the other portions of the year his officers are not capable of detecting wilful evasions of work.  The Civic Guard are there and they are very active when the signing of the unemployment register takes place.  The investigation officers at the labour exchanges are also very active.  We have the third method of detection which we have often so vigorously condemned, the anonymous letter.  When the amending legislation was introduced, we appealed to the Minister to have that third method abolished but the Minister refused to do so and said that he wanted to preserve the anonymous letter as a protection for State funds.  We pointed out the hardships that had been inflicted on recipients of unemployment assistance by the malicious anonymous letter-writer, but the Minister refused to pay any heed to these representations.  That method of detection is still recognised under the amending Act and, on the receipt of an anonymous letter, the man about whom a complaint is made is immediately struck off unemployment benefit without any investigation whatever.  It is bad enough to give recognition to some fellow who has not the courage to sign his name to a letter but the practice of condemning a man, untried and unheard, on receipt of an anonymous letter, and depriving himself, his wife and his children of unemployment assistance, is something that any Government should be ashamed to stand for.</P>
    <P>The manager of the labour exchange has no alternative but to strike that man off unemployment assistance benefit.  An investigation takes place subsequently it is true, and after the <Col N="507" /> lapse of eight, ten or sometimes twelve weeks, if the man is proved innocent of the crime against the Act which the anonymous letter writer has alleged, it is then possible to get the money of which he has been deprived refunded.  In the meantime, however, grave hardships have been inflicted on himself and his family.  Strictly speaking, that man is not entitled to get home help from the home assistance officer during the period that he is deprived of unemployment assistance. There is a contribution from the local authority towards unemployment assistance and if a man is suspected of having abused the privileges of the Unemployment Assistance Act, the home assistance officer might legally be surcharged for giving him relief.  If, however, he does give him relief, the amount of such relief must be deducted from the unemployment assistance benefit when he is again restored to the roll.  I suggest, therefore, that the machinery at the disposal of the Minister for the operation of the Unemployment Assistance Act is quite ample and efficient.  Why, then, is it necessary to have this Employment Period Order in operation from the beginning of June to the end of October?  Without examination of the qualifications of any of the men who are affected by the Order, it is assumed that agricultural work is available for them, and that they must go and perform this agricultural work.</P>
    <P>The Order applies to all rural areas and the rural areas start at the borough stones in the City of Limerick, the City of Cork, the City of Dublin and a few urbanised centres to which the Order does not apply.  Outside these towns, all single men are classified, apparently, as being agricultural labourers.  I, personally, asked that a classification should be made of those who are genuine agricultural labourers who could be sent to agricultural work, but, under the ambit and scope of this Order, men have been taken from the purlieus of the cities and towns, various types of craftsmen, stone-cutters, railwaymen and tradesmen of all descriptions who are quite incompetent to do agricultural work even if <Col N="508" /> it were available, men who have not the remotest conception of what their duties would be if they were employed by a farmer.  It shows the utter irresponsibility which inspires the Order that such men are unquestionably struck off the unemployment assistance roll without any examination being made of their fitness for agricultural work.  I suggest that it is a definite attempt to rob these people of a benefit conferred on them by the Oireachtas. The unemployed citizens of the State are as much entitled to the benefits of this Act as any other section of the community are entitled to benefits conferred on them by other Acts passed by the Dáil.  That is why I contend that it is abusing a Ministerial privilege, abusing a function of the Dáil and violating the rights of citizens to apply this Order.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Dáil to say that we should preserve the authority of the Oireachtas and to say that legislation passed by the Oireachtas is intended to operate for 12 months of the year and that it cannot lightly be set aside by these recurrent Period Orders Nos. 1 and 2.  We are dealing with Period Order No. 2 to-day because it is more vicious in its effects than Period Order No. 1, which deprives a man with a farm of £4 valuation or under from unemployment assistance from March to October.  We are told that these people will be fully employed on their farms from March to October and then, from the 7th June to the end of October, the man without dependents is struck off and is going to get no benefit by way of unemployment assistance. The only excuse that has been so far advanced is that at this particular period there is a sufficiency of work for all these men.  I should be glad if that were true but, so far, no evidence has been put forward to establish that it is a fact.  Even if it be conceded that it is true, I still think that there is no necessity for this Order and that the ordinary machinery established by the Dáil to prevent or to check abuses in the drawing of State funds is more efficient for the purposes of the Act.  I am, therefore, asking the house to agree that this Period Order should be annulled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I formally second the motion.  I would like to point out that when those Employment Period Orders are put into operation they have the effect of throwing a very big number of people from the suburbs of Cork on the home assistance funds. That is the effect that these Orders have in the suburbs.  Those men, when out of employment, have to seek home assistance.  We have a very conservative board dealing with home assistance in Cork, as I am sure Deputy Brasier would testify.  The position is that when those men are out of employment they have to come to that board and seek home assistance.  It is a terrible state of things that young men anxious for work cannot get it.  The discussion on this Order reminds me of a remark that was made in the course of discussion here last night by Deputy T. Crowley.  The Deputy said that there were young men and if they got work they would not take it.  It is bad enough to treat the unemployed in the way that they are being treated under this Order or by the meagre maintenance that is offered to them, but it is a much more serious thing that insults such as the Deputy's should be offered to them&mdash;to young men who, I know, are anxious and willing to work but cannot get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everything that has been said about the operation of these Orders is fully justified.  The Order in March is severe enough, but the one that comes into operation in the period from June to October is really a very serious one for a great many young men of all classes who cannot get employment&mdash; tailors, journeymen harness makers and others who engage in seasonal work.  Apart from these Orders altogether, I may say that the labour exchanges are very strict because, from time to time, they call these men, young and old, before a court of referees to show cause why they are not getting employment.  As Deputy Keyes has pointed out, the machinery of the labour exchanges is quite sufficient to prevent any abuses so far as the unemployment assistance funds are concerned.  In view of what has been said, I hope the Minister will <Col N="510" /> reconsider his decision and not put this Order into operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is his definitely, but he has not taken the necessary steps and has declined, after being pressed here on more than one occasion, to ascertain the figures relating to the number of people who got work during the period that these Orders were in suspense.  He did not do so because he knew that the results would be disastrous to the case that he has made here.  The number that got work was the very minimum, while the majority, or at least a considerable number were driven out of the country to seek work across the water because they had not a shilling left to fall back upon for their support here, notwithstanding the fact that legislation had been passed for their benefit.  Instead of doing what he did in 1935, 1936 and 1937 the Minister to-day seems to think that it is a much stronger and more forcible argument to adopt the cowardly practice of ignoring and refusing to reply to a motion, put down in all sincerity, dealing with a serious matter like this.  I have nothing further to add.  I ask Deputies to show that they at least have some respect for the authority of this House: that they are not going to allow its authority to be overridden and treated in this cavalier fashion by the Minister. The motion will also afford the workers of the country the opportunity of realising that the sincerity of Ministerial gestures can be better tested here than on the hustings of South City to-night.</P>
