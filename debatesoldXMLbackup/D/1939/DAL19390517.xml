      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the total amount of sugar in cwts. imported into the country for the year ended 31st March, 1939; what was the c.i.f. price per cwt.; and what was the total amount of customs duty levied on same.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The total amount of sugar imported was 1,114,313 cwt.  The c.i.f. value per cwt. was 7s. 11d.  It is not possible to state the total amount of customs duty levied on the sugar imported during the year ended 31st March, 1939, because part of the sugar in question was warehoused and duty may not yet have been levied on all of such sugar.</P>
      <P>The imported sugar charged with duty during the year ended 31st March. 1939, includes some sugar warehoused in the previous year and does not include some sugar warehoused in the year ended 31st March, 1939.</P>
      <P>The net receipt of duty from imported sugar retained for home consumption in the year ended 31st March, 1939, was £882,786 9s. 10d., the corresponding net quantity being 1,110,753 cwts.</P>

      <P>I have pleasure in moving that Deputy Daniel Morrissey be elected Leas-Cheann Comhairle. Deputy Morrissey has been a member of this House for 17 years and, during that period, for four years he held the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle to <Col N="2536" /> the entire satisfaction of the members of the House; and I think, having regard to his experience, he is qualified to hold the position.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chinn Comhairle, I regret that we must oppose this motion.  My objection to it can be stated, I think, in a few words.  I think that so long as we have in the House experienced members who have a knowledge of Irish and who could, if required, conduct the business of the Chair through Irish, we ought not to elect one without Irish to the Chair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the objection raised to Deputy Morrissey's nomination, I think it answers itself by virtue of the fact that the particular appointment in question was held with very distinct success by Deputy Dan Morrissey for a considerable number of years.  He filled that position, and filled it to the satisfaction of every individual Deputy and every Party in this House, without exception.  The fact that he was not proficient in the Irish language was never found to be a disability.  I am prepared to admit that it would be desirable if the occupant of the Chair was an all-round proficient linguist.  It could be argued that it would be highly desirable that the occupant of a Speaker's Chair in any Parliament would also have a knowledge of French.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this objection is raised in the interests of the Irish language, and of furthering and fostering the Irish language, I would submit that it is raised without due consideration.  If the Irish language is to be commercialised in this particular way, it should be commercialised from top to bottom: the point should not only be raised when it is a question of a big Opposition Party filling a vacancy that has been previously held by a member of that Party, but <Col N="2537" /> should also be raised when it is a question of filling a Government Ministry or of filling a post such as that of the Attorney-General.  When it is only trotted out of the stable as a pretext, to place an obstacle in the way of the Opposition, or to defeat an Opposition nominee, and when it is not used when it is a case of filling Ministries or filling high Government offices, then&mdash; with all due respect&mdash;I, for one, doubt the sincerity behind the particular point raised.</P>
    <P>If the Irish language is to be furthered in this country it can only be furthered by the help of all, and particularly with the goodwill of those who suffer under the disability of not being masters of the language.  The fact that some are masters of the language and others are not is a question, in most cases, of a geographical accident of birth; and a premium should not be placed on such an accident nor should disabilities be placed on those who had the misfortune to be born elsewhere. This country had a very, very troubled history in the lifetime of everybody here, and perhaps the country would never have a Parliament of its own or have any such thing as compulsory Irish&mdash;and would still be under the rule of the British&mdash;if the best men in this country did not neglect their studies&mdash;including their Irish studies&mdash; in order to step into the gap of danger.</P>
    <P>It may well be that you are placing a premium on the quitters by placing these penalties in the way of others. Unless such a rule applies all round&mdash; and this Parliament and this country is an outstanding example of the fact that it does not apply all round&mdash;I believe it is unjust to apply it in this particular case.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Sir, I wish to question the Taoiseach's sincerity in this opposition.  It is nearly time that we faced realities in the matter of Irish, and particularly in the matter of the use of the Irish language in administrative posts, if we are going to do what is alleged we all want to do, that is, restore the Irish language as the natural, national language of the people of this country.  The Taoiseach opposes Deputy Morrissey's <Col N="2538" /> appointment here on the grounds, as he alleges, that he has not a knowledge of Irish.  It has already been pointed out that Deputy Morrissey presided over this Assembly for four years and gave complete satisfaction in regard to every aspect of the discharge of his duties.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach is concerned with a knowledge of Irish in the case of people who preside over our Parliamentary discussions.  I wonder how can the Taoiseach face this House here and oppose this appointment on the grounds of Irish when we consider what happened when it was proposed &mdash;when the new Seanad was set up&mdash; to place as the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad a man who was entirely non-Party, who had an incomparable knowledge of the Irish language and who as far as the language movement itself was concerned, was a monumental and institutional figure in the eyes of the whole country.  It was boasted particularly by the Government Party that the Seanad was going to be a non-Party institution.  His nomination was opposed, and a Party person was put into the Chair in the Seanad, who has not a competent knowledge of Irish, who is not competent to carry out business in Irish that arises from time to time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask Deputies who hold that, to consult members of their own Party who were interested in the language and who were in the Seanad at that particular time.  I would ask members of the Fianna Fáil Party to consult the records of the Seanad and see to what extent, when points of Order were made in Irish in the Seanad, the present Chairman was able to understand what they were about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that criticism of the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad should be made in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am criticising the Party opposite, led by the Taoiseach, and I am criticising the <Col N="2539" /> actions of that Party in relation to the appointment of the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad&mdash;and in relation to their opposition to the appointment that is being proposed here now.  If Irish is going to be restored either as the spoken language of this country or if it is going to get a natural or reasonable position in the administration of this country, something else should be done. We cannot do it by any Party in this State acting in the way in which the Fianna Fáil Party acted in relation to the Seanad appointment on one occasion and in relation to this appointment now.</P>
      <P>I would like to question the Taoiseach on what he has done, or what his Ministers have done, to see that in those parts of the country where Irish is the natural language Irish is being restored in any way to its proper position in the administrative work of the country.  In March, 1929, acting as Minister for Local Government and Public Health, I considered what could be done in four counties&mdash;in Donegal, Galway, Kerry and, I think, Cork&mdash;to see that Irish was introduced, through the local bodies there and that in their relations with the Department of Local Government and Public Health Irish was introduced as a language of communication between the Department and those bodies.  After fully reviewing the matter I decided to take Donegal and Galway, and I addressed a communication to the county councils and to the boards of health in those two counties, suggesting that, from the beginning of 1935, all official communications between those bodies and the Department of Local Government and Public Health should be through the Irish language.  The matter was discussed by the various bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some members of the Galway County Council, including one who is now a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, thought the Minister for Local Government at that time was going too slow.  He proposed that, as 1932 was the 15th centenary of the coming of St. Patrick to Ireland, it would be an appropriate date for the Galway County Council to begin doing what <Col N="2540" /> the Minister for Local Government at that time suggested.  By the casting vote of the chairman of the council, who subsequently became a member of the Fianna Fáil Party and sat in this House, the Galway County Council decided that the Minister for Local Government at that time was going too slow in the matter, and that from the beginning of 1932, the 15th centenary of the coming of St. Patrick to Ireland, the Galway County Council should do what the Minister for Local Government at that time was suggesting&mdash;conduct all their business through the medium of Irish.</P>
    <P>Seven years have passed since 1932, and four years have passed since 1935, the date which I considered reasonable. During that period, a Fianna Fáil Government has been in power. The Minister for Local Government during that period is the person whom the Taoiseach, on the last occasion on which he opposed Deputy Morrissey's nomination for the Vice-Chair, was put up to speak against the nomination. But not a single tap has been done to get either of the two premier public bodies in Donegal or Galway to see that their correspondence with the Local Government Department was carried out through the medium of Irish.  In the light of the utter neglect to see that, where it was possible, the Irish language was used for administrative purposes, the action of the Taoiseach here to-day is utterly impossible to understand.  The only interpretation to be put upon it is that the action has been taken for Party purposes, just like the action that was taken in connection with the election of Chairman of the Seanad.</P>
    <P>Again, the Minister for Local Government has been for the last seven years in charge of the Department responsible for the administration of the Gaeltacht Order.  How many public appointments have been made in the Gaeltacht, subject to the Gaeltacht Order, during the last seven years in which the persons appointed subject to the conditions of the Gaeltacht Order have satisfied the conditions of the Gaeltacht Order, that they <Col N="2541" /> are able to discharge all their duties through the medium of the Irish language; how many cases have there been where persons have been allowed to evade and who have not complied with the Order as to the conditions for appointments in these districts?</P>
    <P>There is too much work to be done if the Irish language is going to be saved, if the Irish language is even going to be used to any reasonable extent in public affairs, by those who have the language.  I charge the present Ministry with utterly neglecting both their duties and their opportunities as to what can be done and should be done and must be done if the Irish language is to be saved.  I charge them with neglecting their opportunities and their responsibility; and I charge them, in opposing this motion here to-day, with simply carrying on a bluff and a sham; simply degrading the position of the Irish language in the eyes of the country <Col N="2542" /> as a whole, and making it impossible for people to concentrate in a complete and fully co-operative way on the work which is absolutely necessary if the Irish language is to be saved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has given reasons why, in the opinion of the Government, it is not possible for them to support this motion.  I want, however, on behalf of this Party, to say that our opposition to the motion is based on entirely different grounds, but it is unnecessary and, perhaps, not desirable that these grounds should be entered into in detail at this stage.  I, therefore, want to emphasise that our opposition to the motion is not based on the grounds indicated by the Taoiseach and, at the same time, to say that we are opposed to this motion.</P>

      <P>When speaking last evening I was dealing with the table given by the Minister in which he claims to have given £8,000,000 to agriculture.  I pointed out that where he claims £220,000, there was a debit against him of £1,000,000.  I pointed out that the increases imposed upon agriculture through increased prices as a result of customs duties and tariffs amounted to £4,750,000, at a very low estimate.  I also pointed out that there was a decrease in the value of cattle by earmarking of £1,500,000, and a decrease in the Agricultural Grant of £78,000.  These items make altogether £7,328,000. Giving the Minister credit for £606,000 export subsidies and £666,000 for dairy produce, we are left with the figure of £5,066,000 against the Minister.  To that must be added the unknown quantity&mdash;I am leaving it to the Minister himself to put a figure on it&mdash;which would cover the loss that agriculture has sustained by reason of losing so much of our market.  The Minister told us that we are limited now to a part of our exports.  He himself can estimate what that would amount to.  That would bring the figure up to £8,000,000 of a loss and with no gain.  There was one item I forgot to refer to last evening.  That was £2,200,000 in land annuities.  The Minister for Agriculture told us that that was equivalent to a capital sum of £40,000,000.  Yes but what about the loss that agriculture sustained during those years of the economic war?  Was it not at least £60,000,000? That would be a figure that is nearer to the mark.  And even £40,000,000 would be very much better for agriculture at the present time when it is under capitalised, than the interest on £40,000,000.  At all events the Minister cannot claim credit for £1,200,000 which he has been claiming. If any claim were to be made the claim would be made against him. We will pass from that subject.  I am afraid when the Minister has all his claims wiped out by the losses he will not have much to boast of.  Now I come to deal with the widening chasm between revenue and expenditure.  We are borrowing money this year to balance the Budget.  There is a difference of something like £4,500,000. I also pointed out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only trying to get started in order to give an outline of the position.  There are two windfalls which bring in £3,695,000.  That <Col N="2545" /> is not really revenue at all and it is a drying-up source.  That £3,695,000 represents arrears of income-tax.  And the £2,400,000 that the Minister is getting in annuities.  The position is that we have £27,435,000 of real revenue and if that is deducted from the £35,000,000 for which the Minister is budgeting, it leaves a deficit of £8,281,000, or something over £8,250,000.  That is the gap that has to be filled up between real revenue and estimated expenditure.</P>
      <P>The Minister pointed out that the revenue is decreasing, and Deputy Dillon has pointed out that expenditure is going up.  The gap is growing wider and threatens to swallow up the solvency of this country in a short time. What are we doing about it?  It is recognised by some of the more thoughful Deputies on the opposite benches that it is a serious problem and needs to be tackled.  Deputy Childers said that it is something that must be gone into and that needs very careful attention, but nothing can be done this year.  I am afraid Deputy Childers is like the old sinner who got to the length of acknowledging his sins, but deferred repentance.  He admits the damage is being done and that the country is threatened with bankruptey, but we have not the moral courage to begin to put it right.  We are going further, though we know we are on the wrong road.  We are getting into deeper water or, shall I say, deeper mud?  That is where the country is being led by this Government.  We will keep on until we reach a point from which we cannot retreat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I really think that some effort should be made to find a remedy.  The fact is that we are living above our means.  We are copying countries like Great Britain or the United States of America.  Can we afford to live up to the standard of these countries? The average income here is about a quarter of the average income in Great Britain.  How can a man here with £100 hope to compare with a man who has £400?  There is very little difference between nations and individuals. The squandermania which is going on here is getting beyond the <Col N="2546" /> ability of the taxpayers.  Our national financial position proves that.  We have a deficit of £8,250,000 and the chasm is getting wider.  I think it is time to cry a halt.  We must examine into the position of the country and see whither we are drifting.  We are drifting very near the precipice and something must be done if the nation is to be saved.</P>
    <P>There have been great sacrifices made in the past for this country, but now what is being done?  We are told that all the Opposition are doing is criticising and doing harm and that no useful suggestions have been made.  I do not agree with that.  The Opposition have made very useful suggestions. The Government acted on some of them, but the Government action was slow.  They did not act until almost irreparable damage had been done. Perhaps they will not act now until it is entirely too late and until more damage has been caused.</P>
    <P>Who advised the Government to settle the economic war?  The Opposition advised them and eventually they carried out that advice.  Unfortunately, they were a bit late and they had lost our market.  We have now only a limited market and our cattle are affected to the extent of 30/- a head for every animal exported.  We have had quotas and everything else and that would never have happened if the economic war had not been started. They settled it at last after the Opposition had been pointing out to them that that was the sensible thing to do.  It could have been settled sooner and with more advantage to the country.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture told us he proposed to do something to improve the condition of the unemployed in rural districts, to devise some scheme whereby they can work with farmers, the farmers to give them whatever they can afford and the Government to augment these wages, instead of paying these men a few shillings a week and keeping them in a starving condition, demoralising them and leaving them no good for themselves or for the country.  As a result of the Government's policy, the land in many places has been allowed to go wild, to grow rushes and to <Col N="2547" /> remain under water, when it might have been used for the advantage of the nation.  That suggestion came from this side of the House also.</P>
    <P>I am prepared to make still further suggestions, but I suppose, like the other suggestions that have been made, they will not be acted upon until it is too late.  Deputy Childers asked for co-operation and I am happy to echo his appeal.  We are quite prepared to co-operate and, if the country is to be saved, it is necessary that all Parties in this House should co-operate.  If there is not general co-operation the country will head for disaster.  It may be necessary, if the Budgets of the future are to be balanced, to tell the people hard and unpleasant facts. There is no use in telling them the nice story all the time, about how prosperous we are.  I am afraid that sooner or later the people will have to be told the truth, and the truth is that the people will have to take off their coasts and work harder, otherwise they will have to tighten their belts.</P>
    <P>Who is in a moral position in this country to tell them that?  Can the Minister or any one on the Government Benches do it?  I am afraid not.  That is the difficulty they have placed themselves in.  They are not in a moral position to ask anyone to tighten his belt without giving an example.  Some months ago Acts were passed increasing the allowances to Deputies and giving pensions to Ministers.  The suggestion I am going to make is that the Act giving allowances to Deputies should be repealed, and that the Act giving pensions to Ministers and others should be drastically amended.  I admit that there are cases where some provision should be made for Ministers and ex-Ministers, but the Bill went much too far.</P>

      <P>I am pointing out where a beginning should be made. Unless Deputies and Ministers put themselves in a moral position to give a lead to the country, they cannot lead it away from the precipice, with a deficit of over £8,000,000 in the Budget this year, and with the trend to increase, and likely to run up to £12,000,000 next year.  What is going to be done?  Is it not better to begin this year and not as Deputy Childers said, to defer a decision for another year?  I say that nothing can be said until we put our own house in order, and I suggest that we should commence here.  Then we will be in a better moral position to ask the people to work harder or to make sacrifices of some sort.  Sacrifices must be made. We cannot go on living up to the standard of countries that are four times better off than we are.  Supposing I tried to live up to the same standard as a Minister, I would be bankrupt in three months.  If a Minister tried to live up to the standard say, of the President, he could not afford it.  The position is the same with regard to this country.  If we try to live up to a standard that the nation cannot afford, then the nation will go down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot ask our people to make sacrifices unless we are prepared to make them ourselves.  If we are not prepared to do that, then I suggest that we should get out and leave it to people who will do it.  I do not agree that there is any sacrifice in doing that. Sacrifices were made by our forefathers, and this generation is entitled to do a little in that way.  All they are asked to do is to preserve what has been gained.  If we are going to put the country into a state of bankruptcy, now that we have the management of affairs in our own hands, it will not be any great credit to this generation.  I was speaking recently to a gentleman in Northern Ireland, with whom I have been acquainted for some time, and he asked me how we were getting on in Dáil Eireann.  I told him that we were doing our best, but that we could not hope to get on very well until Northern <Col N="2549" /> Ireland joined us.  He told me that there was not much chance of that, and he mentioned that he had heard that the salaries of Deputies had been increased.</P>

      <P>They are not going to come in with us unless they find it to their advantage, and unless they see if it is likely that we will make a success of the Twenty-Six Counties. We will not be able to do that unless we live within our means.  Every nation must try to live within its means, or otherwise must tighten its belt.  It is better to do it before the crash comes.  Agriculture is now on the dole, just as every other industry here.  Agriculture was to be derated. Before he came into office the Minister was very eloquent in promising derating for agriculture, but when he got to the Front Government Bench and became Minister for Finance he could find millions for everything but for the relief of the one industry that really mattered.  Now, instead of being able to derate agricultural land, he is unable to balance the Budget, although the country is taxed to the hilt, and 125,000 farmers are in such a position that they can make no use of their land for want of capital. What a beautiful prospect that is for raising revenue in future!  Where is revenue to come from unless agriculture is made prosperous?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told that the Minister had great difficulty in making up his Budget this year.  There will be greater difficulty as the years pass unless there is a change, and the unfortunate citizens will have bigger difficulties in trying to make up their <Col N="2550" /> own budgets.  For that reason, I suggest that the position should be seriously considered, and that we should begin now by putting our own house in order.  If we do that, there will be some chance for the country. There is a weakness in the Irish character whereby the people never like to acknowledge that they made a mistake.  If they are wrong once they continue in that way.  That is a serious weakness, and is one that we must try to overcome.  We must admit that it was a mistake to increase Deputies' allowances, and to provide extravagant pensions for Ministers at a time when the country was not able to make ends meet.</P>

      <P>I will not press the point but, as I have mentioned it, it is worthy of consideration.  I am afraid it will be difficult for the Minister to find the wherewithal to balance future Budgets unless he considers the suggestion.  I strongly appeal to all Parties to do something to bring about better conditions in agriculture, to try to cut down taxation to the lowest level, to provide employment for the people that will be useful and productive, and that will be a benefit not only to them but to the nation as a whole. In that way, production could be increased, the people enabled to recover their position, and be able to meet the burden of taxation.  We all know that when money is expended taxes have to be raised, but there should be no necessity for half the expenditure if all the silly schemes started by the Government were scrapped.  Scheme after scheme has been started, and officials to deal with them have multiplied.  Instead of being any benefit these officials have only added to the difficulties that farmers, business people, and others <Col N="2551" /> had already.  There are more forms to be filled by the business people in some cases than would take up the time of a dozen clerks.  That is waste of time and waste of energy.  It is tiresome, and it is disheartening the people.  All these nonsensical schemes are only wasting the taxpayers' money.  So far as possible everyone should be allowed to carry on his industry with the minimum of interference, but the policy of the present Government is to have the maximum of interference.  They will not allow anybody to do anything except as directed from some Government office in Dublin, and in order to enable all this work to be carried out from those offices they are multiplying the number of officials.  They are also multiplying the number of pensioners down the country.  People are getting pensions for anything and everything, and there is hardly anyone left in the country to produce anything.  The few who are left on the land, finding that they are in the position of having to carry the whole burden, are trying to get out of it.  They feel that their only chance is to escape.  I think it is time that a change should be made, and I do appeal to all sides of the House to put their heads together and try and do something to bring about a change before the country goes completely to ruin.  It has gone far enough on the road to ruin, and the red light is now showing.  Before things have got completely out of hand, the Government should try and do something to put the country right.</P>

      <P>No doubt, this was a gloomy place to sit during the last three or four days and, unfortunately, I sat here during most of the debate. I spent a good many weeks in Mountjoy Prison in past years, and I would prefer to spend a week in that prison again rather than sit through a Budget debate as gloomy as this one.  From the statements of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, anyone who cannot see financial trouble coming in the near future is pretty blind.  Of course the unfortunate thing is that reason hardly <Col N="2552" /> ever comes to the people of this country until poverty stares them in the face.  If the Minister had only seen reason four or five years ago this country would have been saved a great deal of money and trouble.  Extravagance, either in private or public affairs, is always the forerunner of financial trouble.  Anyone we know throughout our lives who lived in a fast, riotous way, no matter how much money he had at his disposal, suffered a financial crash, and his last state was worse than his first.  The extravagance of the present Government is exactly in keeping with that of a wildly extravagant man in the country.  They flung money here and there and every where, with the result that the till is almost empty, and to-day they have to look hither and thither to see where they can get extra money.  As the Minister for Finance himself said, the till is drying up.  I would almost say it is good for this country that it is, because I always said that until Fianna Fáil were not able to jingle two pennies together they would carry on in their wild, extravagant way.  Of course, it may be said that they got a majority at the first election, at the second election and at the third election. Of course, we must blame the people for a lot of it; the people, with their eyes open, put this Government into power, and must take a lot of the blame.  They threw away the substance for the shadow, and they have been following that shadow ever since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce came in here with a bombastic kind of speech, and tried absolutely to overpower the whole lot of us.  In his wisdom, he knew all things.  He even lectured the farmers.  A man who perhaps never worked a week outside the City of Dublin in his life, who never perhaps saw a field of turnips or mangolds or potatoes in his life, came in here and told the farmers how they can make money.  That is the man who for the last six or eight years has carried on one of the most extravagant policies that this or any other country ever experienced; the man who has been responsible for the starting of wild cat schemes of all sorts, which <Col N="2553" /> have turned out to be absolute failures. Not alone were tens of thousands of pounds involved, but hundreds of thousands, or I might say millions.  He started off with the alcohol factories, which were huge white elephants. There, hundreds of thousands of pounds went west.  Then we had the beet factories&mdash;three or four new white elephants.  Most of the people who are growing beet tell us they cannot get a living out of it, but of course the Government must go on with their wild cat scheme.  They then started the meat factory in Roscrea&mdash;another great scheme.  It has gone, and a few hundred thousand pounds have gone into the pockets of a few rich gentlemen. Then we had the oil refineries. We were to have crude oil made into all classes of oil.  Where are those oil refineries to-day?  That scheme has gone, too.  Then we had the great scheme of slaughtering the calves&mdash;the greatest failure and the greatest curse that ever came to this country.  Then the Minister for Industry and Commerce comes in here and lectures us as to what we should do on the land.  It would be far better if he would mind his own Department in the way the people want him to mind it.</P>
    <P>We were challenged by the Minister for Finance as to what we would do with the social services, and what we would do with the old age pensions. We were asked if we would cut them down.  I should like to talk straight on this matter, because I am a member of a board of health, and can see what the social services are.  I do stand for decent social services, but I do not stand for wild, mad extravagance. Your social services have been the cause of a good deal of the flight from the land.  We know that the social services in the towns and cities are far in advance of the decent people in the country, who should come before the towns and the cities. You have housing&mdash;I agree with good housing&mdash;you have water, sewerage, lighting, heating and all those things in towns.  Is it not a fact that you have gone far too fast as regards those social services?  Is it not a fact that, while you are giving those social services to the towns at huge expense <Col N="2554" /> to the country, our farmers are in a deplorable state?  Their sons and daughters are leaving the land, and going into the towns and cities to get the benefit of those social services. You are building up in this country a huge city&mdash;the City of Dublin.  Ten or 15 years ago it was quite an ordinary city, but to-day you have here all types of people&mdash;country people, city people, internationalists of all denominations and all colours, all coming in here and getting the benefit of our huge social services. They are living here in a grand and joyous manner, while the people who are entitled to at least a fair share of those social services have to go without the necessaries of life.  Is it not a fact that, instead of rushing through all those social services at a cost of millions and millions of pounds, it would be far better to have decent bread and butter on the tables of our country people.  I believe that if you said to one of those people:&mdash;&ldquo;You are living in a poor old shack of a house to-day.  Would you prefer to have a new house, or decent bread and butter on your table and shelter and clothing for your children?&rdquo;  he would say: &ldquo;I would rather lie at the back of a ditch than do without decent food for my children and myself.&rdquo;  No consideration is given to that.  While there is all this rush of building, you are making a derelict country of our great and fair land.</P>
    <P>I think it is time that a halt should be cried to this mad rush to the towns and cities, for which the Government of this country are directly responsible.  How can you expect any decent young man or girl to stay in the poverty-stricken country to-day while they can come into the town where, by the mere turn of a tap, they can get cold water and hot water, where they can press a button and have light, and where they can avail of all the other amenities? Surely to God it is time we woke up and realised that the people in the country cannot have those things. First things should come first.  The people who produce on the land are the people who should get the first benefits from this State, but that is <Col N="2555" /> not happening.  I accuse the Government of being directly responsible for the flight from the land.  Of course, one might as well be talking to the wall as talking to some of them, because they know nothing about country life.  They would rather swank around in swanky cars out to Bray and Dalkey and Howth.  When they go across the Channel you will see travelling by their side their tall hat in its lovely case.  They have their spats and white fronts when they skip, through Paris and Rome.  I would rather see that tall hat thrown into the Liffey, and see them going to the farmers' homes to find out what they wear.  They have not got tall hats. They have ragged old trousers and no hats at all.  If they have a hat you can see the hair growing out through it.  I would like you to realise that this is going on all over the country, and I say to the eight or nine on the front bench opposite that they are directly responsible for all this.  It must stop.  The wild Minister of 1932 is now the sober Minister of 1939, standing directly behind the banks and the Banking Commission's Report. That is a big turn over, and I am glad it has taken place, but it has taken place far too late.  We in this nation are living beyond our means, and the Government is setting the headline. As individuals we are all living beyond our means, and whether we like it or not, whether we have to come back to &ldquo;praties and salt&rdquo; or not, we have got to face the facts and let people know that we realise what ought to be done.</P>
    <P>The coming year will bring a financial crisis and it may mean the overthrow of this Government.  That in itself would be a disaster, because I believe that the people, with their eyes open, put this Government into office, and I think it is only right to let the Government live through its whole period and let the blister be borne by those who put them in.  However, even though we may like to let some people suffer, we have got to remember that there are other people who are being made to come into line.  We know that the <Col N="2556" /> people who swung the present Government in are an irresponsible section of the community who have nothing to worry about and nothing to lose.  I am sorry that the Government&mdash;who should be a wise and learned Government&mdash;is hearkening to the appeal of that mob.  The job to-day is to get away from that section and tell them, as they were told eight years ago, that it is a man's duty to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow and that it is not fair that one section should be living at the expense of another.  The farmers are working from morning to night to carry, not only their own heavy loads, but the load of 107,000 unemployed men, on their backs.  It is time the Government realised that it must do something to put those 107,000 men working, earning their own living. There is no use in saying that it cannot be done.  I say that it can.  There should be no idle man in this country except the aged and infirm or those destitute and unable to work.  We would like to see the social services extended, but not by way of giving millions and millions of pounds to support idle men.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate to see half of the labour power of this country living as State paupers, going into the towns to get a few shillings for livelihood.  They go into the towns, five, six or eight miles, on bicycles, stand around there from morning to night and collect 8/- or 10/-, and yet have not 2/- in their pockets when they come home, because there are too many enticements to get them to spend their money.  Instead of bringing it home to hungry families it goes sometimes into the tipster's shop. I say that it is time the Government woke up: they should awaken before it is too late.</P>
    <P>We also heard the Minister for Finance tell what the Government is doing in regard to old age pensions, but I accuse the Government of being responsible for the huge number of people who are applying for old age pensions to-day.  Twenty or 30 years ago when this Old Age Pensions Act came into force, would any decent son allow the father who had reared him so well apply for 8/- or 10/- to live at the <Col N="2557" /> State's expense?  No, he would not. Any decent son&mdash;especially if his father was decent and had reared him honestly and well&mdash;would, in his father's old age, be only too proud to forego many of the necessaries of life in order to keep that man in his old age.  However, the whole clamour to-day from all sections of the community is to get something for nothing from the State.  For my part, I would love to see such old men have a decent ending after a hard life, but I do not think that it is fair to see every old man begging to the State to get the old age pension.  It is unfortunate, and I accuse the Government of the responsibility for it.  These people with decent farms of land have been brought to the verge of destruction and are crying for help, and fathers who, in the ordinary course of events, would never dare to look for money to the State, have now got to beg to them for it.</P>
    <P>This is the state of affairs to which the Government has brought this country, this Irish country which has cost so much blood and tears in the obtaining of its freedom from the Saxon yoke.  Are we sure that it is free?  Remember, the Fianna Fáil yoke is more severe than the Saxon yoke ever was.  I think it is time that our whole people woke up and realised that our freedom is nothing more than humbug and tomfoolery.  It is time that the people of this country were given a chance to earn their living in a decent honest way; it is time to get rid of this idea of State pauperism for 50 per cent of our people; and come back to the old Christian solution that every man has to earn his bread by the sweat of his brow.  It is nothing more than ten years of fake nationalism and hypocrisy that has brought us to our present condition.  It is &ldquo;Up the Republic&rdquo; and &ldquo;up&rdquo; this and &ldquo;up&rdquo; everything else; and &ldquo;Up the Republic&rdquo; put up the price of bread, butter, sugar and other things for the poor man, and down went the unfortunate workman's wages.  Yes, we fixed the wages for the labouring man.  How many men were the wages fixed for?  I know honest and good men who had their wages fixed for them.</P>

      <P>I knew a man who had given eight or ten years of good service to a farmer and the moment that wages were fixed that farmer had to put the man out and take in another man, to whom he could give a smaller wage.  There is the result of the fixed wages.  It would be far better to let the farmer and the worker go their own way and live their own lives in the old way, when a farmer ploughed the worker's garden, gave him seed to sow, gave him meat for his children and gave him the grass of a cow.  The fixed wages destroyed all that, and men have to live to-day in a far worse condition than previously.</P>
      <P>No matter what may be said in this House regarding social services or old age pensions, it is all fake and humbug. Every man&mdash;whether on this side of the House or on the other side&mdash; stands for an honest living for our poor and our infirm, but at present you have the nation looking to the State for assistance.  Our people must be brought back to the old principle of self-reliance, with everyone living in his own way without let or hindrance from the hordes of officials who are bleeding the country white.  New schemes are brought in and then hundreds of State-paid officials are employed to work those schemes, and the last stage is worse than the first.  I say, as Deputy McGovern said, start at the top and pare right down, so that we may be a nation once again, and that as comrades we may govern this country as a Christian State, giving everybody a fair crack of the whip.  But you are making it a preserve for a certain type of people, such as the State official who has his big salary and who, at the end of ten or 15 years, can retire with a secure pension and mix in the different social circles and get his family into these circles.  That is a vicious circle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we want to see is fair play for all the people, whether rich or poor. The only way to do that is to let the people alone, give the people the freedom they had even in the worst British <Col N="2559" /> times, so that they can work their farms in their own way.  The more you meddled with their affairs, the more you helped to destroy their living, with the result that there is a conglomeration of people who have flocked to Dublin, living in God knows what way, but certainly not in as honest a way as the people in the country.  There is a lot of financial &ldquo;crookery&rdquo; going on in Dublin.  There is a lot of people living very &ldquo;soft&rdquo; here.  They have £5 to-day and £10,000 to-morrow.  Is that just?  They are coming from all parts of the earth, so that you do not know what they are.  I should like to have a census taken in Dublin to see who are Dublin people.  Instead of providing social services for the people who want to flock into the City of Dublin, I should like the Government to stop this game and to get the sons and daughters of the farmers, who flocked to Dublin during the last three or four years, back to the land where they may have a plain and humble way of living, but at any rate, it will be honest.</P>
    <P>If we in the country want a servant girl we cannot get one.  We may get one for two or three months, but when she has got a certain training she goes off to Dublin or to England, where she has electric cookers, electric irons, electric sweepers, electric fans, and everything else.  If she loses her job, does anybody think she will go back to the country where she will have to milk cows or feed calves or scrub floors?  No, she will not.  The fact is that you want to make Dublin nothing but a city of &ldquo;dandies.&rdquo;  Our young girls are flocking to Dublin and they come back to the country done up with rouge and lipstick and with fancy high-heeled shoes and absolutely set the country people mad.  Every young girl in the country of 12 or 14 years is longing for the day when she will be 17 or 18 and can get up to the city and get nicely &ldquo;done up.&rdquo;  These are the things which are facing the country. I know that I shall have to face bad times, as everybody else will, to bring the country back to a decent sense of its responsibility.  I should like to see <Col N="2560" /> it going back 50 years and starting again in a plain, humble, Irish way and not have all these &ldquo;stunts.&rdquo;  We want to be as good as Paris or London; we want to make Dublin better than the whole lot of them. You have done it, but you will live to regret it.</P>
    <P>We are told: &ldquo;We have our freedom and we have our comforts.&rdquo;  Are you sure you have your freedom?  Are you sure that John Bull has not got you in his pocket?  Are you sure that it was not England's opportunity when she put Fianna Fáil into power to carry on with wild extravagance?  You carried on in that way, and to-day John Bull has you in his pocket.  You have no money.  You must go to Threadneedle Street for a few pounds to carry on your services.  John Bull is better off to-day than when he had the British Army here, because you are doing his dirty work.  You have impoverished the country and left it financially tied to England.  There is no use fighting for freedom now.  It is not worth a rap to you.  You are at the mercy of the old bully still.  I suppose it is good enough for the people who put you there, but they will put you out when there is nothing left.  You could have done a good deal in the past to save the country if you wanted to.  But, at the behest of your friend across the water, you put up £7,000,000 or £8,000,000 for a huge Army of 30,000 or 40,000 with bombing planes and quick-firing guns.  For what?  To suit John Bull.  You had to smile at him because you had to raise a few millions to carry on the social services.  We do not want any armies or bombing planes.  What we want is bread-and-butter, and decent comfort in our homes.  Instead of big towns and cities we want the people brought back to the country to work with a spade or a plough and live an honest, clean life.  Instead of spending money on bombs and guns we should spend it on producing the necessaries of life for our people and for any other people who may need our food.</P>
    <P>What you want is straight talking, and you are not getting half enough of it.  If you come down to my county <Col N="2561" /> in the future and try to tell the people what you have done, I will tell them from the same platform what you really have done.  You have destroyed the moral fibre of our people.  Twenty years ago we had people who would fight and die for their country and for freedom.  Would they do that to-day? They would not.  Why should they do it?  We see what our freedom has been brought to.  It is all sham and humbug. You have brought the country to ruin until it is not worth fighting for.  The whole agricultural community is begging of you to do something for them and you will not do it.  You provide bombs and guns and aeroplanes, and then you sneer and jeer at the farmers who came to Dublin a few weeks ago to protest in a clean and manly way that they were not getting a fair crack of the whip.  You called them perambulating farmers who never did an honest day's work.  You came from a foreign land almost&mdash;the City of Belfast.</P>

      <NameTxt>Colonel Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Minister has been very inconsistent of late in comparison with his statement of policy of some years ago, there is one thing for which I must give him credit and that is that he is ever and always perfectly consistent in increasing taxation. Year by year, since Fianna Fáil came into power we have a consistent rise in the Budget.  Each year the amount is greater.  This year the Budget has been very nicely framed with a big increase but it is framed with an eye to politics.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce told us yesterday that they did not put an increased tax on boots, that they put it on income-tax, on petrol and on tobacco.  It is no trouble to go out and tell the ordinary innocent man in the street &ldquo;we did not touch you, we are only taxing the rich.&rdquo;  If one looks at the history of income-tax one finds that the men who are generally taxed on income-tax do not lose much themselves, personally.  To cope with that increase they cut down and lowered all their expenses and they saved what they paid in income-tax in wages and labour or in some way like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Government is doing is that indirectly they are taking the money out of the pockets of somebody else and not really out of the pockets of the rich.  They are very often taking it from the very poorest of the people in this indirect way, the while they are telling the poor man that they are not taxing him.  We know how this tax works out in the case of petrol.  That tax does not so much hit the man with the car.  It affects the big companies, and if we follow the history of those big bus companies we will find that they go on paying dividends just as well after the tax is put on as they did before.  It is not these companies who suffer.  Who suffers?  I think I know who will have to pay the increased fares.  It is the ordinary member of the public, the ordinary individual, the poor man who <Col N="2564" /> will suffer from this tax when he has to travel on a bus.  It is the poor man who will have to pay extra for his goods when these goods are brought to the shopkeeper on petrol-driven lorries.  The same thing has been happening for years.  Now, if we take the case of tobacco, it will be found that this tax hurts very severely the poor man.  The poor man does not smoke cigars.  What he smokes is the ordinary common tobacco.  That is one of the few things in life that he enjoys.  He is not able to afford to go to the pictures or that sort of thing and it is the tax on the ounce or two of tobacco that he smokes in the week that will hurt him.  The Government framed the Budget with the idea that they could go out into the street and tell the ordinary man &ldquo;we did not tax you; we only taxed the rich.&rdquo;  I tell the Government that these three taxes that they say are only on the rich will fall most severely on the poor man.</P>
    <P>We have only to look back at other Budgets and at the history of the Minister and of this Government to find that nearly everything in the line of food and clothing that could be taxed is so heavily taxed that it cannot bear any more.  There has been a tax on sugar, bread, bacon and nearly everything used in the poor man's household.  All the things he uses in his house are taxed one way or another.  If the poor man does not pay direct taxation to the Government, he pays it to the person from whom he buys his foodstuffs because there is a tariff or tax on nearly everything he uses.  Almost everything used to-day by the poor is already heavily taxed and there was not much room for any more direct taxation.  Yet the Minister frightens us when he tells us &ldquo;this may not be the end of taxation this year.&rdquo;  He tells us that he may have to bring in another Budget before the end of the year.  On account of how things in the world are looming and the dangers of a big war, he tells us there is a possibility of further taxation. I hope that is not a fact.  I think the present Budget looks monstrous enough and dangerous enough without having any further taxation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2565" /> Yesterday the Minister for Industry and Commerce talked across to this side of the House, harping at Deputies here and asking them: &ldquo;Do you want to cut the social services?&rdquo;  We do not want to cut down the social services, but it is rather disturbing that their cost should have run so high in this country and, at the same time, strangely enough, everybody who is receiving something from these social services seems to be worse off.  It is extraordinary that we should have an increase of millions in the social services and, at the same time, the people are much worse off than they were seven or eight years ago.  That is one of the disturbing factors in connection with your whole policy, that the people receiving money from the social services are day by day becoming worse off.  That applies to the whole country, and anybody travelling through the country and around the various towns will find that is correct. Even with all the money that is being spent, conditions are not improving and everybody seems to be poor.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House do not stand for the cutting down of social services.  We are just as Christian as the people on the other side of the House.  In the circumstances that exist, we feel that these social services must continue, but we also feel that there can be, and there should be, some savings made.  I hope we are not as mistaken as the Minister for Finance used to be eight years ago when he was here in opposition.  At that time he told the Government how they could save money on public expenditure.  This year we have a vast increase for our Army.  We have the ports we took over from Britain, and we were led to believe that the vast increase for the Army and for those ports is necessary for the defence of the Irish people, at least the people of the Twenty-Six Counties.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Meaney said yesterday that the people on this side of the House did not appear to want to defend this country; that they wanted the British to defend it.  That is what I gathered from the Deputy's speech. I may say definitely that if we want <Col N="2566" /> this country defended we should consider the position very carefully.  What are we putting up defences for, and against whom?  What is the idea of modernising ports and forts?  We have no navy, and whose ships are we going to protect in those parts if a war comes?  We have no ships of our own to protect and I assume that it is British ships that will be protected in these ports, should it be necessary to give protection to any ships.  With our country in its present state, not bankrupt but badly impoverished, I say that if those ports are necessary for Britain's defence, let Britain pay for modernising them.  The poor people of this country should not be asked to pay for modernising them.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to putting up air-raid shelters and protecting the civil population, but I do not believe in building a big army of volunteers and infantry.  If I did, I would like to have it built up to ten times the size that it is at the moment.  Our Army is no protection to this country against any of the big countries in Europe.  I have indicated that our people are impoverished.  Building up an army might be one means of taking people off unemployment assistance, but this money should not be spent on an army until our people are better off.  I believe that this is one of the things we have to pay for the economic settlement we have had with Britain. I believe this is one of the ways in which we are paying for that, and that it is part of the settlement.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce told us yesterday that we had 140,000 more acres tilled.  I would like the Minister for Finance to ask the Minister for Agriculture how much less tillage he is likely to have this year than last year and how much less will we have in the season that follows this one.  I am sure the Minister for Industry and Commerce has taken into account the new grasses and the second year grasses.  The new grasses sown in most parts of this country last year and the year before have had this effect, that if the people who sowed them can help it, they will never go back to tillage again.  I am sorry to <Col N="2567" /> see that happening, but it is happening in some of the best of the tillage districts. We have a huge increase in dairy cows.</P>
    <P>There is more of the bluff.  We are told there is an increase of £30,000,000 in the value of our industrial output. It is extraordinary if we have that increase when we are exporting less in industrial products than we were seven years ago.  How does that come about, I wonder?  The Minister at one time used to say a lot about factories closing when Fine Gael was in power.  He used to quote that repeatedly.  We do not hear a word about the factories that are being and have been closed during the term of office of Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce says we have not increased our dead-weight debt.  Surely, no one will believe that?  I take it that our dead-weight debt applies to all the local bodies, as well as to the central government.  Amongst the local bodies there has been a huge increase, and it looks to me lately as if it has been difficult for the local bodies to find money.  I know of cottage schemes in connection with which everything is ready, and has been ready for over a year, and yet the schemes have not been started.  People are pressing for the cottages and the boards of health have approached the Minister, but there is no sign of the houses being built.  The dead-weight debt on the local bodies has been brought about by the policy of the Government.</P>
    <P>I admit there has been a lot of good work done in the way of house-building, but, because of the Government's policy, each building has cost 30 to 35 per cent. more than it should have cost. Everything that went into each building from the very foundations to the top of the chimney was a third dearer than it should be.  I advise the Minister before he raises taxation further to look closely into the cost and utility of the Army and see if it could not be cut down by half.  He used to tell us that it was a toy Army and could be reduced to almost nil.  The <Col N="2568" /> same way with every other public Department.  I admit that with the different trend in world events there are perhaps some more inspectors necessary than there used to be, but I still hold that 50 per cent. of the inspectors parading this country are not necessary.  That applies to every Department.</P>
    <P>I believe that a great deal more than £1,000,000 could be saved, if the Minister examined closely into the different Government Departments, with a view to finding economies.  I hold that economies could also be made in connection with the employment of inspectors, who are interfering with the ordinary lives of every man, woman and child in the country.  When schemes put up by Departments, and in which inspectors were employed were scrapped these inspectors were not scrapped.  They were shifted to some other scheme, and they are still in the employment of the State.  The same thing applies to the Government's policy concerning county councils.  I say that a big saving could be effected under that heading, and a big saving could also be effected in the Army.  If the Minister does not try to effect economies in the future, instead of consistently increasing taxation, there will be a revolt, because the country cannot continue to bear such taxation.  I hold that the position of this country is sound, and that it can be saved by not increasing taxation.  I believe that that can be done, and it is for the Minister to find a way to do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I look upon this as the most disappointing Budget yet brought in by the Fianna Fáil Government. After seven years of office, and after promising the people in 1932 that when they came in they would reduce taxation by £2,000,000, we find that, although we had an economic war for four or five years during the progress of which the Government should be excused, for the increased taxation, the farmers, who were in the front line trenches, and other sections of the community, are now paying the cost.  It cost this country a big sum of money and, according to Fianna Fáil, the war was won: It was won at great expense <Col N="2569" /> to the people.  When a settlement was effected we were told by the Taoiseach, and by members of the Government, that it was a good settlement, and that this country had been saved an annual payment of something like £5,500,000. Surely if this country has been saved that payment annually by the settlement, the people are now entitled to a reduction in taxation.  Instead of that we find taxation very much increased, and we must now face a bill for some thing like £35,000,000 to run this country.  After the miseries and misfortunes that the farmers went through during the economic war they now find themselves in a worse position.  It is always the case after a war that the people find themselves in a worse position for a number of years.  That is the position of the farming community here to-day.  They find themselves almost bankrupt.  It is well known to the Government and to Deputies that the deplorable state of the agricultural community is due to the economic war and to the policy of the present Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same Government has got authority to spend something like £7,000,000 or £8,000,000 of money on national defence.  It would be more fitting for the Government to scrap all the talk about re-armament, bombing planes, and anti-war craft guns that are to cost huge sums of money.  That money could be better spent by trying to increase agricultural production.  It is no wonder that young men and young women who had always got a livelihood in the agricultural industry are flying from the land, seeing that there is no living to be got on it now. Going around the country to-day and visiting farm houses one does not notice two or three sows or 20 or 30 pigs in the farmyards.  There are very few pigs in the country.  We have now to import bacon from England, and it is selling in Dublin and in Cork at a price that is beyond the capacity of the people to pay.  I know for a fact that a piece of Irish bacon has not gone into the homes of some of the working class people in my part of the country for five or six years.  If one goes into a retail shop for a pound of rashers the price is 1s. 11d.  That is due to the <Col N="2570" /> policy of the Government in handing the bacon industry over to a ring.  In fact it is costing £80,000 yearly to transport pigs from one county to another.  That is a disgraceful state of affairs.  We have committees of agriculture in every county, and we have as well the Department of Agriculture, which is costing between £600,000 and £700,000 a year.  What are they doing for the bacon industry?  The Department and the Minister have ruined the industry.</P>
    <P>What have they done to bring back the poultry industry to its former position?  Then it brought in £2,300,000 yearly instead of £800,000 for the past few years.  This Government, that claimed some years ago to be the Government of the poor man, has raised the price of tobacco, the only luxury left to the poor man.  He must now pay 1/7 for two ounces of tobacco in order that we may be able to defend this country from Great Britain.  I can see no other reason.  I do not know of any other great Power that wants to attack us.  The poor man is to be asked to pay one penny more on every two ounces of tobacco so that we can get anti-aircraft guns and bombing planes.  It is a wonder the Government did not think of building a fleet.  It is also intended to put a tax on imports of bicycle frames.  Is it the intention to grant a monopoly to any particular firm or to any group that proceeds to manufacture cycle frames?</P>

      <P>Petrol has been increased by 2d. a gallon, and I hold that that is a great burden, particularly on taxi-men who are making their living by their motor cars.  They will have to increase their prices, and I believe that that will result in less business for <Col N="2571" /> them.  As I have said, this is the most disappointing Budget since Fianna Fáil came into office.  This year the people expected a reduction in taxation because, as stated by the Taoiseach and members of the Government, this country, by the settlement made with Great Britain, was relieved of an annual payment of £5,500,000. Surely it was reasonable for the people to expect a reduction in taxation as a result of that settlement.  I believe that the people will not be able to carry on and to meet all this additional taxation.</P>
      <P>We heard a lot about increased social services but I cannot see very much increase in the social service. We have more unemployed to-day than we had seven or eight years ago.  You have unfortunate men looking for work and being unable to find it.  They have to go four or five miles into the towns to sign three or four days a week for a paltry 10/- or 12/- wherewith to maintain their wives and families. Even men who are working and who are receiving from 30/- to 35/- a week find it impossible to maintain their households owing to the increased taxation.  Since this Government came into power, all the necessaries of life have been increased in price, and that has affected the poor especially.  Their flour, butter, bread, sugar and bacon are being increased in price.  It is impossible for a poor man to go into a shop and attempt to buy bacon now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his statement, the Minister explained that the Forestry Department were asking for £186,000 this year.  That seems a very small amount. If it were £1,180,000, the money would be well spent because it would be giving employment to men who would be otherwise idling about the country or working for 10/- or 12/- and endeavouring to keep their families on that amount.  The sum should be £1,180,000.  You will find that, before the end of this month, the Forestry Department will be dismissing their men from all the centres.  These men, when they are dismissed and when they make application for unemployment assistance, will be told that they have <Col N="2572" /> no business into that office until next October.  The only source of employment for them will be on the land. It is well known to the Government that farmers at the present time are not in a position to pay, labour. Deputy Childers, in his speech, suggested that the Government should subsidise farm labour and help the farmers, in that way, to employ additional men on the land.  I think that the Ministry should give that suggestion their earnest consideration.  The people will not be able to continue for long to meet all the taxation that is being placed upon them.  If something is not done for the agricultural community you will have here very soon a state of affairs which it will take more than a Treason Bill to remedy.</P>

      <P>I was talking about the previous Budgets.  It is also said that, when a national calamity befalls a people, the first seven years are always the worst.  I was hoping that the seven Budgets we have gone through and the fiscal flagellation we have got from the Minister would have satisfied him and that we would be able to look forward to something better in the future.  I am sorry to say that, from the general trend of his remarks and the general spirit in which the Budget was conceived, the outlook is not as bright as we would like it to be.  In fact, I think the Minister himself told us that it was one of very great gloom indeed.  We should ask ourselves why it is necessary <Col N="2573" /> at all to have the impositions upon the people increased to the extent to which they are being increased in the present Budget.  No new social services have been created during the past 12 months.  Certain provisions have, if you like, been made for defence which, whether it is going to cost us £5 or £5,000,000, will be equally inadequate.  This country ought to weigh the matter up very carefully before plunging itself into commitments with regard to defence.  However, I am not one of those who would like to see this country defended by anybody else.  I think we should defend ourselves if defence be necessary, but I do not think that the time will ever come when it will be necessary for us to defend this country because it would not be worth anybody's while to attack this country except as a jumping-off ground for some bigger operation. That is not likely to happen.  We have a neighbour whose future is going to be highly imperilled if there is European conflagration, and it will be up to that country, with its unlimited resources, to defend itself.  In the course of that defence, it will necessarily, whether it likes it or not, have to defend us also. It will have to defend us to the extent of preventing this country from being made the jumping-off ground for anybody going to attack itself.  Our natural attitude is to keep out of war. At the same time I think the Government is fairly wise&mdash;although, from the practical point of view, I do not agree with the steps they are actually taking, with regard to defence&mdash;in keeping the position before them; I think they are wise in keeping the people's minds not necessarily alarmed but at the same time fixed on the gravity of the situation surrounding us at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are called upon this year to meet a total expenditure&mdash;I am quoting the Minister's figures&mdash;of £37,716,000.  Let us go back to the year 1932, and the seven intervening years.  In 1932 the total expenditure was £25,496,419.  There is, therefore, £12,000,000 more expenditure in the country this year than seven years ago. Is it any harm to say that the first seven years of the Fianna Fáil <Col N="2574" /> Administration were, we hope, the worst?  All that time we have deliberately damaged not alone the position of the country with regard to its basic industry, but we have damaged the country very much from the point of view of its credit, and we have mortgaged its future in a very harmful way.  The Minister this year is budgeting for a sum of £1,180,000 extra on top of the present taxation. That does not seem a great lot of money, but it appears to me that it is money which could easily be saved if there were careful administration, even with the resources at our disposal and the taxes which are already being collected.  We have heard here that this expenditure is due to increased social services.  I should like to ask what are those social services? Are there any new social services which were not in being last year?  No, but there has been extravagance; there has been bad handling; there has been.  I might say, actual mishandling of the social services.</P>
    <P>The Vote for Primary Education this year has gone up by £700,000; it has gone from £4,600,000 to £5,300,000, in round figures, and this at a time when schools in the country are being closed down owing to the want of students; when the school-going population of the primary schools has gone down by not less than 42,000 children; at a time when over 700 trained teachers cannot get positions because of the fact that the averages in the schools have gone down, and the number of schools is decreasing.  There must be something wrong.  Some blame has been thrown on the Labour Party and on some people at this side of the House because we asked for free school books for necessitous children.  That certainly would not run away with £700,000.  We are told that certain &ldquo;cuts&rdquo; are being restored to the teachers.  That is not going to run away with £700,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>But where is the other 75 per cent?  I cannot see that there is any reason why that Vote should be increased by that amount.  I do not want to cut down education.  It is one of the things on which I should like to see very little parsimony or cheeseparing. Look at the Vote for Unemployment Assistance and the Vote for Relief Schemes.  Unemployment assistance and relief schemes run away with £2,250,000.  Will anybody here in this House get up and say that that is productive work, and that there is no opportunity there for making some economy?  As long as you are paying over £1,000,000 to men in this country to remain idle you will not solve the unemployment problem.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance told us here that he was at the end of his tether&mdash;that he found it very difficult to get useful schemes on which to spend money for the relief of unemployment.  When a man with all the energy and the resources of the Parliamentary Secretary finds it difficult to solve that problem, after all the attention, all the care, all the study and application he has given to it, I think it becomes a very serious problem for this country. Those Votes run away with £2,250,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I went through some of the other Votes I think it would be possible to point to some extravagances or mismanagement. At all events this year we are going to spend £37,716,000 as against £25,496,419 in the year 1932.  I would ask anybody here in this House now, a year after the economic war ended, to tell us whether this country is in a better position to-day than it was in 1932.  I do not think anybody will say that it is.  That is not the worst aspect of the case.  The capital commitments of this country are enormous.  I think the Minister told us <Col N="2576" /> in his opening statement that the increase of 48 per cent. in one year is a matter which must be of grave concern to a person in the position of Chancellor of the Exchequer.  The position to-day is that the capital obligations of this country have gone up to over £76,000,000.  In 1932 they were £48,878,000.  There is a big increase there.  I say that those obligations have come upon us at a time when the country is getting poorer and poorer.  In addition to that, there is the matter of the local authorities' liabilities.  Their capital obligations have gone up from £15,750,000 to £28,000,000.  We will see, therefore, that this country has been run in a very extravagant way, and has been spending its capital in a way which is not justified by the resources of the country.</P>
    <P>I was about to say that I was much impressed by the speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce; I should rather say that, I was very much impressed by the manner in which it was delivered, and the blatant way in which he tried to put over things which are far from the truth.  Whenever I hear the Minister for Industry and Commerce telling us how grand things are in the country, and how buoyant our credit is, I feel that there is something wrong, something which calls for careful examination. He is a remarkable man for making up a fine brass band statement about a bad case.  I think he has done so on this Budget.  I was impressed by one fact to which he referred&mdash;but which he did not live up to, and which this Budget does not square with&mdash;and that is the fact that the country should be run in a businesslike way.  I should like to see any business which could be run as this country has been run&mdash; by eating into its capital, day after day, without building up a reserve of any description.  The Minister postulates that there is no bottom to the pocket of the taxpayer in this country. As long as we can keep dipping our hands into other peoples' pockets it is easy to run any country.  It is easy to run it in a very extravagant way, without any regard to its resources.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2577" /> There is one very important point with regard to the resources of this country.  There is only one industry in this country which can carry on successfully, and that is the agricultural industry.  When this country's gross agricultural output was £67,000,000 our expenditure was only about £25,000,000. To-day the gross output of agriculture is down to £42,000,000, and our expenditure is up to £37,000,000.  That £37,000,000 is purely national expenditure. What about the local expenditure? What about the rates raised on the £12,000,000 valuation?  I would say that the rate works out at an average of 15/- in this country.  If that is computed it will be seen that nearly £9,000,000 are raised in local taxation. That amount must be found on top of this expenditure of £37,750,000 this year.  In the seven lean years, about which we have been complaining, our agricultural exports have fallen from £32,000,000 to £13,000,000.</P>
    <P>The Minister provided us with an interesting White Paper in which there are several tables.  Therein Table VIII is supposed to represent the amount of money that flowed into the pockets of the farmers as a result of Fianna Fáil policy.  He does not say this is money given to them, but that it comes directly from <i>ad hoc</i> legislation for the improvement of agriculture.  The total with regard to wheat is £1,900,000 which, the Minister says redounds to the credit of the farmer out of what he calls the wheat scheme.  It would be interesting to inquire how much of that money is kept in the pockets of the farmer.</P>
    <P>Last year we produced 250,000 acres of wheat and I do not think the farmers' share of the subsidy over and above the actual value of the wheat amounted to £3 an acre.  On the assumption that it was £3, the farmers got something less than £800,000 out of it.  Even £1,900,000, I think, is an under-estimate of the actual amount of money that this wheat scheme cost the country.  The present price of flour in this country is really £1 more than the price it ought to be, and we use 2,600,000 sacks each year.  That means that the consumers of bread are paying <Col N="2578" /> the extra price of over £2,600,000. Instead of calling this a wheat scheme, I think the Government ought to change their minds and outlook and call it a millers' endowment scheme. The millers are getting the full advantage of it.  I will concede that the millers have certain financial difficulties, having to provide extra capital and buildings, finance purchases and pay carriage, but, at the same time, when there is a sum of £2,600,000 to play with a lot of it goes into the extra cost of bread.  When we realise that the farmer gets only £800,000 over world price as subsidy, there is surely in that way a very nice margin in the balance for the millers.</P>
    <P>That is a tax on the people's food&mdash; a tax that has not been levied by the Dáil, but which is paid direct by the people in the extra cost of their food. When I stated something about this previously to the Minister he told me there were no taxes on food in this country.  Of course, there are no Budget taxes on food&mdash;no taxes on tea or sugar (except in so far as imported sugar at 7/11 per cwt. is concerned)&mdash;but people are paying extra prices for necessary commodities such as bread, flour, bacon, milk and butter.</P>
    <P>I need not deal with the bacon business: that has been dealt with by various other speakers.  I will quote one instance that has come before me with regard to the discrepancy between the price of bacon and the price of the pig.  The Minister refers to the increase in the value of home-produced bacon to the &ldquo;producers.&rdquo; And he quotes in Table VIII the figure of £1,300,000.  That sum, however, does not go to the farmers at all.  I happened to be in a poor town in Kerry, a town very near to the residence of one of the members of this House, Deputy John Flynn.  When I was in a little shop I noticed the assistant was selling a pound of rashers and the price was 2/-.  Being interested in the business, I made inquiries, asking was it easy to get people to pay such a big price for rashers and the assistant told me that she had to charge that price. Eventually she showed me the invoice <Col N="2579" /> from a Trade bacon company and the invoiced price was 170/- per cwt! Now, the top price that the farmers in Kerry were getting for pigs at that time was 63/- per cwt.  Between 63/- and 170/- there was certainly something for the &ldquo;producer&rdquo; of bacon, but certainly nothing for the producer of the pig.  How long will this go on?</P>
    <P>Deputy Daly a few minutes ago referred to foreign bacon in Cork.  They are actually producing too many pigs in Cork at present and cannot get them cured, and yet we are importing foreign bacon.  We have a Pigs Board, and we have had the Minister talking about &ldquo;perambulating farmers;&rdquo; but we have &ldquo;perambulating pigs&rdquo; now, since it is costing £80,000 per annum to distribute those pigs!  Even pigs that may be reared and fattened in one part of the country may be sent 80 or 100 miles away or further to be cured. That is extravagance, and reacts eventually on the consumer who always pays.</P>
    <P>My viewpoint is that in addition to the real Budget of taxation falling on the people there are hidden taxes of a hideous kind hitting the consumer of goods, especially foodstuffs, in a very grave way.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce told us yesterday about the great increase there has been in the number of people absorbed into industry.  He never told us about the increase in the number of unemployed, nor did he explain why, while there has been an increase in gross output, there has been no impression made on the hard core of unemployment.  He has not explained why, if the output has increased, there is no diminution in the number of unemployed.  Industrial output is up by over £32,500,000 from 1931 to 1937.  That is a very big increase, and yet there are over 100,000 unemployed.  Where has all that money gone?  On going through the country, there is no evidence to be found in the small towns of any sort of industrial life&mdash;they are stagnant and decayed, the population is going and the little trade they had is gone. I will concede that there are certain people in Dublin who are getting <Col N="2580" /> monopolies of certain industries, and I must believe from the facts that most of this £32,500,000 extra gross output of industry is finding its way into the pockets of the small select few.  This Government is gathering around it a number of people who are battening upon it and upon its industrial policy, men whom I have described in this House as having fingers dripping with the fat of tariffs, who are deriving benefits from the monopolistic policy of the Government.</P>
    <P>Industry generally has gone down, the small towns are decaying, Dublin is expanding and a certain small number of monopolies are reaping benefits from the higher prices obtained through hidden taxes that have fallen upon the people for the increased cost of supporting those industries.  These new taxes that the Minister has levied in his Budget are indicative of the poverty of the country. Deputy Corry made a statement that he was sorry income tax was not more than it is.  That is a reckless, callous, brutal sort of statement for a Deputy to make.  No man should be sorry that taxes are not greater.  I am sure even the Minister himself is very sad and very worried that it has been necessary to tax anybody.  I am sure it is no pleasure to him to extract extra money out of the pockets of the people who are ill able to afford it. That such a statement as that should have gone unchallenged shows the sort of channel into which we are drifting with disregard for the people outside the House.</P>
    <P>Income-tax is the one tax which hits every section of the community.  It is not alone people with incomes of a certain amount who pay income-tax. It hits industry, because, if trade is saddled with a high income-tax, trade naturally suffers.  The industry from which it is extracted suffers.  The earning power of the industry suffers; and the employment-bearing capacity of the industry is bound to suffer.  So on through the whole gamut of the community.  Income-tax is a thing which comes back on everybody, even on those who never knew what income-tax is.  Every industry that is <Col N="2581" /> saddled with income-tax will suffer by that extra shilling.  That extra shilling is nearly 25 per cent. of the existing tax, and one &ldquo;wallop&rdquo; of a 25 per cent. increase on an already high tax is sufficient to blister people very much indeed.</P>
    <P>The petrol tax is not a luxury tax. In my own constituency there are many people in a small way who, from their savings, were able to buy utility lorries.  They are running these lorries for the benefit of the farmers and they are getting a living out of them.  This tax, which is going to be extracted from these industrious boys, will fall back on the farmers, whose produce they bring to the market, and on the consumers of goods because the shopkeepers and the merchants in the towns to whom they bring these goods will naturally have to pay more too, to meet the extra running costs.  I need not mention the taxi drivers.  It will cost the Great Southern Railways £30,000 per year, which will fall on the bus services and the lorry services of the railway and affect employment and the carriage of goods and persons. Here in the City of Dublin, it is not the wealthy people with the extravagant Ministerial salaries who use the buses; it is the poor people. £12,000 more will fall on the buses as a result of this extra petrol tax of 2d., and will be collected in extra fares off the working-class people.</P>
    <P>Then the Minister is going to come down on the unfortunate local bodies again for £68,000, which, he stated, they did not pay last year owing to some mismanagement.  £68,000 is to be got out of them in increased rates.  So that you see the Budget is coming down on top of everyone, and every class in the country.  In addition, the Minister is going to raid the Road Fund again.  That is a very immoral thing; it is a sort of public misappropriation of money; a sort of trover and conversion: taking money from a fund which should be devoted to special purposes. It is an <i>ad hoc</i> fund, and the money should go for the upkeep of the roads of the country.  It should go to relieve the local rates for the maintenance of the roads.  But the Minister is going to put it into his own pocket for <Col N="2582" /> his own needs.  I am sure that the roads will suffer accordingly, and that the local rates will suffer accordingly, because the money must be made up in some other way.  The tax of ½d. per oz. on tobacco looks very small, but it is going to be a very serious thing for the poor man.  I need not dwell upon it.  What I want to bring home is the fact that the £1,180,000 that is going to be extracted in this very hard way by this extra taxation could easily be saved, by a little more careful administration, in the taxes which already exist.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see that the Minister, in his statement, did not give us the usual poetic statements about gold ounces, buoyant bullion, etc.  He made a nice allusion to our difficulty in trying to steer our barque between Scylla and Charybdis.  The unfortunate taxpayer has no alternative.  He is between the hammer and the avail.  He is between the anvil of hard times and the merciless hammer of taxation, and he has no redress.  That is the outlook. I think the Budget is a very bad Budget, and shows very little imagination and very little regard for the actual capacity of the people to pay. It shows an abyssmal disregard of the actual conditions under which we are trying to live at present.  To ask this country to meet a national expenditure of £37,750,000 in this year is certainly putting upon it a burden which it cannot bear.  It is a very bad Budget, indeed. There are many other aspects of it with which I should like to deal, and from which it should be attacked.  But time is pressing.  There is plenty of material to show the immorality of it. We had some difficulty in the House yesterday with regard to a quotation from Shakespeare.  I should like to use a word in connection with the Budget which may not perhaps be strictly Parliamentary.</P>

      <P>I suppose I ought, thinking of the tone of this debate, to thank Providence that the economic war is over.  We did not hear so much to-day about the beneficial effect which the settlement of that dispute would have on the fortunes of this country. The Opposition has lost what used to be the stock-in-trade of debate here in the Dáil, and I, for one, think that the standard of debate has improved in consequence.  Within the limits of exaggeration, which I suppose are excusable in Parliamentary discussion, this debate has not been lacking in usefulness. Perhaps, listening to each other, we may learn a great deal.  One thing I am sure we may learn, one thing which we ought to take to heart and remember is, that in matters of public expenditure we cannot eat our cake and have it too.  We cannot have increased expenditure, no matter how laudable the purposes, and, at the same time, keep down taxation, no matter how vexatious the burden.  We must learn that, as matters are so ordered by Providence, if we want things in this world, or indeed in the next, we have to pay for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave has described this Budget, not in the Chaucerian term of his colleague Deputy O'Neill; he has not applied to it the mediæval adjective &ldquo;lousy&rdquo;; he has described it in terms of latter-day politics as a popular Budget.  He said it was a popular Budget, but a bad Budget.  Words of praise from Deputy Cosgrave are rare, and I suppose I ought to be grateful for his acknowledgment that the Budget is acceptable to the masses of the people.  In the same breath, however, as I have said, Deputy Cosgrave also described it as a bad Budget.  Why has Deputy Cosgrave so described it? I presume because, in order to maintain the existing services, it has been necessary to increase greatly existing rates of taxation.  That, in Deputy Cosgrave's view, makes the present Budget a bad one.  Very well.  But, think how much worse that Budget would be if Deputy Cosgrave had his way.  He wants full derating.  Derating, as the House is aware, is an expedient which is designed to help the large landowner at the expense of <Col N="2584" /> the less fortunate elements in the community. Full derating would cost the Exchequer and the taxpayer an additional £2,000,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>If the Government were prepared to endow a section of the landowners to the tune of £2,000,000 a year and, at the same time, to maintain the existing services, as I presume Deputy Cosgrave and his Party would pretend to do at any rate, they would have not merely to increase the standard rate of income-tax by 1/- but by 3/- in the £ and, in addition to an increase in the tax on petrol and on tobacco, they would have to put a further 1/2d. per lb. on sugar and perhaps 4d. per lb. on tea.  That is the sort of Budget Deputy Cosgrave and the Fine Gael Party want.  If our Budget is a bad one, because we have had to increase the existing rates of taxation, what sort of Budget would Deputy Cosgrave's Government have introduced if they were in power at the present moment and had to find an additional £2,000,000 in order to endow the large landowners of this country at the expense of the least fortunate elements in the community?  In regard to this matter of expenditure and taxation&mdash;I am sorry that Deputy Davin is not in the House, for in this matter he is a mere can tied to the Opposition tail&mdash; the Opposition and Deputy Davin should stop trying to face both ways. It makes them look too much like the well-known Petrol Shell advertisement of &ldquo;Crikey,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Crikey&rdquo; cannot be described as a thing of beauty or of dignity.  It is striking, and striking only because it looks so supremely ridiculous.</P>
    <P>In introducing the Budget I pointed out the purpose for which revenue was required.  I enumerated the services upon which it was proposed to spend the money.  I challenged the Opposition to state whether they were against any of these services and whether they were prepared to economise in respect of any one of them and, if so, to name which of them.  There are over 70 services in the Volume of Estimates. Some of these services are perhaps less necessary and less desirable than others.  Obviously if a Deputy or a number of Deputies or the Leader of <Col N="2585" /> the Opposition, speaking for 40 per cent. of the Deputies of the House, thinks that the expenditure upon these 70 services, taken as a whole, can fairly be described as squandermania, there must be some amongst these 70 services on which, in his opinion, and in the opinion of the members of his Party, expenditure could be reduced and therefore ought to be reduced.</P>
    <P>Surely Deputy Cosgrave&mdash;when he accused this Government of squandermania&mdash;when he said that, he meant that on certain services money was being needlessly and wastefully spent, and that were it not for this fact the additional taxation which has been imposed this year would not be necessary. If words mean anything to him, if Deputy Cosgrave believes that, if his statement represents his considered judgment on the merits of these services, he can render a first-class public service which, I am sure, will appeal to those hard-driven farmers for whom Deputies O'Neill, Hughes, Corey and Brooke-Brasier have been speaking. In fact, if Deputy Cosgrave, when he stigmatises all our present policy in regard to public expenditure as squandermania, is justified, he has it in his power to render a first-class public service.  It lies with the Deputy to save the taxpayer from additional taxation.  Will Deputy Cosgrave or the members of his Party do that service for the taxpayers?  They have accused us of squandermania. Surely they ought to stop talking in polysyllables, come down to hard facts and say in simple language: &ldquo;Here is a service upon which so many hundreds of thousands of pounds can be saved; here is another service; here is still another, and let the Government save the money on those services and let the taxpayer keep his money.&rdquo;  If the Deputy does that, if those who had been talking here about squandermania and about the burden of taxation get up here in this House and state openly what service they would save the money on, their words will receive the serious consideration of the Government and&mdash;what is perhaps more important in view of the fact that feeling in a constituency is shortly to be tested&mdash;it will receive the serious consideration of the electorate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2586" /> Since his attack on the Budget, the taxpayers of the country have been waiting for Deputy Cosgrave's words. Will he not speak out and save them? Not at all.  Deputy Cosgrave prefers that the taxpayers should continue to suffer.  The Deputy seems to be animated with the same sort of vindictiveness against the electors who turned him out of office and put us into power. That was from his follower, as Deputy Giles seems to be.  Deputy Giles says the taxpayers, the farmers and the farm labourers put in the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Giles says what these people are getting now is good enough for them.  That would appear to be the position which Deputy Cosgrave takes up in this matter.  He seems to feel a spirit of vindictiveness towards the taxpayers.  We have the fact that though he feels there are services on which economies could be made, and the removal of which would relieve the taxpayers, yet he refuses to open his mouth and state what these services are, and so save the taxpayers that burden.  His reply to my plea that he should speak, has been to maintain a sullen silence.  He proclaims that he has no responsibility for the Budget.</P>
    <P>That will not do.  The Opposition cannot wash its hands of this matter. They, too, have a responsibility for the conduct of affairs here.  They bear an equal responsibility with Deputies in other parts of the House.  Like them, they receive a Parliamentary allowance to do the country's work, and that allowance is not being granted to them merely to enable them to pose as Pilates in Irish politics.  They have a responsibility, and a great responsibility. Let them act up to that responsibility and tell us what economies they think ought to be made, what economies they would make.  It is, of course, and I quite admit it, the function of the Minister to keep expenditure within bounds, but to do that the Minister must be supported by the Dáil and by public opinion against the unreasonable demands which from all sides are made upon the Exchequer from time to time.  When I was in opposition I did tell the people of the country that in my view they were paying <Col N="2587" /> too much and they were being taxed too heavily to maintain the then existing public services.</P>

      <P>I am just coming to that, Deputy Hughes.  As I said, when I was in opposition I often urged the Government of the day not to spend all the money they were taking from the people in maintaining the then existing public services.  Statements which I made when in opposition have often been quoted here.  They were quoted during this debate.  I urged that expenditure should be reduced, but I did not content myself with that.  I went on to specify the services upon which, in my view, economies could be made, and this Government, since it took office, has made these economies and has fulfilled its pledge in that regard to the letter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan, I think, quoted a speech which I made in 1930 or 1931, in which I said I would not touch the public services, but that there were sources of expenditure which could be cut off completely, and that if we came into office we would cease to make the payments and thereby would save for the people a sum of over £2,000,000. What were the services and the economies which I advocated?  There was, first of all, in Vote 16 of that day, a sum of £1,152,000 for the pensions of the Royal Irish Constabulary.  There was a sum of £110,000 for civil pensions. There was in another Vote, Vote No. 8, for local loans, a sum of £600,000 paid over to Great Britain, and on the Vote for the Land Commission there was a sum of £134,000 for Bonus and Excess Stock paid over to Great Britain.  There were a number of other small items, totalling £84,000. All these moneys, in addition to the land annuities, were collected from the taxpayers of this country and paid over to Great Britain.  Excluding the land annuities, apart from them, they totalled £2,080,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we were in Opposition we protested against the attitude of the Government of the day in maintaining <Col N="2588" /> these services, and thereby imposing unnecessary taxation.  We pointed out that £2,000,000 too much were being taken from the people.  We specified the services upon which we were prepared to economise.  We came into office and we have made these economies.  Our pledge in regard to the £2,000,000 has been fulfilled to the letter.  We no longer tax the people to the extent of £1,152,000 to pay over to Great Britain; we no longer tax the people in order to find £600,000 to pay over for the local loans; we no longer tax the people in order to find £110,000 to pay to Great Britain in respect of civil pensions; we no longer tax the people in order to find £134,000 to pay in regard to bonuses and excess stock to Great Britain, and we do not find another £84,000 in regard to a number of small annuities paid under the Ultimate Financial Settlement.</P>
    <P>We have stopped taxing the people for those purposes.  We have not stopped taxing the people for the purpose of improving the social and educational and other services.  We have known that we were in charge of a young, undeveloped country, a community which had not had the power to order its affairs for centuries; that there were many things that would have to be done in this country, and that vast sums of money would have to be spent in order to provide for our people the amenities and services which people in other European countries have come to regard as the ordinary commonplaces of everyday life.  These things had to be done here.  We had to make good the defects and deficiencies of centuries of foreign rule, and accordingly we have had to ask the people to tax themselves more heavily in order that they might provide these things for themselves. But so far as our original pledge, that there were certain services upon which we would save £2,000,000 per annum, was concerned, I have said, and I will reiterate it, that that pledge has been fulfilled to the letter.</P>

      <P>I was saying that when we came into office we made economies to which we had pledged ourselves.  Deputy Cosgrave implies&mdash; though he will not specify them, if he knows them&mdash;that there are economies that could be made.  When asked what was his remedy for the present situation, instead of telling us what these economies were and asking us to make them and to reduce taxation to correspond, he said his only cure for squandermania was to turn out the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputy Cosgrave believes in himself, what a prospect faces the taxpayers. &ldquo;Turn out the Government,&rdquo; he says; but the electorate have put us here, one might say, for another four <Col N="2591" /> years.  Deputy Cosgrave's attitude towards the taxpayers is that since they put this Government here for four years more, let the taxpayers, in his view, endure the penance for another four years.  If he wants that period shortened, if he wants to relieve these taxpayers in whom he expresses so much concern, then, I think the Deputy ought to open his mind a little more. He ought to tell the country what economies he would make if it took him at his word, turned out the Government, and put him in office.  When the Deputy has been as candid and as open with the country, as I think the Leader of a Party that wants to take over the existing Administration ought to be, then the electorate will be able to judge the issue and, I am sure, come to a wise decision.</P>
    <P>Why are the increased rates of taxation necessary?  Deputies Murphy, Gorey, Bennet, Belton and O'Neill, and Jeremiah Ryan say that the need for increased expenditure on national defence is the principal cause.  Deputy Gorey took up the challenge which I offered, and was good enough to say that one of the services on which he would economise would be on the provision for national defence, and that he would let that £3,000,000 is defence go.  But the money required for defence is not all coming from immediate taxation.  £1,350,000 is being borrowed.  A certain amount, undoubtedly, must be provided out of present taxation.  But that fact&mdash;and I want to emphasise it&mdash;of itself does not necessitate an increase in the rates of taxation which we have had to propose this year.</P>
    <P>Even if the additional need of national defence did of itself involve us in the increase of rates that we have had to make, let the House ask itself: Should we shirk that expenditure? Deputy Daly has told us what his point of view in regard to that question would be.  The Deputy is in agreement with Deputies Belton, Gorey and Bennet, and suggests that we should. The British, these Deputies say, will defend us!  Let us rely upon the British.  That is a doctrine fit only for spineless slaves.  We pride ourselves <Col N="2592" /> on our fight for freedom.  We, and our fathers before us, have made many sacrifices for that cause.  We have secured our absolute sovereignty over five-sixths of our ancient territory. There is a danger that, in certain circumstances, our territory or our commerce or those communications which are vital to us might be endangered. Are we not, within the limit of our resources, to put ourselves in a position to defend them if they are menaced? Self-preservation, it has been said, is the first law of nature.  Self-defence is the first obligation which that law imposes on men, and particularly upon free men, and equally upon States and nations.  It is a law that carries with it its own sanctions.  It cannot be disregarded with impunity, particularly by a nation reborn to freedom as ours has been.  If we are not prepared to shoulder the burden of our own defence, make no mistake about it, our fate may be such as befell other nations which, in Europe, recovered their freedom after years of struggle, but were not able to consolidate that freedom, and unfortunately were not prepared to make sacrifices to maintain it.</P>
    <P>The adequate defence of our country is necessary for our own welfare.  It is essential to the preservation of our liberty, and it cannot, on any account, be neglected.  It must be attended to for the sake of our own people, and for our own interests above everything else.  The matter, however, is not quite so simple and autonomous as that.  Our defence problem is a complicated one. The adequate defence of this country is essential, not only to safeguard our freedom and our interests, but to obviate possible danger to a mighty and powerful neighbour, with whom, let it be at once admitted, we have certain economic interests in common. Deputies Belton, Bennet and Daly said that the defence of this country is a vital concern of Great Britain.  All who have given the matter serious thought must agree.  I do, at any rate. Therefore, Deputy Belton says: &ldquo;Let the British defend us and let us save the money.&rdquo;  How simple!  That is just the sort of him-bugging catch cry that Deputy Belton delights in.</P>
    <P>But how might the British respond <Col N="2593" /> if we were to adopt that sort of attitude?  Might they not say: &ldquo;The Irish want to have it both ways.  They want to be free but they will not accept the obligations of freedom. They will not tax themselves to defend themselves.  They want us to tax ourselves and do it for them.  If that is to be the position, since we have to defend the Irish Beltons, the Irish Bennetts, the Irish Goreys and all the poltroons who say that the Irish are too poor or too miserly to defend themselves, let us do it in the cheapest way, in the way which will be most effective for our own purposes; let us go back to Ireland and reoccupy those strategic points in that country which we regard as vital to our defensive scheme.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is what is really implicit in all the talk we have heard here from Deputy Belton and those like him who are trying to induce the people to believe that the defence of this country can be safely entrusted to the imperial forces.  Deputy Belton and his colleagues know that as well as I do.  They are not simpletons and they are not fools.  They are not so ignorant as the poor people whom they wish to dupe and gull.  If Deputy Belton and Deputy Davin are sincere when they say that we should spend no money on defence but leave it all to the British, then the only reason these Deputies take up that attitude is because they want the British back. That is what Deputy Belton wants in his heart of hearts.  They tell us to spend no money and to leave the defence of this country to the British. What they want in their heart of hearts, if they are sincere when they put that catch-cry before the taxpayers, is to have the British back.</P>

      <P>The people are prepared to tax themselves in order to defend themselves&mdash;to stint themselves to the very limit if need be to preserve the liberties which they have won so dearly.  But let me repeat that it is not because of the defence forces alone that we have had to increase taxes. The need has arisen from other sources. I shall try to put them before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my Budget statement I referred to the White Paper of Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure which had been circulated on the preceding Saturday&mdash;in time to allow Deputies who wished to take an intelligent part in the discussion upon the Budges to study the figures carefully.  That Paper has not once been referred to from the Opposition side in the course of this debate.  Yet there set out in black and white, plain to be seen, was the principal reason why it has been necessary to increase rates of taxation this year.  In the first table of Part II of this Paper, circulated for the information of Deputies by the Government in accordance with the Constitution, it is shown that the tax revenue on the basis of the rates of taxation in force prior to the introduction of the Budget was expected to be £676,000 less than it was last year&mdash;the then existing taxes, it was estimated, would, for a variety of reasons, bring in £676,000 less than they did in the year 1938-9. Now the Opposition, because they are supposed to be the watchdogs of the taxpayer, might urge that, since the revenue was going to be so much less &mdash;then, at least, there were some things in regard to which we ought to make economies.  Again I ask them, what economies are we to make?  Deputy <Col N="2595" /> Cosgrave has refused to tell us.  If he would tell us perhaps we could obviate the need for putting a further 1/- in the £1 upon income-tax.  As I pointed out to the House, revenue upon the basis of last year's rates of taxation is going to be £676,000 less than it was last year.  An additional 1/- in the £1 on income-tax brings in £660,000.  If the Opposition know of any economies which could properly be made, if they tell us what they are and we can make them, and they total £676,000, we can save that additional shilling on the income-tax.  If they will not tell us, if the Dáil will not help us in the matter of economies, then we have no option but to impose taxation to maintain the existing services&mdash;those services which the country, as represented here in the Dáil not merely by those who support the Government but by those sitting on the Opposition Benches, tells us it wants.</P>
    <P>How can the Government be responsible for the short-fall in revenue which we have to face this year?  We did not create the September crisis.  We did not march into Czecho-Slovakia.  We had nothing to do with the Austrian Anschluss.  But everybody knows that since this crisis developed in international affairs last September, business everywhere&mdash;not only here, but in every country&mdash;has tended to retrogress. That is inevitable in the atmosphere of uncertainty and dread which hangs over Europe.  We suffered from it here in many ways.  Dividends have been reduced.  Former stock exchange gains have been replaced by heavy losses.  Sweepstakes have declined. Therefore the yield from taxes upon property and income, and from the duties in respect of stock exchange transactions must decline next year likewise.  We cannot cook the figures.</P>
    <P>I was told by Deputy O'Neill that there was little imagination in the Budget.  There can be little imagination in any Budget, because you do not pay for the public services out of imagination.  Therefore, looking back at the year which has elapsed since the last Budget was introduced, seeing how trade everywhere has been stifled by, as I have said, present international fears knowing that incomes have declined, <Col N="2596" /> what else can we do but look the facts in the face?  And so next year out of the existing taxes we are going to get £676,000 less than last year. Therefore, if the public services are to be maintained, the only thing that is left for us to do is to increase the rates of taxation so as to make good that short-fall of £676,000.  That accounts for more than half of the additional taxation which is imposed in this year's Budget.</P>
    <P>What were the other reasons why taxation had to be increased?  The second principal reason for the increase in the rates of taxation is the additional sum which must be provided this year out of revenue for export subsidies on agricultural produce.  For what purpose is that money being provided? We have been told about the poor prices the farmers are getting for their milk, not by Deputy Mulcahy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

      <P>But Deputy Mulcahy's understudy&mdash;I believe that is what he is in the councils of the Party &mdash;Deputy Bennett, comes along and makes a wail here, sets up a sort of banshee cry, about the poor prices dairy farmers in Limerick are getting for their milk.  In any event, one of the reasons why we have to impose increased taxation this year is that we are spending £606,000 out of revenue for the purpose of providing amongst other things £434,000 for subsidies on exports of dairy produce. Deputy Mulcahy has not advocated that we should refrain from providing that money.  Oh, no; he would split his Party if he did.  He split it before when he tried to get the Fine Gael Party to walk into the division lobby against the Dairy Produce (Prices Stabilisation) Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>In any event, £430,000 is being provided out of taxation this year for subsidies on exports of dairy produce.  A sum of £160,000 is being provided for subsidies on exports of eggs and poultry. Whether the subsidy on dairy produce finds its way into every farmer's household or not, I do not know.  I am told its reactions are very widespread indeed, that it is not merely the dairy farmer in Limerick that is getting the benefit of it, but also those who are rearing and selling cattle everywhere.  In any event, here is an item of £160,000 provided for subsidies on exports of eggs and poultry, and undoubtedly a due part of that finds its way into every farmer's household, and also into the households of agricultural labourers in this country.  Again, a sum of £12,000 is provided for subsidies on exports of potatoes and other agricultural produce.  There we have a total of £606,000, all for the benefit of the farmer, to help him, to stimulate production by assuring him of remunerative prices.  Last year only £222,000 was provided out of revenue for this purpose.  As I have said, this year we have to provide £606,000. That is to say&mdash;and let those who have been talking clotted nonsense and saying that nothing is being done for the farmer, note it&mdash;£384,000 more has to be provided this year for the farmers than was provided last year.</P>
      <P>Then for educational purposes, for teachers and such like, we require £106,000 more than last year.  We want as well an additional £50,000 for the reconstruction of national schools, making £156,000 more for education. Am I to be told, by those who tell us that we are doing nothing for the farmers, that that is an unnecessary expenditure, that the farmers get nothing out of it when we provide better schools for their children and better educational facilities?</P>

If the Deputy is logical, if I am to grasp anything of his mind from that remark, then I presume the line of argument is that, since there are less children, there should be less money provided for education.</P>

      <P>I do not know how Deputy Mulcahy wants me to work out that last suggestion, that the money should be spent on seeing that there are more children first.  Last year the Land Commission required £1,645,000. This year we have to find £1,792,000 or £147,000 more.  This too, has to be found out of new taxation.  Although we have heard a great deal about additional taxation, I have not heard any person coming along here&mdash;certainly I have not heard anybody on the Opposition Benches&mdash;to say: &ldquo;You ought to cut down expenditure on the Land Commission.&rdquo;  We could save money, if they were prepared to accept that proposition.  But not at all! That is not the line the Opposition ever take in regard to any possible occasion of public expenditure.  They are always crying out for more and more money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What do all the four heads which I have read out amount to, when you tot them up?  We have, first of all, in order to make good the anticipated deficiency in the revenue arising out of the international situation, to get <Col N="2599" /> £676,000.  Then for additional export subsidies on agricultural produce we require to find out of revenue an additional £384,000.  For educational purposes we must find out of revenue an additional £156,000 and for the Land Commission we must find out of revenue an additional £147,000.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy could keep expenditure on these three items down even to last year's figure he could save £687,000&mdash;£27,000 more than the extra shilling on the income tax <Col N="2600" /> will bring in.  If he would keep even the export bounties down to last year's figure he would save £384,000, or £50,000 more than is represented by 6d. on income tax, or £70,000 more than the additional 2d. per gallon on the petrol, or £40,000 more than twice the additional tax on tobacco would bring in.  I heard Deputy Daly and Deputy Giles making a sad story about this tax on the poor man's tobacco.  The Deputy told us that the amount&mdash;I think he said&mdash;that the poor man would have to pay would be 1/7 for his two ounces of tobacco in a week.  There you are.  The Deputy can save not merely the poor man's 2d. per week, but he can save £40,000 more if only he could persuade everybody in the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Now, I am saying, Sir, that the Opposition cannot have it both ways.  Either they stand for this additional expenditure, and therefore accept responsibility, with us, for the additional taxation which is required to defray it, or else they ought to have dissociated themselves from the proposals to incur these increased expenses when they were submitted to the Dáil.  Opposition Deputies&mdash; Deputy Cosgrave and his colleagues&mdash; who have spoken against this Budget, did not take any such stand on behalf of the taxpayers about whom they now pretend to be concerned.  On the contrary, they approved, without a division, the Votes for Education, the Land Commission, and the Export Subsidies.  They wanted the additional expenditure on these services six weeks or two months ago, and they, as well as we, have the responsibility for finding the money to pay for them now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They, with the rest of the Dáil, must take responsibility for the additional £687,000 which these services represent in additional taxation this year. I hope they will take the responsibilities more seriously than they have done in this debate: take them as seriously as I do, and look at the future in the light of the present strained conditions in Europe with an apprehension similar and equal to mine.  Then we shall have here an Opposition worthy of the name and fit to play the important part which an Opposition should in a parliamentary assembly.  Then we shall have an end to the irresponsible pandering to every sectional interest which has been the keynote of the Opposition policy here. Deputy Mulcahy will then stop complaining <Col N="2602" /> about the price of butter in an attempt to work up resentment among butter consumers in the towns, while at the same time another member of his Party, Deputy Bennett, as I have said, tries to curry favour with the dairy farmers of Limerick by complaining that the price they get for their milk is too low.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gorey, in an endeavour to work up feeling among the farmers, protested in this debate against the social services.  When the Party of which he is a member&mdash;and a valuable member, because he speaks his mind and is a man of courage&mdash;becomes a really responsible Opposition, with some principle and some backbone, he will refrain from doing that so long as Deputy Dan Morrissey, who sits at the further end of the Front Opposition Bench, rises and, seeking the support of certain Labour elements in Tipperary, is permitted by Deputy Gorey's Party to demand further expenditure upon the very services against which Deputy Gorey has protested.  When the Opposition become really responsible we may even have Deputy Dillon, whose view of the sugar beet industry has been succinctly expressed by himself in a word of one syllable, telling the House&mdash;members of his own Party and his ally on this side of the House&mdash; when they complain that an insufficient price is being paid for beet, that their statements are all &ldquo;cod&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Opposition Deputies have pointed out that, if it had not been for the failure of a number of beet growers to enter into their usual contracts for beet acreage this year and last year, the position of the Exchequer would have been worse.  That is quite true. If the acreage under sugar beet last year and this year was what it might have been if the growers had been better advised, we should have had to impose, not merely the additional 1/- on income-tax, the extra 2d. a gallon on petrol, and the further ½d. per ounce on tobacco, but we should have had to put, perhaps, as much as 3/4d. on sugar as well.  Now, there is a moral in that, and a warning for those who are interested in beet growing, not to kill the goose which lays the golden eggs.</P>

      <P>By their actions, they have led many farmers not to grow beet at a price which a competent tribunal fixed as a fair price.  What has been the consequence?  Thousands of farmers who were misled by the wild and unjustified statements, such as those we have heard here from one or two Deputies, lost the profits on the best paying crop in their rotation, but the general taxpayers profited to the extent of over £500,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If the farmers, by listening to the politicians, have lost profits which might have been theirs, the taxpayers have escaped an extra ¾d. per lb. on sugar this year.  There is a moral in that for all of us&mdash;never to go on strike for an unreasonable demand, particularly where your opponent, in the case to which I have been referring, the sugar consumers of this country, has nothing to lose, but everything to gain by your strike. The Government has been anxious to establish the sugar beet industry here and has been prepared to do that at a not unreasonable price, a price which the consumers, who, in regard to this matter, include in their number over 90 per cent. of the 500,000 or 600,000 families, farmers and farm labourers, who have to live in rural Ireland, have to pay.  If the existing factories were working to capacity, the consumer, at the present rate of subsidy, would be <Col N="2604" /> paying £1,500,000 more for his sugar than the price at which he could get it elsewhere.</P>
      <P>Even as it is, he is paying £1,000,000 more than he might.  Those who control the Beet Growers' Association ought to be satisfied with that. They ought to stop mixing politics up with beet growing, and leave the decent, hard-working farmers to get everything they can by honest labour out of this industry which the country is subsidising so heavily.  And that applies likewise to all the demands that are now being made, of one exorbitant kind or another, upon the Exchequer.  If we are going to carry on here as a democratic community we have got to get a sense of responsibility among public representatives. We have heard, in the course of this debate, that the Government is not doing enough for this, that or the other sectional interest.  Every ramp against the community which is started for no matter what purpose and no matter by whom, is supported by the Opposition because of the political advantage which may be got out of it.  That, as I have said, is the rot of democracy. That attitude by political Parties is sapping the morale and character of this people.  We have had a very serious Budget to face this year.  I hope it awakens us all to a sense of our responsibilities&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is the moral of this Budget.</P>

    <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the <Col N="2607" /> Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1940, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, including Grants and other Expenses in connection with Housing, Grants to Local Authorities, Sundry Miscellaneous Grants and Grants-in-Aid, and certain charges connected with Hospitals.</P>
    <P>The first item of the Estimate makes provision for expenses that may arise under the Milk and Dairies Act, 1935, in connection with the function of the Minister as licensing authority under the special designations regulations which provide that milk may be sold under certain designations in accordance with the licence granted by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The second item of the Estimate is rendered necessary by the passing of the Housing Act of this year.  The Housing Act extended the period for the payment of the housing grants in urban areas up to the 1st April, 1939, and, in rural areas, to the 1st April, 1940.  The main Estimate for the Department was passed before the Act was passed.  Consequently, the Supplementary Estimate had to be introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points to which I would like to draw the Minister's attention.  I agree, of course, with the Milk and Dairies Act in so far as it is improving the conditions under which milk and milk products are being produced in the country, but some very grave hardships are arising out of the enforcement of the Act.  There have been people, living a mile or two from a town, who have been producing milk under fairly good conditions, but not, perhaps, up to the standard required.  They may have seven, eight, nine, ten or 15 cows. Under this Act they have been practically put out of business completely. I would like to know from the Minister if he is taking any steps to accommodate these people who are being put out of business by authorising the Agricultural Credit Corporation to extend loan facilities to them for the <Col N="2608" /> establishment of suitable houses for cattle.  I know several cases all over the country where a family was working hard, not making very much money, and the cowsheds had not suitable floors or a suitable lighting system. The result was that they were condemned, and these poor unfortunate people were pushed out of business if they were not able to build or reconstruct the out-offices so as to bring them to the required standard.  I agree that it is very suitable and very essential that a high standard should be required, but in a case like that some facilities should be made available for these farmers in order to enable them to reconstruct their out-offices. They should not be put out of business completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of housing, a rather strange situation has developed all over the country regarding the reconstruction grants.  This work of the reconstruction of houses is one of the things that I have always approved under the Fianna Fáil Administration.  It is an admirable work, as I told the Minister here on former occasions.  During the past two or three years, however, the system has grown up so that a reconstruction estimate must be round £80 or £90 before the £40 grant will be paid.  That, I think, is unfair.  It is unfair in the sense that if I was not able to reconstruct my house until this year I am penalised to the extent of £10 or £15, or maybe £20.  That was not the case in the early stages.  I know of hundreds of cases in the County Longford where, say, the reconstruction estimate was £50.  In these cases the grant given is not more than £25 or £30.  During the first couple of years, if the reconstruction estimate was, say, £53, the full £40 was given by way of grant.  There is no doubt that in recent years the cost of building materials has increased considerably.  When one takes into account the provisions of the Conditions of Employment Act and other things, the cost of reconstructing a house may be said to have considerably increased in late years.  The reconstruction of houses is an eminently desirable work, and it is unfair, I submit, to people <Col N="2609" /> who are anxious to undertake it that they should be penalised by reducing the amount of the grant.</P>
    <P>I also wish to complain about the delay there is in making payments.  In several counties, particularly in the counties of Longford and Roscommon and in portions of Leitrim and Westmeath, large numbers of houses have been completed and not inspected.  I am of the opinion that the inspection system is too cumbersome.  I think it should be eased somewhat, and that the inspections should be expedited. The county council officials&mdash;county surveyors and assistant county surveyors&mdash;could be asked to take part in this inspection work if the Department of Local Government so desired it, and without very much expense, if any.</P>
    <P>On the question of new houses I have not much to say except that I think two points should be attended to.  In the first place, I think the valuation should not be kept at £25, as at present. It should be extended to £35 or £40.  Of course, I know the Minister will argue that if he extended it to £45 there would still be a border-line case of £45 1s. that would debar some applicant.  I am aware of that, but still I think that if the valuation were extended to the figure I urge, the additional money spent would be devoted to a most worthy object.  It would lead to an improvement in the health of the people.  It would be far better to have money spent in that direction than in many others that I need not go into.</P>
    <P>With regard to the floor space of houses, there are hundreds of farmers all over the country who, because the floor space of the old ramshackle houses they occupy exceeds a certain figure, are not eligible for grants. Their houses are really more in need of reconstruction than some of the tidy, compact houses that qualify for a grant.  You have many a poor farmer who is in a far worse position financially than his neighbour who has a three or a four-roomed house, and because the floor space of his house exceeds a certain limit he cannot get the grant.  That is under a regulation made by the Minister which is like the regulation at the Curragh Camp of which the old sergeant-major said that <Col N="2610" /> in his opinion regulations were only made to be broken.  If the Minister so desired it, he could keep the regulation there to suit his purpose, and change it when he was perfectly satisfied that it would suit a better purpose.  In these circumstances, I think that the method of measurement could be altered under the regulation without amending the Act.  If that were done it would assist a large number of people all over the country to provide themselves with better living conditions in their homes.</P>
    <P>I quite admit that these reconstruction grants have done much to improve the housing conditions of the people.  I gladly pay tribute to the Department and the Government for their services and activities in that direction.  In conclusion, I hope that the Minister will see his way to make the few alterations I have suggested.  In the first place, I hope he will increase the valuation to the figure I have mentioned; secondly, that where the reconstruction estimate is £50 and over, the full £40 grant will be given, and, thirdly, that an alteration will be made in the method of calculating floor space.  If this last alteration were made it would mean that a large number of houses, badly in need of reconstruction, would come within the terms of the regulation, and that the occupiers would qualify for the payment of grants.</P>

      <P>On this Estimate I would ask the Ministers responsible to see that Sections 19 and 20 of the Milk and Dairies Act are complied with, so that milk coming into Dublin will be subject to the same inspection as milk produced in Dublin for Dublin consumption. It was one of the inequities of that Act to permit milk to come into Dublin that was not subject to inspection at the source of production.  For instance, under the Dairy Produce Act of 1924 a creamery was permitted to register as a dairy, or as a dairy premises.  Secondly, the creamery could buy milk from any producer.  No inspection regarding the production of that milk went beyond the creamery premises, while, in the case of milk sold that did not pass through a creamery, the premises in which the <Col N="2611" /> cows were housed and in which the milk cans and milk were stored were all subject to very rigid inspection. I think it is a little breeze of that kind that has hit General MacEoin's constituents, for whom he is asking for an easing off now.  If the produce to which he has referred is going to be sold locally, it is a local matter, but if it is coming to the City of Dublin the milk produced in the country should be put on an equal footing with that produced in Dublin.  Contamination from outside counties is no less dangerous to the health of the citizens of Dublin than contamination from milk produced in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts, I think we already had a Bill which pretty well covered the whole field in regard to this matter, and I do not propose to go into an exhaustive discussion of it now, particularly as the Minister for Local Government is not here and it would hardly be fair to ask another Minister to make promises for him or to honour promises which he has made.  However, I will put the question, and I am sure that if the Minister in charge of this Vote has any information on it he will let us have it. I think the Minister for Local Government on that occasion promised that he would bring in a Housing Bill at an early date.  I should like to know from the Minister when he is replying if he can throw any light on that matter. The Minister for Local Government said on the occasion to which I am referring that he had it from people in the building trade that the grants under those Acts were not so important in the encouragement of building as were funds to help purchasers to purchase their houses, in other words, State loans.  I agree with that to a large extent, but it must be remembered that those grants have obtained for a number of years, and have become part and parcel of the payment for houses.  While there was no specific allowance to a purchaser who was buying one of those houses for which the builder had got grants, yet the price was regulated on the understanding that a grant had been given.  The houses were valued down by the <Col N="2612" /> amount of the grant.  Valuers called in to make valuations under the Small Dwellings Acts, or in connection with advances by insurance companies, made their valuations on the basis of an understanding that a grant had been given, and so much was taken off the market value of those houses. There is a big discrepancy at the moment, when those grants are not available.  The houses are valued on the same basis as heretofore, and it leaves a very big gap between the deposits which purchasers pay and the loans they get on percentages.</P>
    <P>I am not absolutely positive about this, but my recollection is that the Minister for Local Government promised us a Bill making provision for loans to help purchasers to purchase their houses.  I do not know whether it came from the Minister, but there was some suggestion here about the encouragement of existing building societies or the creation of national building societies which might get some initial capital from the Government.  If my recollection is correct as to what was foreshadowed by the Minister, I should be glad to know&mdash;and the building trade in Dublin as well as those anxious to purchase their own homes in Dublin and elsewhere would also be glad to know&mdash;whether any advance has been made in that regard.  Speaking with some knowledge of the building trade here, I am quite satisfied that nothing has contributed so much to the dislocation of that trade as the fact that loans are not available.  With the exception of big housing contracts placed by the Dublin Corporation, there is practically no building going on in or around the City of Dublin at the present time.  It is not that saturation point has been reached; it is not that there are not people looking for houses who are prepared to pay from 15 to 25 or 30 per cent. of the value of the houses, it is because of the fact that, after the 15, 25 or 30 per cent. has been paid by intending purchasers. the balance cannot be got on loan.  It is to fill that want that I understand the Minister was to devise machinery either to finance directly the Small Dwellings Acts and to put them moving again, or to provide <Col N="2613" /> moneys to be administered through the building societies or through some machinery which he was going to set up.  It is immaterial which way it would be done.</P>

      <P>There is just one matter to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention.  It arises out of the Milk and Dairies Act.  First of all, I want it to be quite clear that I do not for a moment suggest that anything should be done to disimprove the conditions of the Act.  Nevertheless, a great deal of hardship has been occasioned in rural areas, arising out of its operation.  I wonder if the Minister could, after inquiry from the boards of health, formulate some scheme whereby this hardship could be removed.  For instance, in many cases farmers who did not go in for selling milk retail obliged neighbours <Col N="2614" /> by letting them have milk for their household requirements.  These farmers are unable in some cases to bring their cowsheds up to the requirements of the Act and should be permitted to sell small quantities of milk.  It affects particularly the agricultural workers.  I am sure the Minister has heard the complaint before now, but I thought I should bring it to his notice on this Supplementary Estimate; and I would be very glad if he would have inquiries made of the boards of health in order to have some machinery established to obviate this hardship.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister a question regarding this Supplementary Estimate.  I understand that it was the policy of the Minister's Department, in dealing with the allocation of houses, to ask the boards of health what rents they proposed to charge, and to ascertain the circumstances of the tenants, and then to approve&mdash;as they usually did&mdash;of the rents which the local authority proposed to fix.  Recently a case has come to my notice, where the Kildare Board of Health erected 26 houses at Newbridge. They intended to charge the tenants 5/- per week rent&mdash;apart from additional charges in respect of water and electric light.  They contracted with the tenants to allow them into the houses at 5/- per week; and, in fact, handed over the keys to the tenants. Then they intimated to the Department what they had done; and the Department&mdash;for the first time, so far as I know&mdash;wrote to the board of health and said they must fix a varying rent in these cases according to the circumstances of the tenant.  The Department asked for statistics as to the income of the tenants, and got that information from the board of health; but the Department seems to have taken no notice of the circumstances of the tenant.  In some cases the tenant was able to say that the income was, say, £3 per week, but the Department took no cognisance of the fact that seven persons were trying to live on the £3 weekly.  A person in receipt of £3 weekly in income, and having to maintain seven persons on that sum, would be much worse off than the person with <Col N="2615" /> 30/- a week in income and having to maintain only two persons.  On that occasion, the board of health replied that they did not propose to increase the rents beyond 5/-; and the Department retaliated by saying that, if they did not, the subsidy would be reduced from 60 per cent. to 15 per cent.  I would like to know from the Minister whether this is a new departure on the part of his Department, and whether, in future, the Department is going to insist on some central policy of differential rents, which is what they did in this particular case.  If the Minister's Department is going to adopt a policy of that kind, I am afraid that is going to add to the complications of the local authorities.  I should like to know whether that is going to be the policy of the Department in regard to the fixation of rent, and whether&mdash;if the local authority does not carry out that policy&mdash;they will be penalised by the loss or reduction of the subsidy which they expected from State funds when they had built houses under the Housing Acts.</P>

      <P>I did not expect that these points would be raised, as the main Estimate was only passed about three weeks ago and there was a Housing Bill a month ago.  This Supplementary Estimate had to be introduced because the main Estimate was prepared before that Bill was passed. Consequently, I am not in a position to deal with these matters, which I did not expect.  I understood that it was unlikely, unprecedented, that a general housing debate would take place on this Estimate.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4.  This is an amendment which <Col N="2618" /> seeks to make some easier provision for persons who are in receipt of unemployment assistance or home assistance. In some cases I understand that the sum available to those people would amount to about 6/- per week; and in a case where it was necessary to pay for the licence it would take 5/- out of the 6/-, which would be a hardship. The principle is admitted of having to buy a licence, but an effort should be made to bring it within the means of the person concerned.  It is unlikely that there would be many such cases, and, of course, the administrative difficulties have to be taken into account.  Nevertheless, it would be advisable that people who are in poor circumstances ought not be debarred by reason of a charge which, although merely nominal, is almost prohibitive to persons in the two classes that are mentioned.  If it were possible to make a scheme of this sort workable, it might be a good thing for everybody concerned.  In other countries you have fruit trees growing alongside the road, and they are never interfered with.  There has grown up a respect there for what Providence provides.  It is more than likely that, if special consideration were shown to people of these classes, to people in these circumstances, there would be a corresponding interest shown by them in the fisheries and all concerned with them. That is the purpose of the amendment. It is one that I think the Minister ought to consider in the exceptional circumstances of the case.  From the information at our disposal, quite a number of these people have fishing rods, but naturally they are not of the expensive kind, and if occupation and useful recreation of this sort were available for them, it would be a benefit to their families and generally, I think, would be of use to the country. I put down the amendment in order to deal with persons who are either in receipt of home assistance or unemployment assistance.  I can quite appreciate the case that the Minister may make against it&mdash;that a man may not be long in receipt of unemployment assistance or home assistance. But it is possible that in such cases, if provision were made for them when they are in receipt of assistance, they <Col N="2619" /> would themselves respond to that if they got into more affluent circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the amendment.  If this Bill as originally drafted were introduced in the British House of Commons 30 or 40 years ago, representatives of this country would feel like saying very hard things about it.  As a matter of fact, one might say that it was a landlord's Bill.  Of course that does not arise now.  Apparently it is substantially agreed that, in the interests of the country and to make these fisheries a national asset, it is prudent to do something for them.  But we must consider the background of this whole question.  People of this class in the past, to put it plainly, would hardly be allowed to walk on the bank of a river.  It was an offence to walk on the bank of a river if there was any suspicion of poaching.  We are now introducing a universal licensing provision, and we are making an appeal on behalf of this class of people, who at present have no amenities to enjoy. The first two classes particularly are people who could not possibly afford any amusement for which they would have to pay.  There is nothing for them except to walk the roads or the fields. I suppose they will be at liberty now to walk on the bank of a river without committing an offence.  I said on the Committee Stage that if you give a man like this a licence he possibly would not catch a trout in ten years. But that is not the point.  The point is that you get the goodwill of men who, when they take a stroll on the bank of a river on a Sunday, might otherwise do damage to valuable fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the two first classes, I do not see any administrative difficulty whatever.  If the concession were granted and such a man were to look for a licence, all you have to do is to ask him to show his unemployment certificate or his home assistance certificate and that settles the whole matter. Some trouble might arise with regard to people earning under £2, but with regard to the two first classes there <Col N="2620" /> would be no trouble whatever.  But I think that when we give a concession to riparian owners and their families we should also give it to the labourers. On the farm of a riparian owner there may be a labourer who may have two or three sons.  All the amusement that these boys would have on a Sunday evening would be to take a fishing rod of some kind and go and fish a river or a stream.  As we have admitted the principle with regard to the riparian owners, surely a very strong case can be made for these agricultural labourers and their sons, because, although the riparian owner actually owns the land, these are the men who assist him in working it and keeping it in production.  We have admitted the principle of giving a 6d. licence to farmers.  A farmer may be a man who has £1,000 in the bank and may own a farm of 60, 70 or 100 acres. There may be three or four labourers' cottages on his farm.  We are giving the concession to the farmer, but we are not giving any concession to the labourers.  When we are giving the concession to the farmers, I think we should certainly meet these other cases.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has attempted, I think, to meet very fairly the views put up by Deputies.  I wonder would he consider this matter before the Bill goes to the Seanad.  He has met nearly every possible point put up with reference to this trout rod licence.  He has gone farther in some respects than, perhaps, I would be inclined to go myself.  I think it would be worth while, in order to get general agreement on this trout rod licence, to agree to consider meeting this one remaining point, especially with regard to those who are in receipt of unemployment assistance and home assistance. I think the Minister will agree that I have shown right through the whole course of the Bill appreciation of the difficulties with which he has to contend.  When a person who is in receipt of one of these licences ceases to be either unemployed or in receipt of home assistance, I can see a difficulty arising as to how you are going to get him to change from a special concession licence to an ordinary 5/- licence.  That is the difficulty that the <Col N="2621" /> Minister would have to consider, and before the Bill goes to the Seanad I think he ought to consider whether he could meet this last point.</P>

      <P>I wonder do Deputies Cosgrave, McMenamin and Browne mean these amendments to be taken seriously.  My belief is that it would be better to withdraw the licences altogether.  If these amendments were passed it would take an army of officials to operate even the concessions already made.  I doubt if it can be carried out.  The Dáil is only inviting hundreds of other people to break the law even with the previous concessions. It would be far better to have something in the Bill that we can carry out. A man may be in receipt of home assistance this week and go off the next week, and we should then change his licence. Then there is the matter of earning under £2 a week.  If that were in the Act we would have arguments over it in court every day as to whether a man earns £2 or £2 1s. a week.  Thousands of officials would be needed to operate the provisions for juveniles and riparian owners though it would be easier to know whether an applicant was a riparian owner or whether he was a juvenile.  But to establish the fact in court that a man is in receipt of home assistance or unemployment assistance or that he has a wage of £2 a week would be extremely difficult. Every employer in the country would need to make returns to the boards of conservators.  In my opinion that is what it would mean.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Though I see some of them, I think the difficulties are exaggerated by Deputy Allen.  I would like the Minister to consider that the number affected is very slight.  One of the main difficulties was the one mentioned by Deputy Lynch, that is the question whether a man is in receipt of home assistance or unemployment assistance and what his wage is. These are theoretical rather than practical difficulties.  The number of such cases would be slight.  If a man <i>bona fide</i> gets a licence and exercises it for a year there is not much damage done. The number of people fishing is not so <Col N="2622" /> very numerous and there would be no army of officials necessary.  The man has his unemployment card.  I admit there is some difficulty so far as earning under £2 a week is concerned, but I do not think an army of officials would be required to deal with that. I suggest to Deputy Allen that it would be easier to establish the receipt of unemployment benefit than juvenility.</P>

For that reason I think the Minister, in order to meet the objections, some of them not well founded, should consider at least two of the cases first mentioned in this particular amendment.  I see the difficulty about the £2 a week earnings. Possibly in the other cases the Minister might consider the genuine purpose that is served by this particular amendment.</P>

During that 12 months a certain number of months only will be operative. Assuming that a man were getting home assistance or unemployment assistance for three weeks and then gets employment, some one or other will inform the clerk of the board of conservators that that is so. Assuming that no action is taken, will not the clerk mark in his book that this man was employed for a certain period of the year and when the man in the following year comes in for his licence he will ask him for 5/- for it. The individuals will have to make a case for the licence.  The man will have to satisfy the board of conservators or rather satisfy the clerk, for that is what it would mean.  It does not appear to be a very onerous task.  It is possible if there are difficulties that there are compensations as well in the whole business.  The desire here is to ensure&mdash;and it is possible to do it&mdash;greater respect and regard for <Col N="2623" /> the fisheries, to make them of interest to everybody and not to have men going along and saying &ldquo;only the rich can enjoy this; how can I pay 5/- for a licence out of 6/- unemployment assistance?&rdquo; or something of that sort. These amendments are moved in order to get a true appreciation of citizenship. The number of persons affected will be inconsiderable.  If the amendment effects the purpose of getting the interest of everybody in the fisheries, it will be worth paying money in order to get it.</P>

      <P>The concessions so far made on this section are on the age or residential basis and not on the means basis.  In these amendments there is a departure from what has been the principle.  It is not following on the lines of the concession already brought in in respect to Section 9.  I think we are going to put a very big task on the board of conservators in these cases.  I could understand that a question like this may arise where it was a case that the Government were collecting the money and keeping it for Government purposes, because in that case we would have organisations such as the Revenue Commissioners and the Civic Guards at our disposal to investigate the cases.  Here we have only the board of conservators and I think it is hardly fair to ask these boards to take the responsibility of deciding whether a man is getting unemployment assistance, home assistance or earning less than £2 a week.  It is not so easy for the clerk to satisfy himself in these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some big districts like Limerick the clerk is resident in Limerick and that district runs up to Leitrim.  That is an extraordinary case if you like, but there are other districts where the clerk can have no knowledge whatever of the people who will apply for licences.  I think it would make it almost impossible for the boards to carry on this business at all if these amendments were passed.  The boards have to pay the expenses of their local representatives in court and if they were to lose one case in ten or 12 it would not be worth while fighting the <Col N="2624" /> cases.  If the Deputies gave the matter full consideration they would come to the conclusion that the boards would be almost powerless to carry on the business.  In every case they would have to accept the word of the person that he was in receipt of unemployment assistance or that he was earning less than £2 a week.  I think by bringing these people to court they cannot lose on them; it is not likely that there would be more than one dishonest person in ten and therefore they could not lose.  The only sensible course would be to take the word of the person applying for the licence in each case.  I am not sure that Deputies are satisfied that everybody's word can be taken.</P>
    <P>There are people in this country who if they think they can get a thing for sixpence instead of paying 5/- for it, would not object to go in and tell a lie.  I think you would have this result, that every dishonest person in this country who wants a brown trout licence, if he can get it for sixpence, I am quite sure he will make every possible effort to get it for sixpence.</P>
    <P>There is another point about what would happen during the year.  It is quite obvious that if this amendment is passed the licence will hold for the year.  I think it would be better to have it that way than to have any reinvestigation during the year.  Take it that the beginning of the brown trout year is the 15th February.  We might regard that as the beginning of the brown trout licence year.  There are people who may not be earning as much during that particular week as in other parts of the year.  There are people who earn a good deal of money in the Summer or the Autumn or the Spring and they might possibly be earning very little at that time of the year and they would be entitled to this sixpenny licence.</P>
    <P>Deputies will observe that there are all sorts of anomalies cropping up which will be very hard to deal with. I think if this matter is examined very minutely we will have to come to the conclusion that if we do this there is no use in saying that we can investigate it or verify the facts when a person comes forward for a licence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>You would have a great deal of trouble.  For instance, if the clerk were to doubt a person who might be living many miles away it would entail a lot of trouble.  If the clerk suspects that the man is not telling the truth, and if he brings him to court, there will be a great deal of expense.  He will have to accept the man's word, or otherwise it will become very expensive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Even that is not sufficient. He will have to bring them to court, too.  I do not really know why Deputies should bring this particular amendment in connection with this Bill and place the very unpleasant task of investigating cases of this sort on the boards of conservators.  You could imagine a Deputy or other people suggesting, if this amendment were passed, that people who are unemployed should not be taxed going into a cinema, that they should go in for less than a person who would be working. What is perhaps more important is that they might suggest that unemployed people should not be asked to pay the tax on sugar, that they should get it from their grocers free of tax, and that persons who are working should be obliged to pay the tax.  That sort of thing could happen.  It is a new principle that has not been seriously advocated, so far as I can recollect, in the Dáil before, and I think it is unfair that we should put this task on the conservators and select them as the first on whom we should try it out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this connection I might mention that in regard to another matter Deputy Norton raised a question relating to rents.  From my knowledge of the subject before the Deputy introduced it, I believe that there are great difficulties arising in the charging of rents to people according to their various circumstances.  In that instance you would have a case worth while investigating <Col N="2626" /> in order to find out the person's circumstances.  The local authority would have 20 or 30 people, and they would set out to investigate their circumstances.  Even so, the members and officials of the local authority would have a great opportunity of knowing the individual circumstances of the applicants for houses, and yet they would find it very difficult to get the facts and act fairly in putting a higher rent on one person than they would put on another.</P>
    <P>In spite of all this, Deputy McMenamin says that a man might not catch a trout.  That is a bad argument.  After all, if they did not catch a trout, why should we have all this trouble about it?  I prefer Deputy Cosgrave's point, that these people who are poor might add something to the family income by catching trout.  If it were not for a point like that there would not be much in the amendment.</P>

      <P>Will the holding of the licence entitle the fisherman to a right of way, or is there any provision made in that connection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that in a moment.  On this matter of the licence I may say I have given it great thought and so have the officials of the Department, and they think, and I think, that if this amendment were pressed and passed it would, as Deputy Allen suggests, make this section practically impossible.  I know that the conservators would get the 5/- from the tourists who come along.  Obviously they are not local unemployed.  But I do not think they would get it from anybody else.  I think we will have to resist this amendment.  I am quite prepared, as Deputy Lynch has requested, to consider every aspect of this matter even up to the last stage in the Seanad, but at the moment I see no hope of anything being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, with regard to Deputy Walsh's point, there are two very distinct questions there.  A person must get a licence to fish in the first place, and he must get leave to fish in the second place from whoever owns the fishery. If it is a privately-owned fishery, unless the person gets leave from the owner the licence does not entitle him to fish there at all.  The licence does <Col N="2627" /> entitle him to fish in a public fishery. The licence does not give him a right of way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LaurenceJosephWalsh" hpid="Mr. L.J. Walsh Mr. L.J. Walsh">

      <P>I would ask the Minister to bear that in mind.  I was rather shocked to hear the Minister say that people could tell lies.  I recollect that a couple of years ago I was almost hurled out of the House for suggesting that, and I was told I was casting a slur on the fair name of our people.  I think our conscience is sometimes extremely subtle, and while a man can tell a lie to the clerk of the conservators, he might not be so ready to produce false documents, and the number of cases, therefore, would be greatly diminished, I suggest.  It is a subtle distinction, but it has a funny effect on people.  There is documentary evidence, I think.  I am not dealing with the case of the man with £2 wages but with the other cases where there may be documentary evidence supplied and the clerk could act on that.  In that case I do not think many people would get through the net.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was one point I omitted.  When this section was first brought in I could quite understand Deputies putting down numbers of amendments, but I think the position has changed considerably since the Committee Stage and all these small rivers and streams are absolutely free to the person with a low wage.  We are now only dealing with the larger rivers and lakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>One point made by the Minister was that these cases might go to court.  I do not see how they could.  The person applying must satisfy the board of conservators and, <Col N="2628" /> if he cannot satisfy them, apparently he will not get the licence.  Surely, they are the persons to be satisfied?  It is scarcely fair to compare this with the tax on sugar.  It is rather more comparable with the case of income-tax, where certain allowances are given to certain people which are denied others.  This is not something that we are taking off right away.  We are imposing a licence of 5/-, which was never in existence before.  If we elect to reduce that by 4/6 in respect of an unemployed person, we are still taxing him to the extent of 6d.  The same might be said with regard to the entrance fee to cinemas and other places of that sort.  Those charges were always there and we are not asking for any special dispensation in the case of the trout licence.  We are saying in respect of a particular tax that it should be mitigated in the case of those who have practically no means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as this matter of a licence is concerned, the case has been made by Deputies and by newspapers that it was likely to injure fishing.  It is to correct that impression, as well as to maintain, as far as is reasonably possible, a sort of right that people had, at a moderate price, that the amendment is proposed.  Assuming that we take 20 years as the age of persons interested in fishing, presumably 80 per cent. of those who fish one year will be fishing the next year, so that the secretary of the board of conservators is probably acquainted with them. It does not mean that there will be a new onslaught by unemployed looking for licences.  It will simply mean that those who were engaged in the sport, occupation, recreation, or whatever it is called, will still be interested in it. The strength of the case for the amendment is that if a man has been accustomed to fish for a number of years, and has not had to pay a tax, he may consider that some limit is being put on his activities.  If he is unemployed he will feel aggrieved at not being allowed to take out his rod, unless he pays 5/- licence.  I do not think it is administratively impossible to work this proposal. I believe that sufficient case has been made for it to warrant reconsideration by the Minister.  It is unlikely <Col N="2629" /> that there will be a very large number applying for this concession. In a case like this, where the number will be limited, it is better in the first place to have people fairly well satisfied that an attempt was made to preserve and further develop fishing, and in the next place, not to interfere with those who have been engaged in this sport, pastime or recreation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister seems to be putting up hurdles so that he may knock them down.  In the first place the amendment leaves it discretionary to issue a licence.  There is a simple remedy regarding the identification of applicants, inasmuch as they will have to send a certificate, a card from the home assistance authorities or an unemployment certificate to the secretary of the conservators.  A letter from the sergeant of the Gárda district in which the applicant lives would identify him as the person specified in the unemployment certificate.  No responsibility is thrown on the secretary of the board of conservators.  The onus is on the applicant.  The proposal does not apply to a large class, because a trout would never look at a fly cast by a man who had not fished before he was 20 years of age.  That man might as well be whistling jigs to a milestone as fishing for trout.  We are only concerned with men who have been fishing all their lives, and who believe they had a right to fish.  They are a limited class who began fishing young; otherwise they will never be trout fly fishermen. Up to this they have been free to fish.</P>

In my opinion there are no obstacles, because if a man is not able to produce his card, then the question of issuing a licence is within the discretion of those concerned.  Fishing has been more or less a reserved right in this country.  There was an absolute tyranny in some respects in the past, because a local water bailiff who saw a man on the river bank could summon him.</P>

We want to get good-will in this matter.  Are we to close the door to a poor man who takes a fishing rod out on Sunday?  I am supporting this for the purpose of developing a source of national wealth. A big advance was made when licences were given to all riparian owners.  I want to get good-will by getting this concession for a class that cannot afford any expenditure.  The British Government never made such a proposal. Even the Irish landlords in their worst days never thought of it. All these years the poor man could take out his rod on Sunday and have free fishing.  Such people had free fishing in the past.  I want to improve this Bill by getting good-will behind it, and to imbue people with a better sense of citizenship.  It should be remembered that very many cases involving violent breaches of the law have taken place in recent years, and that Civic Guards were permanently injured in connection with disturbances arising out of fishing.  This is a question on which we should try to carry the people with us by getting their good-will.</P>

      <P>I am as anxious as anyone to grant this concession to the unemployed, but I am rather inclined to agree with the suggestion that there would be a certain amount of chaos created.  It has been suggested by Deputy Cosgrave and by Deputy McMenamin that the production of an unemployment card or something of that kind would meet the position. That is not so at all, because, under the Unemployment Assistance Act, the man continues to hold that certificate even though he is working.  He can claim to get that certificate when he is in employment, long before he thinks he will be idle.  As a matter of fact, the labour exchanges suggest to men that they should obtain in advance the <Col N="2631" /> certificates to enable them to obtain unemployment assistance when they shall have drawn all their unemployment benefit.  If those who have spoken approach the Minister for Industry and Commerce they will realise that that is the fact&mdash;that a man holds the certificate in his possession even though he is working.  I was wondering whether the Minister could not agree to a scheme to grant this concession to people who have been in the habit of fishing on certain rivers and have been licensed for an agreed number of years up to this&mdash;to give that concession to them if unemployed.</P>

I understand that there have been legal decisions, particularly in connection with the gap in the Lismore weir.  The judges hearing that particular case said they were bound by the certificate of the Commissioners of Fisheries, which certificate was granted pursuant to the Act of 1863.  If the Minister is already satisfied that under this section he can review or cause to have reviewed gaps in weirs even though <Col N="2634" /> they hold certificates as being correct under the 1863 Act, I am satisfied. But I think he might look into the matter as to whether he should, if necessary, take power now to consider whether or not these gaps are in accordance with the law, even though the proprietors may hold the old certificate of the Commissioners of Fisheries that they are all right.  It would be well that the Minister should have power to have these gaps inspected if he thought fit.  It was entirely in connection with the Lismore weir that I put down the amendment.

      <P>I move amendment No. 13:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 38, Section 67 (2) (a), line 59, to delete the word &ldquo;primarily&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been put to me that there is a possibility that if the word &ldquo;primarily&rdquo;<Col N="2636" /> remains, some of the proprietors of these fisheries might, during the transition period, over-fish their rivers in order to push up their returns for the purpose of compensation.  The Minister and the officers of his Department will know that, in the past, many of those proprietors did not fish the rivers as much as they would have been entitled to do under the law because they looked forward to these fisheries remaining in their families for generations.  They took care that a certain amount of fish were allowed to pass up to spawn so as to keep the stock up for the years to come.  During the last four or five years of the transition period, it might happen that a proprietor would say that it would not matter what happened to the fishery after such a date and that he would lay himself out to take up every salmon he possibly could, so as to run up his returns.  The arbitrator would be bound by the figures this proprietor would return as the ordinary profits of the fishery.  I think it would be worth while to accept this amendment. In my own mind, there is one proprietor to it.  I have heard of one proprietor already carrying on very intensive fishing with a view to pushing up his returns.  I would rather like to have that person caught, because his returns are bound to go down during the transition period.  At the same time I am afraid that leaving the word &ldquo;primarily&rdquo; there will be an inducement to some proprietors, at least, to over-fish their fisheries during that period and consequently hand over to the Minister an asset which would be certainly not worth the amount represented in the returns put before the arbitrator.</P>

      <P>I had down amendments covering a similar matter, namely, that when a fishery is taken over, the owner should not be allowed to destroy any of the amenities before it is finally taken over. This is a double-edged weapon.  You can test a fishery this year and destroy it for the fourth year.  The owner might have luck and he might have a run of fish in one year whereas there would be a failure as a result of the intensive fishing in the next year.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy Lynch has given an instance himself which does raise án objection to this amendment. That is that the owners know now that these fisheries will be taken over, some of them in the near future and some of them in the distant future.  They may go out this year, next year and the year after to do intensive fishing and then be able to point afterwards to the period 1938-40, or whatever it may be, to show the great value of their fishery. The intention of the Bill as it stands, with the word &ldquo;primarily&rdquo; in it, is to compel as far as we can, the owners of fisheries to keep their fisheries wellstocked, in other words, not to over-fish them, during the period that is going to elapse from now until the transition period should commence. There is no danger, I think, of overfishing during the transition period because we shall have an officer of the Department there present during that time to see that everything is carried out properly.  If the owner should attempt to over-fish at that time, of course the officer's report will be very much against him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I might say that I think the Minister has set a very good example to his colleagues in the way that he has met suggestions put up from the various parts of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Bill is now a much better Bill than it was when introduced.  I said on Second Reading that I thought it was a good Bill, and I think it has been very considerably improved as a result of the way in which the Minister has met suggestions put forward by the various Deputies in Committee.  Since amendment No. 14, standing in my name, was ruled out of order, I want to make a brief reference to the point with which it dealt.  The Minister does make certain provision with regard to these residences which have angling amenities in Section 69 (2) of the Bill.  First of all, Section 58 (2) provides that where there is any angling with rod or line appurtenant or contiguous to one <Col N="2641" /> of these transferable fisheries, the fishery shall, for the purposes of that part of the Act, be deemed to include such right, that is the right of fishing with rod and line.  That becomes a portion of the transferable fishery. Section 69 (2) provides that in the case of a rating, the appropriate authority may review the rates on the particular demesne.  The fact of the matter is that what will be left will be usually a white elephant.  If you take away the angling amenities from some of the residences, they will be neither saleable nor lettable, and if there could be some provision brought in on the lines which I suggested in the amendment&mdash; which I knew would be ruled out of order and which I put down merely to remind myself of this point&mdash;or if the Minister would consider the matter before bringing the Bill to the Seanad I think it would be worth while, because quite a number of these houses are good houses, which might be an asset if they had the angling amenity still attached to them, whereas they would be absolutely useless if that amenity were taken away. That is one point that I wish to raise on this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also another point.  I forget whether the Minister has any responsibility in this matter or not, but it is well known that after the 1925 Act was passed&mdash;that is, where the rates on valued fisheries went to the board of conservators&mdash;a number of fisheries which had never been valued before were brought in for purposes of valuation. I do not know whose responsibility that is.  I have no objection to that, where there were netting pools or things of that kind brought in, but I know of some cases where it is a matter of annoyance to the riparian owner, even though the valuation is small&mdash;as I say, they are more annoying than of any real substance&mdash;but it is rather annoying for many of these owners, who have stretches of river and who invariably allow the public to come in and fish them without any charge whatever.  It is of no value to the riparian owner, and I raise the matter now for the Minister's consideration. I think that if he could use any influence in the matter, where fisheries belong to persons like that who let the <Col N="2642" /> public in&mdash;and God knows they have little enough from fishing nowadays, and will have less when the Minister for Industry and Commerce is finished with them in his Tourist Traffic Bill&mdash; it would be a good thing.  It is hard lines on a decent farmer who has a stretch of river, and who allows every Tom, Dick and Harry to come in along the banks of the river and fish there, to find himself salted, even if it were only to the extent of £1 a year, in connection with that fishery.</P>
    <P>There is one remaining point to which I want to draw the Minister's attention.  I do not know very much about this matter myself, but a big memorandum was handed to Deputy Giles and he told me that he could not be here himself and asked me to mention the matter.  This memorandum is on behalf of the owners of fisheries on the River Boyne, between Oldbridge and Rosnaree.  They put up the case here that they were in a particular position as distinct from other proprietors of inland fisheries; that is, fresh water netting and traps and so on.  I am not necessarily prepared to accept what is in this amendment.  As a matter of fact I have not studied it, and I remember that I opposed an amendment by Deputy Pattison on a previous stage, because I think that when we are doing this thing at all we should go the whole hog.  However, I intended to pass the memorandum on to the Minister so that he might consider again, before the Bill is taken in the Seanad, this memorandum with a view to seeing whether there is anything in the case they make for special treatment on the Boyne.  I think these are the only points I wish to make now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know from the Minister if he is taking powers under this Bill to cut down the number of nets operating in tidal waters. I do not think he has that power already, and, if he is getting such powers, would he tell us what process he proposes to adopt?  I have a hazy recollection that the Minister referred to that on the Second Reading.  If it is correct that they have these powers, I should like to know how the Minister proposes to carry that into operation <Col N="2643" /> and apply it.  As far as I remember, the Minister said that there would be no interference with present licence owners or those who had been in the habit of fishing certain rivers, but that he would not entertain any fresh proposals. Take the case of a father and three or four sons, and that the father died, or gave up the fishing for some other reason, what would happen in that case, or would the others be entitled to be licensed?  The Minister knows the Slaney well, and he knows that at least three different people there have about a dozen boats on the river manned by different people.  The licences for those boats, I think, are in the one man's name, and one wonders what would become of those boats if that man died or went out of fishing for some reason or another?  Would the other people be entitled to apply for a licence, and would it be given to them?  That is what is annoying certain people on the Slaney, and I should like the Minister to clarify the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. John Flynn Mr. John Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. John Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to have some information from the Minister with regard to riparian owners.  I am referring to people who enjoyed certain fishery rights some 40 or 50 years ago, and the landlord eventually took them over and deprived them of any hope of regaining these fishery rights, under the Land Purchase Act, and even under the Act of 1923.  I understand that no provision is made in that Act for the acquisition of these fisheries by the State.  The result has been that the landlords in these cases sub-let or sold these fisheries to other people outside this country, or to people outside the county concerned, and these tenants claim that they have a just right to these fisheries.  They themselves agitated, and their fathers before them agitated, for some 40 or 50 years and held out against the original landlord in their claim for these fisheries, and the result was that they had to pay an increased rent for 20 or 30 years when all the other tenants had purchased and got the advantage of the reduced rents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asking the Minister whether some steps could be taken to consider people who come within that category. <Col N="2644" /> The fisheries are adjacent to their lands and they certainly have a right to them.  The landlord disposed of them and sublet them to some person from another county or country.  These people claim that that is an amenity which is part and parcel of their holdings, that they were deprived of in the land purchase agreements, simply because no provision was made to give them assistance with regard to fisheries under any of the Acts, and particularly under the 1923 Act.  We thought that something could be done to meet their case, and I should like to get some information from the Minister as to what hope there is for these people.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to refer.  The Minister referred to the question of compensation to employees on the fisheries that are to be taken over, and the question of alternative employment is also mentioned. I suggest that, if the State takes over the fisheries, the men already employed under the existing owners should be re-employed under the State.  We have a case in one district in County Kerry, where men have been agitating for years, and in fact went to prison in 1920 and 1921, in connection with their claim to these fisheries, and we submit that when any fishery is being taken over these men certainly have some claim either to employment on that fishery, when the final arbitration is being put through as between the vested owner and the State, or to compensation.  These men who claim the right to fish in that district should get either some type of compensation or employment in that fishery.  About 20 of these men were imprisoned at the time, and their own people and the countryside subscribed to fight the case in court.  So far as I know, the title has never been decided one way or the other, and I submit, when the State takes over that fishery, these people who still claim the right of employment in that fishery are entitled to consideration.  We submit that they have the same right now as in 1920, and that they should be either compensated or employed, when the State takes over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Minister's intention to compensate an aged fisherman <Col N="2645" /> to whom he would not be prepared to grant a licence and who would be fishing in the estuary of a tidal river like the Blackwater?  I need not tell him that that man might have a family and that very considerable hardship would be inflicted on him if he did not get a licence or compensation instead of a licence.  There are a considerable number of weirs here and there throughout the country on various rivers, the Blackwater in particular, on which the employees get a certain amount of work throughout the year. Is it his intention to give those men compensation as well, in the event of their not getting alternative employment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister not to act too quickly, or too drastically, in the matter of reducing these draft-net licences.  If he does, he will be letting himself in for serious trouble in those places where it has been a tradition.  After all, he has ample powers to ensure that the rivers will be properly stocked, and so on.  In support of what Deputy Corish said, this livelihood is traditional in certain families, and if the licences are cut down too drastically, it will cause serious trouble and serious poaching, and it would be very difficult for the Minister to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Lynch's point as to rates being put on after the 1925 Act was passed, I may say that these rates were put on by the rating authority.  I do not know whether the attention of the rating authority was drawn to it, but it was the rating authority put them on. There is a point, I think, in what the Deputy says, that some consideration should be extended in the case of a farmer who has a right to a certain fishery, who is rated for it, but who has never prevented anybody from fishing there&mdash;a fishery which, in other words, is a public fishery so far as that owner is concerned&mdash;but I think it would be a matter for the Bill which I have forecast, the co-ordinating Bill, which will deal with such matters as that, boards of conservators and so on.  I am taking a note of the point to see if it could be dealt with in that Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2646" /> The Deputy also raised a point with regard to his amendment which was ruled out of order, but if the Deputy will look at Section 64 he will see that the person he has in mind may, if he wishes, keep the angling rights on his holding.  If he does not exercise that right, and allows the Minister to take these angling rights, I do not think he should get any special treatment because he has allowed these rights to go.  He would be having it both ways, if we were to give it to him.  The Deputy further mentioned that he had a memo which had been handed to him with regard to some waters in which Deputy Giles is interested.  I should like to have that memo. to examine it and to see if any point arises on it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corish asked about the cutting down of the net men in the public fisheries.  That is very fully dealt with in Section 37.  It amounts to this: there is a standard year taken, 1935, and when that section of the Bill comes into operation, we will take the number of nets that worked in the tidal waters of the Slaney in 1935.  The Minister has power to give licences for the same number, that is, 100 per cent., or he may reduce them to 80 per cent. for the first three years, which period he can extend to ten years, if he wishes.  Subsequently, he has power to bring them down to 50 per cent., but for the three years or ten years period, he must permit 80 per cent., and he may permit up to 100 per cent.  The intention is to allow the regular fishermen to continue.  As a matter of fact, it is provided in the Bill that those who have been fishing regularly must get preference.  As far as the other point raised with regard to a father of two or three sons, who had been fishing and who dies the intention is to give the licence to sons to carry on.  When speaking on the Second Reading, I said that the intention of that section was to make fishing, as far as possible, a regular profession, because in a good year, like 1937.  I knew people who came to fish in the Slaney who had never fished for years before and never will again. but it was, however, a good year and these people came along and took a <Col N="2647" /> good bit from the fishermen.  I think the regular fishermen should be given the good year with the bad year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In a case like that, where a man owns eight or six boats, we possibly would avail of the opportunity to take at least one from him. Deputy Bartley raised the same point and said that we should be slow to reduce the licences.  It is the intention to be slow in reducing the licences and to give licences as far as possible to the regular fishermen.  I should like very much to have particulars of the matter raised by Deputy Flynn.  It would be impossible to deal with the point raised without full particulars as to the men he has in mind. He also referred to employees who were working on privately-owned fisheries and he advocated the taking over of those employees, when the State takes over the fisheries.</P>
      <P>That will be done as far as possible. The State will naturally take over these employees.  If they are not taken over, they must get compensation.  That, I think, answers Deputy Brasier's point also.  The State will try to employ them, but if they are not employed, they will be compensated, and the compensation is laid down in the Bill. The other matter raised&mdash;that those who thought they had a right to the fisheries should be employed&mdash;is different altogether.  It would be very hard to give a promise in that respect because I do not know where it might stop.</P>

      <P>Under the existing law, it is not possible for seamen&mdash;and for this purpose the term &ldquo;seamen&rdquo; includes an officer&mdash;to agree in advance to have any part of their remuneration deducted for any purpose.  A superannuation fund for seamen, for officers, has been set up in Britain, and British ship-owners are making it a condition of the employment of officers that they should agree to become members of the superannuation fund.  To facilitate the establishment of a similar fund here, it is necessary that the law should be amended so that officers can agree to have their contributions to the fund deducted from their wages.

      <P>No; there is no contribution. Sub-section (1) of Section 2 provides that wages due or accruing to a seaman or to an apprentice to the sea service, or a part of any such wages, may be applied in paying contributions to a superannuation fund. Under the existing law that cannot be done.  In order to prevent abuses, which were common in the mercantile marine many years ago, the Merchant Shipping Acts prohibited a seaman from agreeing to having any part of his wages deducted for any purpose.  If seamen are to be permitted to agree to having part of their wages deducted for the purpose of a superannuation <Col N="2650" /> fund, the law must be amended.

      <P>That for the purpose of any Act of the present Session to make further and better provision for the encouragement and development of the tourist traffic, and for that purpose to establish a board having powers of regulation, registration, and control in matters relating to the tourist traffic and, in particular, the accommodation and attractions available for tourists, and to provide for the charging of fees by such board in respect of registers kept by them, and to provide for divers matters ancillary to or connected with the matters aforesaid, it is expedient to authorise&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not give much information in the course of his Second Reading speech on this Bill regarding the money that was to be expended under the Bill.  The revenue which will be provided under this Bill amounts to £45,000, of which £25,000 is to be paid in administrative charges or expenses.  £20,000 is to be devoted to publicity.  Speaking from recollection, the amount of money that is available to the tourist board at present is somewhere in the neighbourhood of £18,000, which also would be available for expenditure in connection with publicity matters.  There are some points in connection with this expenditure of money which require further explanation.  £25,000 for administration charges represents a fairly big sum.  First of all, there are five members of the board.  Could the Minister give us any indication as to what it is proposed to pay these members of the board?  There used to be criticism of the way this country was run during the British régime.  The principal criticism was that we were literally covered with boards.  That seems to be, to some extent, the policy of this present Government.  Is it necessary to form a board of five persons?  We are now reaching a point where careful consideration must be given to the expenditure of every penny of public money.  In essence, this particular Financial Resolution is going to involve somewhere between £1,500,000 and £2,000,000.  Taking it as a capital sum <Col N="2653" /> that represents five years' purchase of £45,000 and £600,000.  The success or failure of this measure will depend, very largely, on the way in which this particular board is going to be run.  Would the Minister give us any idea as to how the estimate of £20,000 for administrative expenses was arrived at?  The present tourist board spends something like £18,000 a year.  Is it necessary to expend at such a rate as we find indicated in this Bill?  I should say that most of that £18,000 is spent on advertising.  The Minister, in the course of his speech, referred to the accommodation available in this country as being entirely inadequate and out of date.  It may be that I am putting a wrong interpretation on the Minister's speech, but if that impression were to get abroad it would not make this country particularly attractive from the tourist point of view.</P>
      <P>It is desirable to improve tourist traffic in this country.  I wonder if this particular proposal is the best way to do it.  Can the Minister give the House any information as to the type of person he has in mind for appointment to this board?  Could it not be done by a branch of his Department, with the assistance of an advisory body?  This method of dealing with a matter of importance such as this amounts in substance to this: that we provide £2,000,000, that we are setting up a board, and that the Minister has practically got no further responsibility.  It is true that £600,000 of that sum has to be sanctioned or approved of by the Minister, and subsequently approved by the Minister for Finance, and presumably a Vote in respect of it will come before the Dáil.  It does appear as if there was to be the minimum of Ministerial control as regards that sum of £600,000.  In respect of it, I take it that the Minister must be persuaded that it is necessary, and satisfied that it is good business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we examine some of the purposes for which money is to be provided, we get into still deeper water. For instance, it is proposed under this measure to construct hotels in places where other business people might not be interested in constructing them&mdash;in places such as Rhynana and Baldonnel. <Col N="2654" /> I hope that on that point I am interpreting what the Minister said correctly.  Is it part of the policy of this measure to have hotels built in these places?  One of them is about 12 miles from the City of Limerick and some 12 miles, possibly, from the town of Ennis, in which, at the moment, there is very good hotel accommodation. Both Baldonnel and Collinstown are within a reasonably short distance of the City of Dublin, and one would think that a restaurant or something of that sort would be quite sufficient at either place.  If it is intended to construct hotels in either of these places, it is unlikely that they will be paying concerns. If they are not paying, are we not withdrawing some patronage from hotels which would be paying or which are paying?  I think that the House is entitled, when asked to vote such a large sum of money as this, to get very full information from the Minister.  I hope that he is in a position to give it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the matters referred to by Deputy Cosgrave were discussed on the Second Reading of the Bill, and I should have thought that it would not be necessary to go over the same ground again.  We are proposing to set up this board because we consider that the functions which it is designed to carry out can best be performed by a board which will have the liberty of action that such a board usually has.  We might have decided to set up a public company or some such similar organisation, but we felt that the particular arrangement for which the Bill provides was the best in all the circumstances.  I think it would be completely impossible for a section of a Government Department to do this work, apart altogether from the administrative difficulties which would be inevitable.  The question of political pressure, of representations from particular areas for the undertaking of expenditure in those areas, which perhaps purely business considerations would not justify, and other matters of that kind would make effective and <Col N="2655" /> efficient administration by a section of a Government Department impossible. Therefore we decided that the best course was to set up by statute a board with certain statutory functions and certain statutory powers, and to give it within certain limits the necessary resources to do the work.  We are retaining in the hands of the State powers which we think should be adequate to ensure that the board will do the particular job that is designed for it.  The power of appointing the members of the board, the power of appointing the auditors of the board, and the other restrictions on its activities for which the Bill provides, are, we think, sufficient to ensure that the board will not act in any manner other than is intended.</P>
      <P>The Deputy does not appear quite clear as to the financial provisions of the Bill.  The Bill provides for two forms of advances to the board: non-repayable advances, and repayable advances. The only thing in relation to the non-repayable advances is that they must not exceed £45,000 in the year. The actual amount will be estimated and provided for by a Vote of the Dáil. It is anticipated, however, that the board will have a revenue, a growing revenue, as a result of its own activities. It will have a revenue from the registration fees at the beginning, and ultimately, a revenue from its investments. In the course of time, the revenue of the board will be sufficient to finance all its activities and remove the necessity for the making of any non-repayable advances at all.  The sum of £45,000 in the Bill is there to indicate that that is the maximum sum which can be provided without an amendment of the law.  The actual sum required will, of course, depend very largely on the board's programme of activities on the one hand, and upon its revenue from other sources on the other.  Repayable advances will, of course, be advanced for capital purposes, and will be invested by the board in profitable undertakings, undertakings capable of ensuring not merely the payment of interest upon the amount expended but the ultimate repayment of the principal to the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2656" /> There is no question about the desirability of considering carefully before we undertake any expenditure of public money.  I do not think the need at present is any greater than it was ten years ago, but the need is, nevertheless, considerable.  If, however, we are to undertake the expenditure of public money at all, the most useful way of doing it is in a manner which will bring additional business to the country, increase its income, and operate to raise the general standard of prosperity.  We think that the development of the tourist business is one way of doing that; that money spent upon that activity&mdash;if it produces the results we anticipate&mdash;will be money well spent, and that the people as a whole will get back that expenditure and a substantial profit in addition. I think there is no doubt whatever that some of the hotel accommodation and a lot of the tourist facilities which exist in this country are out of date, and that it is desirable that some body should be in existence with powers and resources to ensure that they will be improved.  I do not think that is going to do any damage whatever to our tourist trade, when it is said in connection with a plan to improve them.  I think the improvement which the board will effect in due course will make it impossible for anyone to say the same thing in the future.</P>
    <P>The Deputy, I think, misunderstood my remark concerning the establishment of a hotel at the Shannon airport. I was asked why it was considered desirable that the board should have power to build and operate hotels, and I said it might prove to be desirable in the public interest that, in certain circumstances, hotels could be established in particular localities where they would not pay in the ordinary commercial sense.  As an illustration of what I had in mind I mentioned the possibility of the establishment of a hotel at the Shannon airport.  There is no immediate intention to establish a hotel there.  I merely mentioned that possibility for the purpose of illustrating my remarks.  It might be considered desirable from many points of view that there should be a hotel <Col N="2657" /> there&mdash;a hotel which, as Deputy Cosgrave has said, would not be a paying proposition, and which consequently would not be established by private commercial enterprise.  In such circumstances we think the board should have power to undertake such development itself.  That is the only reference to such a project that I made in the Second Reading debate.  There is no such project in mind.  Whether the board would in fact be prepared to undertake any such project is something on which I could express no opinion.  My reference to the establishment of a hotel there was merely by way of illustrating a point.  I think I have dealt with the main points raised by the Deputy.  I have no doubt whatever that the establishment of an organisation like this to ensure that adequate attention is given to the development of our tourist facilities is preferable to the conferring of those functions upon a section of a Government Department.</P>

      <P>Is not that a very serious proposition?  Here we are asked to vote what is in substance a sum of approximately £1,500,000. Normally, if there is a prospectus asking for subscriptions to the extent of that sum, or any sum, one gets a regular detailed plan concerning the whole business.  We appoint this board in six months' time, or in three months' time, as the case may be.  Will the board and the Minister then decide whether or not a hotel will be built at Rhynana or any other place?  It is an extraordinary thing that we are to consider a business of this sort without considering even the personnel. Has the Minister in mind what he proposes to pay them&mdash;what their remuneration is going to be?  There are to be five members on this board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the face of it, it is an extraordinary thing that there are five unemployed <Col N="2658" /> person or persons whom we can get from other occupations to take on this right away.  Once they are appointed, they have the expenditure of £45,000 if that sum is voted; £18,000 the present income of the Tourist Development Association; then there are registration fees. While all those developments and improvements are necessary and desirable, the question arises as to how soon we will have every single man in this country looking after his brother or somebody else; we will be inspected out of existence.  I think the Minister ought to tell the House what he proposes to pay those men, whether they are persons with experience in hotel work, or what particular type of person he had in mind when he considered setting up the board.</P>

This is one of the items, £45,000, and possibly the interest on the £600,000 or a part of it, because it can be waived.  There was another point raised by Deputy Professor O'Sullivan as to whether this tourist board could lend money. Is it not restricted to profit making transactions?  For example, a hotel company might desire to put up a new front.  That will not increase their profit making possibilities.  It will, perhaps, attract more customers, but of itself it is not profit making.  Would they be entitled to make a loan in respect of that?</P>

      <P>I should like to support Deputy Cosgrave's contention that, before this Money Resolution is passed or in order to enable us to say whether it should be passed, the Minister should give us more information. <Col N="2659" /> To-day we finished the discussion on a general resolution under which a very substantially increased sum of money was being raised from the taxpayers of this country, and a part of the Minister's contribution to the debate indicated that he was of opinion that the development of this country depended on its being possible for the State to take more money out of the people's pockets in order to carry on that development. Enshrined in this measure here, and in the explanations of the measure which the Minister has given, there is definitely a suggestion that the State is going to step into an arena in which it thinks the people have failed; that it is going to spend the people's money in a particular kind of way, and enter into certain profit making occupations.  They admit that some of them may not be profit making, and that they may have to write the money off.  There are two sides of the question which occur to me.  At the present time a large number of the ordinary people of the country are spending money in the country&mdash; money which is not raised either from the ratepayers or the taxpayers&mdash;in providing amenities and facilities throughout the country of the kind which would enable tourists to enjoy their time here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take, for instance, the Royal Irish Automobile Club and the Automobile Association.  I do not know what the annual expenditure of the Royal Irish Automobile Club is, but I understand that the expenditure of the Automobile Association is £20,000 a year.  It provides services here of various kinds. It provides information for foreign visitors to this country&mdash;particularly English, Scotch and Welsh visitors.  It is an association that is recognised throughout very many countries in Europe&mdash;Italy, France, Belgium and other places&mdash;and part of the services that it provides for the tourist from Great Britain is information about hotel standards.  The information is provided in their guide books and also by signs on hotels.  It seems implied in Section 38 of the present Bill that <Col N="2660" /> the power or the permission of the tourist association to indicate standdards from the international point of view, of the various hotels to which their signs are applied, is going to be interfered with.  I would like to find out from the Minister to what extent there is going to be interference of that type with international bodies which are formed for the purpose of assisting their own nationals and tourists generally to get information with regard to hotels in the different countries in which they are travelling, according to the standards of the association.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a reasonable request, to put simply and without great argument, to the Minister when we are asked to vote this money.  It is reasonable to ask whether it is in any way going to interfere with the provision of services and the expenditure of money here that is not going to be taken out of the taxpayers. There are other groups of people in this country who develop fishing, shooting and other facilities; and I would like to ask the Minister in what way they are going to be interfered with, to what extent the £600,000 that is to be available for capital work is going to be used to buy up and interfere with societies that are at present providing shooting facilities and providing fishing and other amenities throughout the <Col N="2661" /> country.  That is one aspect of the position with regard to this Bill that I think we would like to hear at this stage.</P>
      <P>The Minister has indicated that out of £45,000 to be provided annually, £25,000 is going to be used for administrative expenses and £20,000 for publicity. As well as that, something like £18,000, the income of the Irish Tourist Association, is likely to be available. If this £25,000 is going to be spent on administrative expenses, I would like to ask the Minister under what headings it is going to be expended.  It seems to me to be a very considerable amount of money to spend on purely administrative expenses if £20,000 is going to be expended on publicity. Even if the whole £600,000 is going to be spent on outlay, loans, or capital investments of one kind or another, to spend £25,000 annually on administrative expenses seems extraordinary without getting some description as to how it will be spent.</P>
      <P>The Minister says in column 1177 of the Official Debates:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The £45,000, constituting the non-repayable annual grant, will be divided as to £25,000 for administrative expenses and £20,000 for publicity.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is extraordinary to ask the House to contribute £25,000 for administrative expenses in circumstances where we are not told who the persons are who are going to control this work, nor under what headings this expenditure is to be distributed annually.</P>

I gave certain information here on the occasion of the Second Reading debate &mdash;particulars of which are available to the Deputy&mdash;but that was merely for the purpose of conveying an idea as to the activities which the board would <Col N="2662" /> undertake upon which these capital moneys would be expended and the relative importance attaching to one particular matter as compared with another.  The same applies to the question of the £45,000 non-repayable grant to which Deputy Mulcahy refers. The division into two parts was made by me roughly, merely for the purpose of indicating what we anticipate will be the amount of the necessary expenditure.</P>

There are a number of duties imposed on the board by the Bill, a number of activities which they will have to undertake and which will involve expense.  There is the question of provision of hotel signs, the inspection which must precede the grading of hotels and their subsequent registration, the carrying out of the functions of the board in relation to special holiday areas in the appropriate part of the Bill&mdash;all these matters would involve expense to some extent &mdash;on staff and other expenses of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2.  I put down these amendments because it was not clear to the people interested who are to constitute this board and what are to be their qualifications with regard to the control of the hotel industry.  For that reason it was considered desirable that the Minister should put one or two additional members on the board.  That would not in any way affect the administrative costs other than, perhaps, the expenses of these members.  The Minister told us on the Money Resolution that he expects that these people will be business people.  There are thousands of very competent business men in this and every other country who are utterly ignorant of the hotel business.  If that is the Minister's intention, I put forward the proposals here in different forms with a view to one or other of them being accepted, and it is very necessary I think that one of these amendments should be accepted.  If these members are going to deal with hotels and tourist traffic and do not know anything about these things, even though they are first-class business men in their own particular line, it is essential that they should have some expert knowledge put at their disposal.  I do not know where they are going to get that expert knowledge.  Will the secretary of the board be a man who is fully versed in the hotel business, or will there be other members of the administrative staff who will be able to give advice? If that is so, the board will have to do their administrative work on the advice of people subordinate to them. For that reason, I think that there should be one or two persons who will help the board to deal with this industry, even in an advisory capacity. My view as to that is strengthened by the statement of the Minister that the members of the board will probably be business men, from which I infer that they will be men who are not engaged <Col N="2666" /> or have not been engaged in the tourist industry up to now.</P>

      <P>The interests covered by the ambit of the Bill are so very wide that I think it is only fair that the Irish Hotels Federation and the Hotel, Restaurant and Catering Association of Ireland should have representation on the board.  Needless to say this is more or less in its infancy and, having regard to the importance of the tourist industry to this country, there should be on the board, at any rate, some persons who have expert knowledge, and by having two members representing the bodies I have mentioned you will ensure that information will be available of which some other members might be ignorant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree to the amendment under any circumstances. I do not question that the two bodies mentioned in the amendment are fairly responsible organisations, and I am sure that any persons they might nominate for membership of the board would be very excellent business persons and suitable members of the board.  That, however, is not the point.  The point is whether we are going to have a board that will be effective to do the work entrusted to it under the Bill, composed of persons chosen because of their intelligence, integrity and energy rather than because of their representative capacity, or whether we are going to have a board of representatives.  Since this Bill was introduced I have received representations from a whole multitude of organisations that want to be represented on the board.  I have received representations from every county in Ireland urging that that particular county should have a representative on the board.  It is not possible to have a board of representatives. The persons who are going to be appointed on the board will not be representative of anybody.  They will be there as individuals charged with carrying out, with their associates, a particular job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both Deputy McMenamin and Deputy Brasier spoke, however, on this amendment in a manner which <Col N="2667" /> indicated that they are misinterpreting to a certain extent the purposes of the Bill.  This is not a Bill for the hotel industry.  It is true that the hotel industry plays an important part in our general tourist industry, and that the supervision, control, and development of our hotels will be an important part of any tourist development scheme. But this board will have a lot more to do than merely the supervision and control of hotels.  On that account, it might possibly be urged and, in my opinion, could reasonably be urged, that we should take all due precautions here to ensure that the board does not get into the control of the hotel industry, or subject to the domination of the hotel industry.  I am not putting that forward as an argument, but I could understand the argument being put forward.  In any event, I think the main argument against the amendment is that we cannot have a board which will consist of representatives either of organisations or parts of the country. That is not possible.  A board that would give even the minimum of representation to all the interests that would claim such representation would be unwieldy in size.  We contemplate a small business-like board, able to do its job effectively, and which will consist of people appointed for their individual worth, and not because of their representative capacity.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that this is not to be for the hotel industry.  What is it to be for?  Is it for farmers, for the agricultural industry? Surely, it is going to deal with one thing only, and that is hotels and <Col N="2668" /> the tourist traffic.  It is proposed to spend £20,000 annually in advertising, and to devote £25,000 to salaries and administrative expenses.  Where is the rest of the money going?  Is it not going to deal with hotels?  You ask me to deal with an industry about which I do not know sufficient without first getting expert knowledge and advice.  The ablest business man could not, without being advised, deal with linen, beds, bedrooms, bathrooms and all that sort of thing connected with hotel life and catering.  One would want to be a cook, butler, chef, and all these other things combined.  Where is the business man who can have accumulated all that knowledge?</P>
      <P>I do not see how this board is going to function independently unless it has got some expert advice.  If you got only one person to advise them, it might meet the point.  Here you are giving State moneys to a board that will be composed of ordinary business men who do not know anything about the industry or the first thing about tourist traffic.  They can have plenty of ideas and speculate and put new schemes into operation.  They may have no knowledge of the hotel industry, but possibly they may have acted on an organisation connected with the tourist industry.  They know very little about hotel management and equipment.  For instance, they may say there is only one bathroom or, perhaps, there are two bathrooms in this hotel, where there should be three or four.  If a hotel is to be fully up-to-date there should be a bath for every bedroom and, better still, if it is a double-bedded room, there should be two baths.  That would be the condition of a properly equipped, modern hotel.  I hope a board of this kind will succeed, but I have grave doubts.</P>

I have stressed the importance of the whole Bill through the country and what it means for our people.  There is only a certain class of people who understand tourist industry.  If you except transport, shipping and similar activities, what others besides the <Col N="2669" /> hotel industry understand how a board of this kind should be run?  Unless there are men of experience on the board it will be a failure.  Their duty will be to administer £600,000, and unless they understand the activities of a body like the Irish Tourist Development Association the thing will become an absolute farce.</P>

Persons will go on as individuals and not as representatives.

Such a board would be completely ineffective, apart from the impracticability of setting it up, unless it had 40 or 50 members, and then it would be incapable of working effectively because the members would be concerned with the interests of the particular bodies that sent them there and not with the work of the board.

      <P>The Minister seems to extend the intention of the amendment here.  The amendment suggests that instead of a board of five, as the section provides for, it shall consist of such number of members, not exceeding five, as the Minister may determine.  Two members shall be nominated jointly by the Hotel, Restaurant and Catering Association, Ireland, Ltd., and the Irish Hotels Federation.  The very fact that the Minister is indicating how the £600,000 for development may be divided, indicates that £400,000 of that is intended for the extension or the <Col N="2671" /> improvement of hotel and guest-house accommodation.</P>
      <P>Out of the £600,000 £400,000 is intended to be applied to the improvement and extension of hotel accommodation. The underlying argument in this amendment is that the hotel position is the key to tourist attractions in this country.  The hotel side of things is certainly entitled to some kind of representation on the board, or to some kind of special consideration. The suggestion made to the Minister is that he should add to the board of five that he contemplates, representatives of the hotels federation and the catering federation.  The Minister has indicated that it is unlikely that the members of the board will be remunerated in any way except the chairman.</P>

      <P>Now is the time for the Minister to give some indication as to what remuneration is going to be given to members of the board, seeing that we were given to understand that there was an objection to taking persons nominated by the association.  One of the difficulties Deputies have in considering the question of pressing the amendment is that the Minister has not given any indication, good, bad or indifferent, as to what kind of board he intends to set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I contemplate precisely the same kind of board as would be set up to run any other extensive industry, except that we will have to have due regard to the fact that it may call for particular qualities on the part of the personnel.  This is a business proposition, to be run by men with the necessary business qualifications.  My objection to having anyone on the board as a representative of some other interest is that that would immediately <Col N="2672" /> lessen its effectiveness.  If persons are on the board as the nominees of some other association, or as the representatives of some other interest, they will regard their first loyalty to the association which nominated them, and their first job to protect the interests of that association, and not to carry on the work of the board so as to get the most effective results from the expenditure. An organisation to be effective must be composed of people whose main interest is the proper fulfilment of the work of the board.  You cannot have that type of organisation if any members of the board are there in a representative capacity.  If there was any question about the appointment of representatives on the board, we would have to consider many other interests besides hotel interests and, on that account, would have to enlarge the board.  I cannot say what the remuneration will be.  No decision on that has been made.  No consideration has been given to the personnel of the board.  I may say that I have got an amazingly large number of proposals from various organisations throughout the country with similar interests in relation to this board, but these have not yet been considered in relation to the board nor any selections made.  I can only lay down the principles upon which I propose to act, and I have tried to make these as clear as possible. I think it my duty to resist any proposal in this House to secure special representation on the board for a particular interest.  That is what this amendment proposes to do, and that is why I must oppose it.</P>

      <P>I am rather inclined to oppose the section.  There was some ground for Deputy McMenamin's amendment, in that it made it clear what the composition of this unnamed board is going to be, and that it would, at least, define that one of the biggest interests concerned would be represented on it.  The Minister said that the members of the board would <Col N="2673" /> not be representative of any body. That is one of the things some of us regret.  For all we know they may not be particularly suitable representatives. I am not going to say that that would be the case, but when a Bill is introduced we should try to make it as workable as possible.  This Bill concerns numerous interests, the biggest being the body that Deputy McMenamin tried to protect.  There will be other bodies that the board will be asked to control.  I think the Bill should have been brought forward on lines similar to those that Deputy Cosgrave suggested with regard to a previous Bill.  This board will have huge financial powers.  Last week when dealing with the Budget we lamented the fact that money was difficult to get.  As we are getting money for this purpose, we should be careful that the men selected on the board will be thoroughly suited to the job.  We should have some indication in the Bill as to what class the board will be drawn from, even if we do not get the exact personnel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not regret it if the names were given.  At any rate, we should know the interests from which they will be drawn.  There is nothing whatever in the Bill about the hotels, about the catering, about the land, or the fishing that the board will take over.  A Bill of this character requires men with very wide knowledge in charge of it.  These men will be very difficult to get.  There will be a remarkable absence of unanimity about their appointment.  Certainly, we have a right to criticise the board when the members are going to be paid unnamed salaries.  We do not know what salaries they will get.  The only information we got from the Minister was that some of them would be part-time.  We do not know if some will be whole time.  I am as concerned <Col N="2674" /> as other Deputies in conserving the finances of the country, and I do not want to see a board set up that might engage in squandermania.  I know that the board cannot spend more than a definite sum, but I would like to see the money well spent.  I would also like to see the particular interests that the Bill provides for protected, and the object for which the Bill is brought in implemented to the fullest extent.  The composition of the board is the most important section in the Bill.  With the best will in the world the Minister may not get the right men.  We should certainly have an indication as to what particular class the members of the board will be drawn from.  I am not suggesting that they should be drawn from one class. It is well that the organisations they will be drawn from should be named, because that would give some indication of the personnel.  We should also have some indication of the remuneration that the chairman and members of the board will get.  That is due to the House.  In its present form I could not support the section.</P>

      <P>I share the views of Deputy Bennett about the composition of the board, having regard to the fact that there are various organisations catering for visitors, and that bring capital into the country to its benefit. There is great urgency that the selections should be the best.  It is possible we may have members of the Hotels Federation on the board. Having regard to the composition of boards like the Irish Tourist Development Association with which I had some connection, it is certainly a matter for further consideration as to how this board should be composed. I do not know that, even with the Minister making the selections, he will be able to get a board that will satisfy everybody.  We might get a good board by appointing civil servants to it.  I am not so sure that that might not be the very best board we could have.  At any rate, if there were one or two civil servants on it it might be a great help.  The Minister has the nomination of the chairman of the board.  He undoubtedly will be a <Col N="2675" /> person who will largely guide the destinies of the board.  I think if the Minister could give us some idea as to the mode of selection it would certainly calm the fears of Deputies on this side of the House.</P>

A number of the people in Cork who aspire to be members of the board do not belong to any particular organisation.  Still they claim they are qualified to be members of the board because of certain knowledge they possess.  Some people say they have superior qualification to others because they have been in contact with people abroad.

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Chair is satisfied, then the section is before the House.  Here we have a section under which it is proposed to set up a board, and to give them very wide powers in the development of an important branch of the social and, if you like, the business life of the country.  The Minister comes before the House and says that &ldquo;every member of the board shall, while holding office as such member, be disqualified from being nominated or elected and from sitting or receiving payment as a member of Dáil Eireann or of Seanad Eireann&rdquo;. I should like to hear the Minister on that proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite prepared to give the House reasons why it was included in the Bill.  I think they are good reasons.  If the House presses strongly for the deletion of the section, I might consider it, but I do not think it would make any difference.  It certainly will make no difference, so long as the reasons which prompted the inclusion of the section remain good because these reasons will obviously influence the selection of members of the board, whether the section is in the Bill or not.  I consider&mdash;and it is the view of the Government; it is not a personal opinion&mdash;that the appointment of members of the Dáil to positions upon boards established by Acts of the Dáil, particularly boards which are financed out of public moneys, could, if practised upon a large scale, easily become a public abuse.  We think that the danger of such abuses arising <Col N="2678" /> should be avoided and that, if possible, a precedent should be established by having, in Bills of this kind, sections debarring members of the Dáil from membership of these bodies.</P>
      <P>Apart from the danger of abuse, there are practical considerations which make it undesirable that members of the Dáil or Seanad should be on these boards.  Somebody must be answerable to the House for matters relating to these bodies, in so far as the House is entitled to deal with them. It is clearly desirable from a practical point of view that the member of the Government charged with that responsibility should alone be answerable to the House.  If there are sitting in the House members of the body whose affairs are under discussion or are being questioned, a situation of some difficulty might arise.  I do not say that it is an insuperable difficulty, but it is one which, in the course of time, might be a cause of grave embarrassment.</P>
      <P>There is another point of view which, in relation to this particular board, should have very careful consideration from Deputies.  This is a board which will have powers to expend substantial sums of money in the development of tourist resorts.  In this country every country is, or is capable of being developed into, a holiday area.  Certainly there is no county in respect to which a claim could not be made for the expenditure of such money in it. Of course, on that account, it is inevitable that local organisations and local opinion will be strongly in favour of putting pressure upon this board to ensure the maximum expenditure in each particular area.  No Deputy could possibly go upon a board of this kind, of five members, with an impartial frame of mind; he would be bound to be prejudiced in favour of the representation from his own particular area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is no reason for having a section in the Bill that implies that Deputies could not carry out their duties with integrity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Even if we got the ideal Deputy&mdash;the person who was <Col N="2679" /> absolutely impartial&mdash;there would be inevitably, in the parts of the country that had not a representative on the board, the feeling that because they had no representative on the board their interests were being overlooked, and the people in these parts of the country would be very critical of their own Deputies for not having succeeded in getting membership on the board when a Deputy from another part of the country had succeeded in getting representation.  Certainly, at any rate, the presence of Deputies on these boards would be a source of trouble.  I know, of course, that in this House at the present time&mdash;on both sides of the House&mdash;there are members who would be particularly well qualified for appointment on this board, but I think the considerations I have mentioned are sufficiently strong to make it impossible for us to consider them in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>But not based on the Minister's experience of these men, although they handled sums of money in this line already?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not.  I am quite certain that many of the difficulties we think might arise if membership of that board were open to Deputies would possibly arise if the people I have in mind were appointed in the first instance, but we are at the beginning of a new phase in our national history.  We are trying to establish a new State here, and everything we do constitutes a precedent, and one way to establish confidence is to see that organisations of this kind which, in my personal opinion are likely to become more numerous in the future, should not be composed of members of the Oireachtas.  I think that that might develop very easily into abuses, and it certainly would create difficulties for Ministers who have the appointment of these boards and who would find it not an easy matter to reject proposals put forward on behalf of colleagues of their own in the House.  In any event, they might find it difficult, even as politicians, to satisfy the claims of particular areas that would be made <Col N="2680" /> to them to give representation to the various areas.  Apart from that, board having in its membership one or more Deputies, would not be as efficient or as fully capable of carrying out its duties well and efficiently in all parts of the country as a board otherwise constituted would be.</P>
      <P>These are the reasons that prompted me in connection with this section.  We have had similar points with regard to other enactments.  There have been similar sections in connection with other Acts.  If there is objection on the ground that this casts a reflection on the impartiality of Deputies, I am prepared to consider its deletion, subject to the approval of my colleagues, but in any event these are the main considerations which prompted me in this matter of the board.  As to the Constitutional point raised by Deputy Mulcahy, I presume that that was considered and taken into account by the Parliamentary draftsman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am certainly not arguing for the appointment of Deputies on these boards, but I am arguing against the unseemly way in which a clause like this is put in, and I think that the Minister's concluding remarks, about the difficulties of Ministers, even make it more unseemly. After all, it is a degrading thing if a Minister has to say: &ldquo;I want to put this clause into an Act so that members of Parliament will not make it difficult for me to exercise my judgment in finding the right people for particular positions.&rdquo;  I welcome the Minister's suggestion that he is prepared to consider the deletion of this clause.  I do not want to discuss the matter further, and I think that a little more consideration of the matter will lead the Minister and his colleagues to the definite conclusion that this ought to go out.</P>

It is as much as to say to Deputies of this House: &ldquo;You are disqualified from membership because you are not men of integrity.&rdquo;  I quite agree with the Minister's point, and I would go a long way with him in what he said. It is the form of the section to which I take objection, and the blunt manner in which it is drafted.

      <P>With regard to Section 7, Sir, I think it goes a bit far.  The section reads as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Minister, whenever he so thinks proper, may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, remove from office one or more or all of the members of the board.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2682" /> I do not mind taking power to remove a member of the board because of incapacity, lack of integrity, misconduct, or something like that.  I am quite prepared to agree that the Minister should be allowed to remove a member for such causes, but I think that it is very drastic that a Minister, merely because he may take some snuff in his nose at some time or other, should be allowed to say: &ldquo;I shall wipe out this entire board.&rdquo;  Of course, I shall be told that, even though the power is there, the Minister will not exercise it.  Well, I have often heard that said by Ministers here with regard to other Bills giving similar powers, but once the Bill was passed these powers were exercised, and when the Minister was charged with it afterwards he said: &ldquo;Oh, well, it is in the Act; there is my authority; there is the Act.&rdquo;  I agree with giving the Minister power to remove a member of the board, but I think that the section should be remodelled with a view to deleting that part of it which gives power to remove the entire board.  I do not think that should be there at all.  I think it is bad for the administration of the board, to think that on any particular day the whole board could be wiped out.  It begets a feeling of insecurity, and I think that if men are to be taken away from some work on which they are engaged and put on to a part-time job, they should have some sense of security&mdash;I mean, as a board, as distinct from individual membership.  I quite admit that there should be power to remove a man when his misconduct becomes so apparent that it becomes necessary to remove him, but I hold that it is going too far to have power to wipe out the entire board, and it is putting the whole board in the Minister's hands.</P>

I am asking the section to be passed in the full knowledge that the power will be exercised if the necessity should arise.  Clearly, there must be some power given to remove a member of the board.</P>

      <P>The section says that the Minister, whenever he so thinks proper, may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, remove from office one or more or all of the members of the board.  If the board fail to do their duty or if a member of the board fails to carry out his functions in that capacity or acts in some way detrimental to the public interest or in a disgraceful manner or in some other way which calls for immediate action on the part of the Minister, there should be power of removal.  It is necessary to have this provision in order to give that power. The Minister is not going to remove from a board of this kind a person whom he himself has appointed unless there is really serious cause.  The mere act of removal is a criticism of himself and of the appointment he made.  The power will not be used unless there is real necessity for its use.  In case circumstances should arise in which we would all agree that a particular individual or individuals or the whole board should be removed, then this power should be included in the Bill.  That is all the power that the section gives.</P>

It is obvious that he would not wipe out the entire board appointed by himself, but can the Minister guarantee that the Minister in charge to-day will be there in years to come?  A new Minister may come in and say that the whole board should be wiped out.  I do not think that we should give that power.  If a member of the board disgraces himself, he should, of course, be removed, but I do not think it is wise that the Minister should have power to remove the whole board.</P>

      <P>It is theoretically possible for a board to be appointed under <Col N="2684" /> this Bill which might act in a political way, favouring a political Party or fraction.  The Minister should have power to remove that board.  Whether we are going to have the spoils system in this country&mdash;a system which involves complete change of public servants with every change of Government&mdash;is not going to depend on an Act of Parliament but on the public spirit of the people and the wisdom of political Parties.  When we came into office, we found the Electricity Supply Board composed of persons nominated by our predecessors.  These persons are still there because we did not think there was any justification for their removal, even though they had been appointed by our predecessors.  But if there had been an idea in relation to any of these boards that they were acting in a particular way, instead of carrying out their functions, with a view to some political purpose, it would have been our duty to use any powers which we had for their removal. If the board concerns itself only with carrying out its functions under the Bill and is carrying out these functions well, whether there is a change of Government or not they are likely to be left there because good men are not so plentiful that we can afford to get rid of those we have in positions of this kind.  If the board is not doing its business properly and is allowing certain influences to interfere with its work, then there should be power of removal.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Good&rdquo; and &ldquo;bad&rdquo; are relative terms.  What I should fear would be that a Minister, in a moment of pique, would clear out the entire board.  If the Minister has power to remove one or two members it is all right, but there should be continuity of experience, and one or two members of the board with experience should be left to guide the new men who would replace the men put off.</P>

      <P>Everybody will agree with the Deputy.  That merely means that Ministers will follow that opinion when exercising their powers under the Bill.</P>

      <P>Every civil servant in the State holds his position at the will and pleasure of the Government.  That is the law.  In practice, there are changes of Government and changes of Ministers but civil servants go on for ever because it would not be practicable to remove all of them, even if we desired so to do.  But the law says that they hold office at the will and pleasure of the Government.  The law here will be somewhat similar and the practice will depend on the circumstances.</P>
      <P>Section 7 agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 8.</P>
      <P>(2)  If and whenever a member of the board is adjudged bankrupt, or makes a composition or arrangement with his creditors, or is sentenced by a court of competent jurisdiction to suffer imprisonment or penal servitude, or ceases to be ordinarily resident in Ireland, he shall be disqualified from holding and shall cease to hold office as a member of the board.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5, on behalf of Deputy Benson:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), line 42, to insert after the word &ldquo;imprisonment&rdquo; the words &ldquo;with hard labour&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I did not consult with Deputy Benson about the amendment but I think I see the point of it. A person may be sent to prison for some simple offence that does not involve any dishonour.  A person will not get hard labour unless the offence is somewhat serious.  I think that that is what is behind the amendment and that it is a prudent provision.  A man <Col N="2686" /> could be sent to jail for standing up in defence of some moral right.  If that were so, I do not think it would be right to disqualify him for this position.</P>

      <P>The case is even simpler than all that.  A member of the tourist board might very easily be found on licensed premises in the City of Dublin during prohibited hours. Another member might be found on licensed premises in a certain part of County Mayo after the prescribed hour. It would be all right if he were found in Mayo but it would not be all right if he were found in Dublin.  A member might be caught with some poteen in Mayo and another member might be caught under similar circumstances in Galway.  The man found in Galway might get imprisonment whereas the other offender might get off safely in Mayo.</P>
