      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that at the recent revision of voters' lists for the County and City of Dublin the names of a substantial number of people were removed from the register on the ground that they were not citizens; and whether, inasmuch as such people are British subjects, and taxpayers, and residents in this State for a long time, and entitled to vote at local government elections, he will have the matter examined with a view to introducing legislation to enable such people to vote at parliamentary elections.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative.  As regards the latter part, it would be inconsistent with the provisions of Article 16 2º of the Constitution to pass legislation which would enable a person, not being a citizen of Ireland, to be registered as a Dáil elector, and by virtue of such registration to vote at a Dáil election.</P>

      <P>Under the existing provisions of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts, wage-earners who are engaged in manual labour are compulsorily insurable without reference to their rate of remuneration.  Other persons who are compulsorily insured have the right to continue in insurance as voluntary contributors when their rate of remuneration exceeds £250 per annum if they have been two years in insurance and 104 contributions have been paid.  It is not proposed at present to extend the scope of the scheme for voluntary insurance.</P>

      <P>I am not aware of the price raspberry growers received for the crop grown in the year 1929.  As a result of a recent interview which I had with jam manufacturers, the latter have undertaken to pay for this season's crop, on the grower's premises, a price of £38 per ton and for the 1940 crop a minimum price of £38 per ton with a guarantee in respect of both seasons that the whole of the crop will be taken off the growers' hands at not less than this price.  In the circumstances, I see no occasion to introduce legislation to deal with the price of raspberries.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were to accept this amendment, it would negative the two decisions we have already taken on this matter and it would establish that an appeal would lie to the Appeal Tribunal on fact as well as on law and price.  As I have said, that has been decided upon already and we are satisfied that no land has been taken or will be taken without all the facts having been gone into carefully.  We decided upon this matter on the last occasion and I do not think there is any necessity to repeat what has been said already time and time again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Why insert this provision here?  Why not say that the order of the Lay Commissioners shall be absolute and final immediately?  The Appeal Tribunal consists of the President of the High Court of this State and two Lay Commissioners, and the effect of this is that if a message is handed to them from the Lay Commissioners they are simply to give into it and authorise it to be done.  The more one examines this thing, the more one fails to see what is its purpose and what lies behind it.  Why not boldly say at once that the decision of the Lay Commissioners shall be final and conclusive in this matter?  It is worth <Col N="1219" /> while reading this sub-section (1) (e), which is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>the said certificate shall be conclusive evidence that the holding or the said part thereof (as the case may be) is required by the Land Commission for a purpose for which the resumption thereof can lawfully be authorised, and upon receipt of the said certificate the Appeal Tribunal shall authorise the resumption of the holding or the said part thereof, as the case may be.</P>
      <P>What is the meaning of that?  Why have the futile business?  Why reduce the President of the High Court of this State and two Lay Commissioners to a mere registering machine?  If the Minister does not accept my amendment, I would ask him to delete the provision of sending that to the Appeal Tribunal.  The President of the High Court of this State, I think, is paid £3,500 per year, and I take it that the Lay Commissioners are paid £1,000 each per annum, and are they to be mere bell-ringers for the Lay Commissioners? Surely, on the ground of economy alone, if on no higher ground, this thing should be cut out, and surely it is eminently disrespectful to the President of the High Court of this State that he should be put to the humiliation that is provided for here. Do not mind what has been done already or do not mind what has not been done already, but why is this thing being done?  Why is this machinery being provided?  Looking at it at first, one would think that something is being done and that the Appeal Tribunal is being given some authority or power, whereas they simply authorise that what has already been done shall be done, and that is the end of it.  They cannot say yea or nay to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, if there is any sense or reason in referring a thing at all to a body such as the Appeal Tribunal in this case, if we are not going to reduce legislation to a farce, this amendment ought to be accepted or else the whole thing ought to be deleted.  There is no reason in referring the matter to the Appeal Tribunal or <Col N="1220" /> to any other body if they have no function.  This amendment of Deputy McMenamin's gives the Appeal Tribunal at least something to decide one way or another if a matter is referred to them.  If they have nothing to decide, or if they have no powers to decide, why refer it to them?  It is reasonable to accept the amendment. If it is not accepted it is quite unreasonable to ask us to accept the sub-section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>We take exception to this sub-section on a matter of justice &mdash;and it is a very important principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter of economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>And of justice as well. It is a complete denial of justice to the citizen.  The Constitution sets out in great detail the rights, privileges and liberties of the citizens in this country and the preservation of those rights, but in this section it is proposed to deny the citizen his right under the Constitution.  I think it is contrary to the Constitution when you set up a sort of sham tribunal before which the citizen is supposed to appeal or can appeal, and, at the same time, rule that a certificate from the Lay Commissioners must be accepted and cannot be examined further by that tribunal.  That is an extraordinary state of affairs.  The excuse is that it will expedite matters and the question of expediting matters for the Land Commission is put before the most important matter of all in any country, that is, the matter of justice and fair play for the citizen.  No matter how long it may take to do justice, it ought to be the intention of the Land Commission, the Minister and the State to see that justice is done to every citizen and that he is given an opportunity to defend himself when he comes before this tribunal.  How can that be done if certain facts that are certified before the case comes before the Appeal Tribunal must be accepted as such?  If the Minister is not prepared to withdraw this we will have to divide the House on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. F. Lynch Mr. F. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that I thought the last day we were here <Col N="1221" /> the Minister expressed himself as being rather impressed by what Deputy Cosgrave had put up to him in connection with this matter and that he felt the question of tying the hands of the Appeal Tribunal should be reconsidered. Undoubtedly sub-section (e) does tie their hands.  I thought the Minister said that he would possibly look into that matter to see whether or not freedom of action should be given to the Appeal Tribunal, for instance, to deal with the certificate. As the thing stands, the Minister realises that the hands of the Appeal Tribunal, including the hands of the President of the High Court, are completely tied once they are presented with a certificate from the Lay Commissioners, once they certify that the resumption thereof has been lawfully authorised.  Surely in the provisions of the former sub-sections, the Minister has gone far enough in that matter.  He has got it through the House that it shall not be obligatory on the Land Commission to state, for instance, the power under which, or the ground on which, they propose to make their application for resumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>If I may intervene on that particular point, I have agreed to reconsider that and another amendment, No. 19, I think it is.  I just want to correct the Deputy.  I think he is mixing up the amendments.  I did agree to reconsider two points.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. F. Lynch Mr. F. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably that difficulty was created by the fact that the debate ranged over all the amendments and it was not always clear what exact point was being discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. F. Lynch Mr. F. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>At one period not only was No. 19 being discussed, but Nos. 20 and 21 as well.  Even though those other matters are to be reconsidered, I can see no justification for withholding power from the Appeal Tribunal to go into the merits of the resumption and, for instance, to discuss whether or not the certificate has been rightfully given in a particular case.  I think that this is a point, rather more than the other points, if possible, that the Minister <Col N="1222" /> ought to reconsider between this and the Report Stage.  It does seem extraordinary that where there is an appeal tribunal, presided over by the President of the High Court, as it normally is, the hands of a judge of the High Court should be tied to the extent that he must accept the certificate of lay persons in connection with a given matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Does not the Minister realise that the same principle is involved here?  If he agrees on the other two points he should agree on this one. Is it not the principle of justice, fair play and the right of a citizen to be given an opportunity of defending himself? That is being denied here, and I think that if the Minister gives way on one he should give way here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not give way on this principle.  I submit this principle was contained in three amendments, and we have divided on two of them already.  One was No. 18, where it was sought to delete the words &ldquo;on a question of law&rdquo;.  In other words, that would leave the general appeal there.  That was decided on one division. The next point was in connection with the certificate being conclusive evidence.  Whatever had to be said in support of that, as I said before this evening, was debated at length on Friday.  The point is the Appeal Tribunal has taken up the position that the Judicial Commissioner formerly occupied.  They decide, on appeal to them, questions of law and of price&mdash;two very important things.  Particulars as to the user and detailed circumstances surrounding each case have been thrashed out already, the occupant having had every opportunity to come before the Land Commission and make his case and if, having considered all those circumstances, the Land Commission is satisfied that the land ought to be resumed, a certificate is given and on the basis that it has to be accepted by the tribunal.  There was a case&mdash;the Potterton case&mdash;in which it was held that there was a conflict&mdash;which undoubtedly there was&mdash;between two sections of the Act passed in 1933&mdash; Section 11 and Section 31.  Section 11 <Col N="1223" /> is what is apparently sought to be done by this amendment.  That was the interpretation that was given&mdash;that the Appeal Tribunal ought to have the power of veto, so to speak.  But in Section 31 of the same Act it was as provided for here.  That is what was intended and that is what we intend now, in order to avoid interminable delays.  The result&mdash;as I think Deputy Dillon admitted on Friday&mdash;will be the same.  No land that should not be acquired is going to be acquired or resumed. There are questions of law and of price&mdash;two very important matters&mdash;on which appeal is open.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is the key of this entire Bill.  The opening words of this clause say, &ldquo;The said certificate shall be conclusive evidence.&rdquo; A certificate issued by two, three or four laymen shall be conclusive evidence as to the facts contained therein and the Appeal Tribunal has no power to say either &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to it.  Would it not at least appear logical that if the party concerned has the right to appear before the Appeal Tribunal that he should have the right to ask the Appeal Tribunal to say whether or not the certificate was <i>ultra vires</i> or whether or not he Lay Commissioners had jurisdiction when they issued the certificate?  A certificate that may be completely without jurisdiction, involving the title of land, of people's property, shall be conclusive evidence.</P>

      <P>On the last day, when amendments Nos. 19, 20 and a few more were being considered, it was stated by a Front Bench member of the Opposition that, if the first one were defeated there would not be much <Col N="1224" /> use in debating the others.  The points which have already been debated at great length and decided should not be reopened.  The Deputy can raise points on the section, but for the nonce he is confined to amendment No. 21.</P>

      <P>This clause of the section cannot be separated from the other two, because a thing is done in the early part of the section and it comes along to be dealt with here again.  A certificate of a number of laymen shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated therein and this certificate is sent to the Appeal Tribunal and that tribunal, which consists of the President of the High Court as one of the members, would not be able to say whether or not the people that made out the certificate had jurisdiction to make it out.</P>
      <P>Is not that a monstrous proceeding, simply monstrous?  I do not want to use any stronger language about it.  A certificate that may be made without jurisdiction is to be put before the President of the High Court who cannot say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to it.  He simply has to approve and confirm its contents, even though he may be convinced that it is made without jurisdiction.  That is what is in this clause.  I am certainly not going to allow it through this House without resisting it by every means in my power.</P>

      <P>It would appear that Deputy McMenamin, who refers to this particular sub-section as the key of the Bill, is actually trying to weaken this Bill by every means in his power.  He has spoken of the right of the individual.  What about the right of the people who are compelled to exist in uneconomic holdings on the <Col N="1225" /> boglands and mountain-sides of Connaught and of Donegal&mdash;the constituency which he himself represents?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carty</NameTxt>
      <P>I will show how it arises. The question of resumption goes, I understand, before the three Lay Commissioners. These three Lay Commissioners are men who have been employed at the work of land settlement during the greater portion of their lives.  Are these men not competent, from their vast experience of land settlement, to say whether farms should be resumed or not?  I suggest that as far as the right of the individual is concerned, it is adequately safeguarded when it comes up for examination before three Lay Commissioners; and that there is really no need for an appeal on this matter or that this matter should be adjudicated on subsequently by the Appeal Tribunal, except on the question of law.  I would suggest, as I said at the beginning, to the Minister to resist this amendment and to resist any other amendment which is going to weaken this Bill and make it inoperative and necessitate further measures at a later stage.  Otherwise Deputy McMenamin or some of his colleagues might reproach the Minister, as Deputy Dillon did here some years ago reproach the Minister's predecessor in office, for failing to carry out the promises which were made to secure as far as possible that those who were living in congested holdings and uneconomic holdings would be provided with land as far as land is available.</P>

      <P>Surely, Sir, apart from everything the Deputy has said, this particular sub-section is legislation run amok.  What earthly use is there in asking us seriously to consider the problem&mdash;if you may call it a problem&mdash;of referring a matter to the Appeal Tribunal over which they have no jurisdiction or no function whatever? Is it not almost an insult to that particular body to present them with an ultimatum of this kind?  There might be some reason in it if it was <Col N="1226" /> not referred to them at all.  If the Minister adopts the principle that the Appeal Tribunal has no function, there is no sense in asking to refer something to them for jurisdiction over which they have no jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>As regards the remarks made by Deputy Carty, I think the matters he referred to could be debated on some other section: there is not any particular reference in them to this section.  As far as landless men are concerned, I would say that we have as much sympathy on this side of the House as there is on the other, but what we particularly want to safeguard now is the right of the people who have land&mdash;whether they be small holders or large holders.  As far as we can on this side of the House we wish to safeguard the rights of every tenant holder, large or small.  This particular section is nothing short of an insult to the intelligence of this House: it is legislation run amok.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The only comment I would like to make on the amendment is that it makes this sub-section a bit effective.  Deputy Carty seems to think that the Minister should resist the amendment because it is going to do certain things.  The whole point of the argument from these benches on that sub-section (e) is that it is a window-dressing section.  You are given the impression that you have something to appeal to, but having appealed, you can do nothing.  I would suggest that, in view of the speeches made by Deputy Carty and by the Minister, instead of &ldquo;Appeal Tribunal&rdquo; in this section in the second last line, the words &ldquo;rubber stamp&rdquo; should be inserted, or state that the seal of the Land Commission must be put on the certificate when it is handed in.  That is what you are asking the Appeal Tribunal to do.  The President of the High Court and the two Lay Commissioners are being asked, the very moment this certificate is presented to them to put a rubber stamp on it and say &ldquo;Approved.&rdquo;  Therefore, there is no object in the section.  You are giving the impression there is something there when in reality there is nothing.  I submit that, if the Minister does not accept the amendment and <Col N="1227" /> make the section effective in some way, the best thing he could do is to drop the section and make no appeal at all, and have done with it.  Then there would be a clear cut case, a careful examination of what the position is, and when the Lay Commissioners give a certificate that land is required, within the law, that is the end of it and there is no battling about it.  You have here a bit of window-dressing; there is an Appeal Tribunal, but all it can do is say &ldquo;Thanks very much for sending the document down.  We are stamping it, and that is the end of it.&rdquo;  I think that it is a very important matter that an Appeal Tribunal should, when a question of appeal arises, be able to review both the law and the facts. However, that is, apparently, not acceptable to the Minister, and there is to be an appeal on a question of law only.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>And price, of course, though we know that that will not get the holder very much.  As I said on the Second Reading, there are three different valuations.  Where it is to be specifically stated by statute what the valuation of the Land Commission must be, if it is set out that it is to be the Revenue Commissioners' valuation, it will soon end land acquisition in this country, because there will be no question of resisting the acquisition of land at all and farmers will be only too glad to get rid of their farms.  The people are being given the impression that they can appeal upon something, when there is really nothing in it.  If the Minister accepts Deputy McMenamin's amendment it does leave the section operative.  If you reject it, I submit that there is nothing for it except to discard the sub-section altogether, because there is no point in it.</P>

      <P>The background of this sub-section should be examined, so that it may be seen in its proper perspective. It is a short cut to confiscation, without any chance given to the owner of land.  There is a reference to &ldquo;tenant&rdquo; in this Bill.  In land purchase cases, there is no tenant.  It <Col N="1228" /> does not matter whether a man owns an acre which he has purchased in fee, subject to a Land Commission annuity, or 1,000 acres, he is the owner of that land, and not the tenant, and he is proud of being the owner.  It is important for us, as I say, to bear in mind the background of this sub-section, so that we can see it in its proper perspective, and the explanatory memorandum sets out:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Next in importance is clause 39 of the Bill, which restates the law and the procedure in regard to the resumption of holdings of tenanted land by the Land Commission for purposes of distribution.  In the practice of resumption, also, the work of the Land Commission has been affected by decisions of the courts interpreting the powers intended to be given them by the Land Act of 1933, with the result that since the ruling of the Supreme Court in the case of Thomas E. Potterton on 9th July, 1935, they have been able to resume holdings only with the consent of the tenants.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I presume that means those who have purchased their land previously through the Land Commission, and I think the word &ldquo;tenants&rdquo; should be altered to &ldquo;owners&rdquo;.  Now where is our fixity of tenure?  Is this not taking deliberate powers to manhandle the owners of land, while giving them this eyewash of an appeal to an appeal tribunal which has no power, and to give it in order to deny the owner of the land any right in the matter?  This will facilitate the Land Commission. They are an administrative body and are not responsible for policy.  They are given an Act which provides for the doing of a certain thing, I have no doubt but that they have found trouble, and questions will be asked here as to why there have been delays here, there and elsewhere.  The Land Commission is blamed for it, but, if I had responsibility in the Land Commission, I should probably act in the same way.  They say: &ldquo;There are little things that must be straightened out, otherwise we cannot get on with the work&rdquo;, which, from my point of view, is confiscation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1229" /> The Minister comes here and asks to be facilitated in confiscating the land of the country from those whose fathers owned and worked it for generations and who fought the landlords, and drove them out in order that they should be the owners of their land.  We have heard this &ldquo;codology&rdquo; of Deputy Carty about the old planters on the rich plains and the poor natives on the bogs.  It is the land of the natives that you are confiscating under this&mdash;the men who have been the backbone of the country.  It is to those men that you are denying the right of a substantial appeal.  You are giving them the eyewash, but you are asking to be facilitated in breaking fixity of tenure all over the country. Mind you, it is not to relieve the congests alone that this land is being taken.  If Deputies take the trouble to read the report of the Banking Commission, they will see that everywhere the Banking Commission touched on this matter of acquiring land, they point out the danger to credit.  It is very little use to give a man a few acres, as the Land Commission is now giving, in some cases, five, six, seven, eight and ten acres&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am not so enthusiastic even about the amendment.  If you are going to have the principle adopted and worked that you will confiscate the land and that you will give a pretence of an appeal to the owners before the land is confiscated, there is some substance in Deputy McMenamin's amendment because the Appeal Tribunal will have something to consider.  The sub-section, however, merely asks them to &ldquo;sign this document&rdquo;.  I remember, when I was a junior civil servant, I would do a little work and take it to the head of the Department for signature.  Very often he was easygoing and would not even read it, but he had to take responsibility for it <Col N="1230" /> whether he read it or not.  The Minister is not giving this tribunal even a nominal responsibility.  I do not suppose that the Appeal Tribunal will be greatly offended thereby.  It is not intended as an offence to them, but it is intended as eyewash for the country.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I am supporting the amendment on the ground that, with out it, it does not matter what a holder of land may do with regard to his land&mdash;whether he works it in accordance with correct methods of husbandry, whether he gives good employment, or whether he works it efficiently&mdash;it is open to the Lay Commissioners to take his land from that holder and from the best farmers in the country.  They have one sheet anchor at present which the Minister has mentioned, that is, if the land be correctly worked.  The phraseology of the section is &ldquo;in accordance with good methods of husbandry and gives employment.&rdquo;  Where is the security for a man who urges that case before the Appeal Tribunal, once this section passes?  That is a question of fact. It is the most important question for any holder of land in the country; it is the most important question for the people of the country, for the agricultural economy of the country and for those who get employment on the land from one end of the country to the other.  Pass this section and though a man has 40 men working where another man might employ only 20, and is turning out the best stock ever produced, the Lay Commissioners have power to tell him, if he decides to put forward any question of fact to the Appeal Tribunal, that he is estopped and cannot mention it. Where is the security for any person who is working his land properly and doing the best he can?  It is urged by one Deputy that the Minister was reproached by Deputy Dillon with regard to uneconomic holders some years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>His predecessor.  I wonder would the Deputy take the trouble to look up the Banking Commission <Col N="1231" /> report and see how the distribution of land has been affected during the last few years.  It has gone from a distribution in favour of uneconomic holders to landless men in the proportion of two to one to an equal proportion, and then to a proportion of one to two.  Two landless men now get a distribution of land as against one uneconomic holder, as lately as the year 1936.  As far as this section and the whole Bill are concerned, the Minister asks for more and more power, but he says he will not use it.  What is it for if it is not to be used?  This is a very small concession that is asked.  It is not important. It should not be looked upon as a concession at all.  If the Minister had any idea of the justice of the case or if he had any interest in the agricultural economy of the country as it is, he would be more than willing to have such an amendment as this inserted in the Bill.  I want to know in the case of any holder of land who is working his holding properly and working it for the benefit of the country, what opportunity is there for him to make his case if the Lay Commissioners do not listen to him?  None.</P>

I have invited any Deputy in this House to name, in any part of the country, any farm that has been taken without listening to the case made by the holder of the farm.  These Lay Commissioners are most experienced people.  Everybody admits that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>These Lay Commissioners are experienced as to how the land should be worked.  These cases are tried in open court.  Any rebutting evidence that the person affected wishes to bring forward will <Col N="1232" /> be heard by the Lay Commissioners and the case will be decided on its merits.  I say with the full knowledge of the facts&mdash;and the results have justified what I am now saying&mdash;that there has not been any case in which land worked moderately well has been acquired by the Lay Commissioners. I am not a lawyer, but I understand that it is only questions of fact, not of law, that are decided by laymen. The charge is made that these commissioners are laymen and they are deciding the facts.  Now where a person is tried for his life it is a jury of laymen who decide the facts.  Therefore there is not anything very new about that principle.  It is not a question of law that is decided by the Lay Commissioners, but a question of fact.</P>
      <P>There is no use in repeating here that thing about land being taken off people who have put their best efforts into working it.  That does not happen. The speeches to which we have listened are the sort of speeches that have done real damage to the credit of the land holders.  I really do not believe that the Deputies themselves believe what they are saying, but they have a lot of influence in the country and, unfortunately, they will persuade hard-working farmers that their title to the land is in jeopardy and that their land will be taken from them. That is the sort of thing that ought not to be said, for it is not going to happen. Every opportunity will be given to the owner of the land, to the man whose land will be subject to Land Commission proceedings, to appear in open court and make his case.  If they do that their land will not be taken by the Lay Commissioners.  If it were true that the Lay Commissioners would not listen to the case made against acquiring the land it would be a gross injustice.  It is laid down in the 1923 Land Act that the land must be worked according to proper husbandry. It is there set out how the land should be worked and the rest of it.  Someone must judge that.  The Land Commission inspectors are the people who have been judging that matter all along.  If the land is being used properly, the report invariably will be that the inspector does not recommend that the land be acquired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1233" /> That is invariably the case.  Where the holding is non-residential land, where it is not being worked and it is needed for the relief of congestion, that land will most likely be taken by the Land Commission.  But where the land is properly worked there is no danger it will be taken.</P>

      <P>If the inspector says it is not, then it is not open under this Bill for the Lay Commissioners to say it is.  That is my case.  The Minister mentioned that if a man is on trial for his life he is tried by 12 laymen.  I agree, but these 12 jurymen are not employed to find the man guilty.  If the Lay Commissioners will report to the Minister and say there is no more land to be acquired the Minister may say &ldquo;if you do not find land I will pension you off.&rdquo;  The liability of the Commissioners and their responsibility is to acquire land for the Minister.  I am quite sure I am dealing fairly with the Lay Commissioners in pointing out these facts.  It is only fair to the commissioners.  A judge always likes to have an appeal court from his own decision.  I will admit at once that the responsibility of the Lay Commissioners is much greater and they will have to account for it, if not in this world then in the next world. That may be of use with regard to themselves, but it is not of much <Col N="1235" /> advantage to the man who has been deprived of his land.  There is little doubt about it that there is one word capable of being interpreted from this Bill and that word is &ldquo;compensation.&rdquo; The Minister wants cases.  I could give him cases by the dozen.  I am quite sure from what I know of the Lay Commissioners that there is not one <Col N="1236" /> amongst them who would not admit that however careful they have been in the past they have made mistakes.  The Minister now wants us to endow these Lay Commissioners with practically infallible powers.  We will not do it. We cannot do it.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 39 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this section should be opposed.  I cannot understand the Minister standing over such a section or such a Bill.  This section is really the Bill in broad principle.  I cannot understand the Minister standing over it, if he has read the report of the Banking Commission.  Incidentally as a practical farmer, a farmer who found his greatest difficulty the securing of capital, I am amazed that the Government who went to the trouble of setting up a Banking Commission did not think it worth while discussing its report before this House. Land is of no use if you have not capital, and this militates against getting capital.  You have been warned about this.  Let me quote paragraph 328 of the Banking Commission Report:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1237" />&ldquo;There is another aspect of the subject of bank loans for agriculture to which it is necessary to make reference.  The Banking Commission of 1926, in its Second Interim Report, commented in strong terms on the moral risk of loans for Irish agriculture and urged the need of a more reasonable and business-like view of the collection of debts secured on land or incurred by farmers.  It is to be feared that, so far from any improvement having taken place in this matter during the past ten years, there has been a further deterioration of the position.  A contributing factor to this result has been the extension, from time to time, by legislation, of the discretion conferred on the Land Commission to acquire land by compulsion and to reallot it to new occupiers.  We deal in detail with this matter in a later section on land purchase, but think it well at this point, in relation to commercial banking, to mention that the existence of such extreme powers in the hands of the Government is a factor of insecurity as regards the title to land, which threatens to make banks less willing in the future to lend on the security of agricultural land.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They are using very modest language. The paragraph goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Not only is there the danger that a farm may be acquired by the Land Commission at a price which, perhaps for temporary reasons, may be materially below the value as estimated on a long view for the purpose of a bank loan but experience has shown the existence of a considerable risk that agitators may use wrongful pressure to exploit the powers of the Land Commission&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>That is going home&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;by creating conditions for which there is no ready solution other than sale to the Land Commission.  Our recommendations so far as the Land Commission is concerned will be found in paragraphs 512-517.  It suffices at this stage to note how the situation reacts on the commercial banks and on the prospects and <Col N="1238" /> terms of future lending for agricultural purposes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I could quote <i>ad lib.</i> from this, but I do not propose to do so because I do not think that anybody will challenge the statement as to the unsettled conditions in land&mdash;unsettlement of the land, not the settlement of the land to which the Minister refers.  The Land Commission has unsettled land in this country.  It is making it valueless as an asset upon which a loan can be negotiated.  I wish to challenge the Minister to come with me to the head office of any bank functioning in the Free State or any branch of a bank that will give to the ordinary farmer accommodation on the strength of his land alone.  It is not done.  The credit of the country has been undermined by this policy.  Agriculture has no stability.  Land has no stability, consequently agriculture will get no accommodation.</P>
    <P>I have heard applause from the Labour Benches about going ahead with this confiscation of land, unsettling land and making it valueless as a security, upon which a loan can be negotiated.  Think of the unemployment we have.  Think of the 300 carpenters who within the last couple of weeks left this city to look for work in Great Britain.  That is because the credit of the country is at a low ebb and why?  Because land, the one asset we have, has been rendered valueless as a negotiable security.</P>

      <P>The question of loans for house-building in Dublin or in Cork does not arise on Section 39 of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to relate to that question what the Minister is looking for in this Act&mdash;to deny the owners of property a voice in defending that property or an opportunity of saying why that property should not be taken from them.  That is really what the second last paragraph in that memorandum means.  That of course makes the property insecure, and when property is made insecure, it is not a security upon which financial accommodation can be secured.  Land being the main asset in this country, national credit must suffer accordingly.  I have quoted the considered statements of the bankers and I was only relating to housing in Dublin and Cork the fact that I had tangible proof and inside knowledge that because of the state of national credit in this country, public loans are not feasible at the moment. That is the considered opinion of bankers to which the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance have assented.  I defy contradiction of that.  We are warned here not to go on with that policy. Some people may think or say that I am prompted by selfish motives in this. I do not own a sod of land that I did not buy in the open market.  No money was put up that I did not earn, and if a man who has property, which he has bought with his own money, should not, in the opinion of some people, have it, well then the sooner a decent man gets out of this country the better for himself.  I am sure that all here will agree with that principle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1240" /> I am against the section because it further facilitates the confiscation of land.  Will the Minister deny that the taking of land for any purpose has an unsettling effect?  This is not the taking of land for the relief of congests.  In reality, it is the taking of land for the making of congests.  We all remember the old cross-roads appeal that used to be made years ago: &ldquo;All the poor fellows are in the bogs and on the mountains, but the big planters are down in the rich fertile plains.&rdquo;  We are all familiar with that stuff.  We know all about it, and we know too that there was very little sincerity in it.  What you are doing here is, you are taking the land from the grandchildren of those who were foremost in the fight during the land war.  Many of those who want to confiscate the land are the descendants of those who were grabbers and emergency men.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to the section mainly because of its credit effect on the country.  All the industries that we have built up here must depend for their prosperity on agriculture. Agriculture is not prosperous to-day. That is entirely due to the want of working capital, and the working capital is not there because the banks will not advance it.  I have read the bankers' statement in which they say that they will not advance it.  What <Col N="1241" /> is Deputy O'Rourke saying?  Of course the schoolmaster knows all about it. What is the use of a farmer talking about it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielORourke" hpid="Mr. O'Rourke Mr. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that on that subject the Deputy would want to go to school again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The credit position is threatened, and there seems to be no regard for it.  The Minister is not here seeking powers to help congestion. Deputy Cosgrave has given the figures bearing on that&mdash;that there are twice as many landless men looking for land as there are congests to be relieved. The Minister knows there must be a limit to the division of land.  Apart altogether from the question of credit, the Minister must know that it would injure agriculture if all farms were cut down to too small a size, because then the small farmer will have no security in his land.  Consequently he cannot get any credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole position of agriculture is being threatened.  That must be obvious to anybody who considers the economic position of the country.  It is reflected in the public loans that have been issued by municipalities. These loans were not taken up.  You have the skilled tradesmen of the country <Col N="1242" /> emigrating to England to find work. I challenge any Deputy who knows the conditions in the City and County of Dublin to say if that statement is not true.  The urgent thing is to build up our credit.  I am opposed to this section because I would like to see our credit built up.  We cannot do that unless we have security in property and in land.  This section proposes to take away that security.  Consequently, it is taking away any hope of building up our credit and is exposing not only agriculture but industry and the whole country to the danger of economic collapse.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. F. Lynch Mr. F. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also opposing the section because I think the powers that are being sought in it are entirely too far-reaching.  Judging by what has been said by some of the Deputies opposite, and especially by Deputy Carty, I think they do not appreciate the fact that this section refers to holdings which are already the subject of land purchase annuities and that have been bought under the Land Acts by the present owners. That is the type of holding that the Land Commission propose to take up &mdash;to resume&mdash;under this section: holdings that have been bought by the present tenant proprietors under the Land Acts, by the men who were the former tenants under the landlords. What is proposed here is to take the land from them.  In other words, the wheel has come round again.  What I want to point out is that Deputy Carty does not seem to appreciate that.</P>
      <P>I am not saying that this Bill is starting all that business.  Of course, not.  It was started long ago.  What I mean is, the resumption of land was started before now.  What I do complain of is that we are giving far too wide powers to the Land Commission under this section when dealing with the question of resumption, and that we are not giving sufficient latitude to the Appeal Court to review the different matters that come before the Lay Commissioners by way of petition on the part of the tenant proprietor whose land is being taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has challenged Deputies across the floor of the House <Col N="1243" /> to give the names of persons whose lands have been taken&mdash;lands which were being worked properly.  Let me say that I think it would be most undesirable to have this slinging of the names of parties across the floor of the House.  The parties concerned might not be a bit thankful either to the Minister or to the Deputies who did that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>As it happens, I got a letter this morning from a person who resides in the constituency represented by Deputy Kissane and Deputy Professor O'Sullivan.  It is the case of a man who lives near Listowel.  In this case, I think there was no question about the farm not having been worked in accordance with the best methods of husbandry.  Of course, there are other considerations.  This man was living in the town.  The farm is about four miles distant.  He has a nephew living on the land.  As I have said, there was no question about the land having been well worked, well manured and well cared for.  In fact, in these respects it might be called a model farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Has it been resumed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I forget now, but as well as I remember the history of the case, when it went before the Land Commission they decided to resume.  The point is that mistakes will be made by the Lay Commissioners: matters will be taken into account by them which will outweigh the question of good working.  The Minister has stated that a farm that is well worked will not be taken.  I want to tell the Minister, from my experience, that is not so.  If the Minister is genuinely anxious that that should prevail, I suggest to him that it would be quite easy to put in an amendment on the Report Stage to secure it.  It is not in the Acts already; at least not to my recollection.  The only provision with regard to holdings worked according to the best methods of husbandry, as far as my recollection goes, is in Section 44 of the Act of 1931, that is where fee farm grantees, <Col N="1244" /> lessees and so on, apply to come within the purview of the Land Acts.  I do not believe that, in connection with resumption proceedings, there is any provision which would prevent the Land Commission from taking lands because of the manner in which they are worked.  That is my recollection. If I am wrong, the Minister can correct me.  At any rate, I know at least one holding which was worked according to the best methods of husbandry, and which the Land Commission insisted on resuming.</P>
      <P>I am not opposed to resumption as a principle, but I think that the person from whom it is intended to resume land should not only be given every opportunity of making his case before the Lay Commissioners, but that his appeal should be allowed to go forward. This section is wiping out any chance of that, and it is also hampering and embarrassing the petitioner in a most extraordinary way in the presentation of his case even before the Lay Commissioners. The Land Commission will state, on general grounds only, why they are taking up the land.  They will not state the power under which or the ground on which it is being done.  That need not be stated.  How is the petitioner to draft his opposition?  How is he to put in his pleas as against the intention of the Land Commission in that case?  I think that the section as it stands goes much too far in the direction of giving powers to the Land Commission. For that reason, as I said, I am opposing the section, but before I sit down there is just one question which I have been asked to put to the Minister.  I take it that the procedure is something like this:  When the Land Commission has decided to resume a holding, they fix the price.  Then, I understand, they proceed to deduct from the price they are going to give the tenant proprietor, or the owner, if you like to call him that, the redemption value of the existing annuity.  Is that so?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I want to put to the Minister is this: On what basis is that redemption price fixed? There is an annuity.  If the man continues <Col N="1245" /> on his holding for the rest of his time he will be paying only half the annuity.  Is the redemption price fixed on so many years' purchase of the half annuity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Suppose the man purchased under the 1933 Act, that is to say he would have been paying the annuity for 36 years out of the usual 66, I think it was; there would be 30 years to run.  On what basis are the remaining 30 years redeemed?  Take, for instance, a fee farm grant.  That is payable for ever&mdash;for hundreds and hundreds of years.  There are only, say, 36 years of this one left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy want an answer now?  That would be redeemed at whatever is the outstanding amount of the original advance, on half the annuity.  There was a certain advance made on the land.  Whatever remains to be paid, it is half of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is fair enough.  I am opposed to the section for the reason I have stated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>What the person is doing is buying his farm, and the money has been advanced by the Land Commission to enable him to do so.  Whatever remains of that original advance has to be redeemed.  In this case the annuity has been halved, and he gets off with half redemption of the advance originally given to him to buy his farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that it depends on the price of the relevant land stock on that day.  I had experience myself where, after paying an annuity for ten years, I had to pay as much as had been advanced ten years before, because of the position of the stock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the things that I resent in the debate on this section is the tendency of Deputies on the Government side, the moment a farmer on this side of the House opens his mouth, to launch accusations that he is against the landless men and the small <Col N="1246" /> holders.  We are sick and tired of that. Everybody in this House ought to have some regard for agriculturists in general, and should make no attempt to set one class against the other.  No attempt should be made to set the small man against the middle-sized man, or the middle-sized man against the big man.  It is a wrong principle. I do not care one whit whether a man is a ten-acre, a 15-acre or a 75-acre farmer.  I am as interested in the welfare and prosperity of one as the other, and I am as interested in the welfare of the landless men as any Deputy in any Party in this House.  I do not want anybody to assume that I am not interested in landless men because of the fact that I fight for the interests of the man who is a purchased holder of land, a man who took advantage of one of the previous Acts passed by this House, and who has enjoyed the fruits of that purchase.</P>
      <P>There are several objections to resumption, but I am not going to argue them here.  There are other places in which to argue them.  But there are more serious objections to resumption as it is going to be carried out under this particular section of this Bill.  The Minister said that no land is going to be taken from anybody who farms it well, and he challenges us to give instances.  I could give the Minister three or four instances.  I could give ten, I think.  I do not want &mdash;just as Deputy Lynch did not want&mdash; to give the names in the House, but I can give instances to any Deputy who wants them.  I think almost every Deputy in the House could give instances of cases where there has been interference with the owners of properly managed farms.  The Minister says there is no fear; Deputies behind him say there is no fear; they say that all this does not affect the ordinary tenant farmer at all.  But it does.  The Minister may like it or not, and Deputies behind him may like it or not, but I say there is a certain fear all over the country about this resumption.</P>

      <P>It is pure nonsense. The Deputy ought to get up and make a speech instead of interrupting those of us who are trying to make a case. There are several instances of it.  If Deputy Carty or Deputy Belton wants to sell a well-managed farm to-morrow, a farm which nobody can object to his holding and which he wants to sell because he is not in a position to carry on farming any longer or he wants to engage in some other occupation, he will not get the value of it.  The only chance of his getting the value of it is if the purchaser is assured of a continuing tenancy.  I have myself during the last four or five years intervened in cases where farms were about to be sold and I have approached the Land Commission and asked them to give a declaration to the auctioneers in these cases that if they were bought they would not interfere with them. I could never get a declaration from the Land Commission that they were not going to interfere with any of these farms.  Is not that evidence that the sale of land and the price of land are being interfered with?  When the land is put up for sale nobody knows that the Land Commission will not step in after it is bought.  That is bad enough, but I have actual cases which I can give to the Minister where the Land Commission have actually stepped in between the vendor and the purchaser. Is there any chance of agriculture functioning in a proper manner as long as that practice is allowed to continue?  In this Bill that position is further intensified.  Now a man will not alone have land taken from him, but no reasons will be given for it. He will not be told for what purpose it is going to be taken and there is no appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Belton has quoted the views of the Banking Commission on this matter&mdash;the Commission had two views. One honest Deputy on the Fianna Fáil Benches&mdash;Deputy Childers&mdash;the other day said that if Deputies had the courage of their convictions and were not afraid to speak out they could give reasons for this.  He admitted that one reason was interference with fixity of tenure, but he said that if they were honest they could give other <Col N="1248" /> reasons why the banks will not lend money.  We all know that there is a tendency amongst farmers and their sympathisers all over the country to have sympathy for the underdog.  It has been bred in us and has flowed from centuries of wrong government. I have no doubt that the practice has been in certain cases, when a farmer was being sold out by a bank, to have a threatened or implied interference with the sale so that the bank could not sell the farm.  That is a wrong position, and Deputies ought not to be afraid to say that.  I for one am not.  I have not alone said here, but I have said on public platforms in the country that land, like any other property, must be subject to forced sale if a creditor can no longer meet his liabilities.  Until we get that position accepted by everybody it will be hard to get credit.  The Land Commission can do away with that by guaranteeing the banks that if they lend the money no such thing will happen; that if anybody interferes with the sale they will take over the land and divide it. There would be more justification for that than there is for interfering with the land of an ordinary well-conducted man who meets his liabilities.</P>

      <P>They can resume the land, which is the same thing.  But they do not do that.  There are many derelict farms in the country of that kind and the Land Commission know it.  They prefer to interfere with some ordinary well-conducted farmer rather than take over one of these derelict farms.  There is no security in land at the present time and there will be less. There will be no value in land.  The value of land is bound to decrease day by day as a result of the resumption provisions being intensified by this Bill.  There will be no hope of having land properly worked.  A man is not going to work land properly as long as he has this fear hanging over him.  I for one am opposed to legislation such as this.  There are ways, and always will be ways, of providing land for small holders and landless men.  Land <Col N="1249" /> oan always be got for that purpose and always will be got if you pay the price for it.  The Land Commission just like any other people who want to buy land, should be prepared to be just to the present holders and pay a proper price for it and they will get all they want.</P>

      <P>It appears to me that the difficulty with the Opposition is that they are more concerned about individuals than the general community. We have heard to-day of tenant farmers who have been working their holdings well who have been visited by Land Commission inspectors and the land resumed by the Land Commission in spite of the provision of the 1923 Act that land which is being properly worked, worked according to proper methods of husbandry, is not to be resumed.  Deputies opposite know as well as we do that there is no intention here to interfere with the ordinary hard-working farmers.  But they also realise as well as we do that if we are to carry on our policy of land acquisition and division we must have power of acquisition and that is exactly the meaning of Section 39 of the Bill &mdash;to give us the necessary power by which we can acquire land and carry out the policy of land settlement that we have promised the people we would carry out.  We heard a lot to-day and on the last day about the insecurity that has crept in in connection with land.  Deputies opposite try to hold that it is because of this land policy of ours that people will not get loans from the banks.  I am not going to labour that point because it has already been discussed on the Second Reading of the Bill.  But there is one thing I would say and that is, that this reticence on the part of banks to give money at present has nothing at all to do, in my opinion, with the land policy of the Government.</P>

The cause of <Col N="1250" /> the reluctance on the part of the banks to advance money is that they got such a gruelling, and had so much difficulty in the past, as a result of a situation in which they were too liberal, that they brought about a very difficult, and an almost impossible situation, and it is only natural that a certain amount of conservatism would now be adopted by these banks.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kissane</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not care what point of view there is, I try to keep to the point of view that I think is proper. Much has been said about the undesirability of not submitting questions of fact to the Appeal Tribunal. As that has been already very fully discussed, I do not propose to say much on it at this stage, but I would consider the Lay Commissioners as well versed in the ordinary problems of land settlement, as members of the Appeal Tribunal, where it is a question of fact.  The only difference, in my opinion, that there could be between the judgment of the Lay Commissioners, and the judgment of the members of the Appeal Tribunal, would be on a question of law and, of course, on the question of price.  That is provided for in the section.  While I have no revolutionary ideas about the acquisition of land&mdash;in fact, I would be numbered among the more conservative members of the community&mdash;still, I consider that &ldquo;landowners,&rdquo; as Deputy Belton calls them, are well catered for and safeguarded in the section, and they will have no cause to fear any evil consequences. As I stated on a previous occasion, surely the Lay Commissioners are not a body of Turks or Bolshevists, that we would not have such confidence in them, as would from their long experience of the administration of the Land Commission fit them for the proper discharge of these duties. Deputy Lynch mentioned a case of resumption in my locality.  I am not sure of the case the Deputy had in mind but, from what I know, I cannot recall any case where land has been resumed by the Land Commission that was <Col N="1251" /> worked in accordance with proper methods of husbandry.  We can discuss that question later.  The Deputy also mentioned that holdings which had been already the subject of land purchase are not immune from the provisions of the Bill.  That is quite true. The fact of a holding having been purchased under one of the Land Purchase Acts should not act as a preventive to the Land Commission acquiring it.  If there is a person on it who is not working it, or who is leaving the land derelict or half derelict, surely the fact that it was purchased under one of the Land Acts should not safeguard such a person.</P>

      <P>I am sure counsel will find out whether the Land Commission has power to acquire the land or not. As to the purpose for which it is to be acquired, I do not think that is so important. We all know that the purpose is to relieve congestion and to turn uneconomic holdings into economic ones.  Deputy Bennett said that he was as much concerned about the small landowners as Deputies on this side. If he is, he should not impede this <Col N="1252" /> policy of land settlement that we are trying to adopt.  He knows very well that there is a considerable number of uneconomic holdings, as I call them, that require to be enlarged.  It is for the purpose of enlarging these holdings in many cases that the Land Commission is acquiring land.</P>

I am not going to labour the point, but I saw farms sold in my part of the country and they fetched as good prices as ever they fetched.  There is as much value attached to land there as ever.

      <P>I suppose no good purpose would be served on this section in trying to follow the last speaker on the price of land.  I am opposed to the section upon grounds which differ slightly from those put forward, even from these benches. What I should like Deputies opposite to realise is that the section gives the Land Commission power to resume holdings that had been already purchased out by tenants from the Land Commission under the various Land Acts.  It does not say at what point they are to stop.  This section, as it stands, gives the Land Commission the right to resume any holding where the Lay Commissioners give a certain certificate.  A case was made by Deputy Carty that these were big land owners.  They are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankJCarty" hpid="Mr. Carty Mr. Carty">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another section dealing with them altogether. We are not dealing with the Second Reading of this Bill; we are dealing with this particular section and this section is one that does a certain thing. It entitles the Land Commission to come down to Deputy Carty's farm in Sligo and say: &ldquo;You are not working this farm right and we will take it from you.&rdquo;  Deputy Carty might be the same as the farmer in Knocknagow who, when his neighbours said: &ldquo;Do not be working so hard on your farm,&rdquo; replied: &ldquo;I will work hard on it, because when I work it well and drain it and the landlord increases the rent, I am quite safe in it.&rdquo;  He did not feel there was anything else he should do; <Col N="1254" /> he did not feel he should go out and join the rest of the Tipperary tenant farmers in order to hold his farm or get a fair rent fixed.  He said: &ldquo;I am working my farm well; I have improved it, and the fact that the landlord increases my rent is ample guarantee of my security of tenure.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>In this section the tenant farmer who is working his farm well may satisfy himself, when he gets the notice that the Land Commission are going to resume it for the relief of congestion or whatever it may be, that he is all right.  He may say: &ldquo;I am working my farm properly.  I have drained it and done everything I could.  I have read the Minister's statement in the Dáil that a man who works his farm well will not be disturbed.&rdquo;  He can say further: &ldquo;I will trust the Land Commission and the Lay Commissioners&rdquo;&mdash;to whom such a tribute has been paid this evening&mdash;&ldquo;I will trust them that they will be able to ascertain the facts.&rdquo;  The result is that he does not employ a solicitor or counsel; he does not employ Deputy Carty or Deputy Lynch.  The inspector goes down, and perhaps the old fellow is in at the fair or somewhere else on business, and a report goes back that he is not working the land well and he was not there when the inspector called.</P>
      <P>No matter what the conditions are, he does not do anything about it.  He may come to Dublin and appear before the Lay Commissioners in order to say he was working the farm well.  There is no obligation on the Lay Commissioners to interrogate him fully in order to ascertain the facts.  The obligation is on the tenant to satisfy the Lay Commissioners that he is working the land.  There is no obligation on the Lay Commissioners to put him through it, and he has no counsel appearing for him.  As a result of the facts put before the Commissioners, they will say: &ldquo;We are satisfied that he is not working it properly,&rdquo; and they give a certificate for resumption. The man follows the same line of conduct as the farmer in Knocknagow, and says: &ldquo;I am perfectly safe,&rdquo; but there is no appeal from that, once the Lay Commissioners give that certificate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1255" /> Under this section there is no protection of any type or kind.  The wording is quite clear&mdash;&ldquo;The Land Commission shall give in the prescribed manner to the person appearing to be in occupation of the holding....&rdquo;  They do not even have to make sure that they have the right fellow&mdash;&ldquo;the person appearing to be in occupation&rdquo;.  They propose to ask for leave to resume the holding.  There is no obligation on them, because the section sets out: &ldquo;it shall not be obligatory on the Land Commission to state, in any notice given...the power under which....&rdquo;  One farmer may say: &ldquo;I am working my farm well and I know the Minister for Lands&mdash;a decent man&mdash;and the Land Commissioners&mdash; they are all decent fellows&mdash;and I need not go to any solicitor in either Longford or Kerry.&rdquo;  He decides to go on his own to Dublin and submit the case to the Commissioners.  You have the certificate given and there is no getting away from that.</P>
    <P>I submit this is too great a power altogether.  It has been mentioned, and I might be permitted barely to touch it, that it does interfere to a great extent with the credit of the farmers.  I know of a case in which the farm is a fairly substantial one.  The owner worked it so well that he made £4,000 profit in it.  Being a big fool, he bought another farm for £7,500. With the £4,000 that he had, he entered the bank.  I agree with Deputy O'Rourke that he was a fool to go near the bank.  Anyhow, he put in the £4,000, gave a mortgage upon the farm where he made the £4,000 and also on the new farm he bought. When he had all done, along came the slump, because of one thing or another.  You can put down any reason you like.  I will even, for the purpose of making an argument, say it was owing to the international situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I would rather use your own pet phrase, inter-ternational depression.  That was the <Col N="1256" /> cause of all the hardship.  Owing to the international depression, he was no longer able to meet the overdraft. The result was that he sold the farm where he made the £4,000 and got £2,000 for it.  He did that prior to 1932.  To-day he has effected a settlement with the bank for about £650 and the Agricultural Credit Corporation say his £7,500 farm is not sufficient security for them.  Why is that farm, land held from the Land Commission and that was purchased for £7,500, not worth £650 to the Agricultural Credit Corporation?  It is a fairly substantial farm.  There are perhaps 250 acres in it, but they know that when the existing land annuity is redeemed on it if they had to try to liquidate it in order to realise, they would not be able to get that done.  They can only get the price if the Land Commission will pay for it.  That would be the value of the farm.</P>
      <P>If that man, although he has ten or 12 children, put the farm up for public auction to-morrow, I would have people coming in saying I should make representations to the Land Commission that that holding should be acquired.  If I said I would not, it would mean that I was opposed to getting land for the people.  It is a situation that the Government and the Land Commission have to meet and they have to put the farmer in the position that where he has a farm held from the Land Commission, purchased in the ordinary way, he will have some protection in it if he is working it. This man is working it, but because of his circumstances it will not be protection for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Honestly, I am not trying to make a debating point on this matter or to make Party capital or anything like that out of this particular matter, but I feel that in cases of this type, where there is resumption of holdings at present held from the Land Commission, there should be some method by which the facts may be reviewed, in case of accident.  He may have it as in the case of a criminal appeal&mdash;that is that you may make application for leave to appeal.  You can make it as difficult as you like, but you should have some form of second revision <Col N="1257" /> because, if you do not, again the wheel could go around the full distance. Governments could change&mdash; will change, I hope&mdash;and it might not be always even Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael that you would have as a Government; you could have a very reactionary Government here at some future day and, remember, that you are legislating for them.</P>

      <P>Deputy Harris should make his own speech and tell them in Kildare all about it.  If a man has a farm of land from the Land Commission, for which his father fought in order to put him there, I do not see by what right any Government or any Legislature in this country would give a statutory body the right to take that land off him without affording some protection to enable him to show that he was working the land properly, and that when these facts were put up, or, as I said, as in the case of the old fellow in Knocknagow, even with the failure to do so, he should get a chance to mend his hand afterwards.  Any Deputy in the House, whether he is a lawyer or not, knows perfectly well that an appeal should lie if the person who should have made the case did not get an opportunity of making it, and that <Col N="1259" /> there should be some method to provide for that.  That is why I said that there should be an application for leave to appeal, if necessary.  Make it as difficult as you like, but have that matter covered in some particular way, because there will be people down through the country who will not go to a lawyer or solicitor or employ counsel, because they will say to themselves that there is no necessity to do so, and then, when something has gone wrong, it will be too late, and then it will only mean that you will have to bring in another amending Act to squash what you have done.</P>

      <P>Deputies of the Government Party&mdash;notably Deputy Carty&mdash;tried, I think, deliberately, to misrepresent and misinterpret the intentions of this Party.  We are not opposed to land division, and I think that is well known.  Land was being divided by this Party before Fianna Fáil divided any of it, but we stand for justice and fair play for every citizen in this country.  I have no sympathy for the man who does not work his land properly and who is not an asset to the country and not trying to pull his weight as a unit in the State, but I certainly submit that the man who is working his land properly, and who is a real asset to this country, ought to be protected and preserved, and he is not protected and preserved by a pious promise or a pious wish of the Minister for Lands that he ought to be protected in law. I do not see where he is protected in law under this particular section.  It is this particular section that destroys his security.  He has no security of tenure whatever.  The Minister has got up and tried to defend this section, saying in effect, that the House knows very well that the commissioners are a decent lot of men who know their job and that they are not going to take land from a man who is working it properly, and that neither they nor he himself has any intention of doing so.  That is all very well, but how can he bind any successor of his that may come along, or any successor of the Land Commissioners? How can he guarantee that <Col N="1260" /> future people will not confiscate land anywhere they like?  Is the Minister prepared, in this section, to introduce an amendment that will give the protection to which he gives lip service in this House?  That is no good to the people who want protection, and it is no good to the people who are entitled to security on the land, because, as I said before, they are a real asset to this country and they have not got the protection to which they are entitled.  In fact, it is the very reverse, that protection is being destroyed, and the reaction is that they are doubtful and cautions about spending money in improving their holdings.  Certainly, they will not get any help or any loans from the banks.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Or from any corporation if they require money under this section.  The section proposes that the Land Commission give notice in the prescribed manner that they require to resume a holding, and it says that it shall not be obligatory on the Land Commission to state the power or the grounds under which they propose to acquire the land.  Sub-section (1) (d) says that where the Land Commission certify the purpose of resumption it need only be indicated in general terms, and this certificate, in general terms, shall be conclusive evidence that the holding is required for a purpose lawful under the Land Acts.  It would be utterly futile for any citizen under a section like that to appeal to any tribunal because the tribunal's hands are absolutely tied and they would have no jurisdiction whatever.  It would be a pure waste of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sub-section (2) proposes to authorise the Land Commission to enter into possession of a holding before the price is fixed.  It would give power to a department, first, to compulsorily resume a holding and then treat the citizen with contempt by telling him that he can wait as long as the Land Commission like before the price is fixed.  They can say, &ldquo;We will take over your farm and fix the price whenever we like.  It may be six months or 12 months or two years or five years. <Col N="1261" /> We will fix the compensation price when it suits us but we want your holding immediately.&rdquo;  That is also an important clause in this section that has been overlooked.  I think it is very important.  It is certainly treating the citizen with contempt, denying him the right of justice and fair play, confiscating his property, and saying that perhaps in a year or two he may be compensated in some measure for the resumption of his holding.  If this section is passed in its present form there will not be a semblance of justice left.  If that type of justice is going to be administered in this country then justice is a sham and a fraud.  That is what it amounts to.  As I said, we all agree that land ought to be divided. There are some uneconomic holders in the country who, if they got more land, would make good use of it in their own interests and in the interests of the State.  But, on a plea that it is to expedite matters in that respect, individuals are to be denied justice, justice is to be trampled under foot with regard to certain individuals who hold property in this country.</P>
    <P>What we suggest is that that citizen should be given the opportunity to say why his holding should not be resumed; that he should be given the opportunity to defend himself.  That is a simple, a fair and a just request and that is all we ask.  If the Minister is not prepared to meet us on that, then we will have to divide the House again on it.</P>
    <P>On the question of credit, it has been pointed out by Deputy Belton&mdash; and on the Second Reading of this Bill I pointed out myself&mdash;the important bearing this section is going to have on credit for farmers in this country because, after all, you cannot have credit here without security, and the only security the farmer in this country has to offer is the security of his land.  That security is going to be destroyed under this section.  Government Deputies have tried to labour the point that that security was destroyed long ago, that it was destroyed during the war and after the war period.  The type of loan advanced at that time is not the type of loan we visualise when we speak <Col N="1262" /> about loans at the present time and when we speak about rehabilitating a farm.  We do not speak about giving loans to farmers to buy more land. That is what happened during the war. Huge sums of money were advanced by the joint stock banks of this country to individual farmers to purchase land.  Those farmers found themselves sunk beyond any possible hope of recovery and money was lost or frozen.  When we speak about credit we refer to a certain type of loan that would help the farmer to restock the land&mdash;money that would be put into live stock, money that would help the farmers to work their land effectively&mdash;not loans for the purpose of buying more land.  The type of loan we visualise can be secured, and secured effectively, if the farmer has proper security in his holding.  That is the type of loan that we ought to bear in mind in this House.  I do not think the House at any time, from any side, intends to facilitate farmers by providing loans for the purpose of buying land.  That is not our intention at all.  Our intention is that any loans that will be advanced to farmers will be used for the purpose of restocking the land.</P>
    <P>It has been stressed by Fianna Fáil Deputies that this section cannot affect credit.  I referred to a particular case on the Second Reading&mdash;the case of a widow who held approximately 400 statute acres of land.  There was a financial problem attached to that to which I did not refer.  I shall refer to it now because I think it is important. On that holding of approximately 400 acres the bank advanced a loan of £1,500.  Obviously it seemed a safe security from a banking point of view. But it was not.  That holding was resumed by the Land Commission and realised £1,200.  The bank got the £1,200 and lost £300 in the transaction. Is not that one case enough to shy off that bank for all time in advancing loans of that sort?  That land was obviously a very safe security for a loan of £1,500 on two holdings approximating to 400 acres.  That represented less than £4 an acre.  One would think that the land would secure that loan anywhere but there was a loss incurred by the bank of £300.  One cannot get <Col N="1263" /> away from the fact that this has an important bearing on credit and credit is an all important matter for the country at the present time.  The doubt that exists, not only in the rural areas, but in the cities and towns as well, of our stability at the present time has reacted upon credit and that doubt will be increased by a Bill such as this, destroying the security of a farmer in his holding, with the natural reaction that it is bound to have on credit.</P>
    <P>The whole section amounts to confiscation, pure and simple, and to an absolute denial of justice and fair play to the citizen.  That is the point, with its reaction on credit, that we want to stress&mdash;the right of every citizen to get justice and fair play here before you acquire his land.  By all means, land should be resumed and acquired, especially land that is not being properly treated and properly worked.  I have no sympathy for the people who are not pulling their weight and are not trying to make good use of the land, but I say that, before you take it off a man who has not worked it properly, he should be given the opportunity of defending himself and of asking why it is done and why his farm is going to be acquired and for what purpose; and when he knows the purpose he should be heard in his own defence as to why it should not be taken.  We boast about our high ideals here of justice and fair play and impartiality, but surely this section cuts across the whole principle, it lowers the whole ideal of justice in this country and tramples under foot the moral right of the citizen in this and in every country to be given an opportunity to defend himself and his property.  If this Parliament stands for that sort of justice it is a sorry day for this country.</P>
    <P>I have asked myself a question: &ldquo;Does this represent the mentality of the Land Commission or is it a prompt from the back benchers of Fianna Fáil?&rdquo;  I would like to know where it came from, as it is not a credit to any of the people from whom it may have come.  I appeal to the Minister again, before he forces this <Col N="1264" /> matter&mdash;forces this question on this House and on the country&mdash;to reconsider the whole section and to put justice before expediency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am supporting the section.  Notwithstanding all that I have heard from the Opposition Benches, I have not the least fear that I am going to inflict any hardship on anybody.  It appears to me to make a difference between the question as to whether or not we are serious in proceeding with land division.  I take it that this Bill and this section have been considered necessary to try and get on with the job of making land division a success.  Everybody who has spoken has professed that he is not opposed to land division but is only trying to secure fair play.  Listening to some of the speeches that have been made here this afternoon, one would get the impression that there were very many well-worked farms throughout the country, and that everybody was carefully looking after them, and that the Land Commission was a dangerous body which was seeking to split up all the fine ranches into small holdings.  If the Land Commission were composed of men of that type the amendments which have been suggested would never be a protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that the Land Commission is an instrument of State and is not the property of the present Government or of the last Government or of any succeeding Government.  The remark has been made that there may be another Government and consequently another Land Commission.  I hope that the time that you can change bodies of that sort with a change of Government is far distant, and I think that it is not in the interests of the credit of the country to refer to instruments such as the Land Commission in that manner.  I am supporting this section and the Bill, because I feel that it is necessary to give this power to the Land Commission to enable them to get on with the job, and to ensure that they have sufficient authority to function usefully and speedily, so that there may be a check to the great evil of migration and to the decline in the rural population through the flight to the cities and the towns. <Col N="1265" /> If the people are going to be held on the land I do not see any way by which it can be done except by equitable division of land, by giving it to men who are competent and prepared to use it.  If the measures that were in the hands of the Land Commission in the previous Bill were adequate there would have been no need for this measure now.</P>
    <P>Living in the country as I do and hearing all the sins that are supposed to be committed by the Land Commission and the accusations that are levelled at the heads of this body, I know all the devices that have been attempted, and attempted with success, by the owners of land to keep this land from the Land Commission and from those who are waiting for it hungrily.  I know a case where the Land Commission has been defeated in trying to obtain division of land and where the owner has snipe flying over it and where he will not allow the unfortunate people into it, though he is not using it himself.  In this case this land is the best to be obtained in the particular locality, yet the unfortunate human beings cannot get it, because this man has defeated the Land Commission.  ,I am quite prepared to give any power to the Land Commission to defeat that kind of gentleman, who is unpatriotic enough to allow the place to remain derelict and barren.  That is not an isolated case: I know of others.</P>
    <P>Several amendments have been suggested from which it would appear that but little confidence should be placed in the commissioners.  It is sought, by amendments, to safeguard rights in this section, but I believe that the section would be utterly worthless if confidence cannot be reposed in the people who are entrusted with the division of land.  In this particular question&mdash;the question of an appeal to the Appeal Tribunal&mdash;the Lay Commissioners in my opinion are the really competent persons to deal with the question as to whether a farm is well worked or otherwise.  On the question of law there is an appeal to the Appeal Tribunal; but, if the Lay Commissioners are supposed to be dangerous and that there is no security <Col N="1266" /> left and the people are threatened with sheer confiscation of their property, I do not see what guarantee there is that that property will not be confiscated if the case is taken to the Appeal Tribunal.  Are the members of the Appeal Tribunal more to be relied upon than men who have the same legal qualifications as, I take it, is the case under the Lay Commissioners. They are dealing with a matter which is inside their functions and unless they are wilfully and with malice aforethought out for the destruction of the owners of property, there is no justification for attacks of the kind that have been made on them this afternoon.</P>
    <P>The majority of the complaints that I have heard show that the Land Commission is going too slowly.  Generally speaking, Deputies think that land is being divided too slowly and that if we are to proceed at the rate at which we are at present proceeding it will not happen in our lifetime that the Commission will get down to the small holdings that are supposed to be in need of land and rid the people of the huge ranches&mdash;some of them of considerable magnitude&mdash;which have not been used.  I hope that sufficient power is being taken now to carry out the necessary work and that it will not be necessary to come in later for more. I am prepared to give as much power as is necessary, confident in the knowledge that it is not going to be used by dangerous persons but that it will be used by reasonable and sensible men who will carry out what they believe to be the best policy for the people, and that the powers they have will be used in the best interests of the country as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to this section because it gives to the Land Commission powers to which they have no right, powers to confiscate land which has been fought for and won by the farmers of this country, and because it gives the Land Commission power to inflict a gross injustice upon a section of the community which is least able to defend itself.  Deputy Kissane has said that those who are opposing this measure were supporting <Col N="1267" /> individuals against the community. Deputy Kissane does not appear to be aware that the community is made up of individuals and that if you trample upon the rights of the individual you are trampling upon the best interests of the community as a whole.</P>
      <P>What is the best interest of the community at the present time?  Is it not that the land of this country should produce the last ounce of output that can be secured from it?  Is it helping to secure the last ounce of productivity from the land if you deprive the ordinary working farmer of the right to security and the right to regard himself as a free citizen of a free country and not as a convict who can be convicted by a small tribunal from which there is no appeal whatever? We are told that our whole security lies in the fact that the members of the Land Commission are decent men and that the Minister for Lands is a decent man.  We have never questioned the decency of those people. We have been told that we should rely on the fact that the members of the Land Commission are not Turks.  That may not be a respectful way to refer to the citizens of a friendly State, which may be an ally of this country in the next war, but even though the members of the Land Commission may not be Turks, many injustices have occured in this country in the past&mdash; and it is possible that many other injustices may occur in the future&mdash; which were not perpetrated by Turks, but by people who are described in the census returns as Christians.  The gentleman who purchased cows at one-third of their value in Arklow last year was not a Turk.</P>

      <P>I am pointing out that the fact that the Lay Commissioners are Christians does not give the decent Christians of this country adequate protection, and I think that, in all fairness, there should be some appeal from the decisions of the Lay Commissioners. Even though they might be <Col N="1268" /> fairly honest, they might make mistakes, because nobody is infallible, and everybody can make mistakes. Surely it is only just and reasonable that persons who find themselves aggrieved should have the right to appeal to a higher tribunal?  It has been said that the higher tribunal might also be unjust, that a judicial tribunal might not be absolutely impartial, and might possibly make mistakes, but there is this difference, that the higher tribunal would be at least a little more independent than the Lay Commissioners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and, apart from that, they are in a more independent position.  The Lay Commissioners are concerned mainly with one job&mdash;to get as much land as possible divided.  An independent tribunal might not find itself so tied down to carrying out Government policy.  It may be asked from what source does any danger arise to the decent, honest working farmer of the country, and that is a very pertinent question.  The danger arises, and will arise, in my opinion, from the fact that the more land you divide, the greater will be the demand for further division of land.  It is only when you have acquired and divided a considerable amount of land that the demand for the acquisition of still greater amounts will become irresistible. Deputy Childers, I think, dealt with this aspect of the question on Second Reading.  At column 745 of the Official Debates of June 7th last, he said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I myself think that the pressure brought on Deputies of this House by those who want land is an entirely undesirable thing.  I think the whole atmosphere in many parts of the country in which people are waiting for 300-acre estates to be divided&mdash; no one knows whether they are going to be divided or how soon&mdash;is entirely wrong.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Again, at column 746, he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;At any rate, when the present Bill has had its effect the same uncertainty will continue, and whatever <Col N="1269" /> Government is in office&mdash;whether it is ours or another&mdash;will be driven by political pressure to try to take further steps to divide land, knowing very well that those steps may not be economical in their results.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that this remark of Deputy Childers refers to this section in as much as some limit should be placed on the powers of the Land Commission in respect of acquisition of land.  Otherwise, you will have a steady, continuing pressure on the House to go on acquiring and dividing land, and, no matter how impartial the Lay Commissioners, or the members of the Land Commission, are, if Deputies desire that land acquisition should continue and should not be restricted in any way, they will have to carry out the policy of this House and of the Party in power. Because, as Deputy Childers foresees, there is a danger that there will be undue pressure brought to bear upon members of the House to carry out that policy of acquiring land, it is only right that the House, foreseeing that danger, should place some limit upon the powers in regard to the resumption of holdings.  It is very easy for anybody who wants popular support to go to a particular district and promise other people's land to his supporters, and some restriction should be placed upon that type of activity.  In this section, there is no restriction whatever. The Land Commission is given absolute power to divide the last acre of the land of the country and to sweep away completely any security which tenant farmers thought they had secured when they won the land war.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say that I see eye to eye with my colleague here beside me.  I rather incline to the views expressed by Deputy Keyes. So far as I can see, the major fears expressed by Deputies on the Fine Gael Benches are groundless.  There might be some reason for these fears if we had a Stalin, a Mussolini, a Hitler or even, I might say, a Labour <Col N="1270" /> Government, but, under the form of benevolent dictatorship which we enjoy at the moment, I think these fears are absolutely groundless.  Deputy Belton made some references to the effect which this section had on the credit of the Dublin Corporation, and also to the effect which the activities of the Land Commission had on that credit, and he invited any member of that body to stand up here and challenge the accuracy of what he said.  I recognise that reference to such matters is scarcely in order, but I do want to take this opportunity flatly to contradict the statements made by Deputy Belton in that connection.  I do not think there is anything further I have to say on the section, except that, so far as I can see, it aims at establishing the simple principle of taking land from those who are not prepared to work it.  If I may draw a very slight analogy, an unemployed man who is found by the labour exchange to be a person not genuinely seeking work is deprived of his benefit. I do not see why much better off sections of the community should be immune from a little stimulating treatment on the lines suggested in the section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Listening to the Opposition Deputies, one would think that we had reached quite a revolutionary age, that a revolution was to take place in the country and that there was to be an end to all the property we had.  Deputy MacEoin and Deputy Hughes told us they were not afraid of this Land Commission and that they were not afraid of this Government but of some future Land Commission or Government.  I wonder where that Government and Land Commission are to come from.  I expect they will be drawn from the people.  As a farmer I would not be a bit afraid in the morning to live in the future under a Labour Government.  We would be quite secure and our holdings would be quite secure under a Government drawn from any section of this House.  I want to make that plain. There are in this country 300,000 farmers who are under a £50 valuation. These 300,000 farmers have little more <Col N="1271" /> than 4,000,000 acres of the arable land of the country.  Another 66,000 persons have 6,500,000 or almost 7,000,000 acres.  That is almost the exact position.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hughes has talked about the credit of the farmers.  I am sure the credit of the 300,000 with a valuation under £50 is not affected in any way by any Land Acts that are passed or may be passed in the future and put into operation.  I would say that is the case of every single individual with a valuation of under £50.  One might add another 20,000 who are under £100 valuation.  Their credit is not affected. You get then another 20,000 who hold land over £100 valuation.  It is about that number and about their credit that the row is.  They are not one-eighth or one-fortieth of the total farmers of the country.  Let Deputies remember that all the time.  I did not propose to intervene in this debate, but I have been listening for the last hour to speeches on Section 39 of the Bill&mdash;the resumption of holdings.  All these speeches were made on the Second Reading.  There is nothing in this section that this House and the people of the country did not agree to five or six years ago.  Every principle in that section was agreed to by the House and endorsed by the people in the country with their eyes wide open. There are 300,000 holdings with a valuation under £50.  I hope the House will support the Minister in getting this section through.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is pretty clear that the Party opposite and the Labour Party have made up their minds that they cannot any longer support their own tribunal.  There is no doubt the Appeal Commissioners have been created by the present Government. The president of that tribunal is their late Attorney-General.  The two other commissioners on the Appeal Tribunal have been appointed by them.  Now the wording of this section prevents any review by that particular tribunal of any matter on which there might be an appeal.  Why is that?  Human nature is human nature, and the ordinary Lay Commissioners as soon as land <Col N="1272" /> division comes to an end have their job finished.  It is natural that they will try to keep their jobs.  Human nature in Ireland is perhaps made of as much ordinary clay or perhaps more ordinary clay as in any other quarter of the world.  Here the Government have no confidence in their own tribunal, and they will have no re-trial and no examination.  A commissioner comes in and gives a certificate that a certain farmer should have his farm taken from him.  There is no review and no redress.  Deputy Allen has given away the case.  He says that the credit of these 20,000 people with a valuation of over £100 a year is worsened and that they deserve no consideration in this State.</P>

      <P>There is no court and no possibility of an appeal for them.  They do not count.  I know there is no use arguing this question.  It is purely a waste of time.  It is going to be carried. I am certain that the Land Commission never asked that these powers were to be given to them.  The demand has come from the Labour benches.  We can very easily see where it has come from.  It is only a waste of time to argue the matter further.  The plain fact emerges that the individual in occupation of a farm is prevented by legislation from a review of his case and from getting a fair trial to put up a case in a public court and have it fairly dealt with.  Of course we are aware that the people on the dole will return this Government to power any time.  There are 100,000 of them and their families in the country.  They hold the balance of power.  That is the position of which the Government should take stock.  They should give it careful examination.  It is a very happy position for the people on the dole, for the people who are depending on the dole, the people who will not work, the people who cannot work and do not want to work and have never worked and are untrained to work.  It is utterly impossible now for these people to work after being so long on the dole.</P>

      <P>I wish to repudiate one statement by Deputy Gorey.  The Deputy stated that Deputy Allen said that we admitted that the credit of these 20,000 farmers over £100 valuation is interfered with by this Bill. It is not.  Every Deputy knows that the action of the Land Commission as such has nothing whatever to do with the credit of the farmers and that it has never interfered with the credit of the farmers.  I have here already given definitely the reason why farmers will not get credit and nobody knows that better than the Fine Gael Deputies.  They all know that if a bank puts up a holding in the morning that that sale will be interfered with and that farm will be branded.</P>

      <P>Deputy Allen boiled this issue down to 20,000 farmers.  Let us examine the position of these 20,000 farmers.  My valuation amounts to £151.  I have no dread that anybody will come and take portion of my farm from me.  I know farmers in this House who have 1,000 acres and 1,500 acres and they have no dread that that land will be taken from them because they are working it and giving employment. The objection we have is to the small farmer to whom Deputy Allen alluded&mdash;the man with from 50 acres to 20 acres&mdash;being obliged to meet not only his own obligations bu' the annuities on the thousands of acres which these gentlemen hold.  They are paying neither rates nor annuities in in respect of that land.  There are 7,000 acres in my constituency in that position at present.  The unfortunate fellows whose ancestors were evicted out of those lands are living on farms of 20 acres or 30 acres on the mountainside.  They are meeting the unpaid rates and annuities of these gentlemen-farmers who can drive out in motor cars while leaving their lands derelict.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5, but amendments Nos. 6, 7 and 8 <Col N="1280" /> may be taken with it as they all deal with the same point.  Amendments Nos. 5 and 7 are in my name.  During the Committee Stage, the question of having an appeal from the decision to refuse registration or reregistration of a hotel or similar premises was debated at some length and I intimated my willingness to move an amendment which would ensure that the proprietor of such a premises would receive notice of the intention to refuse registration or reregistration, would have the right to appeal against that provisional decision, that, following his appeal, there would be a reinspection of the premises by another officer of the board and that the decision on appeal would be made by the board itself and not by ony of its officers. That is the purpose of amendment No. 5.  The purpose of amendment No. 7 is to effect the same thing in reference to reregistration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that the Minister has gone a considerable distance to meet the view we put forward. He has carried out his promise to the full.  He refused to commit himself so far as the board was concerned, but he promised that there would be a reinspection.  As regards the amendment that stands in my name, I was anxious that reinspection should be carried out by a more responsible officer, as generally happens in case of appeals, than the officer responsible for the original inspection.  As I pointed out on Committee Stage, though the board itself may make the decision, it will make that decision on the report of the inspector and not on personal knowledge. Unless it is provided that a member of the board shall make the report for the purpose of appeal, the board will have to be guided by the report of their inspector.  So far as the Minister's amendment is concerned, the inspector for the purpose of the appeal will be a person of the same rank as, or perhaps a lower rank than, the man who carried out the original inspection.  I do not know whether the Minister could help us in suggesting to the board that a person of higher standing than the original inspector should carry out the reinspection. <Col N="1281" /> That would be more in accord with precedent generally.</P>
      <P>Now, that we are on this new section, which deals with one of the Bill's main purposes&mdash;registration&mdash; perhaps the Minister could give us some guidance.  We are appointing a board but we are giving the board no guidance on this question of registration. There is to be registration of four different classes of persons catering for tourists.  The House is giving not the slightest hint to the board as to these different classes.  If we are not able to clarify that matter, nobody else will.  It is generally regarded as the business of a judicial body to determine what the House means but when the House definitely refuses to give any hint as to its meaning, there is bound to be difficulty.  There is a great deal of vagueness about this matter.  On Committee Stage, an amendment was moved to provide that if a man asked to be registered as a hotelkeeper the board could register him in another category&mdash;as the keeper of a guest-house.  The view was prevalent that a guest-house was a sort of lower-class hotel.  The Minister says that that is not so, but there is nothing in the Bill to guide the board as to whether it is so or not.  Neither is there anything to guide a judicial body in coming to a decision as to whether a guest-house is to be regarded as a lower-class hotel.  I recognise the difficulties of definition but surely somebody must have told the Minister what the distinction was when he put this provision into the Bill.  The board cannot have done so because the Minister says he has no idea of who will constitute the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, there is power here in this section to refuse registration. What happens then?  I think I put this point to the Minister on the Committee Stage and I should like if he would address himself to it now.  I have a hotel and I take a name that is not often used in this country, a name that is used more frequently by English and Scotch proprietors.  I call the hotel the &ldquo;Ivanhoe Hotel&rdquo;. I ask that it be registered and it is not registered.  I then simply knock out the word &ldquo;hotel&rdquo;.  Does that mean <Col N="1282" /> that, so far as I am concerned, the Act is a dead letter?  If it does not, does it mean that I go out of business?  If the Act is not a dead letter I cannot, according to the Minister's own exposition on the last occasion, act as a hotel proprietor, as the owner of a guest-house, of a camp or so on.  In what capacity does the Bill catch me? There is in Section 33, I think, a phrase which I asked the Minister to explain, namely, that a person &ldquo;describes&rdquo; or &ldquo;holds out&rdquo;.  It seems to me there are only two alternatives. I can certainly give the place a proper name.  If that is described as &ldquo;holding out&rdquo;, it seems to me that I can go out of business.</P>
    <P>The reason I am asking the Minister these questions is that I am very anxious that the Bill should be a success and that there is a great deal of vagueness attached to it.  There is an impression abroad for instance, that in reality there will be very few refusals to register, certainly in the case of existing businesses, at the beginning. What they will register as, I do not know.  There may be a great deal of tightening up later on, but if a person is not registered, does it mean that he is deprived of his livelihood, because it may be held that he &ldquo;holds out&rdquo;? I think that is the expression.  Or does it mean that he escapes the Act altogether, and that all he has to sacrifice is the publicity?  I do not know what the publicity may amount to, because there is a large number of tourists who never look at these handbooks. For instance, the French, the Italians and the Swiss each publish handbooks.  I am sure that millions of visitors visit these countries annually, but the number who look at these handbooks is not 1 per cent.  It seems to me that if all a man suffers is the loss of the advertisement afforded by getting into that particular handbook, he will not mind that so much.</P>
    <P>The Minister will confess that we are making a considerable act of faith in this Bill.  We are blindly giving over or providing a lump sum of £600,000 and £45,000 a year, with all these uncertainties left.  I wonder whether, when this Bill comes to the Seanad, the Minister might not clarify a number <Col N="1283" /> of these things?  I am anxious, as I say, very, very anxious, that this particular industry should succeed and be helped in every way, but I would feel a little more easy in voting for a Bill that involves such an expenditure of public money if I knew precisely what I was doing in particular sections. I must confess that the more I listened to the debates&mdash;it may have been due to lack of intelligence on my part&mdash;the vaguer I have become as to the meaning of particular provisions in the Bill. It should be the business of the House to clarify these things.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The first point made by the Deputy concerned the possibility of having the second inspection provided for in this amendment, undertaken by a member of the board. I should say that the effect of the amendment would be to make it inevitable that the second inspection would be carried out by an officer of the board holding a senior position. I should not like, however, to make it obligatory that the inspection should be carried out by a member of the board for the reason that it would mean that in the selection of members of the board, we would have to confine ourselves to people who would be suitable for that particular type of work and who would be capable of undertaking it.  It is possible that members of the board will do that work, but I think in the selection of the board, we should be free at least to consider adding business people who may not be free to do inspection work themselves, but who would be very competent to arrive at a decision on the inspector's report when it is made available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing in the Bill about ranks and that would be a drafting difficulty, but I should say that once you provide for inspection by another officer, you make it almost inevitable that the inspection will be <Col N="1284" /> carried out by an official holding a senior position.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see considerable difficulty in putting that into the Bill. In a sense, when you suggest that the second report is to override the first report, the second report must come from some person of greater authority than the person who made the first report, otherwise the internal organisation of the board would be upset. The general question of the standard required for registration is a somewhat difficult one to deal with.  I do not think it would be practicable to set down in the Bill particulars of the standards of accommodation required in order to make a premises eligible to be registered on the hotel register. We would have to define the general character, the type of accommodation and services provided and other qualifications requisite.  Because it is not possible, practicable, or desirable, I think, to do that in the Bill, we take power to do that by regulation.  We are giving power to the board to make these regulations.  The board may modify these regulations from time to time.  It is extremely probable that all hotels will be registered in the first instance.  The attitude of the board to hotel proprietors will not be one of hostility.  Their main function will be to encourage and assist hotel proprietors to improve the standards of accommodation provided for their guests.  I think, therefore, it is to be expected that the board's attitude will be one of benevolence rather than one of hostility.  Their anxiety will be to get hotels registered and, when registered, to encourage and, if necessary, to assist proprietors to improve them generally.  The difficulty in mentioning here the standards of service, the type of accommodation and so forth that may be required to qualify an hotel for registration is that we are giving the power of making regulations to the board.  The board will have to make these regulations independent of Ministerial supervision.  I am sure the <Col N="1285" /> board will fix standards which are reasonable at the beginning, but it is a matter for consideration by the board at what point they will make a start.  If a premises is not registered, the proprietor cannot describe it as an hotel nor can he hold himself out as carrying on the business of an hotel.</P>

I had the section examined and I came to the conclusion that it was unnecessary, that the phraseology in Section 34 relating to these different classes of premises is sufficient to make it impossible for a person who is not registered to represent himself as carrying on a registered business.</P>

It is not intended that it should be so.  It is <Col N="1286" /> intended that a person cannot carry on that type of business at all unless he is registered.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 14, at the end of Section 39, to add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(5)  If at any time a registered proprietor is dissatisfied with the grade allotted to his premises by the board such proprietor may appeal <Col N="1287" /> against such allocation and the board shall thereupon hear such appeal and give its final award as soon as may be but only after the inspection of such premises by either a member of the board or an inspector of senior rank other than the officer who first inspected such premises.</P>
    <P>From the remarks which have been dropped by the Minister, I think the House ought to grasp this fact: that it is not registration that is the important thing: it is the grading.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that will appear to be so from the remarks just made by the Minister, namely, that in practice, and at the start particularly, we may take it for granted that all existing institutions carrying on hotel business will be allowed to carry on as hotels.  Therefore, I take it that registration is not the important thing, but that the position is to be this: that it is on the grading itself that we are going to rely for achievement in the way of improvement and not on registration.  I understood the Minister to say on a previous amendment that registration, especially in the opening years, will be a <i>pro forma</i> matter: that in the benevolent attitude which the board takes it will accept practically almost any registration that is sent in.  I asked the Minister whether that would be the attitude, in his opinion, of the board.  I gathered that he said &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  He repeated the phrase himself, and spoke of the benevolence and desire of the board to help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept, therefore, that what he means is that the really important section is the one dealing with grading. You may have a number of grades from A to G, and by grading you may decide the fate and the livelihood of a person.  In view of that, I would ask the Minister to revise his opinion on this.  I put it to him that when the Bill goes to the Seanad he should allow an amendment to be moved providing for the right of <Col N="1288" /> appeal on the matter of grading.  In my opinion, especially as a result of the debate that we had on the Committee Stage, and the debate that we had earlier to-day, the right of appeal on the question of grading is more important than on the question of registration. I would, therefore, ask the Minister to make the same provisio in the case of grading that he has made in the case of registration, because you are attempting something very big here.</P>
    <P>I do not know any country where, officially, grading takes place on the lines that, I gather, it is the Minister's intention the board should introduce it into this country.  If you take the French list you find that you have not that grading there.  You have a description of the different types of hotels: the hotels that are strongly recommended and others where a guarantee is given with regard to prices.  You get information as to what the hotel is: the number of rooms, the rooms that have hot and cold baths, the price of meals, and so on.  You have a division of hotels into tourist hotels and furnished hotels&mdash; the hotels where you can have bed and breakfast, and family hotels.  In all, I think, there are about three divisions, but you have no attempt at grading. In the case of the Italian hotels, if there is grading, it is grading according to price: that is that in each particular grade the prices move within certain limits.  You can, so to speak, transfer from a hotel in Grade D to another in Grade E.  But there is no attempt to describe the grading according to the value you get for money, or do anything more than indicate the cost of the hotel.  All sorts of information is given about hotels, but there is no attempt at grading in the sense that I understand this Bill contemplates, that there should be grading.</P>
    <P>I do not know of any country in which you have the grading of hotels in the way that we are attempting grading in this country by a semi-official body that has, so to speak, the <i>cachet</i> of the State behind it.  In view of what I have said, I would urge on the Minister to allow an appeal here, because <Col N="1289" /> I think that this matter of grading is much more important than the question of registration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is, perhaps, not worth while having a debate as to which is the more important: registration or grading.  The position is that when a premises is on the register it is open for business, and the proprietor can carry on hotel business in the premises.  The question of grading is a different question altogether.  On that question, I listened very carefully to the representations that were made to me in favour of having some sort of appeal board, but I felt that it would be impracticable.  I came to the conclusion, when it is a question of grading, that you must give the board certain arbitrary powers&mdash;I recognise that they are arbitrary powers&mdash;if the thing is to work properly.  I cannot say that the board will not in practice make its grading on the basis of price, as is done elsewhere, but I think we must leave that matter very largely to the discretion of the board.  Here we have a premises.  It is registered.  The proprietor is entitled to carry on an hotel business in that premises.  There is no question of preventing him from carrying on that business, because he has succeeded in getting his registration, but, when it is a question of determining the standard of the hotel by way of a grading system, it is the opinion of the board that will matter&mdash;not the result of a controversy between the board and the hotel proprietor.  The board will give its opinion, in the same way as private associations which undertake the grading of hotels for the information of their members are at present giving their opinion, and the opinion of their officers, as to the standard of the accommodation provided at the hotel.  They are doing that by a grading system.  That is exactly what the board will do for the information of tourists, and I considered that it was impracticable and not desirable to provide for a formal grading system, in the same sense as we have a formal registration system, but, instead, to give the board the right to come in and, having got this list of hotels, to grade them on the best information it is able to ascertain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1290" /> Hotel proprietors at the present time have no appeal against the grades they are given by any of those associations.  They know how the system works, but they may not be always satisfied with the way it works. I think they can trust this board&mdash; which will have a somewhat different attitude from the executives of those organisations&mdash;to deal with them as fairly and probably more fairly than they have been dealt with in the past, because, of course, the function of this board is to improve and to assist hotels, and not merely the negative one of giving people information concerning them.  They will have the dual function of giving information, on the one hand, and seeing that the accommodation is improved, on the other, and they will have resources to assist them in improving the accommodation. The hotel proprietors, who are familiar with the system at present in operation, will find the system under this board more satisfactory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusMoore" hpid="Mr. Moore Mr. Moore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moore</NameTxt>
      <P>It looks to me as if, from the internal point of view, the first grading will mean a lot to the average hotel.  After all, there will be a good deal of talk about it amongst those who regularly travel through the country, apart from tourists.  They will be very curious to know how certain hotels with which they are familiar are graded.  The position it gets in the list of graded hotels may make or mar an hotel, and I think there is reason for an appeal.  It might happen that the board would grade an hotel on its appearance on inspection.  An hotel which was not particularly clean, for instance, would not get a good trade, but that is a matter which could be remedied immediately; the change of a manager or manageress might enable the hotel to claim a higher grade than had been given to it by the board.  As far as I can see, once a decision has been given the hotel must wait for a year or more before the grading can be changed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says it is the board which will do that grading, but in the amendments dealing with the registration, he thought it necessary to insert a sub-section which said that a reference to the board does mean the board and not its officers.  No such sub-section applies to the grading, so in practice it will be the inspectors who will do it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is quite so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be co-ordination of their work.  I take it that it will not be done by the individual officers; the board, I take it, will ensure that the actual decisions are made at the central office.  The grading may be upon the basis of price. One can easily contemplate a situation where the hotel proprietor will not want to get the top grade.  He may say: &ldquo;If I get the top grade it is going to keep away the class of customer I am catering for, namely the persons who want a cheaper class of hotel&rdquo;.  It must not be assumed that only such hotels as are on the highest grade will get business.  Quite the reverse may be the case.  Neither should it be presumed that the only communication between the hotel proprietor and the Board takes place when the inspectors come on a formal visit.  There will be constant contact between the hotel proprietors and the Board, and questions involving a change of grade on a change of <Col N="1292" /> management or some alteration in the hotel can be dealt with at any time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been thinking over the debate which took place on the last day, and I can quite see the reasons which induced the Minister to take up the attitude he did, but I wonder whether considerations of public policy ought not induce him to change his mind.  If you look at any particular matter, and look at that alone, there are strong reasons why power should be given to do a certain thing; for instance to give the Revenue Commissioners power&mdash;I do not know whether or not they have it&mdash;to look into the whole banking accounts of everybody, whether they got permission from the individual or not.  If you argue on the individual merits of investigating business of that kind, a case can always be put up, but public policy ought to be against the principle of having the sort of inquisition that is provided for in this particular section, and that the <Col N="1293" /> amendment in the name of Deputy McMenamin and myself strives to prevent.</P>
    <P>I can quite understand the Minister saying: &ldquo;Well, the inspector must get information as to the type of hotel&mdash;get it where he can.&rdquo;  That looks all right, but I think it is a bad principle, namely going behind the back of the employer to get evidence against the employer from one of the employees. From the point of view of general business, I think that is bad, and I think public policy ought to induce the Minister to think over it and change his mind.  I think, apart altogether from this kind of inquisition provided for in the section as it stands, there is already sufficient power.  Apart altogether from hotels, or anything else of that kind, I think that in general it is bad policy to introduce this principle. For that reason, I think the Minister should amend this particular section.</P>
    <P>I am putting that to him on the general consideration, not on the desirability of getting this particular type of information.  The inspector can go in and dine there and hear of things. He can question people, or ask the proprietor to allow him to question certain people in his presence or anything of that kind.  But that he should ask an employee to do practically what would be looked upon in the ordinary way as spying on the person running the business, I suggest is bad policy.  It does not conduce to the smooth running of that or of any other business.  I should like the Minister to give some assurance that he would consider this when the Bill is passing through the Seanad.  I am putting it on the ground of general policy and on no other ground.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say to the Deputy that I have considered the matter already, and I think it desirable to leave the section as it stands. We have considerable experience of the working of similar sections in other legislation, legislation of very long standing, like the Factories Acts, the Trade Boards Acts, and so forth. Under these Acts we have the same power.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not come under my Department and I cannot say anything about it.  It has been the experience of factory inspectors, shop inspectors, and Trade Board inspectors that without this power their ability to carry out their functions is considerably restricted, although they exercise that power very rarely indeed, because, of course, they always feel that if they speak to an employee in some factory or similar establishment they are jeopardising that employee's livelihood if, as a consequence, the proprietor is subject to a prosecution.  Therefore, they do not often use that power except there is real need for it, but they find that having possession of the power makes it easier for them to carry out their functions.  The same thing would apply in this case.  You must assume that the inspectors will be reasonable men anxious to carry out their functions with the least possible trouble to all concerned and get their job done without causing annoyance or difficulty. It is to be assumed that they will not exercise the power except there is need for it, and, if there is need for it, I think they should have the power.  It has been our experience in connection with other legislation that the possession of the power reduces the need for it and that the inspectors concerned are always able to get the information they want from the man in charge, because the man in charge knows that if he does not give it the inspector has power to get it otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was opposed to this as a general principle when it first appeared and I tried to get it amended in Committee and my view has not changed.  The general principle is really bad, I think.  If this is left in its present form it will give the impression of spying.  You can have cases where a subordinate employee may give information which he in fact believes to be true, but owing to the fact that he is in a subordinate position he may not be in possession of full information and as a result of that he may, in fact, give information which is wrong.  These cases occur and we know they will occur.  Everybody knows that in this country the Government inspector, except he is handing <Col N="1295" /> something out, is generally treated as a suspect and people try to conceal things from him.  The inspectors are alive to that.  That sort of thing does not arise here.  What is involved here is a visit to the premises and an inspection of the furniture and the rest of the equipment and the menu.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the charges, all the inspector has to do is to go into the hotel at breakfast, lunch or dinner time and see the menu card.  Is not that the whole problem?  Anyone who comes along can see that.  There is no reason for this at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The ordinary type of case would be where somebody writes in: &ldquo;I went to spend a holiday in your country.  I went down to this part of the country and I was grossly overcharged in the following hotels&rdquo;. That is the complaint the inspector has got to investigate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>We are enacting here that the list of charges must be displayed in a number of places in the hotel.  If I walk in there and consider the charges too high I can go out. There can be no concealment.  If a person is overcharged at the table, all he has to do is to refer the person who is serving him to the list of charges. I do not want to press this, but I am defending it on principle.  I do not see any necessity for this provision for I cannot see any case which will arise. I think it is a dangerous thing.  A person can make a bona fide mistake in giving information, or, on the other hand, can act maliciously.  In either case, it is bad.  In the running of an hotel there can be no necessity for this. The building can be inspected and the bedrooms and other rooms can be inspected. The Bill provides that price lists must be exposed in various places in the hotel.  Everybody can see them. If you are overcharged, you can say: &ldquo;This differs from the price list.  I am only going to pay the price on the list.  If you want any more you can <Col N="1296" /> sue me for it.&rdquo;  You can take a copy of the price list.  Where valuable property is involved, I do not think that this provision should be inserted and that the Minister should amend it either now or in the Seanad.</P>

There can be no question of overcharging. If a person wants to protest, the only time he can satisfactorily protest is there and then.  He can say that there was an attempt to overcharge. He has his bill and can keep it and produce the written evidence to the board.  I think the Minister is violating an important principle and that he will get very little for it.</P>

On principle, where valuable property is involved, it must be remembered that the remedy may be too late.  There is a danger here of doing many things by working in the dark.

      <P>This amendment gives the board authority, if it thinks fit, to omit premises from the printed list.  The amendment is intended to meet the case of establishments with select clienteles which desire to avoid publicity.

What will arise here will be mainly a question of charges, and the board, under the circumstances, might feel that the deletion from the board's publication of information as to charges might be for some purpose other than <Col N="1300" /> the desire to reserve the business to a select class of clients.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few remarks to make on the Fifth Stage. In discussing this Bill we have devoted attention mainly to hotels and their improvement.  In my opinion the hotels in this country have improved considerably during the last ten years. I think there are a number of hotels here which give you better value than you would obtain across the water for anything like the same price.  There are certain things that have an important bearing on the tourist traffic.  I think they do come within the powers that we have actually conferred on the board&mdash;at least some of them do, while others do not.  First and foremost, I should like to take the roads.  The road problem might not have been so important 20 years ago as it is now, but it certainly is a highly important problem now.</P>
      <P>I know a man who is in touch with tourist people.  I met him in town and he told me that he could not advise certain people to take their cars to certain tourist districts in this country as the cars, because of the roads, would probably come back wrecks.  If that sort of thing is going to continue I do not think you will develop what is an important side of the tourist traffic.  First of all, you have the improvement of the existing roads.  I think that is a more urgent problem than the grading of the hotels.  We have made an advance with the hotels, but I know of no country with such scenic attractions as ours that is so badly provided with tourist roads.  I expect it would involve the making of new roads.  I should like to stress that aspect particularly&mdash;the need for providing better roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another important matter. A certain form of tourist traffic is developing here and in England, and also on the Continent.  A man comes to this country and he does not bring his motor car.  He prefers to hire a motor <Col N="1304" /> car in the country.  I have heard very serious complaints of the type of motor car that is given to a tourist who all innocently hires a car of that kind.  He finds that the vehicle is not merely incapable of working, but almost endangers his life.  I am afraid the board has no power to deal with that, but possibly the Minister might look into it and see if he can increase their powers in order to cope with that aspect.</P>
    <P>I take it for granted it is the intention of the Government to develop the tourist traffic and advertise it.  There is a very peculiar advertising campaign going on at the present moment, a campaign of a distinctly negative character, so far as tourists are concerned. I have seen, in tourist districts here, signs put up that are calculated to keep certain tourists, who have money to spend, out of the country, and ten yards away from those signs indicating that we do not want their money, I have seen advertisements showing how delightful Scarborough and other places are.  I take it for granted that is not our policy. I do not know what can be done to prevent things of that kind, but they certainly are having a harmful effect.</P>
    <P>I presume the Minister knows about it.  It is a peculiar form of patriotism. It says to the Englishman, for instance: &ldquo;We do not want your money, but we have no objection to our people carrying our money over to you.&rdquo; Those are matters that the Minister might consider, as he is interested in this particular type of traffic.  I believe that the tourist traffic can be made a source of real wealth much more than it is at the present moment, but every effort will have to be made to develop it and not kill it.  I am afraid that some of the matters to which I have referred may tend to kill it.  Bad roads will certainly not help a better tourist traffic and the particular type of advertisement I have drawn attention to is not calculated to help in attracting people from outside, no matter from what country they may come.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>With what Deputy O'Sullivan said on the matter of roads, I am in complete agreement.  There <Col N="1305" /> can be no question about the importance of good roads, particularly in the tourist districts.  Of course, the provision of these roads is largely a matter of finance.  Any general plan for the development of the tourist business must take into account the roads just as it must take into account the railway services and the steamer services, and other forms of transportation for tourists, in addition to hotels and the general provision of holiday facilities.</P>
      <P>The matter of the suitability of cars available for hire is one that the board could give attention to.  They would have power to assist in the establishment of an agency.  I do not know would that power cover the establishment of an agency for this purpose, but I am quite sure that they could induce somebody to get into that business simply by undertaking to direct whatever business they could to the particular persons concerned.</P>
      <P>With regard to the advertisements, I understand that in Killarney some notices were painted up, the effect of which would be to discourage visitors coming to that district.  My information is that these notices were painted up by an individual who had been employed in some hotel as a waiter and had lost his job, and this was his way of getting his own back on his former employer.  Whether that is correct or not, I feel that the people of that district did not make their attitude sufficiently clear.  It would be quite easy for them to stop that type of nonsense if they fully realised how important it was for them.  Apparently they did not realise it.  If they are not prepared to co-operate fully in stopping that type of nonsense, I am afraid there is nothing the State can do to help them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a question which I cannot answer.  My point is that if the public attitude in matters of this kind is right, these things do not happen or, if they do happen, they will not be allowed to continue.  One individual can do much damage, but <Col N="1306" /> that damage can be repaired by the attitude of the rest of the community. There was one aspect of the Killarney incident which rather worried me. That was the apparent unwillingness of the community there as a whole to express their resentment, even though they must have realised how seriously it would affect the main business of that locality.</P>

      <P>Lest any harm might be done to certain firms arising out of Deputy O'Sullivan's criticism of the motor cars, and the inconveniences that tourists have to put up with, so far as Dublin is concerned I happen to know two or three firms who specialise in that business and I am aware that they keep extraordinarily good cars. One of them does probably the best business of any concern in Ireland in that line and I think its cars could hardly be bettered by a similar concern in any other country.  They are really wonderful people, they keep such excellent cars for that purpose.  A German gentleman who has been in Ireland during the last fortnight and who toured a great deal on business, not altogether pleasure, remarked to me again and again how wonderful our roads are.  He said that, apart from the new military roads in Germany, their roads on the average were not equal to ours.</P>

      <P>I am glad the Deputy intervened so far as the motor cars are concerned.  I am glad he intervened in order to allow me to clear that matter up.  I did not intend to make a general charge.  I know there are certain places in the country that are capable of providing excellent cars, just as there are high-class hotels to be found in many parts of the country. But there are institutions of which the opposite may be said.  As regards the roads, I think the Deputy gave the case <Col N="1307" /> away.  He said that the man was here on business.  I never said the road from here to Cork was not a good road, but go down to the tourist centres, go there for pleasure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>What Deputies fail to realise in the particular cases of the individuals who are fighting, and who have successfully fought the previous Land Act on this matter of the resumption of holdings is that these are generally the particular types to which I have alluded: people who owe a large amount of arrears to the Land Commission and who owe a large amount of rates as well, and who, if and when the holding is finally resumed, have nothing to get.  Those are the people who fight against it and who are the bitterest against it.  In addition, you have another trouble, and that is that those are the very people whose holdings are full of pests or vermin, of which we very often hear complaints here in the Dáil.  We hear loud complaints here in the Dáil from Deputies opposite about the rabbit pest and the rabbit plague; but just imagine the case of the unfortunate man with 30 or 40 acres of land alongside one of these derelict demesnes and who cannot grow any crop whatsoever on his holding because of these pests. He can clear the 30 or 40 acres of land, that he has already, of these pests, but I am hanged if he can do so if there are 500 or 600 acres alongside him derelict and over-ridden with vermin, and then, in addition to having to pay his own rates and annuities and the rates on the derelict land alongside him he also has to suffer the loss of having his crops eaten by these pests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputies opposite say that they are not against the resumption of holdings, they should look at this <Col N="1308" /> section which they are now opposing, and look at the manner in which their opposition here to the previous Acts succeeded in leaving loopholes for those people who were able and willing to take advantage of these loopholes. After all, I do not think there is any Deputy over there who wishes to see the man with the thousand or five hundred acres, employing, say, a man and a dog, being allowed to continue in this country.  I do not think anybody in this House wants to see that system continued, but if those Deputies succeeded in carrying such an amendment &mdash;and particularly to that clause as it stands&mdash;it is only going to bring us back to the old position in which we have been placed since 1935, when the taking over of land by the Land Commission proved to be a complete washout owing to the loopholes that were, unfortunately, found in a previous Land Act.  That is the position, and that is why I ask Deputies to withdraw their opposition to this section and let it go through.  They are endeavouring now by their action to force us back into the position in which we have been from 1935 up to the present moment, when the Land Commission, unless a holding was actually thrown to them, had to take their hands off and let such people keep their holdings, with the result that you have these unfortunate small holders down the country having to pay through the nose.  It is bad enough for a man to be looking down from the hill at the little farm he had long ago and seeing it in the hands of one of those ranchers, but it is worse still when, in addition to paying the rates and annuities for his bit of land, he must pay the rates and annuities for that fellow as well, and the Land Commission says to him that he must pay the extra rates in order to enable them to carry on.  Deputies opposite should let the section go through, in my opinion.  It will go through in any case, and they are only wasting time opposing it.</P>

If I were to reply to most of the points that have been made, it would mean a Second Reading reply, because all these points really were raised on the Second Reading.  However, in regard to this section, I did undertake to consider two amendments, and that is amendments Nos. 17 and 19.  I did not undertake to accept amendment No. 17 as it is, but said I would insert the provision under which we proposed to acquire land.  In connection with amendment No. 19, also, I did not say that I would accept the amendment put down, which wants us to state specifically what we actually do with the land, but said that I was prepared to insert something which would state the purposes for which the land is acquired, but not the particular and specific purposes on which the Supreme Court insisted and which, as I pointed out, might mean the actual mentioning of the names of the proposed allottees. For instance, if you had a crotchety judge, he might insist that detailed information of that kind was necessary.</P>

    <P>As I pointed out in connection with Section 17, there was never any intention&mdash;although I admit that the wording of that section would justify Deputies in saying that we did not intend to state the powers under which we <Col N="1310" /> were proceeding&mdash;but there was never any intention of not stating the powers under which we were proceeding.  The whole thing was that there was a positive case laid down that a definite specific section should be mentioned. There may be other sections under which we are entitled to proceed, and these will be mentioned.  I shall try to meet these two points.  With regard to the other point that has been mentioned, we debated that time and time again, and I do not think there is anything to be gained by repeating what I said on these three amendments.  The question of credit has been raised also, but I dealt with that on the Second Reading, too, and other Deputies over here dealt with that question very effectively.  In my opinion, the question of farmers' credit is entirely apart from this.  Of course, other Deputies may take a different view, but that is what I believe anyhow.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fionán Lynch mentioned a certain case.  I do not think he was quite sure yet as to the position or as to whether the holding was resumed, but in any case power was taken under the 1933 Act to take over land, even where the holding was well worked, if it was in a very congested area.  Power was taken in such a case to take the land, but if the person concerned was a farmer, residing on the holding and working it, he is entitled to other land of a certain value.  That is the position. I am not quite certain as to the case Deputy Lynch mentioned.  I have not the particulars of the case and do not know its circumstances.  It may be that this is a well-worked farm, but it may also be in a very congested area, or it may be that the holder is not a farmer but, perhaps, a business man residing on the farm.  As I say, I do not know the circumstances, but if the farm is being worked by a farmer who is residing on it, I doubt if the Land Commission would take it, except in such circumstances as I have mentioned. They might take a farm that was owned by someone that was not a farmer, such as a business man residing on it, or if there was very acute congestion in that district and if that particular farm was needed.  I do not want to be misunderstood and say they would not do a thing like that, because <Col N="1311" /> there is power to do it and they might do it and would do it in certain circumstances, but if he is a farmer he will be compensated by land up to a certain value; and if the land that is taken from him is worth more than that he will get the balance in bonds. I want that to be understood.  On the other points that were raised in the long debate, I would be taking up the time of the House repeating what I have already said.  I do not think there is any necessity to do that.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 40 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the significance of Section 40?  I take it that this relates to fee farm grants.  Is not that so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I had better explain that the object of this section <Col N="1313" /> is to enable the commissioners to use their diseretion in certain types of holdings&mdash;mainly holdings which may be in urban areas.  The best way to illustrate that would be to take a particular type of case.  As the law stands at present, if these particular lands are situated, say, in the City of Dublin, some of them may pass as agricultural land in character and must be admitted to the benefits of land purchase, and the State would make a considerable contribution.  These lands may be used afterwards for building purposes.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission has discretion in respect of tenancies created since 1923, but in the older cases they have not, and this is in order to bring the law into line and bring in the old cases and put them in the same position as the newer tenancies created since 1923.  There was one case where the applicant held 4½ acres at a poor law valuation of £14 15s., situated in the municipal boundary of Dublin. The rent was £21, and there was a lease for 91 years, dating from a few years ago.  The land consisted of one field with over 800 feet of extensive road front, on a very well-known road in the city.  This land was used purely as a cattle park.  There was a possibility of ruling that out on the ground that it was potential building ground, but that was repealed, and the case had to be admitted, with the result that a person became a fee-simple owner of this field and, instead of a rent of £21, paid only a revised annuity of £5 5s., based on the Land Commission's estimate of a fair rent.  I gather that the person who owns the land immediately built on it.  This is introduced in order to give the Land Commission discretion, when they meet this type of case, to reject the application, even though it may have been used by the owner as a cow park inside a municipal boundary.  If, of course, it was a genuine case, it would be treated differently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was another case in Dublin City, actually on a road which the tram passed and well inside the municipal boundary, and that was admitted with the result that the taxpayer has to pay for these people who had no intention at all of continuing to use <Col N="1314" /> that land as agricultural land.  If that tenancy had been created since 1923, the discretion was in the hands of the Land Commission but they have not in earlier cases.</P>

      <P>I cannot identify the case, and I am glad I cannot.  Do I understand from the Minister that, where application is made in such cases, the intention of this section is to enable the Land Commission to refuse, not to take the land from the person?  That is not the intention?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>On reading the section, it gives me the impression that when it is passed influence could be used either to have lands taken or have lands refused.  I do not like that. I think we should lay down general principles.  If somebody by an accident gets the benefit of the Land Acts, I do not think that that is going to break the State.  I do not think we should enshrine in this Bill powers to take all kinds of land and to take away rights from anybody so far as the law is concerned. We have the power, and we may take it, of course, that it will be reasonably exercised with regard to these cases, but I do not like, in principle, legislation to which Yes or No can be said, and which leaves it open to the implication that influence can be used to prevent the operation of the section.  On principle I am opposed to this section.  I think the number of cases that it will affect is very limited.  I may take it that the people referred to, and people of that class, are very few and apparently they were quick enough on the draw to get in and they are already in.  For that reason I do not think, on a question of principle, that this House should pass this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1315" /> There is no use in going into the history of this thing.  Those Acts were made to cover not one, two, or three. The whole thing was made to cover the class as a whole and not some section of a class.  In the case of a huge lot of land, involving all the land practically in this country, abnormal things of this kind will occur; but I think, in principle, this section should not be adopted.  I do not like it as it is, in its present form, and I think it leaves itself open to the construction that influence can be used to bring in one case and keep out another and in that way that influence could be used to include or exclude a piece of land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak with complete ignorance of the whole matter, but I know that town parks in small towns and villages have been excluded up to this.  I further know that these towns and villages are losing their populations, year after year, that they are becoming practically extinct as business centres and that the population are becoming more and more dependent on the land which has been defined as a town park in previous Acts.  I do not know how far this measure goes, if it goes any distance, towards relieving these people, but I certainly hope that this section will not be used to keep the people of little villages of 200 and 300 population, where business is practically gone and which are becoming purely rural, paying rent perpetually to a landlord who, in many cases, has gone out of the country altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious that the Minister should review this section. You will find that, in the vicinity of Cork City, where you have some land of the description referred to by the Minister, and in rural towns also, this section is used extensively by landlords to prevent the vesting of holdings.  I know the difficulty we had previously and I suggest that the Minister can <Col N="1316" /> get over whatever loss may be involved. When land changes its agricultural aspect, so to speak, and takes on the aspect of building ground, I know that in all cases in which subdivision has been applied for for building purposes, the full amount has to be redeemed, and I think that would practically cover any loss to the Land Commission.  I think it wrong, however, that a man who has seven, eight, or nine acres in the vicinity of a town or city, and who has been working that land as agricultural land, should now be prevented from getting the benefits of the Land Acts in respect of his holding, with the result that, if, at any period, it becomes building land, he can be made to walk out quietly while the landlord gets the benefit of any moneys which accrue, although that poor devil has been holding the bag for him for a number of years.</P>
      <P>I think some other means should be found by the Land Commission to get their money back off these holdings when they change from agricultural to building land, instead of preventing such an unfortunate man from getting the benefits of the Land Acts when he may have been working the land as an agricultural holding for 30 or 40 years. We had several cases of it, particularly outside Cork City, and, in all the cases, they got the benefits of the Land Acts. It would be very hard if they are now to be deprived of them, and I should like an assurance from the Minister in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that there are two points at issue on this section.  First, I want to make it quite clear that I agree with what Deputy Kennedy has said, that where a man has two, four, six, seven or eight acres within an area which can be classed as a potential building site, which he is using for purposes of husbandry or agriculture, he should get the benefit of the Land Acts.  The Land Commission, for various reasons, have excluded holdings of that type from the benefits of the Act.  If a man has a haberdashery shop, a public-house or a small vehicle, and also has this farm of land, the argument is that he is not dependent solely on agriculture, but surely, if he is working that farm as a farm, he is entitled to the <Col N="1317" /> benefits of the Land Acts.  It has been resisted and upheld in some cases, and admitted in others.  I think the section should be a little more clear and should give to these farmers&mdash;and I deliberately describe them as farmers&mdash; the benefits of these Acts.</P>
      <P>Again, I agree with Deputy Corry in his remarks on housing schemes, because it is arising every day.  It is very difficult to draw the line, and even in Dublin, as between what is the City of Dublin and what is outside it for building purposes.  If Deputy Belton has a farm out in Donnycarney direction and is working it according to the best methods of husbandry, that is, growing potatoes, bananas, wheat, and peas and beans, which were mentioned in the Fianna Fáil plan, if he is doing all the things he should do, and doing them well, or fairly well, and if he holds either by 11 months, which we know is a sort of tenancy, or on 12 months, which is an English tenancy, or in any way in which you could say he is a fixture, and if he applies to the Land Commission for the application of the Land Act to his case, I think he should get the benefit of the doubt.  I do not think there ought to be any question of it, because these men who are holding places like that&mdash;I have several pictures in my mind&mdash;are often subject to costs and expenses which are unusual.  Right within the urban area of Athlone, there are farms which are subject to the town rate and cannot get relief of rates under the Relief of Rates Act.  They have to pay the water rate, although they have no water, and the gas rate, although they have no gas, although they might think they had. Unless it can be shown that they are not potential building sites, they cannot get the benefits of the Land Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think there should be some power given; and not power only, but that there should be some statutory direction given to the Land Commissioners both lay and legal, that when such a representation is made, where the facts are fully ascertained that it should be made compulsory on the Land Commissioners to admit them.  That is my point, and I think we should not approve of this section because it does not exactly cover the point I am making.  As a matter of fact, this particular <Col N="1318" /> section can be used against them.  It is not for what is in it, but what can be made out of it that I am objecting to it.  It is like half-pay in the Army Act.  It was a privilege but it can be used as a penal measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Land Commission want is to get discretion and if they find the thing is bona fide I am sure they will not refuse to admit it. It is not a question of taking the land. It is a question of admitting these lands for the benefit of the Land Purchase Acts.  There is the question of halving the annuities.  Having got that then it becomes builders' land at the expense of the taxpayer.  What we are seeking in this section is the same discretion in respect of the old tenancies as the Land Commission has in respect of the tenancies created under the Land Act of 1923.  In the City of Dublin actually in one case, where the tram passed by a field it was found that this field was used for dairy purposes.  This person came in and because he was able to show that the field was used for grazing the Land Commission had no option but to admit it.  All I am asking is that the Land Commission should be put in the position of not being compelled to reduce these people's rents by three-fourths. Then immediately they subdivide this land for building purposes, and for one small plot in that land they will get paid more than they had been paying for the whole field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Except that we are satisfied that it will not be used against them.  That is the case I am making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the question you will have to leave to the Commissioners. We are seeking to get discretion.  I was perfectly shocked at some of the cases that went through and I am satisfied that if the Deputies here knew the type of cases admitted, for which this was never intended, they would understand the position better.  We must not put our hands in the taxpayers' pockets and enable these people to get away with this money. Then the land ceases to be agricultural land.  In this case I cannot guarantee that each particular case will be met, but I am asking that the Commissioners <Col N="1319" /> should not be bound to admit them.  I think, for this reason, the Deputy should withdraw his opposition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that, personally, I have great sympathy with what the Minister is endeavouring to accomplish. But has there not been an enlargement of Acts subsequent to the 1933 Act?  Has not the Minister been more generous in interpreting the type of land that should be admitted? Surely if in the City of Dublin a tram is passing a field, we have one picture. But I know the City of Dublin, and I cannot visualise a field by the side of which a tram is passing, that has not all the building services in very close proximity.  My understanding of that particular matter is that where you have services in close proximity, the land cannot be admitted.  It is not alone potential building land, but actual building land.  If this field in Dublin is not actual building land, possibly it is a low-lying field in which there is something that precludes it from being actual building land.  While I have full sympathy with what the Minister is endeavouring to accomplish, yet we must remember that this Bill is for the whole country, and the Minister may cause a hardship in other places that may unbalance the Bill.  He may be doing a hardship that he himself may not like.  It may be worth while considering the drafting of a stricter definition of actual building land. Surely if a tram is passing a field, one cannot visualise any field passed by a tram in Dublin that has not other services.  A bus might be passing a field in Dublin and it might not have building services.  I am sure when the Minister was speaking of a field by which a tram was passing, he was not thinking of the Blessington tram?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not.  The 1933 Act prohibited building sites, but that <Col N="1320" /> is no obstacle now, it is withdrawn. Even if a tram is passing by, and these services are there, still if it could be shown to be agricultural land in the case of the old tenancy, there is nothing but to admit it.  But we want to get discretion now.</P>

      <P>Why not have a stricter definition of what is actual building land?  Where you have actual building land according to your improved definition, cut it out and do not admit it.  Do it in that way.  I am so long away from country towns that I do not know the exact position now, but I am quite sure that the Minister will cause a lot of hardship in country towns if he lets this section go through as it is. He will create hardships that he does not see now.  There may be a field right in the heart of a country town. That may have been a field in our fathers' time and it may be a field in our grand-children's time, but if the Minister puts through this section he may leave that land in the way it is and not give it the advantage of the Land Purchase Acts, as was the intention of the Dáil.  I do not think the Minister is approaching this matter in the best way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to put up one particular case.  There is a phrase here: &ldquo;Not in the best interests of the country.&rdquo; Outside Carrigtwohill, ten <Col N="1321" /> miles from Cork, there is a holding. We got that in under the 1933 Act.  The owner objected because it was a potential building ground.  The owner lives in England.  The unfortunate widow who holds 12 acres of that land found herself in the position that we had to step in and take this land for the townspeople for building, and now we find that that woman will not get a bob out of it because it did not come under the benefit of the Land Acts. The landlord will get most of the money because that portion was not agricultural land.  If this section is included in the Bill the argument will be brought up that it is potential building ground and, therefore, should not be allowed in under the Act.  That is the position you will have.  To my mind, it would be far better if these holdings were left in the hands of the unfortunate people who have been working them for the last 20 or 30 years.  When these holdings change their character as agricultural holdings, I am sure a way can be found of recouping the State.</P>

If they do, then what I have to say will be a waste of time.  If they do not, I should like to make a case for a small place which I know.  It consists of nine houses, four of which are business houses.  A considerable portion of the land around that hamlet is defined under the 1923 Act as townparks and a big rent is still being paid to the landlord, who lives outside the country.

That would be a dangerous thing to do because we should have to generalise.  What we are seeking to do is to allow the commissioners to examine the different cases and to give them the right to admit cases which they think clearly ought to be admitted. If you state in black and white that a <Col N="1323" /> certain type of land should not be admitted, then a case which Deputy Corry or some other Deputy might have in mind as a suitable case for admission might be barred out.  A glaring case, which no member of the House would agree should come in, might arise.  If this provision be not made, you will be compelling the Land Commission to admit such a case.

In some ways I was specially amused at the opposition from the other side of the House.  In the case of the last section, Section 39, we had supreme confidence expressed in the Lay Commissioners. Here, where it is a question of giving discretion to the Lay Commissioners with an appeal from them, those Deputies are not satisfied at all.  How many of them expressed supreme confidence in the Lay Commissioners in the case of the last section and wanted no appeal from the Lay Commissioners to the Appeal Tribunal? Now when it is a question of giving a discretion to the Lay Commissioners with an appeal to the Appeal Tribunal, some of those Deputies are not satisfied. They have apparently lost the confidence in them which they expressed a few moments ago.</P>

      <P>I am rather puzzled to know whether the easements referred to here are easements that were appurtenant to untenanted land or <Col N="1325" /> whether they were easements enjoyed by adjoining tenants over untenanted land prior to its acquisition.  One can readily visualise the case of a farmer having a right of way over land that was untenanted land prior to its acquisition. That right was priceless to him and no compensation that would be offered to him would recompense him for the loss of it because there would be no possible way whereby he could get an alternative right of way, particularly if it were heard in the district that the Land Commission were paying him for the right of way of which he was being dispossessed.  If he were to seek a right of way on some adjoining holding, the price asked would be so inflated that he could not give it.  I should like to hear the Minister on this matter.  There are certain easements which money cannot buy, rights to water and rights to get to an outlying field with manure.  Nothing could compensate a man for the loss of such rights.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is required to enable the Land Commission to deal with bogs, for instance.  They find that when they have acquired bogs from the owners, certain people who have rights of grazing object to the bog being divided amongst people who have been given turbary on them. That has happened in one particular case in County Kerry.  The bog has actually been given to certain allottees but certain people who have grazing rights will not allow the bog to be used by these people.  The grazing rights are much less valuable than the turbary rights for the people of the district and the people who are being deprived of these grazing rights will be compensated.  This section is analogous to an earlier section in the Bill which dealt with lands on which there was a house which had been let and the Land Commission could not go ahead with the division of the land as they could not get possession of the house.  Similarly, in this case they cannot go ahead with the division of bogs owing to the existence of these easements.</P>

We have several cases in my county, where it was proposed by the Board of Works to carry out important works such as minor drainage works and reclamation works.

      <P>These are cases where a committee had bought land and the Land Commission under the 1927 Act got authority to take over these lands. They were often bought at very high prices.  The Land Commission resold the land to the tenants at what was considered a fair value for the land and the Department of Finance made up the difference.  It was considered that all these cases had been dealt with before the Land Act of 1936 but some further cases have since cropped up&mdash; I do not know how many.  On representations from Deputies on this side of the House this section was brought in to deal with these cases.</P>

      <P>I am just wondering whether the Minister is right in closing the back door that he is closing by virtue of this section.  This section repeals sub-sections (c) of Section 43 of the 1936 Act by which certain cases were able to take advantage of Section 44 of the 1931 Act.  There may not be very many of them.  There is, however, something to be said for continuing to allow in the type of case that could get in while the door was open.  Section 39 of the 1923 Act was often of very little value to the type of person who had been in arrears to his landlord for a number of years, as undoubtedly very <Col N="1329" /> many of them were.  In the particular case I have in mind you had arrears of rent over a period of six years. Decrees were obtained.  There was a stay put upon them pending the decision of the Land Commission.  If they came in under Section 39 they got the benefit of the section, but since under that section there is no provision for compounding arrears these unfortunate people could not get the benefit of it. The decrees were confirmed and were actually in the hands of the sheriff.</P>
      <P>I wonder whether it would not be as well to allow the door to remain open for the types of cases that were able to avail of it.  It was, I believe never intended that they should be able to do that, but certain cases did get through that door.  It would be of great value to those people if the Minister were good enough to say that he would consider them from the point of view of a revision of their annuities from which they were debarred as the sub-section stood.  It is a question whether he should not consider opening such a door, or otherwise reconsider Section 39 of the 1923 Act with a view to providing for the compounding of arrears.  If he does that, of course, it will be just as good.  It would have the effect of meeting the type of case that I have in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 22:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before paragraph (a) to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>an application under sub-section (1) of the said Section 44 (as amended by subsequent enactments) may be granted in respect of any parcel of land where the Land Commission is satisfied that <Col N="1330" /> such parcel is held by the owner under a grant or conveyance in fee simple under which is reserved or payable any perpetual yearly rent charge or other charge or rent being in the nature of a perpetual rent or rent charge.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows the kind of case I had in mind when I put down this amendment.  The amendment is directed really to amending Section 44 of the Land Act of 1931.  Deputies will remember that that section made provision for admitting within the purview of the Land Acts three types of cases: (1) fee farm grants; (2) leases for lives renewable for ever, and (3) leases of which 60 years, or more, had to run at the passing of the Land Act of 1923. My amendment would add one further type of case: that is land held in fee simple which is subject to a perpetual rent charge.  To all intents and purposes, that is really fee farm.  As a matter of fact, most persons, if asked to define what fee farm is, would say: it is fee simple subject to a perpetual rent.  The type of case that I want to get in is the case of fee simple holdings which are subject to perpetual rent charges.  I am not tied to the wording of my amendment.  As a matter of fact, I see very many objections to it myself.  Perhaps that is the result of being a bit versed in the law, but I would like the Minister to consider making provision for the type of case that I have in mind.</P>
    <P>The case is this: this was land which was sold in 1914.  It was fee simple land, and at that sale there was created a perpetual rent charge of £80.  The land was transferred in 1924 to the present owner.  He paid a very substantial sum for it&mdash;£3,500.  It is subject to this £80 of a perpetual yearly rent.  He applied under Section 44 of the 1931 Act as amended.  The Land Commission declared&mdash;I think rightly on a literal interpretation of the wording of the section&mdash;that he did not come within the purview of the Land Acts.  Now to all intents and purposes that owner is a fee farm grantee.  He holds this land subject to a perpetual rent change.  Now, the objection to the thing may be stated in this way: that these rent charges mostly arise <Col N="1331" /> from family settlements.  If some form of section could be drafted which would safeguard family settlements and at the same time allow in cases which can, by no stretch of the imagination, be called family settlements, it would meet my point.</P>
    <P>I agree that, as the thing stands, there is that objection to it, because it is a common practice in the country, although I myself think it is a most undesirable practice, to have these charges created.  I think it is undesirable, because I do not think land can bear them.  You have men in the country, fathers of families, who are fairly big owners of land, which they hold in fee simple.  A man has two sons.  He gives his fee simple holding to the elder son, and creates a charge on behalf of the younger son and his heirs.  That is where most of these rent charges normally arise.  I do not think that a practice of that kind is a very commendable one&mdash;I mean that kind of family settlement.  At the same time one cannot prevent it; but I do say this, that in these modern times I do not think land is able to bear that type of charge.  At the same time, one feels that it would be rather heartless to say to the younger son that the brother who got the land would be able to go in the next week to the Land Commission and have his income reduced by one-fourth, as would happen if he were allowed within the benefits of Section 44 of the 1931 Act. I have made the case against, as well as for, my amendment.  I want to put all my cards on the table.  I know the objections to the amendment, and I know the objection there is to bringing this type of case within Section 44 of the Act of 1931, but I think the Minister might consider restricting my amendment in such a way as to safeguard family settlements if he thinks it well, and at the same time to allow in cases which have no relation whatever to family settlements.  If the Minister could indicate that he would consider that between this and the Report Stage, I would be prepared to accept that assurance.</P>

I think it might be possible for the Minister, on the Report Stage, to bring in something in the nature of a sub-section which will cover the cases Deputy Lynch had in mind, possibly by restricting its operations to a specified time, or restricting it in some other way.  I know a couple of cases not covered by family arrangements; I know one case where the owner has been out of the country for the best part of a century, and the tenant could not come under the thing because of the perpetual rent-charge.  It would be covered by something like Deputy Lynch's amendment.  I should be glad if the Minister would look into the matter.</P>

I think it is a <i>bona fide</i> case, which should be dealt with.  If those cases referred to by Deputy Lynch could be classified where the owners of the charge were in the capacity of landlords, provision might be made as in the case of receivers of rents under fee-farm grants, but where there are charges upon settlements in the nature of discharge of debts, the difficulty I see is that we cannot prevent it.  If we make provision for that to-day, a new crop of family charges can be put <Col N="1333" /> on the books at once, and we will be confronted with them again.  I think if they could be segregated into classes, where the rent-charge is paid to a person in his capacity as landlord, provision could be made for them. Apparently Deputy Lynch is not quite clear as to whether or not the receiver of the rent-charge in his case is in the capacity of landlord.</P>

      <P>The trouble about this amendment is that it is hard to draw the line.  Deputy Lynch sees the difficulty. The most I can promise is that I will look into the matter to see whether there is any way of limiting the thing, but I do not think there is. If fee farm grants arise solely out of the letting of land or the use of land, those family settlements may be continued, and we do not know where we might be brought.  Of course, I cannot accept the amendment, but, as Deputy Lynch has asked me to see whether there is any limited way in which the matter might be dealt with, I will have it examined.  I do not think there is much hope.</P>

      <P>There was in the 1903 Act a provision whereby a farm could not be mortgaged beyond eight times or ten times&mdash;I do not know which&mdash; the annuity.  I do not know whether that is still the law.  Deputy Lynch, in the case he put up, expressed fear of the danger of burdening land with too heavy charges&mdash;more than the land could bear.  The only way to combat that would be for the Minister to put in a provision limiting the amount of charges that could be put on the farm.</P>

      <P>On the section, I should like to know what is the reason for the repealing of the provisions of paragraph (b) of Section 44 of the Land Act of 1931.  The same explanation would cover sub-section (f) (i) and (ii). I am very doubtful about the wisdom of that, where a receiver has been put in by a creditor or somebody else to liquidate a debt.  Where the Land Commission resumes land and deducts the redemption money, and then there is no money left or not sufficient money to discharge the debt which the receiver was there to liquidate on behalf of the creditor, does it not occur to the Minister that a very serious injustice might be done in that case?  Has that been fully considered?  What would justify such an injustice, I should like to know?  Certainly it would take a lot to convince me that it is right to put into statutory form something which would deprive a person of rights that existed prior to the passing of this Bill.  I think it would be a very drastic thing.  Take sub-section (b)&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If I explain the purpose of the section, we will be on clearer ground.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section was brought in very largely as a result of a case mentioned here several times in which, when the purchase money was allocated, the holder of the fee farm grant was left with practically nothing.  The effect of this is going to be a more equitable distribution of the purchase money between the landlord and the holder of the fee farm grant.  As the law stands, clause (b) of Section 44 of the 1931 Act provides that a person, in order to be admitted, must be in occupation and working the land in accordance with proper methods of husbandary.  If that is not the case, the Land Commission <Col N="1335" /> has no power to admit him, with the result that to proceed with acquisition would mean that the landlord would get away with everything.  We are amending that and providing that the Land Commission may admit the person to the benefits of the Land Purchase Acts and subsequently resume.  The result is going to be a far more equitable distribution of the purchase money between the two.</P>

This section would probably open the door for them now to come in.  I take it that nothing would be done pending the Land Commission's proceedings.  This gives them now the benefit of Section 44 of the 1931 Act.  I think it would be monstrous, if they put up the proposition now, that the Land Commission should walk in and resume.  Most of these persons would have no objection to the resumption of the holding if they got a fair price.  They could not possibly get a fair price as the law stood.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 23:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 47, page 27, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the Land Commission, on or in consequence of an application <Col N="1337" /> under sub-section (1) of Section 44 of the Land Act, 1931, has (whether before or after the passing of this Act) apportioned, under sub-section (2) of that section, the rent reserved by the fee farm grant or lease under which the parcel of land to which such application relates is held, then and in such case, if the other land comprised in such fee farm grant or lease and on which a portion of such rent has been so apportioned is entitled to be indemnified by such parcel of land against the whole or a part of such rent, the following provisions shall (in addition to such (if any) of the provisions contained in the next preceding section as are applicable) apply and have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  the Judicial Commissioner, on the application of the owner or owners of such other land and on notice to all parties interested, may make such provision, by way of a charge on such parcel of land or otherwise, as appears to him to be equitable for the preservation of the said right of indemnity;</P>
    <P>(b)  the Judicial Commissioner may at any time, on the application of any party interested, vary in any manner which appears to him to be equitable the charge created or other provision made by him under the next preceding paragraph of this section;</P>
    <P>(c)  the said charge (if any) created under this section on such parcel of land shall rank next in priority to the annual sum or annuity set up on such parcel of land in consequence of the said application under sub-section (1) of the said Section 44.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I had better explain the section. Take a case where a person had a fee farm grant and sold portion of his land to another person and indemnified the part of the land which he gave to the other person by the land he was retaining; that is, he left the land sold free of rent and indemnified that by his own land.  Then he subsequently applied to come under the provisions of Section 44.  As the law stands at <Col N="1338" /> present, the Land Commission, if they grant that application, will apportion the rent on all the land, including the indemnified portion, and the result will be that the person who held his land free of rent, indemnified by the land of the other person who had applied for the benefit of the Land Act, would be in the position of having to pay rent where he had been paying no rent. This section will enable the Judicial Commissioner in such a case to see that the indemnity is continued and to put a charge on the indemnifying land, that is, the land of the person who made the application.</P>
    <P>In clause (b) it may happen subsequently that a person whose land is indemnified also applies to come under the Land Purchase Act, and if that application is granted that person's rent may be reduced.  This enables the Judicial Commissioner, on the application of the owner of the indemnified land on which the charge was put, to vary the charge if the circumstances have changed.  The other clause deals with priority.</P>

      <P>I should like to hear the Minister's views on this section. A great injustice might be done to local authorities under it.  References were made to certain Acts that I have not looked up, and that I do not know the significance of, but if the Land Commission acquired land that belonged, say, to some of the parties Deputy Corry mentioned on the Second Reading, on which seven or eight years' rates were owing, the position is that the county council could only recover two years' rates.  I do not think the Minister is taking any power to alter that position.  If he is, it would save time and some effort on my part if he said so.</P>

      <P>If land is acquired compulsorily, and if rates are due, the percentage collectable is not a matter for the Land Commission.  That is a matter for the Department of Local Government.  Whatever rates are due are charged against the purchase <Col N="1339" /> money.  All we seek is to enable that to be done.  In the case of a voluntary sale, where a person would be giving land voluntarily, whatever amount of rates was due, he would agree to have charged against the purchase money.  We want authority to have that done.</P>

      <P>I would like the Minister and the Land Commission to bear this in mind, that the county councils blame the Land Commission, because, in most cases where rates are owing, land annuities also are owing.  If there are large arrears of rates, there will also be large arrears of annuities.  I have been harping at the Land Commission for years to deal with these holdings, but there is no sign of them doing it. There are many instances in County Wexford where there are arrears of rates and annuities going back 10, 12, and 15 years.</P>

The Deputy spoke at great length on various stages, and he said that the amendments put down here were directed to making work for the lawyers.  The very opposite is the case. The Bill that the Minister has brought in is directed towards opening up applications that have been closed down because of a legal decision.  Because of this Bill there will be ten times more <Col N="1344" /> work for the lawyers.  I am glad to be able to assure Deputy Corry that there will be ten times more work in the Land Commission Courts for us than there has been for the last couple of years since there were a couple of those decisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think Deputy Allen realises what can be done under this section with regard to that matter of the rates.  Where there is a voluntary sale, all arrears must be paid up to date of closing.  Where there is a compulsory acquisition, as the law stands only two years' arrears of rates are recoverable.  If the county council was awake and took legal proceedings and got judgment for all arrears due, and registered that as a judgement mortgage against the lands, then out of the purchase money of those lands those rates would have to be paid.</P>

      <P>What I am asking the Minister to do is to notify the county council of his intention to inspect a farm or farms.  That is the signal for the county council to look up the rate books and see how the rate position stands.  If they are very much in arrears, and if the county council looks after its business, it will take proceedings at once, get judgment, and register that judgment, and the county council will lose nothing.  All the arrears of rates will have to be paid, and the same result with accrue as if the law with regard to the limitation of two years' arrears was amended.  Of course, the two years' arrears apply only when the title of land changes.</P>

When lands are taken voluntarily all arrears are paid out of the purchase money, and when lands are taken compulsorily only two years' arrears are recoverable.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the persons from whom land might be resumed would have a particular grievance in the case of the redemption of drainage charges.  Drainage charges in a district are meant to be a general benefit, not a benefit for any particular farmer.  To mulct one farmer because a district needed drainage seems to be perfectly unjust.  Take the case of the owner of land on which there was a drainage scheme completed last year <Col N="1346" /> and the maintenance charges were arranged last year.  They might amount to a considerable sum.  The Land Commission might resume the year after the drainage was completed and the maintenance charge arranged. Out of the purchase money you are going to stop the redemption value of the drainage charge, which might run in some cases to hundreds of pounds, certainly to a good percentage of what is going to be got for the place.  I think it is completely unjust, and I do not think the Minister really can justify the section.  I know of several instances where drainage schemes have been completed within the last three or four years and there are very heavy maintenance rates as a result.  If, to-day or to-morrow, these farms were resumed and the redemption price of these drainage maintenance charges paid, it would run, in some cases, into hundreds of pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, maintenance charges for drainage schemes that are for the benefit of a district.  The farmer is compelled to fall in with the scheme, whether he likes it or not, and in many cases, in my district at any rate, farmers have resented it.  A man, for instance, might have been against the drainage system altogether from the first, because he would not be affected by it and would not get any benefit, but because he was in a minority he would have to agree and would have a drainage charge put upon him&mdash;a charge that he never asked for &mdash;and some of these are very heavy charges and, if they were to be redeemed after a year or so, it would amount to hundreds of pounds in some cases.  I think that this is altogether unjust.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to put a point to the Minister in connection with sub-section (1) (a) of this section. I do not know of any particular case, and I am only dealing with the clause in itself.  Surely, it is inequitable, where work has been done, which is going to be a continuing benefit, to charge that against one man when you are taking over his land.  I am not <Col N="1347" /> concerned at all as to whether a man agrees that drainage should be done or not.  What I consider wrong is that this should be treated as a capital sum of whatever drainage charges will be voted, whereas this is going to be a continuing benefit to whatever person will get the land.  As I say, I have no particular case in mind, as, apparently, Deputy Bennett has.  I am dealing with the principle of the thing, and on the face of it this clause seems to be grossly inequitable.  I think that the Minister should remodel it or recast it between this and the Report Stage.  Of course, it is following the practice with regard to the redemption of the purchase money, but the two things are not on a par at all.  You are putting a man out who is getting no benefit at all and you charge him on the purchase money as if he were getting the benefit, whereas the benefit is a continuing one, and is given for continuing purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no particular case in mind either, but I support the point made by Deputy McMenamin, that drainage is a continuing service and that, when the Land Commission buys the land, or whoever buys it, and gives it to anybody, they are giving that service over to these people and they should pay for it.  Take the case that Deputy Bennett mentioned&mdash;that a drainage scheme may have been carried out last year.  The full benefit of that scheme will not accrue for a number of years, and every year the benefit will be increasing.  Yet, you are asking the man who is going out to pay the capital cost of the benefit that is going to accrue to his successor for years to come.  That is not fair, and the market value of the land that is selling is not enhanced by that capital amount just now.  I think that in that case the purchase money should be left intact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a worse aspect of this matter than has been mentioned. If land is in a very bad condition, it must be bearing a small rate and a small annuity, and, therefore, the purchaser would get the benefit of that small rate and small annuity.  If the <Col N="1348" /> land is going to appreciate, the increased value should be put on the man who is buying it and going to occupy it for the future and get the benefit of it.  It would be utterly unjust&mdash; although it might be easy from the book-keeping point of view&mdash;to saddle the man who is going out with what he has derived no benefit from, while the man who is buying the land must be buying it while it is bearing a small annuity and a small rate and is also getting all the benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can put a case where the rent includes the drainage charge and the drainage is carried out by the landlord, and I do not agree with the other Deputies who have spoken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a question of the landlord, but of drainage done by the Board of Public Works or by the Land Commission or anybody else. Let us say that there is a drainage maintenance charge for drainage that is done to-day.  I could give several instances of such schemes.  There have been wholesale drainage schemes down in my county.  I do not know if Deputies from other counties are as careful as we in Limerick are with regard to the carrying out of drainage schemes, but we have had many of them, and some have been completed within the last three or four years. Deputies may not know what occurs in these cases.  A vote of the whole district is taken.  Some people have been against these schemes because they said that they had got no benefit whatever from the drainage, and in many cases it is problematical if they did get any benefit, because their holdings may be a good bit away from the river, but they are brought into the scheme whether they like it or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is possible that they might make a good case showing that they had not benefited by the drainage.  As a matter of fact, they are making complaints of that nature every day to the county councils in order to try to get out of it.  Now, these drainage charges may be very heavy, amounting to £30 or £40 perhaps where land has been drained within the last two or three years, and yet you ask a man to redeem that charge of £19 or £20 or £30 <Col N="1349" /> annually out of the purchase price.  I think it is unjust, and it would eat up the resumption price.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKennedy" hpid="Mr. Kennedy Mr. Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make one point.  I know of drainage schemes that have been carried out where the land was useless previously.  Take the Awbeg scheme, near Buttevant.  Anybody who travels down there can see the improvement that has been made in that land.  Naturally, when the Land Commission come along to value that land they value the improved land, and I think that I certainly would not agree that the man going out should have to pay for the future maintenance of that scheme.  I think that would be unfair.  It speaks here of the drainage maintenance charge, and I do not think that the man going out should have to pay for the future maintenance of a scheme which would be conferring a benefit, not on him, but on the man coming in.  I see that point, but I certainly think that the man going out should pay something for the improvement caused in that land by the drainage scheme which increased its value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>But he had paid it in the previous maintenance charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my point.  Take the Awbeg scheme, to which I have referred, where the county council and the ratepayers subscribed £12,000 towards the improvement.  The ratepayers of the county paid two-thirds of the money, and only one-third of the money fell on the land holders. Anybody travelling from Cork to Dublin, along there outside Mallow, and comparing the land with what it was some years ago, can see the improvement in that land, which at one period was a complete swamp.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1350" /> Twelve or fourteen years ago it was valueless but if the Land Commission go in there to-day and value it, it is worth at least £1 an acre.  Surely that valuation is going to be put on improved land, for which this man has already paid very little or nothing.  As a matter of fact, I think the drainage scheme has now been carried out seven years and last year was the first year they had to pay anything.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>If the value of that land has been increased by that drainage scheme, surely the man is going to get an increased sum and should pay at least some of the drainage costs.  I agree that he should not be asked to pay for the future maintenance of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe if I were to intervene I could clear the matter up. This is a case where land has been taken from the owner and out of the purchase price the drainage charge will be redeemed and the incoming tenants will be relieved.  But the annual drainage rate, where there is a new scheme, will not be affected.  It is a question of where there was a drainage charge on land and the lands have been acquired for distribution amongst tenants, that charge is required to be redeemed out of the purchase money, so that the tenants will not be saddled with the charge.  Instead of putting a burden on the tenants in this case, it is relieving them.</P>

After all, the new tenants coming in are going to get the benefit of what he is being made to pay for.  It does not seem to be fair. I think a case has been made against this section, and the Minister ought to reconsider it.  It does not matter whether it is being given to one or distributed amongst a number or being given over to a new purchaser, it seems to me unfair that the outgoing man&mdash; the vendor he will be called in this case&mdash;should be made to foot the bill for all the future maintenance of this drainage until it is fully discharged.

      <P>Deputy Lynch is a very powerful advocate of certain aspects of tenant rights and so on.  I feel that under this particular section <Col N="1353" /> that again the question of fact must be taken into consideration by the Land Commission, and when the subtenant has applied to have his holding declared an agricultural holding within the meaning of the section and Section 44 of the 1931 Act, when the Land Commission or the Land Commission tribunal have heard the case and have heard the facts, that that applicant by his own sweat and blood and tears has redeemed that little parcel of land, that little six or seven acres that he is living on, notwithstanding the fact that it may incommode a big holding or a big tenant of the Land Commission, they should admit that above all considerations.  This is an application by sub-tenants of holdings to have particulars furnished, and, conversely, to have them declared agricultural holdings: is not that right?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy was asking me for some information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am making the case for application under this section.  Deputy Lynch has tried to tell me that I am not in order, but I do not take it from him, or the Minister either.  I will take it from you, Sir, whenever you rule accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold that, where a tenant has held for, say, 20, 30 or 40 years&mdash;again I will go back to &ldquo;Knocknagow&rdquo;&mdash;and has redeemed or reclaimed his little holding of 6, 7 or 10 acres, or whatever it is, out of the bog, and has paid his annuity fully&mdash;not to the Land Commission, but to the tenant owner who already holds under the Land Commission, the Land Commission should be compelled to admit that case.  I do not want to stress it any further than that.  The argument may be answered by saying that there are several other ways of getting over the difficulty, but I want it to go down on record here that I stand for that principle, that where a man has redeemed or reclaimed 6 or 7 acres of bog and has <Col N="1354" /> reared a family of fine children on it and has made a good living on it for himself and his wife and family, he should get the benefit of the Land Acts, that that holding should be declared an agricultural holding, and that the Land Commission should be compelled to grant the application.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is to provide for that.  Where a person who made a letting has not furnished the particulars and is trying to obstruct, such a person as a Deputy has been speaking about can furnish the particulars himself.  As far as compelling the Land Commission, we cannot say we will compel them: they will have to go into the merits of every case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There would not be the slightest question about that, but we must not compel them in a particular case.  They have to decide that themselves. This is to deal with a case of that kind, by providing that where the person who makes the letting has not furnished the particulars, the tenant himself can do it.  That was not provided for before.</P>

It would take very little to do it.  Perhaps a judicious sowing of bent would give a little relief, and I am sure that the local authority would gladly co-operate, and I think the town landlords would co-operate also.  The town I have in mind is <Col N="1357" /> Skerries, in my constituency, and I would suggest to the Minister that where a town suffers from drifting sand that accumulates owing to peculiar currents of wind, he should take it within his purview.  If nobody else does it he could take it and deal with it and, if he had too much to do, he could then ask to be relieved by the Minister for Industry and Commerce or by the Board of Works&mdash;whichever would be the proper authority.  By a happy coincidence we have the Minister for Finance here at the moment.</P>

      <P>You might say that one small town has, I believe, been practically saved, but the object of the Land Commission was to save land from being submerged.  The town I mean is that of Dunfanaghy, in Donegal, which had been nearly destroyed altogether.  Owing to the sand fixation and the operations of the Land Commission, the village was saved.  That was incidental, but I am quite sure that if Skerries, or other towns, want that done, and if the county council, or whatever authority has control, ask for advice and help, the Land Commission will be glad to give it.  It would, however, be too much to ask them to extend their activities to all towns.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal reason for the introduction of the Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Bill is to give the Minister power to suspend the provisions relating to the maize meal mixture. When the main Act was introduced in 1933, it was provided in that Act that the Minister would prescribe a certain percentage of home-grown grain to be mixed by the maize millers.  The reason for the introduction of these provisions at the time was because there was a considerable amount of barley and oats in the hands of the farmers throughout the country.  There was no ready market for the buying of oats because it was difficult to export it at the time on account of the tariff on oats and barley going into Great Britain.  The mixing of oats and barley with maize commenced in October, 1932.  At that time the farmers were in many cases doubtful of their ability to grow wheat, if they wanted to grow it as a cash crop.  A tariff had been imposed on imports of oats and barley <Col N="1361" /> into Great Britain.  This method of the absorption of grain seemed to be the only solution at the time.  That is the difficulty we were up against.  No other solution was suggested at the time or since to meet the situation we had to face.</P>
      <P>When the Act came into operation in May, 1933, the percentage of home-grown grain in the mixture was raised from 10 to 15; in July, 1933, it was raised to 25 and in the same year in October to 33?.  The percentage reached its peak in December, 1935 when it stood at 50.  It remained at that high level until October, 1936 when it began to decline.  It came down to 33? after October, 1936.  For two years now it has averaged under 14.</P>
      <P>The first matter one might be inclined to consider when introducing this Bill is whether the scheme conferred benefits on the corn growers. To get an idea of that, I want to give the House a picture of what was the surplus grain farmers had some years previous to 1933.  If we take the four or five years previous to the introduction of this Bill in 1933, we find that the normal sales of grain were about 1,000,000 cwts. of barley and 1,600,000 cwts. of oats.  Barley had been grown principally for malting and oats was sold for feeding to horses in towns, for racehorses and for milling into oatmeal by the oatmeal millers.  In addition to the 1,000,000 cwts. of barley used in that way, and 1,600,000 cwts. of oats used inside the country, about 900,000 cwts. of oats were exported. But it was found to be impossible to carry on those exports then on account of the tariffs.  In addition, there was the question of the very poor export prices on the English market at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of acres, 50,000 acres of barley and 125,000 acres of oats, of which 45,000 acres were exported, were grown for sale.  The ordinary methods of absorption were still there as far as the internal market was concerned.  A certain amount of barley and a certain amount of oats were taken up.  A certain amount of oats was used by the oatmeal millers, a certain amount of oats was used for feeding horses in the towns and for racehorses.  Over and above that, the maize-meal mixture&mdash;for <Col N="1362" /> the six years from 1933 to 1938, inclusive, during which the maize-meal mixture was in operation&mdash;accounted for about 300,000 acres of each, or 50,000 acres per year.  That is to say, 300,000 acres of barley were grown for sale and 300,000 acres of oats were grown for sale, in addition to the ordinary things I have mentioned. That was an average of 50,000 acres each in these six years.  For the last year the amount was very much lower than 50,000 acres of barley and oats.  The amount absorbed by the maize-meal mixture in 1938 was 20,000 acres of barley and 33,000 acres of oats.</P>
    <P>That was the effect the maize-meal mixture had on the absorption of oats and barley in our market.  It had another effect also.  It absorbed this grain at very much better prices than would have been available had not these provisions been there.  To give an idea of the percentage of price increase, I will give the figures for oats here and in Northern Ireland during the period.  I can only give the figures published here and in Northern Ireland. In 1933 our farmers got 2/9 more for their oats than the farmers in Northern Ireland; in 1934 they got 1/7 more; in 1935, 1/8; in 1936, 2/-; in 1927, 1/2.  I have not got the figures for 1938, but the margin is, I believe, smaller than it was in the other years. Now there is no tariff.</P>
    <P>Another question that is sometimes debated and another thing that is, in fact, alleged, is that the proposals embodied in the cereal legislation of 1933 did not have a salutary influence on tillage.  As a matter of fact, our tillage increased between 1931 and 1938 by very large figures.  In 1931 we had 160,000 acres less under cereals than in 1938.  The amount of wheat grown increased by 210,000 acres, the amount of barley increased by 2,000 acres.  There has been a very big decline in the acreage under oats for many years.  During the ten years previous to 1931 there was a decrease of 210,000 acres under oats.  For the last six or seven years the decline has been 52,000 acres.</P>
    <P>Now I will take the figures in another way.  I have given what is the increase in acreage under cereal <Col N="1363" /> crops for the last six or seven years, and I have also given an idea of the prices paid here for oats as compared with the prices in Northern Ireland. There is one other figure from which might be gained, perhaps, a better idea of the benefits conferred on the country in general, and especially on the farmers, by the cereal legislation introduced in 1933.  The cash received by the farmers who sold their grain crops before 1933 would be about £1,000,000 per year, putting barley at 7/- per cwt. and oats at 5/6 per cwt. During the years 1932 and 1933 the farmers received almost £2,000,000 each year.  Since then their receipts have exceeded £3,000,000 each year.  It must be remembered also that in addition to these receipts there has been another addition.  In these last few years 60,000 acres of wheat were used by farmers in their own households. That is equivalent to a large amount in cash to these farmers.</P>
    <P>I have already announced my intention to suspend the maize meal mixture at the end of this cereal year.  In order to do that this Bill is required, and it is necessary to have it passed by the Dáil before the session ends, because the necessary order will have to be made about the end of August. Although the scheme has conferred great benefits on grain growers I think we can suspend it now.  Seeing that it has conferred benefits on grain growers the question might be asked&mdash;why discontinue it now?  Well that is because we can do so without inflicting any great hardship on grain growers.  In the first place, farmers have been growing less and less oats and barley for the maize meal mixture.  For the last two years the percentage of oats and barley in the maize meal mixture has been less than 14 per cent., while it reached 50 per cent. during the first three years after the scheme was put into operation.  In the next place the price that can be realised for oats and barley on a free market without the maize meal mixture is much closer now that it was three or four years ago. In the next place, it is generally recognised by the farmers throughout the country that they can grow wheat as a good alternative cash crop.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1364" /> There is admittedly opposition to the removal of this mixture scheme.  During the previous debates here on the Agricultural Estimates some Deputies spoke against the advisability of having the scheme removed. There is the natural divergence of interest amongst the farmers between grain growers and feeders It is rather difficult to decide which is right and which is wrong, but if this Bill be passed now, the Order removing the provisions would not be made until about the end of August.  It is possible for any interested party to put up an alternative scheme or to seek the opinion of the Commission on Agriculture on the question, and I should be very glad to consider an alternative scheme put up by the Commission on Agriculture or by any other body of persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The acreage of barley is, probably, slightly down, and the acreage of oats is also, probably, down, so that there should not be any great difficulty about the disposal of the grain.  I should also say that this scheme does not alter in any way the wheat scheme, because the wheat scheme appears now to have the support of all Parties and may, therefore, be regarded as permanent national policy.  If there is a further tendency to decline in the acreage of oats, some alternative schemes must be sought, and if no alternative scheme can be found, we shall have, in a year or two years, to consider the reimposition of the maize-meal mixture scheme.  As regards barley, I am told by the maize millers that they intend to purchase barley for milling if this scheme is removed, as they do in England and in the North of Ireland, where the millers buy it and mill it into barley-meal, <Col N="1365" /> which they sell as a feeding stuff.  I hope there will be barley available for that purpose because, if barley were to disappear altogether as a feeding stuff, the quality of our bacon would suffer very much.</P>
      <P>The Bill is rather complicated. There are many references to sections of other Acts, and I should like to give a short explanation of each section. Section 1 is self-explanatory.  Section 2 is introduced for the purpose of altering the definition of &ldquo;Compound feeding stuff&rdquo;.  In the original Act, &ldquo;compound feeding stuff&rdquo; included medicine used for animals.  That is being changed so as to exclude medicine used for animals, because we found it impossible, in practice, to administer that part of the Act which referred to medicines.  In future, we do not intend to try to deal with proprietary medicines manufactured in this country but only with proprietary feeding stuffs.</P>
      <P>Section 3 has five sub-sections and deals with the suspension of the maize meal mixture.  Sub-section (1) gives the necessary power to suspend the maize meal mixture provisions.  Sub-section (2) gives power to revive that scheme, if thought necessary.  Sub-section (3) suspends the register of maize millers and sub-section (4) gives the necessary power to restore the register, if necessary.</P>
      <P>Section 4 suspends the provisions relating to all compound feeding stuffs made within the country.  As I pointed out, Section 2 deals with the importation of compound feeding stuffs.  This section deals with the manufacture of compound feeding stuffs within the country and removes many of the existing restrictions.  In fact, we shall go back and rely on legislation passed many years ago&mdash;the Feeding Stuffs Act&mdash;under which the declaration of the analysis as regards albumen, carbohydrates and fat may be demanded. That is all that may be asked for henceforth.  The other sub-sections of Section 4 give the right to re-impose these restrictions, if thought necessary.</P>

      <P>On many of these feeding stuffs there is no duty.  It is mostly a case of prohibition.  Soya beans are, however, subject to duty.  Section 5 deals with the importers of maize and is drafted in much the same way as the <Col N="1367" /> provision relating to maize millers. Section 6 refers to the laying of Orders on the Table and is the same as the provision which appears in many other Acts.  Section 7 is a re-drafting of a clause which appears in the previous Act which was thought to be defective by the Revenue Commissioners.  Otherwise, there is very little change.  Section 8 is introduced because there was some difficulty about the provision of <Col N="1368" /> ships' stores.  It provides that, where a ship is getting in stores, the prohibition of imports will not apply.  Section 9 refers to the citation of the relevant Acts.</P>
