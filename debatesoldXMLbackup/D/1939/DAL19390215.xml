      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he has received complaints from customers of boot and shoe salesmen in Clonakilty as to the quality and price of children's shoes manufactured in Éire; and, if so, if he has made inquiries in the matter; and if he can take any steps to secure that a better quality shoe at the price charged be provided for native wearers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>One complaint as to the wearing quality of a particular pair of children's shoes was received by my Department from a resident in Clonakilty. Enquiries were made into the matter, but in the absence of evidence it was not possible to reach any definite conclusions.  With regard to the last part of the Deputy's question, I am not prepared to accept an isolated complaint which was not substantiated as proof that footwear of Irish manufacture is defective in quality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, would it not in this particular case be sufficient evidence that a pair of children's shoes bought on the 1st December had to be sent back to be re-soled on the 14th December, exactly 14 days after being purchased?  Surely the Minister knows that no person would send shoes to be repaired in this way unless they badly needed repair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I have definite information, and I have here in my hands correspondence from the manufacturers, Messrs.  Rawson and Sons, with their customer.  Is it not plain that that is sufficient evidence for any person to know that the shoes were re-soled 14 days after being purchased? Should not the Minister realise that if this is going to be allowed to continue, this one will not be the only complaint?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the date on which representations were last made to the British Government in connection with the proposed reciprocal arrangements for the payment of benefits under the Unemployment Insurance Acts; if the British Government has refused definitely to enter into reciprocal arrangements, or if they are prepared to do so only under certain conditions; and, if the latter, whether he will state the conditions under which the British Government are prepared to enter into such arrangements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Proposals for reciprocal arrangements in connection with unemployment insurance between this country and Great Britain were examined by representatives of both countries in a conference held in London in 1931.  The examination revealed grave difficulties in the way of such an arrangement.  The representatives of Great Britain undertook to give consideration to proposals which were formulated. No reply was received, however, to a despatch which I caused to be sent in 1932 requesting information as to any decision which the Government of Great Britain may have reached.  Formal negotiations in relation to this matter have not been undertaken since.</P>

Am I now to understand that that is not so and that no such representations were made at all after or since the London Agreement?</P>

While this is the only Official Import List description in which the term &ldquo;Flour Improver&rdquo; is used, an examination of the Official Import List headed &ldquo;Chemical Manufactures and Products n.e.s.&rdquo; shows that there were approximately 1,750 cwts., valued at £5,600, imported in the year 1938 described generally as &ldquo;Bread Improvers.&rdquo; In addition, acid calcium phosphate and acid sodium phosphate preparations are now manufactured in a plant in this country.</P>

Mr. Pitt has been resident in the urban area of Wexford only since the 24th December last and he does not, therefore, fulfil the residence qualification.

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have, in recent years, received complaints from time to time regarding flooding on certain lands adjoining the Dunderry River.  as part of the river referred to is a scheduled work in the final award for the Dunderry drainage district made by the commissioners on the 8th October, 1907, the responsibility for its maintenance is, under the provisions of the Drainage and Improvement of Lands Act (Ireland), <Col N="388" /> 1863, a matter for the Dunderry Drainage Board.  Section 2 of the Drainage Maintenance Act, 1924, empowers the commissioners to execute such works as they shall consider necessary for the effective repair of the drainage work of the district, and Section 4 (1) of that Act empowers the Minister for Finance to make a free grant towards the cost of such works.  However, pending the findings of the Drainage Commission, which is reviewing the drainage problems of the country as a whole, no further works under this Act are being undertaken.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As will be seen from the face of the Estimate, this amount arises under various sub-heads, including that of grants to newspapers and periodicals published in Irish or publishing current news in Irish.  So far as that sub-head is concerned, the additional amount now asked for arises out of a decision to subsidise a fortnightly paper called <i>Eire Og</i>, to be published by the Christian Brothers and issued in conjunction with the publication, <i>Our Boys.</i>  The subsidy will be to the extent of £30 per issue, with a possible maximum of £800 in a full year.  There is an offset to the increased cost under that sub-head, due to smaller payments than were anticipated in respect of subsidies to other periodicals publishing news in Irish.  Under sub-head H, £500 additional is required to meet increased demands for various items of printing from Government Departments <Col N="401" /> generally.  Under sub-head I, an additional sum of £6,000 is required for paper.  There has been a very marked increase in the purchase price of paper in the present financial year.  An increase was anticipated, but it has proved larger than was originally estimated.</P>

    <P>The purposes for which this money is required are set out in Part III of the Estimate.  By far the larger part of the requirement&mdash;£861 12/&mdash;arises out of the practice whereby the Revenue Commissioners, when dealing with deeds and other instruments for public departments, stamp them without requiring payment, at the moment, of the duty thereon.  It has been the custom to make these payments for stamp duty from the Contingency Fund and, at the end of the year, when the amount of the indebtedness to the Revenue Commissioners has been ascertained, to recoup the Contingency Fund for the amount so paid.  The sum required is £861 12/- under this head. <Col N="402" /> This is an additional sum of £212 17s. 6d. required as expenses in connection with the installation of the President.  The other items are those which generally occur&mdash;bounties in respect of triplets and an item of 10/-, recoupment of the motor taxation account in respect of a motor driving licence issued free of charge to a member of a foreign Government who desired to have the use of a car for one day.</P>

      <P>The Department of Posts and Telegraphs consider that the accommodation for broadcasting purposes in the General Post Office is inadequate.  As a result of increases of staff, more office space is required, and in consequence of the development of programmes, larger studios, rehearsal rooms, etc., are needed. Moreover, the accommodation now occupied by the broadcasting service in the General Post Office properly belongs to the accountants' branch of the Department, and as there are pressing demands for space in that branch, the broadcasting service will have to be removed therefrom.  Advantage has been taken of the opportunity to acquire suitable premises in Exchequer Street, portion of which will house the broadcasting service, and for that purpose the Supplementary Estimate is being introduced.  The amount of £7,260 originally voted in 1938-39 for the purchase of sites and buildings will be fully expended before 31st March, 1939, but there will be sufficient savings on sub-head B&mdash;New Works, Alterations and Additions&mdash;to meet the portion of the purchase price in respect of the broadcasting service.

      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1939, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will have noted, there are three sub-heads under which additional provision is necessary&mdash;Sub-head J, New York World Fair, 1939; sub-head L, Minerals Exploration, and sub-head N, Prices Commission.  I shall deal with the three items in order.  In connection with the New York World Fair Vote, the additional provision arises firstly from an increase in the amount necessary to provide Irish pavilions at the Fair and, secondly, from the fact that portion of the total payment which we anticipated would not be necessary until next year will fall to be met in this year.  That is, in a sense, only a book-keeping transaction and the corresponding amount to be voted for 1939-40 will be reduced in consequence.  The plans made for our participation in the New York World Fair provided for two pavilions. The first, which has a floor space of 5,000 square feet, will contain exhibits of an historical and cultural character and exhibits showing development in Ireland in the economic, educational, social and other spheres during the past 15 or 16 years.  The shell of that building has been placed at our disposal by the Fair authorities, but the Irish Government must bear the cost of interior decoration, the provision of transport, the installation of exhibits, staffing and experts' fees, lighting and other operating charges.  The expenditure <Col N="407" /> under this heading is estimated at £15,000.</P>
    <P>The other pavilion, which has a total floor space of 9,000 square feet, is being devoted to trade interests.  It will contain, in addition, a comprehensive tourist information bureau and exhibits covering industrial products for which there is an actual or potential market in the United States.  Part, and in two or three cases the whole, of the cost of the exhibits in that pavilion will be borne by the firms concerned.  Even so, the public expenditure in respect of the second pavilion was estimated at £35,000, made up of £11,000 for the construction of the pavilion itself and £24,000 to cover the cost of decorating, staffing, transport, insurance, lighting and other operating charges. Altogether, the expenditure in respect of the two pavilions was originally estimated at £50,000.  The Estimate of £11,000 for the cost of constructing the second pavilion has, however, been exceeded.  Although the Estimate originally made by the Department's architectural advisers, on the basis of the approved design, was well within that sum, the actual cost of the building will amount, on the basis of the contract which has now been signed, to nearly £21,000.  That excess must necessarily involve some revision in the total cost as originally estimated. It is now estimated that the total expenditure will be £62,400, rather than £50,000.</P>
    <P>As I explained, since the Estimates were framed it has transpired that in addition to making provision to cover the extra cost of the second pavilion, provision will also have to be made in the current year to meet an expenditure which it is now felt will come within the course of payment within the year and not during next year, as anticipated originally.  It is, therefore, necessary to make provision for a sum of £37,400, that is £17,400 in excess of the original Estimate.  It is hoped that a sum of £25,000 will be sufficient to cover all the expenses during the year 1939-40.  The total cost, as I have stated, will not exceed £62,400, but contributions from firms, who have rented <Col N="408" /> space in the trade pavilion, are expected to yield £2,400, making the net cost of Ireland's participation £60,000.  The contributions from these firms are not being credited against the cost of participation but are being treated, as Deputies will notice, as Appropriations-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>The increased expenditure for minerals exploration arises also under two headings.  In the current year's Estimate, provision was made for the expenditure necessary to carry on a scheme of exploration of gypsum deposits in the Carrickmacross-Kingscourt area.  The work began in February last and is expected to be near completion at the end of this financial year.  The work comprises a number of borings which are being carried out by an Irish firm under the supervision of a resident mine manager appointed by, and responsible to, my Department, and acting under the direction of a firm of consulting mining engineers employed by us.  The amount provided in the Estimate, £5,500, was intended to cover consultant's fees, travelling expenses, mine manager's salary, boring expenses, analysts' fees, land damage compensation and other incidental charges.  The additional provision is required as portion of the programme which it was hoped to have carried out by the 31st March, 1938.  The total estimated expenditure is now given as £8,500, £3,000 of which was provided in 1937-38 and the balance in the current year.  The actual expenditure amounted approximately to £400 only, and it is necessary, that of the unexpended balance, £2,600, a sum of £1,000 should be revoted in the current year, as supplementary to the amount of £5,500 already voted.  I may say that the results of the borings to date have been highly satisfactory and there is every reason to believe that the final results of the investigations will prove that in that area&mdash;Carrickmacross-Kingscourt&mdash;there is an extensive deposit of high-grade gypsum suitable for use in a variety of industries.</P>
    <P>The second item of new expenditure under this sub-head relates to the proposed grant to the firm of Messrs <Col N="409" /> Flemings' Fireclays, Ltd., towards the cost of borings for coal to be made near the Swan, Athy.  That firm holds a lease under the Mines and Minerals Act of 1931.  The available geological evidence warrants the assumption that seams of anthracite coal underly the strata in the area of the company's lease.  The company claim, in fact, that the area is the centre of a coal basin and that the thickness of the coal seam at the outcrops indicates that a reasonably good seam will be found in the centre of the basin.  The Department's geological advisers are uncertain that the underlying seams will be found to be of workable thickness, but they agree that this can only be established by means of sinking boreholes, and, in fact, it has been long contemplated by my Department that any exploratory scheme in connection with the minerals of the northern part of the Leinster coalfield would include the sinking of a number of bores in the area now held by Messrs.  Flemings' Fireclays, Ltd. In the circumstances, I am disposed to assist the company to explore the coal deposits of the area, all the more so because, if some workable thickness were discovered, I understand that the company, who are already established on the site, propose to develop the deposits.  The question of the proposed grant has accordingly been discussed tentatively with Messrs.   Fireclays, Ltd.  It has been made clear to the company that the whole cost of any exploratory work carried out would not be borne by the State, and that the only acceptable arrangement would be one under which the expenses would be shared by the company on a contributory basis.  As a result of these discussions, an arrangement has been come to whereby some three boreholes will be sunk.  These will be sufficient to dispose of the difficulty at present felt by the Geological Survey.  There is no intention of sinking, at Government expense, boreholes such as would be necessary for large-scale investigation of the commercial possibilities of the coal in the leasehold area.  If these are undertaken, they will have to be at the company's own expense.</P>
    <P>The third item relates to additional <Col N="410" /> provision in respect of the staff of the Prices Commission.  As Deputies will remember, the Prices Commission (Extension of Functions) Act was passed last year, and necessitated the provision of additional staff for the Prices Commission in consequence of the additional work given to them. That additional provision of £4,025, with an additional £170 for incidental expenses, is being made under this Supplementary Estimate.  I do not know if any Deputies would desire to have a review of the work done by the Prices Commission.</P>

The net amount which it is proposed to vote here is £10, but the passing of the Estimate gives Parliamentary sanction for the expenditure of £4,025 and £170 additional in respect of the Prices Commission. I would have wished to move to reduce this Vote by £4,195, but as the Vote itself set out £10 I had a difficulty in putting down a motion to that effect.  It did not even help me to be told here that we were going to save, on&mdash;of all things in the world&mdash; industrial alcohol, the sum of £21,185, so that I am constrained to oppose this Vote.  What the Minister has said with regard to the money which is required for the New York World Fair makes the matter easier for me.  He tells us it is purely a book-keeping matter, and I am quite sure he will be able to deal with the New York World Fair even though we vote against this Estimate.  I want to oppose any further expenditure on the Prices Commission until the Minister tells us that the Prices Commission is going to deal with those matters that <Col N="411" /> are of the first and the gravest importance to the people.  I consider that the price of flour and bacon, and the absurd and unnecessary profits which are being made by the flour millers and by the bacon curers, are things that bear very harshly on the people, and are things that should be attended to with priority over a lot of matters with which the Prices Commission are dealing.  We understand that the Prices Commission has recently concerned itself with reducing the price of motor cars.  Evidence given before the Banking Commission suggested that there was a <i>prima facie</i> case for dealing with that, but even the price of motor cars can wait until the flour situation and the bacon situation, among others, are dealt with.  In 1934, we had a report from the Prices Commission on the price of flour.  Since then, the position with regard to the price of flour, and the profits that are being made unnecessarily and unreasonably by flour millers, have gone beyond the beyonds.  In the report which was signed by the Prices Commission in July, 1934, and published in February, 1935, the Commission which examined into the price charged for flour then show and repeat at various stages of their report that they examined very closely into the matter.  At page 32 they say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are of opinion that the prices charged for flour in the Saorstát are unreasonably high.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>If the Deputy does not mind my interrupting him, I should like to ask you, Sir, to what extent we are, on this Estimate, entitled to discuss the prices of particular commodities. The Prices Commission has certain statutory functions to perform. Would it be in order, A Chinn Chomhairle, for the Deputy on this Estimate to discuss the price of motor cars or flour or other particular commodities, and if so, to what extent?</P>

      <P>Before you reply, Sir, might I put the point that we are here asked to vote £4,195 for additional staff for the Prices Commission, and I am opposing the granting of that unless we get a definite assurance <Col N="412" /> from the Minister that the money which is being voted there is going to be supplied first to deal with the question of the price of flour and bacon. If the Minister can assure us on this point, then I have no objection to passing this money, but, if the Minister cannot assure us on that, I want to put very briefly and not in any way elaborately a number of points before the House to induce the House to support me in that matter, and force the Minister by our attitude to deal with those questions.</P>

      <P>As regards the point raised by the Minister, this is a Supplementary Estimate for a very small sum in comparison to the main Vote for the Department.  Questions of policy and detailed questions of administration are normally raised on the main Estimate.  It is not customary on a Supplementary Estimate to enter into the details, for the obvious reason that it would be impossible for the Minister to have before him the data necessary for a reply.  If the Deputy wishes to put briefly one or two points, well and good, but a detailed discussion of the prices of bacon, flour, motor cars and other commodities would obviously be irrelevant on a Supplementary Estimate for £10.</P>

      <P>Sir, may I submit that the Deputy is not going into a detailed examination of the Minister's main Estimate.  He is merely giving reasons why this additional money should not be voted for a particular small Department under the Minister's direction.  I submit, Sir, that the Deputy cannot argue his case unless he is allowed to do that.  It would be quite a different matter, I submit, if on a Supplementary Estimate he were going into details covering the work of the Department of Industry and Commerce.

      <P>I propose to put before the House about four items taken from this report.  I propose to put before the House the increase in the price of flour as sold across the threshold of the millers since this report was printed; what that means in increased money to the millers as a lump sum; and what was given to the farmers for increased production of home wheat during that particular period&mdash;a simple set of figures.  I propose to go back no further than 1934 on bacon.  I will be briefer when dealing with bacon than with wheat.  The Prices Commission after what has repeatedly been said to be a very close examination in July, 1934, said:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;We are of opinion that the prices charged for flour in the Saorstát are unreasonably high.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Lower down on page 32 the report says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The virtual monopoly at present enjoyed by the Saorstát flour milling industry necessitated from our point of view the fullest possible investigation of the subject.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On page 33 it says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;On the facts before us we are satisfied that the deliberations of the three price-fixing groups, all the members of which are, we understand, members of the Irish Flour Millers' Association, represent agreement and combination for interfering with free competition.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Then on page 35, after giving what ought to be a reasonable formula for fixing a reasonable price for flour, they point out that in 1935, what was actually obtained by the millers represented a contribution of £34,640 over and above profits to <Col N="414" /> which they were, in our opinion, entitled. They make the statement that the unreasonable profit of £34,640 was made in respect of the quarter ending March, 1934, above what the Prices Commission fixed as reasonable profit on the sale of flour.  The Census of Production figures show that the millers, for the year 1934, would have been satisfied to dispose of their whole production across their thresholds and to receive 10/4 per cwt.  In 1935 they were asking 12/7 per cwt., in 1936, 15/- per cwt., and in 1937, 18/3 per cwt., so that between the years when they were getting these unreasonable and excessive profits the price of flour across the thresholds of the millers went up from 10/4 per cwt., to 18/3, or an increase of 7/11 per cwt. Between 1934 and 1937 the production in the country ran to 6,400,000 cwts.; 6,800,000 cwts.; 6,800,000 cwts. and 6,670,000 cwts., respectively, so that there was not any considerable variation in production.</P>
      <P>But when we take the figures that the millers asked for the production that they pushed over their thresholds, we find that in 1937, with a gross output of 6,700,000 cwts. they asked for £2,922,000 more than they asked for the 6,410,000 cwts. they produced in 1934.  In 1934 they used 184,000 cwts. of home-grown wheat, and that was increased to 1,159,000 cwts. of home-grown wheat in 1938.  The farmers got from the millers an increase of £1,775,938 for home-grown wheat that the millers took in 1938, over 1934, but the millers got, for approximately the same production as in 1934, £2,922,000. With the base as £34,640 for one quarter in 1934, that continued, so that the millers got £1,146,000 more in 1937 than in 1934 for approximately the same amount of production.  Whereas the farmers benefited by £1,775,000, a small group of millers benefited by £1,146,000, I submit that there is no more urgent question to be gone into by the Prices Commission than the question they left at the stage portrayed in the report.  I want to know from the Minister why he sits so acquiescently over that situation, when every household is suffering from the excessive cost of flour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="415" /> Coming to bacon, I have repeatedly pointed out how the consumption of bread has gone down, and how the consumption of bacon has gone down. The consumption of bacon has gone down by 25 per cent.  What is the history of bacon prices as far as the curers are concerned, compared with 1934?  In 1934 the curers would have disposed of their bacon, hams and gammons across their thresholds at 79.5s. per cwt.; in 1935, 76.4s.; in 1936, 82.5s., but in 1937 they asked for 103/- per cwt.  Fantastic figures have been quoted from time to time, and figures have been used in the street that in ordinary conversation would be regarded as fantastic about the profits being made by curers, but the figures that have been used are facts that have been disseminated in conversation and put before the House by men who know what they are talking about and who are &ldquo;close in&rdquo; in the business of curing.  While we are voting additional moneys to build up the Prices Commission machine we are not told that anything is going to be done by the Prices Commission to deal with the curers' situation, and to deal with the prices position that has taken one-quarter of the amount of bacon that used to be consumed by the people off their plates.  The Minister has in no case shown that he interfered in this particular way, or that he interfered to curtail the profits of the flour millers and the bacon curers. The additional profits taken by the curers are taken out of the farmers' pockets on the one hand and the consumers' on the other hand.  The Minister is aware from the figures that his Department have recently put together and reviewed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have the prices going up here and the profits being accumulated into the pockets of curers and millers, to mention only two classes, at a time when male employment in agriculture is going down year after year to the extent that, in 1938, it is 41,187 male people below the figure for 1934.  That is that.  As I say, until the position is brought about that the Minister is forced to tell the House that he is going to put the machinery of the Prices Commission, or some part of the machinery, on to dealing with the questions of flour and bacon, the prices that are charged for them and the profits that are being made by, as far as the millers are concerned, what the Prices Commission call a &ldquo;virtual monopoly,&rdquo; I am against this House voting any additional bit of money for the machinery of the Prices Commission.</P>

      <P>Sir, in regard to that part of this Vote which is intended for the Prices Commission, I would like to underline some of the observations made by Deputy Mulcahy.  Deputy Mulcahy has referred to the price of flour.  Take bakers' flour.  Into that flour most of the millers in this country put no Irish wheat at all.  They use for the manufacture of that flour Manitobas and Pacific wheats, which they are at present being paid 1/- a sack to buy and store in this country.  Out of precisely the same wheat, frequently out of precisely the same cargo of wheat, Messrs.  Rank manufacture flour in Liverpool and in Limerick and Cork. The wheat carried into Cork and Limerick is converted into bakers' flour and sold to our people at about 39/- a sack to day.  The same wheat, the other half of the cargo, is carried on to Liverpool and there manufactured into bakers' flour, and sold to the people there at 21/- a sack.</P>

      <P>I say that no money should be voted on this Vote for the Prices Commission unless the Prices Commission can discharge their functions. If the Prices Commission cannot stop the highway robbery of the consumers in this country then I do not know what the commission is for.  Is it to conduct academic debates behind closed doors with the very people who are plundering the public or is it to intervene and stand between the suffering consumers in this country and the flour barons who are robbing them every hour of the day? My understanding of the functions of the Prices Commission is to expose the plunderers so that those charged with the duty of doing so may bring them to book and make them disgorge their plunder.  Far from that being so, the plunderers are called in and told, &ldquo;You are not plundering them enough.  Put another shilling a sack upon flour.&rdquo;  The Minister himself here told us that, with all the information set before this House to-day by Deputy Mulcahy in his possession, he recently sent for these men and said, &ldquo;You are not charging the people enough.  Put another shilling on.&rdquo; And they did it.</P>

      <P>If this money, then, is to finance a body known as the Prices Commission and that that is to serve as the rag of decency wherewith the plunderers in this country cover their nefarious transactions, the sooner we tear that rag of decency off the plunderers the better, and I object to voting £4,000 to provide a rag of decency to cover the iniquity of these plunderers.  I am directing the attention of this House to the plunder that is going on at this instant moment and asking the House to tear the rag of decency provided by the Minister for Industry and Commerce to the Prices Commission for the plunder&mdash;to tear it away and to let the true facts stand forth.  The Prices Commission has not effectively prevented the robbery of our people by the flour combine in this country.  The flour combine, notwithstanding the Prices Commission, is getting out of our people approximately £1 a sack more for flour than they are getting for the same flour which the same people are selling to Great Britain.  If they are manufacturing, as I believe they are, 2,750,000 sacks of flour in this country, they are robbing our people to the tune of £2,750,000 over and above a fair <Col N="419" /> margin of profit, and that is what a lot of people forget.  But, let us state our case conservatively, let us give them, as a make-weight, £750,000 a year. They still stand convicted of robbing the people of this country of £2,000,000 sterling per annum.  Look at the Deputies of this House who are supposed to represent the people.  They sit like pillars of salt while the people are robbed, and glory in it.

I challenge the bacon manufacturers, if they dare, to produce their profit and loss accounts to this House.  That is all.  I want nothing more than the profit and loss accounts of the several bacon factories in this country to be laid upon the Table of the House, and that in itself will settle the whole question.  I said before, and I now repeat, that I put £200 into a bacon factory four years ago or five years ago.  For the last three years I have got magnificent dividends out of it and last Christmas I got 900 shares for my 200 and I am still getting good dividends.  That is being taken out of the hide of the Irish people.  I told you that four years ago.  I told you <Col N="420" /> three years ago.  I told you two years ago.  I told you a year ago, and I tell it to you now, and it is being taken out of the hides of the Irish people with the connivance, help and protection of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will, Sir.  Seeing that the Prices Commission have not stopped it, they are either absolutely inefficient and useless, or their representations to the Fianna Fáil Government have been absolutely ineffective. In either case, it is perfectly useless to go on spending money on it.  If, with the Prices Commission sitting there, the bacon trust and the flour trust, in their continued existence through the Prices Commission, can continue to plunder the Irish people, what is the use of voting money for the Prices Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Messrs. Henry Denny cure about 50 per cent. of the bacon of this country. I ask for nothing but the production of their profit and loss account.  Let the country see the figures.  Let us see their profit and loss account for the last five years.  Many of the units of the bacon trust, or at least that one which does by far the greatest part of the curing in this country, is primarily an English-Danish concern.  I ask them to turn up nothing but the profit and loss account on the activities of that firm in Ireland, and let Deputies compare the profits which the Prices Commission allowed the farmer to make on pigs, the price which the Prices Commission allowed the bacon curers to charge the consumers of this country for bacon and the profits which the Prices Commission permitted the bacon trust to make for the last four years. If Deputies will examine that and nothing else, the case we are making requires no advocacy in this House. But they never have examined it.  They have never even bothered to look at the results of their own folly, and the Prices Commission have signally failed to bring the consequences of their own folly to their attention.  God knows, if the Prices Commission cannot make  the folly of the Fianna Fáil <Col N="421" /> Party, it is high time we abolished them, because if they cannot do that, they could make nothing manifest.</P>
    <P>The reputation of the Prices Commission is so disreputable and futile that it is almost a waste of breath further to expose it, but there are two other matters I want to mention. What is the procedure employed by the Prices Commission?  Have their activities, in so far as they have taken place at all, been designed to set a premium on inefficiency and to penalise efficiency?  Is it true that, when the Prices Commission made very necessary inquiries into the prices charged for Irish assembled motor cars, they went to the highly efficient men, who were doing a good economic job, and said to them: &ldquo;You must cut your prices down,&rdquo; and brought those people down to a very modest margin of profit; that they then went to the inefficient fellows, the fellows who were making a mess of the assembly work they had undertaken, and said to them: &ldquo;You are making a mess of your job. It is, therefore, costing you far more to do your job than it ought, but, in those circumstances, I guess you had better take your profit,&rdquo; with the result that the inefficient man was left with a large margin of surplus profit to finance inefficiency, which he could pocket himself if he chose to remedy his own inefficiency, while the efficient man, who was doing a good job, was cut down to the lowest penny of what they considered to be a fair profit and was left with no margin at all other than what he could earn by maintaining the highest possible standard of efficiency?</P>
    <P>I have no complaint with that standard being set for all manufacturers.  I have no complaint if the Prices Commission say to manufacturers: &ldquo;Firm No. 1 is doing its job efficiently.  We have fixed a reasonable price which will give him a fair margin of profit and that standard is going to apply all along the line and every firm is going to have its profit assessed on the basis of efficient operation, operation as efficient as that of Firm No. 1,&rdquo; and then let the inefficient fellows stand or fall.  Let them reform their own operations or <Col N="422" /> get out of the business.  What I strongly object to, however, is that a premium should be set by the Prices Commission on inefficiency and that the inefficient man should be allowed to charge the consumer in this country a far wider margin of profit than the useful and efficient industrialist is allowed to take on his work.  I believe that to be the case, and, if it is, it ought to be remedied.</P>
    <P>I wonder how many members of the Fianna Fáil Party adverted to savings on sub-head M of this Supplementary Estimate.  I do not believe that a single one of them knows what it is.  I will tell them.</P>

      <P>The Minister is extremely fortunate because, in the interval between now and the time when the matter properly arises, he will be able to buy a gas mask.  He will want it. The last matter I want to raise relates to the World Fair.  The Minister says that one of the pavilions, which I am glad to hear we propose to set up, is to be devoted to industrial products. He said that part of the exhibition was designed to inform the American people of the industrial progress of this country in the last 15 or 16 years.  I note that since the production of the &ldquo;March of Time,&rdquo; our propaganda has become somewhat amended.  The House will remember that on the last occasion on which industrial progress was outlined to the American people, it was in the &ldquo;March of Time.&rdquo;  I attended the picture on that occasion and I was greatly edified by the innuendo therein contained, of the Taoiseach being connected with the erection of Trinity College and the establishment of Guinness's Brewery.  I see now that our history and achievement are to be pushed back by about 15 years.  Now, while it might be all right to put the Prime Minister's books back that far, I trust that we may depend on other recollections.  I have no doubt that the imagination of the Minister for Industry and Commerce will give rise to a very pleasing display of work that has been achieved, but, in order to check up on his historical recollection, <Col N="425" /> perhaps I might remind him that there are more reliable sources than his memory to rely upon in order to avoid any confusion between Queen Elizabeth and the Prime Minister.</P>
      <P>Now, Sir, having corrected the historical aspect of our display, I think we can come down now to the kind of things we want to see displayed in the forthcoming New York World's Fair.  In that connection, I am primarily interested in the products of the Gaeltacht, and I apprehend that if we make an adequate display of Gaeltacht products in New York&mdash; should they be successful&mdash;that display will evoke a considerable volume of orders.  Now, if these orders cannot be filled, and if an impression is broadcast through America that although the products of the Gaeltacht are very good, they cannot be delivered, infinite damage will be done.  I think everybody here will realise that&mdash;because a good name lost is extraordinarily difficult to recover.  I, therefore, put it to the Minister that now, at once, there should be consultation opened up between his Department and the other Departments concerned, such as the Department of Lands, which, I think, is responsible for the Gaeltacht, the Department of Finance and the Department of Agriculture so that any materials that are on display at the New York World's Fair can be had as soon as possible, and that no matter what lines of merchandise we determine to figure on as Gaeltacht products there should be some kind of committee set up at once&mdash;not necessarily composed of civil servants, but of people who have experience in connection with the production of handicraft work and also with some knowledge of marketing and the requirements of markets, particularly the American market in this instance &mdash;to deal with this question of putting our products on the market and afterwards supplying the possible demands of that market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I went so far as to impress on the Minister for Agriculture the difficulties that lay ahead, accentuated as they are by the difficulties that particularly exist in West Donegal with regard to <Col N="426" /> hosiery.  Entirely apart from the Party to which I have the honour to belong, I sent a memorandum to the Minister for Agriculture, without consulting anybody, dealing with a particular kind of plan I had in mind whereby Gaeltacht industries might be marshalled with a view to making them commercially successful.  I do not say that my memorandum is, necessarily, the way to make these industries successful, but at least my memorandum contains some thought of a considered plan to deal with the Gaeltacht industries.  In that connection, I should like to emphasise this: that it would be better to show nothing from the Gaeltacht industries at the New York World's Fair than to make a great display of Gaeltacht industries and then not to be able to deliver the goods when orders come for them.  If we cannot arrange for adequate deliveries, prior to the Fair, I think it would be better not to make any display there at all. It would be better, in my opinion, to take steps later on to feature Gaeltacht industries by some other method on some other occasion, so long as you can ensure the adequate fulfilment of orders.  I say again that nothing could be more fatal to Gaeltacht industries than to get the bad reputation, which is all too common in commercial circles, of displaying good stuff and then not being able to deliver it.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Minister says that one of the pavilions at the New York World's Fair is going to be devoted to the display of Irish industrial products.  What does that mean?  I should imagine the first preference should be given to the hitherto despised native Irish product, but I should venture to say the first preference will be given to the fly-by-night Irish industries and that the poor, wild and despised native Irish products will get the backward position, and then the fly-by-night industries can come bleating to the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Agriculture, looking for more support and asking that more ginger should be put into them.</P>

      <P>Surely, Sir, the Minister connected with the Gaeltacht is responsible for this matter, but it seems that the whole business is now being handed over to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  It seems to me that, instead of Irish industries being represented, anybody from the back streets of Dublin will be able to get representation at this exhibition.  I do not mean that I despair at all of Irish industry, but I do mean that I have not much hope that the representatives of Fianna Fáil from the Gaeltacht will make sufficient agitation about it. I hold that they ought to be agitating now to ensure that a proper organisation is set on foot to get the fullest possible benefit that can be got for the Gaeltacht industries out of the New York World's Fair.  If they do not agitate now they will get nothing. They should take example by their colleague, Deputy Dowdall, who tells his colleagues&mdash;the industrialists of this country&mdash;to howl, and howl now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise some other questions concerning the activities of the Prices Commission.  I notice that there is roughly a 40 per cent. increase in the amount for salaries for that commission.  That, as the Minister has stated, denotes increased activity.  I should like to ask the Minister if he can give us any idea along what lines those activities are to be directed.  We are, of course, all sympathetic with the idea that profiteering should not be allowed and, in so far as that is an aspect of the Prices Commission's work, I have nothing to say.  But there seems to be an uneasy feeling amongst the members of the public that there is to be a new era introduced and something in the nature of rationalisation in industry <Col N="429" /> introduced by the Prices Commission. I should like to ask the Minister how far its activities go beyond fixing what, in its opinion, is a fair price for a commodity, and can methods of trading in this country be altered by order of the Prices Commission or in accordance with its rulings.  This is a question of policy in connection with the Prices Commission which is causing very great anxiety to members of the community.</P>
      <P>There is another aspect in connection with the Prices Commission's activities and that is, on what basis it is supposed to work.  Is the Prices Commission to be used as a penalty for efficiency? In other words, are manufacturers, who are making what the Prices Commission consider substantial profits or excess profits, to reduce their prices without any consideration of the circumstances under which they are made? I should like to suggest an instance to the Minister.  If a manufacturer could point out that, although he had the benefit of a tariff here, he was manufacturing within 10 per cent., say, of the prices prevalent on the other side of the water, would that be a justification for the Prices Commission reducing his ratio of charge to his customers? It seems to me that that would bring in its train a feeling that once the manufacturer had become really efficient he would be attacked by the Prices Commission.  Would that mean that other manufacturing concerns who are, say, charging 100 per cent. more than the prices which obtain on the other side of the water will be immune from interference owing to the fact that their profits do not go beyond a margin which would render them open to attack by the Prices Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may think that that is a small point, but it is a very serious point for the people who are manufacturing and trying to be efficient. Remember, that efficiency is not brought about just by haphazard methods.  It is the result of very hard work and, in a lot of cases, of expending very considerable sums of money. Are we to feel that a manufacturer, once he has become efficient, lays himself open to attack by the Prices Commission, <Col N="430" /> and that it does not matter what price you are charging as long as your profits do not bring you into conflict with the Prices Commission?  I ask the Minister to deal with these two points when replying, because they are both serious points, one for the manufacturers and the other for the people engaged in other branches of industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last occasion upon which the work and activities of the Prices Commission were discussed in this House, the Minister said he would duplicate the commission or increase its personnel if he found it necessary to do so and if the work justified him in doing so.  I should like to ask the Minister whether he is satisfied that the present part-time Prices Commission is doing its work as expeditiously and efficiently as he expected, or whether he proposes to appoint a full-time commission, or to increase the existing number of the Prices Commission.  There is a feeling that prolonging the work of the Prices Commission unduly is to the detriment of industry to a certain extent.  The sooner, in my opinion, the Prices Commission finishes that part of its work which has been delegated to it as a result of the recent trade agreement with Great Britain the better it will be for those engaged in industrial activity and for everybody associated with industrial development, whether on the workers' side or on the employers' side.  I dare say it can be assumed that the staff of the Prices Commission is recruited through the usual channel of the Civil Service Commission, but I should like to know whether the inspectors for whom additional money is being provided in this Supplementary Estimate are also to be recruited through the same channel, or whether they are to be appointed by the Minister without reference to any selection board of any kind.</P>
      <P>I am glad to note that in the Supplementary Estimate provision, by way, I presume, of Grant-in-Aid, is being made for further investigation into the question of the mineral deposits in certain areas in County Laoighis.  The sub-head states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="431" />&ldquo;Grant to Flemings' Fireclay, Limited, towards the cost of borings for coal, near The Swan, Ballylynan, Laoighis, £1,000.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would like if the Minister would give us some further information with regard to the area in which the borings will take place. &ldquo;Near the Swan,&rdquo; County Laoighis, might mean near anywhere unless there is a definite geographical boundary laid down.  There should be an understanding between the Minister and the people who are to get these Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>With other colleagues of mine in this House in previous Dála, for a number of years, I have been trying to encourage the Minister and his Department to pursue this matter for which provision is now being made.  Within the last year representations on these lines were turned down, because, in the opinion of the Minister and his advisers, no good purpose was to be served by spending money in this particular way.  I want to know now is there any understanding between the Minister and the people who are to get this grant as to the conditions under which this money is to be spent? Is there a definite geographical boundary laid down for the borings?  Can I have an assurance from the Minister, who is asking the House to pass this Vote, that in apportioning this money it will be laid down that trades union conditions will prevail in the expenditure of the money?  The word &ldquo;grant&rdquo; means that this money will not be subject to investigation by the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and, therefore, it is very necessary that the geographical boundary of the area in which the borings are to be carried out should be clearly understood by the parties concerned.  There should also be a clear understanding as to the conditions under which the money is to be spent, especially as regards conditions of employment.  Will the Minister say whether the borings will be carried out in the Luggacurra area, where the local people believe that there are mineral deposits to a very great extent?  I do not profess to have any technical or professional knowledge with regard to matters of <Col N="432" /> this kind, but these are the things that should be understood definitely before grants of this kind are passed by the House.</P>

      <P>I meant no reflection whatever on the Chair.  If any attention had been paid to my remarks it would be seen that my words conveyed no reflection on the Chair.  The practice of the House can change from time to time and the procedure which controls debate and discussion here may vary with the passage of time.  I did say and I repeat it, that the rules of procedure and practice which allow the Minister to know in advance how the debate would develop have been changed.  The result is that the Minister cannot know what papers and documents he should bring with him, so that it is now impossible to know in advance and to be prepared in advance for what the Opposition may bring forward.  One might toss up a penny 100 times and not once would it be found that the subject which was to be raised had been thought of in advance. On this Estimate we have been discussing <Col N="433" /> a variety of subjects which, in my opinion, have little direct relation to this Motion.  I was prepared to be asked here whether the Prices Commission have investigated the matter of flour prices and published their report on it and whether the Prices Commission have investigated bacon prices and published their report on it.  Deputies were fully aware of that; they were anxious to take mean advantage of the lenient ruling of the Chair and made statements on matters with which they knew the Minister would not be prepared to deal.  I am quite prepared to discuss the price of flour; the report of the Prices Commission of 1931 and the action which the Government took on it.  That would be an appropriate matter for discussion, and notice should have been given of it to the Minister.  I am quite prepared to deal with the bacon question or with any other question.  Deputy Dillon has been advising members of this side of the House to do a certain amount of howling.  Any subject on which the Deputy wants to howl I am prepared to come here and debate.  But I suggest that common decency and common courtesy should suggest that some intimation of the matters which are to be discussed or which the Deputies want to have discussed should be given to the Minister in advance.  I know Deputy Mulcahy was talking a lot of nonsense about flour prices.  I have not here with me the reports and the records which will allow me to demonstrate that he was talking nonsense on that very question.  I have not the documents here, but I know he was talking nonsense.</P>

      <P>I am glad Deputies agree with me.  The Prices Commission published a report on the flour question in 1934 and they reported that, for the first quarter of 1934, that is five years ago, the flour millers made excessive profits and they said that in order to ensure that these excessive profits would not be made in the future, the price of flour should be fixed in accordance with the formula which they set out in the report on flour in 1934. From that day to this the price of flour has been fixed in accordance with the formula they agreed upon in 1934.</P>

      <P>I have to adopt with the Deputies the kindergarten system of teaching.  The price of flour has nothing to do with the profits made by the millers.  Fluctuations in the price of flour could take place upwards or downwards without any variation in the millers' profits.  The price of flour could go up by reason, for instance, of an increase in the price of wheat.  It could be caused by reason of an increase in the wages of workers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has now the privilege of having to listen to me. The price of flour can fluctuate widely because of many other factors than the profits made by millers.  In fact, you can have these wide fluctuations in the price of flour without any alteration in the profits of millers.  Is not that obvious?  It should be obvious to intelligent people, but whether members <Col N="435" /> of the Fine Gael Party understand it is another matter.  The price of flour went up from 1934 to 1937. That fact is not denied.  On the contrary, it went up in every country in the world.  I make the statement here, and challenge contradiction of it, that in the year 1934, the year Deputy Mulcahy started his calculations from, and the year in relation to which the Prices Commission carried out its investigation, the price of wheat in this country certainly, and in Great Britain, was the lowest recorded for 500 years.  That is a big statement, but it is true.  From that year until 1937 the price went up.  Deputy Mulcahy worked an elaborate sum which seemed to get him this conclusion: that if the flour millers got £2,500,000 more for their products in 1937 than in 1934, and if they paid only an addition £1,500,000 to Irish farmers, that, therefore, they were £1,000,000 better off.  I have here the trade and shipping statistics, and while the Deputy was speaking I worked out for myself a simple calculation.  I find that the price for foreign wheat imported in 1937, as compared with 1934, increased by practically £1,000,000.  That figure did not appear in the Deputy's sum.  He forgot that &mdash;it was a mere detail.</P>

      <P>Anyone who wanted to examine the subject seriously would surely have compared the price of foreign wheat imported into this country between 1934 and 1937. Undoubtedly the price of flour went up from 1934 to 1937.  The Deputy stopped his calculations in 1937 because the price of flour went down in 1938, and that did not suit his argument.</P>

      <P>Let me say here that, in so far as this Estimate deals with the functions of the Prices Commission, the commission has done its duty completely. It is entitled to carry out certain investigations, either when asked by me to do so or on its own initiative in accordance with the Act. What I do upon the commission's report is a matter of policy, a matter for which I am prepared to answer here fully at the proper time.  The Prices Commission reported to me in relation to flour in 1934.  I do not feel that there is any obligation on me to defend the flour millers, or to say that their profits are fair or unfair.  If they were conducting their business in the way which I thought was contrary to the public interest, then it would be my duty, if possible, to prevent them from doing that.  That is my duty and not the duty of the Prices Commission. Let us get the Prices Commission clear so far as future discussions on the Estimate for that body are concerned, so that our discussions may be relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy tried to make his remarks relevant by asking what has the Prices Commission done about bacon.  Deputy Mulcahy occasionally gives evidence of doing some study outside this House in relation to the matters that may arise here.  Deputy Dillon gives no such evidence, and probably does not know that very recently in a report the Prices Commission dealt with this question of bacon.  Deputy Mulcahy, I am sure, does know that, but he forgot about it.  Bacon was one of the major items that was investigated last year by the Prices Commission.  They made a full investigation with regard to the bacon position and published a report on it. That report was printed and delivered, free of charge, to Deputies&mdash;to Deputies <Col N="437" /> who are now asking what did the Prices Commission do about bacon last year.  It is not three months since Deputies got that printed report delivered to them through the post. The report is under examination by me, but as to what is going to be done upon it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing will be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that is not a matter for the Prices Commission.  That will form a basis for Government policy, or, at any rate, the Government's policy in relation to bacon will be based on the information conveyed in that report.  That will happen in due course.  The Deputy is entitled to criticise the Government for delay if he wants to.  He is entitled to urge that the Minister has failed in his duty in not acting forthwith on the report. He is entitled to make any such case as he likes.  No one will contest his right to do that.  But he is not entitled to blame the Prices Commission for it. He is not entitled to ask the House to vote against this Estimate on the ground that the Prices Commission have not dealt with bacon, when they have.  Deputies, when they are elected to this House, are expected to take the work of the House seriously.  I submit that they are not doing that, when we have a couple of Front Bench Opposition members, presumably leaders of the Party, alleging that the Prices Commission have done nothing about bacon, in view of the fact that three months ago they had delivered to them, free of charge, the report of the Prices Commission on that very subject.  That, at least, is an indication that outside this House they are occupying their time and attention dancing on Sunday mornings, or at something else.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon's attitude in relation to the question of profits is quite clear.  According to him, any manufacturer who makes a profit is a plunderer, a thief and an unsavoury blackguard.  Deputy Dockrell's attitude is the reverse.  He is a business man who has had business responsibility, and he has the business man's outlook.  If I interpret his remarks correctly, his attitude is quite the reverse to that of Deputy Dillon. It is this: that the amount of profit a man makes is the test of his efficiency. The efficient man will make more profit than the inefficient man, and the more profit he makes the more efficient he is, particularly if he makes his profits in a competitive market. That is a perfectly reasonable point of view.  It is one that I have a great deal of sympathy with.  I disagree entirely with Deputy Dillon that the mere fact that a man makes profits thereby proves him to be a thief. Most people are in business to try and make a profit out of it, and there is surely nothing unsavoury about that. Deputy Dillon, I am sure, tries to make a profit out of his business and does not, therefore, regard himself as an unsavoury blackguard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can make any personal remarks he likes.  They will not hurt me in the least.  I do not care the least for his personal remarks. To get back to the Prices Commission, the Deputy apparently thinks anyone who is making a profit should be immediately jumped upon and squelehed.  As I have pointed out, that <Col N="439" /> is not Deputy Dockrell's attitude which I think is a reasonable attitude.  The job of the Prices Commission is to see that no unreasonable profits are taken, and that the public get a fair deal from manufacturers of protected commodities. That is their primary concern.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy agrees, I should prefer that he would do so mentally.  The Prices Commission have various methods of procedure.  One is a formal investigation, as happened in the case of bacon.  When requested by the Government, they investigated the whole position in relation to bacon and submitted a report.  They were requested to carry out an investigation into a variety of other matters as well. During the course of the year they carried out investigations in relation to a number of matters, including foundry products used for house building, iron and steel nuts and bolts, fertilisers, printing and stationery, yarns comprising binder twine, jute piece goods, felting, bottles and jars, sheet and plate glass, etc.  In addition to these formal investigations which result in the submission of a report to the Government, it may recommend some action by the Government, such as the making of a Price Order or some other step of that kind.  The Prices Commission also carry out investigations of an informal kind, which have caused some irritation to manufacturers.  I know that, because I have received many representations of the kind that Deputy Dockrell voiced here.  It is open to the Prices Commission to go to a manufacturer and say: &ldquo;We want to know all about your prices.&rdquo;  Having got all the information they wanted, they may express the opinion that these prices should be reduced.  It is equally open to the manufacturer to refuse to give the information or to refuse to effect any reduction which the Prices Commission may advise, but the manufacturer who does refuse to give information, or who refuses to accept the reduction recommended, knows that he is almost certain to be facing a formal public investigation of his prices.  Consequently, <Col N="440" /> the great majority of them chose to act on the informal advice of the Prices Commission rather than await such a formal investigation.  The Prices Commission have used that position to effect price alterations over a wide range of articles.  Some of these price alterations were in connection with commodities of everyday use and some of them were in relation to articles of a luxury kind.  May I say, for the information of Deputies, that in respect of probably the larger number of articles the investigations of the Prices Commission resulted in their coming to the conclusion that the prices being charged were reasonable and that no action on their part was required.  It is not true that the Prices Commission have taken a decision that there is a fixed limit to the profit a man may make, irrespective of how he organises his business or however more efficiently he may run it than a competitor runs his business.  What is true is that the Prices Commission, on the facts in individual cases, have requested a number of manufacturers to reduce their prices and that these manufacturers reduced their prices rather than face a public inquiry.  The complaints of these manufacturers need not concern us very much because their mere existence is proof that the Prices Commission are actively doing the work which they were set up to do. It is rather strange that the people who talk most about profiteering are the people who always opposed, obstructed and attempted to destroy the machinery set up to check it.  I am referring to Deputy Dillon.</P>

      <P>He seemed to have some nasty suspicion which he did not want to express but which, at the same time, he wanted to suggest.  Are the people to be employed, he asked, going to be employed at trade union rates?  Is there going to be discretion exercised in the selection of the people?  Were the Prices Commission inspectors appointed by Civil Service Commission procedure or by the Minister?  The Deputy knows the answers to these questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Prices Commission inspectors are appointed by selection boards in the ordinary way.  If the Deputy were familiar with the terms of the Civil Service Regulation Act, he would have known that.  The recruitment of Civil Service staff is a matter for the Civil Service Commissioners and Ministers have nothing to do with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise to the Deputy if I was wrong but I got the impression that he was very suspicious and that he was anxious to give voice to his suspicions.  Answering the Deputy's query, the work of the Prices Commission is being done as expeditiously as possible and I am quite satisfied that no greater expedition would be secured by duplicating the commission.  The amount of work the commission can do is determined largely by the output of the staff and not by the formal meetings of the commission. Its decision on the information that comes to it takes a very short time.  The work is done by the staff and that work would not be expedited by duplicating the commission. Expedition can be effected only in the way we propose to do it&mdash;by increasing the staff available.  Deputies opposite will probably vote against that.  That is the only effective way of securing what Deputy Davin wants&mdash; that the work of the commission <Col N="442" /> should be done as expeditiously and as efficiently as possible.  The work of the Prices Commission under the Trade Agreement with the United Kingdom will not stop so long as that Agreement is there.  It is open to the British Government, under that Agreement, to request that the operation of any tariff be reviewed and, if they so request, we have to ask the Prices Commission to undertake the task of review.  There is a very long list of tariffs in relation to which the British Government have asked for a special review.  That matter is at present awaiting the attention of the commission.</P>

      <P>The three years of the agreement.  The boring of the Swan will be carried out in the area of the lease of the company.  The company have got a mineral lease.  They are working these minerals for the purpose of manufacturing fireclay goods.  In the course of that working, the management of the company came to the conclusion, from certain things they saw, that down below where they are working fireclay there is coal. They discussed the matter with the geological officers of my Department, and these officers, having examined the position, said that it was quite possible that that view was correct&mdash; that within that space there is a workable seam of coal, but that it is by no means certain.  While the coal is, undoubtedly, there, there may not be a sufficiently wide seam to permit of its being worked.  The only way of finding that out is by boring.  Ordinarily, <Col N="443" /> we carry out these explorations where, in the first place, it is in the national interest to know whether a particular mineral exists in a workable quantity, irrespective of the immediate prospects of getting the mineral worked.  The investigations carried out in relation to gypsum were of that character, though we knew at once that if there was gypsum there of good quality, there was a use for it within the country, apart from the possibility of its use outside the country.  In the second place, we engage in this exploration of minerals where there is an immediate prospect of these minerals being worked successfully by a private company in the event of the minerals being found to be present in commercial quantities. We would not have immediately undertaken this exploration of coal in South Laoighis were it not that this company, which has a lease of the area, stated that, in the event of borings revealing the existence of coal in workable quantities, they were prepared to consider its commercial working as part of their enterprise.</P>

There is a very strong local belief that the gold areas they worked are still in existence and that it would still be possible to make a profit from them.

      <P>There is nothing to prevent a similar grant being made for mineral exploration work in any other part of the country, if there is any prospect whatever of the exploration resulting in commercial working.  If the Deputy can produce, in relation to these other areas, some individual prepared to say: &ldquo;If you will explore these minerals by digging boreholes and prove their existence, I am prepared to put up my own resources, or organise a company to work them commercially,&rdquo; or if he can get someone to consider it seriously, then a grant can be made available.

      <P>I contest that entirely. In other cases, where there was better reason to believe that the minerals existed in workable quantities, as in Slieveardagh, we have provided and spent a very substantial sum to explore them thoroughly.  The report on Slieveardagh was published last year and justified the expenditure we undertook. In that case there was no immediate <Col N="445" /> prospect of commercial working.  The report may create commercial prospects, but until some progress is made in respect to that area I do not think we should take a similar shot in the dark in any other part of the country unless we have, as we have in the case of The Swan, an immediate prospect of a commercial working by a private firm.</P>

In 1938 the functions of the Prices Commission were extended.  They were given an entirely new block of work to do which was not within the original scheme.  Additional staff had to be appointed, including accountants and inspectors and so forth, in order to enable the work to be done.  The estimated cost of that is £4,025.</P>

      <P>I think No. 3 on the Order Paper might be discussed in conjunction with this Estimate, because the Estimate provides the amount required under the order specified in No. 3.  Accordingly, I move:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Eireann hereby approves of the Subsidy (Aer-Rianta, Teoranta) Order, 1939, made under Section 79 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936 (No. 40 of 1936) by the Minister for Finance on the 11th day of February, 1939, and laid before Dáil Eireann on the 14th day of February, 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Go ndeontar suim Bhreise ná raghaidh thar £37,500 chun íoctha an <Col N="447" /> Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1939, chun Seirbhísí Iompair agus Meteoraíochta.</P>
    <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £37,500 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1939, for Transport and Meteorological Services.</P>
    <P>The Air Navigation and Transport Act provides that every order made under Section 69 shall be laid before Dáil Eireann as soon as may be after it is made and it shall not come into force unless confirmed by a resolution of Dáil Eireann.  Hence the reason for the motion.  The order to which the motion relates was made to authorise the Minister for Industry and Commerce to pay a total subsidy not exceeding £33,000 during the current year to Aer-Rianta, Teoranta, out of moneys to be provided by the Oireachtas, and in order to make that money available, the Supplementary Estimate which I have moved is being submitted to the Dáil.</P>
    <P>This is the first order of its kind. I think some words in justification of the principle of subsidy may be considered appropriate.  The importance which has been attached to the development of air transport by all the countries of the world is, I think, in itself a sufficient indication of their belief in its very great possibilities.  In the Air Navigation and Transport Act the Dáil approved of the steps which the Government propose to take by promoting civil aviation in this country and establishing air connections between Ireland and other countries to ensure that Ireland would participate in the economic and other benefits which should follow from the development of this new form of transport.  As was stated during the debate upon that Act, when it was before the Dáil as a Bill, the Government believed that the advantages were on the side of a national transport company in which would be centralised all the commercial air transport activities with which Ireland would be concerned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="448" /> In that respect, the tendency in other countries towards the formation of large scale companies operating internal and international air services under close governmental supervision was followed.  The Irish National Company, or Aer-Rianta Teoranta, was set up by the Minister for Finance in April, 1937.  Aer Lingus, which had been established earlier and was engaged in the operation of cross-Channel air services, is now a subsidiary of Aer-Rianta. It is the Government's aim to encourage air transport development, organised on sound lines with proper equipment, on a large scale and under Irish control.  The services between this country and various points in Great Britain have been operated in accordance with that policy since May, 1936.  These services have had a successful operations record and the companies concerned have recognised the necessity for the maintenance of high standards in speed and comfort, high standards comparable with the highest possible degree of safety.  Provision was made in the Act of 1936 for the payment of subsidies in connection with air transport services.  While it was the intention that such services in this country should be operated on a commercial basis, it was recognised at the same time that the experience of other countries had shown that in the proper development of air lines, particularly in the earlier stages, financial assistance by way of subsidy was necessary.</P>
    <P>From the experience of Irish companies to date, it is clear that there is no prospect of securing rapid development in the sphere of commercial aviation without financial assistance from the Government on a substantial scale.  In this respect, as I have already stated, the position of Ireland appears to be the same as in practically every country in the world.  In view of the Irish companies' comparatively short experience in the field of commercial aviation, and the necessity of ensuring the maximum degree of development in connection with Transatlantic air services, considerable importance is attached to the companies' building up a reputation for a high standard of safety, as well as regularity and efficiency <Col N="449" /> in operation.  For that reason, expenditure by the companies, and consequently the subsidies considered necessary, are somewhat higher than they would be if operation precautions were less.  It is considered that it would be a mistaken policy to accept lower standards than the companies have observed and propose to continue.</P>
    <P>There are some figures here that may interest Deputies in this connection. Since the commencement of the services in May, 1936, the activities of Irish Sea Airways, that is to say a combination of Aer Lingus and the British company&mdash;West Coast Air Services, Ltd.&mdash;have shown satisfactory progress.  For example, the number of aircraft miles flown increased from 151,600 in 1936 to 385,533 in 1938.  The number of passengers carried increased from 1,330 in 1936 to 4,987 in 1938.  The weight of goods carried increased from 6,472 lbs. in 1936 to 35,264 lbs. in 1938. The percentage regularity of services on the Dublin-London route increased from 90.96 in 1936 to 94.02 in 1938. While these figures are just cause for optimism as to the traffic in future. the accounts of the company show that the existing services are being operated at a loss.  To ensure the observance of the highest standard of safety in operation and, at the same time, the use of modern equipment, the payment of a subsidy is essential.</P>
    <P>The order provides for the payment of a total subsidy not exceeding £33,000 during the current financial year.  This is the sum of the actual losses sustained by Aer Rianta Teoranta and Aer Lingus Teoranta up to 31st March, 1938, and the estimated losses in the year ending 31st March, 1939.  The actual losses were Aer Rianta, 1937-38, £3,334; Aer Lingus, 1936-37, £4,824; 1937-38, £7,330.  The estimated losses for the year ending 31st March, 1939, are Aer Rianta, £3,100; Aer Lingus, £14,235.  The losses arose out of the operation of services&mdash;Dublin-Bristol. Dublin-Bristol-London and Dublin-Isle of Man.  The terms of the order itself are self-explanatory. It will be noted that provision is made for the repayment of <Col N="450" /> any amount by which the Estimates for the current year exceed the actual losses.  I do not know whether there is any other point in connection with this matter which Deputies would like to discuss, but should they desire any other information, I shall be quite willing to supply it to them.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate also contains another sub-head for a civil airport.  Some explanation will be necessary in regard to that matter also.  That additional provision is required in connection with the acquisition of land for aerodromes, for which service £58,050 was provided by the Vote of 1937-38.  Owing to delays in completing the investigation of title, a sum of only £30,528 was expended. Accordingly, the payments have to be carried forward in this year and the increased provision in the Vote is necessary.  The Vote for 1938-9 provided for an estimated expenditure of £10,100.  The total payments expected to be made before the 31st March amount to £24,600.  A Supplementary Estimate for £14,600 is, therefore, submitted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of points which I want to put to the Minister.  I suggest that in future where he contemplates acquiring lands compulsorily for the purposes of an aerodrome he should incorporate in his Bill a provision that the land should vest in him at once and let the title dispute be fought out by the parties interested afterwards.  He can then proceed with his job, irrespective of the dispute as to who should get the money for the land.  There is no reason why important work should be held up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is the position at the moment.  We have power to acquire land at once, but payment for the land is dependent on a satisfactory title being produced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that some scheme might be formulated whereby the payment should be made to a trustee for the rightful owners.  The trustee can hold the money while the <Col N="451" /> title is being investigated.  First, let me say that every member of the House will heartily rejoice at the attitude of the Government in the matter of ensuring safety in aviation.  They are perfectly right not to sacrifice standards of efficiency and safety in order to save money.  Extravagance is to be condemned, but there should certainly be no cheese-paring, nor do I believe the Oireachtas would desire to have cheese-paring which would in any way interfere with the highest possible standards of air services originating in this country.  The Minister said that the highest standards of comfort were provided by the company, consistent with safety.  That is not true, and while I would not ask the company to cheese-pare in any way, and would be anxious to give them very liberal discretion to preserve the highest standards of safety, in view of the generous treatment they are receiving from the State, I do not think it is fair that they should impose upon persons availing of the service a wholly gratuitous inconvenience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned last year, at an early stage of those services development, one very glaring shortcoming.  It now requires to be mentioned with greater emphasis and it ought to be remedied now.  If you take an Irish airplane at Baldonnel you arrive at Croydon in the middle of the day.  Every other air service coming into Croydon has some kind of wheel conveyance to take you into Victoria Station, London. You may arrive with four other airplanes in the customs, and the sheep are then herded from the goats.  One other man and myself happened to be the two goats.  We were carted down to a suburban railway station with our baggage, and dumped on the platform. Everybody else coming from Poland, Sweden, England, France and other parts of Europe had various forms of buses or cars to take them into the centre of London.  The two unfortunates who arrived from Ireland were deposited on a suburban railway platform with their luggage, and subsequently loaded on to a commuters' train.  We all know what that means. There is no accommodation for baggage. <Col N="452" /> We fell over everybody's feet, and carefully struggled into the equivalent of a tramcar.  We were then decanted onto the platform at Victoria, where no porter ever presents himself because it is a local train, and they no more think of meeting those trains than they would think of meeting a tramcar from Nelson's Pillar.  We scrambled out with our luggage and mournfully sat on it until we braced ourselves to carry it what seemed a mile and a quarter, the length of Victoria platform.  The Minister knows that Victoria is a pretty large place. Being, as we are, fine figures of men we were able to stagger along, but if any lady had arrived with a considerable volume of luggage she might have sat there for a quarter of an hour while somebody was given six pence to find a porter with a barrow in which to bring the luggage to a taxi.</P>
    <P>I admit it is not economical to provide road transport from Croydon to Victoria but, when a company is getting an ample subsidy, and when every other air company is doing it, it is highly undesirable that anybody using our service should be so served, and it is grossly inefficient.  Now I do put it to the Minister that, in view of the fact that it is our aim to set a really high standard for the services we are providing, it is silly to spoil the ship for a ha'porth of tar.  The ships are good; the schedule is well kept; the accommodation at Baldonnel is perfectly reasonable; the personnel is admirable; every facility, convenience and courtesy are extended to people travelling by the air line; therefore, it is silly to spoil the whole for a ha'porth of tar.  I do not know whether the Minister has used the service or not.  Possibly if he has, special provision was made for him, but I can assure him that after one has made that journey&mdash;particularly if one is inclined to be air sick&mdash;it is not a pleasant experience to make that subsequent journey in a suburban train from Croydon to London.</P>
    <P>The next point I wish to make is this: In view of the fact that we are going to have a protracted period of development, why on earth do we not <Col N="453" /> get in contact with Imperial Airways, and make some deal with them so that our schedules could start from Dublin and end up in Melbourne if we want them to.  I have no doubt whatever that some reciprocal arrangement could be made whereby Dublin would be virtually linked with any point of the Imperial Airways system.  The Imperial Airways system is now subdivided into two parts, one covering the Commonwealth of Nations, and the other operating within Great Britain.  It seems obvious to me that there would be a very great advantage if we established contact with those two organisations and linked up Dublin &mdash;and such other points in Ireland as we may subsequently link with Dublin &mdash;with the whole of the Imperial Airways systems.  I suppose ultimately we are going to extend air travel to Cork, Galway, possibly Sligo and probably Belfast.  Surely it is desirable, if we are going to have a network of airplanes passing between those cities, to link them up with the major cities in Great Britain, and also with the major ports of call on the Continent of Europe and the rest of the Imperial Airways schedule.</P>
    <P>The Minister said we already have a service between here and several points in England.  What are the several points?  The only points in England I know to which we have a service are Bristol and London.  There is no service to Manchester; there is no service to Liverpool; there is no service to Glasgow.  I am not saying that at this stage there ought to be, because I quite agree that it may be impracticable to have them yet, but I think it would not be a bad plan in the interregnum to avail of the facilities which co-operation with Imperial Airways would make available. Lastly, Sir, in most countries of the world at present I quite agree that the commercial air services are subsidised, but in most countries those subsidies are made available by means of a mail contract.  At present our air mail to the other parts of the Commonwealth of Nations is sent from here to London by boat and train, and thenceforward has the advantage of the Commonwealth arrangement <Col N="454" /> whereby you can send a letter by airmail to any point in the Commonwealth for twopence.  Could we not expedite the delivery of mails in London and further afield by dispatching them from Ireland by air?  It may be that we cannot, but I imagine that by amending the schedules of our airships we might, and if we did I think the air company might reasonably be expected to carry some of those mails for part of the subsidy that they are getting.  Possibly at the first stage the Minister would ask the air company to accept mails intended to be reconsigned on Imperial Airways air liners, and later he might determine to offer the company a larger subsidy than it is now getting if they would consent to carry all letters intended for London. I merely throw that out as a suggestion, because it is in line with the practice of, I think, every other air-minded country in the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister what is the present position with regard to the proposed air port for Cobh and Cork.  They have succeeded in selecting the most suitable site out of about nine or ten, and farmers there are rather perturbed by the extensions that have taken place lately as to the likelihood of their lands being immediately taken over.  Now, what I am really concerned with is the attitude of the Government on this matter.  I want to know whether they are prepared to give a substantial subsidy to carry out that work which will undoubtedly develop that area to a very considerable extent.  Cobh having a Trans-Atlantic service, could be developed by the establishment of an air port.  Owing to the high cost involved, a subsidy would be necessary, because it would be impossible for the local authorities to contribute, to any great extent, the very large sum that would be required for an air port.  It is really a matter of national importance.  I should greatly appreciate it, if the Minister could inform the House what is the position now, or what is the attitude of the Government, having regard to the fact that the matter has been discussed frequently, at considerable <Col N="455" /> length, and reports of a very elaborate character put in.  I think the time has come to ask the Minister to come to a decision on the question of establishing an air port for the South, in view of its geographical position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only say that we are now merely at the beginning of air transport development here, and that plans for the future contemplate a very large extension of these facilities.  It is, however, impossible to be definite with regard to plans, because many difficulties will have to be overcome, and a great deal of information collected. At the present time, the only services are those from Dublin to Bristol, Dublin to London, and Dublin to the Isle of Man, in the summer months.  These services are linked up with other services, through the International Air Traffic Association.  The position is that Aer Lingus Teoranta is able to book passengers right through from Dublin to connect with any air port in the world, to which there is a regular service.  Aer Lingus Teoranta is agent for most of the Continental air lines.  So far as organisation can give a link, it is possible for passengers anxious to get to any part of the world, to get a ticket at Aer Lingus Teoranta office in Dublin, and that ticket will deliver the passenger to his destination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of mail services by air is, of course, one that has been receiving a great deal of attention.  It is almost inevitable that in a short time all mails will, ordinarily, go by air.  It is not possible, however, to make tentative arrangements, as the British have no facilities that I know of for handling mails at Croydon.  The British air mails are handled at another part, somewhere in the midlands, and until they have changed their internal Post Office arrangements, or provided air port facilities there, not much can be done.  In any event, the existing mail contract lasts until next year.  I would be very much surprised if more than two or three years pass before the ordinary mails go, as they go at present, by air, to South Africa, Australia, and India.  It is not possible to send a letter in the ordinary way from Britain to these <Col N="456" /> countries unless by special arrangement. The letters are taken by aeroplane, and that will be the ordinary practice in a year or two.  The matter is very definitely in view.  We have prepared all the necessary plans for an extension of the equipment of the company.  The aerodrome at Collinstown has been lengthened about half a mile, and the fullest possible consideration will be given to every aspect of this matter.  It is anticipated that the civil aviation headquarters will be transferred from Baldonnel to Collinstown about June.  Collinstown will not be complete then, but will be sufficiently far advanced to enable it to be used as the headquarters of the air services.  In any event, all the essential equipment for safety in flying will be there.  The administrative buildings will not be completed, and the hangars will not be completed, but there will be sufficient accommodation to enable work to be proceeded with. The matter of having better transport facilities between Croydon and London has been under consideration for some time and, I think, Deputies can be assured that the directors of the company are fully alive to the need for such facilities being there.  It would, in fact, mean small changes, but they would add considerably to the air service.</P>

      <P>The Minister is bound by the terms of the Estimate.  A few small matters which held up development here, such as the difficulties of ordinary tourist agents selling air tickets, have been got over.  Some other comparatively small things will be got over in time, and the convenience of passengers fully met.  So far as Cork aerodrome is concerned, I want to say that I regard it as so vitally important to the air transport services in this country, to take the fullest advantage of our international <Col N="457" /> position that there should be a proper aerodrome in the vicinity of Cork. The Government is prepared to co-operate, and to assist in getting the aerodrome if the local authorities are prepared to make the necessary financial provision to that end.  I am not in a position to say what the volume of cost will be.  The Estimates have been prepared but they are not complete.  I can assure Deputies that I am more than anxious that work on the provision of an airport at Cork should be proceeded with without delay.  With regard to details of the present position, I refer Deputy Brasier to a reply that I gave to a Parliamentary Question last week. There can be no question about the desirability of having a properly equipped airport in the vicinity of Cork, if we are to take full advantage of the present development in air transport, and to use our geographical position and to get the very best out of it.  I hope, therefore, that the local authorities concerned will be prepared to co-operate and to provide whatever money is required.  Government assistance will be given.</P>

In estimating that amount regard was had chiefly to the actual expenditure in the previous financial year, so far as it was known at the time when the Estimate was prepared, and, of course, to the increased rates of unemployment assistance which had become payable as from the 26th January, 1938, following the enactment of the Unemployment Assistance Act of that year.  It is now apparent that the amount voted will not suffice for the payments of unemployment assistance which are likely to be made during the remaining weeks of the financial year.  The weekly number of recipients of unemployment assistance has been higher throughout the year than in the preceding financial year.  The increase in the number of recipients of unemployment assistance in the first weeks of the 1938-39 financial year over the <Col N="459" /> corresponding weeks of the previous financial year was approximately 10,000, but in succeeding weeks the increase gradually diminished until, towards the end of the year, it practically disappeared.  Since that date, however, there has been an increase also recorded in the number of recipients.  Whatever the reasons for that increase in the number of persons receiving unemployment assistance, it is clear that the additional provision must be made if the statutory obligation of the Government to pay unemployment assistance at the prescribed rates and under the prescribed circumstances is to be fulfilled.</P>
    <P>Included in the Estimate of £720,900 for Appropriations-in-Aid, are six items.  The particular item which will fail to yield the amount estimated is Item No. 4, that is, Receipts from County Borough and Urban Area Councils under Section 26 of the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, as amended by the Unemployment Assistance (Amendment) Act, of 1938, from which it was estimated that an amount of £225,000 would be received.  The yield from that source will fall short of the Estimate by some £68,000.</P>
    <P>The appropriate section of the 1933 Act requires the four County Boroughs, the Borough of Dun Laoghaire and the twelve urban districts that are &ldquo;urban areas&rdquo; for the purposes of the Act, to pay to the Minister for Industry and Commerce a specified poundage rate on their rateable values at the beginning of the immediately preceding financial year.  In the cases of the County Borough of Dublin and the Borough of Dun Laoghaire the rateable value is the rateable value as deemed to be reduced by Section 69 of the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1930, and, in the case of the County Borough of Limerick, as deemed to be reduced by Section 28 of the Limerick City Management Act of 1934.  It was intended that this obligation would require payment at the specified poundage rate of 1/8 for the four County Boroughs and the Borough of Dun Laoghaire, and 9d. for the other twelve urban areas, on the total valuations of the areas less only the specified deductions <Col N="460" /> authorised by the Acts in the cases of Dublin, Dun Laoghaire and Limerick. Some of the councils, however, are reading the obligation as requiring them to pay the prescribed poundage rate, on not their total valuations, but the valuations as reduced by the valuations or the portions of valuations of properties that are not productive of rates.  The descriptions of these properties which are not productive, or are only partially productive, of rates are very varied, including such descriptions as new buildings, council houses, half-annuals, gradual rating scheme, reconstructed buildings, vacant buildings, premises affected by Housing Acts, and so forth.  During this year, many of the councils which have hitherto paid the prescribed poundage rate on their total valuations have not made payments on the valuations of the properties that did not produce rates.  In addition they have made recoveries from current payments of the amounts paid by them in previous years on such non-productive valuations.  In consequence, the yield from that source, which was estimated to amount to £225,000 is expected to yield only £157,000, that is £68,000 less than the estimated yield.</P>
    <P>The interpretation taken by the councils of their obligations reduces considerably the payments which it was intended they should be required to make under the Unemployment Assistance Acts and, without prolonged litigation, the matter could not be determined.  Recipients of unemployment assistance resident in those areas receive the higher rates of assistance prescribed by the Acts and the payments required from the councils were intended to enable the higher rates to be paid in those areas.  The whole position is being examined with a view to having the matter adjusted but, in the meantime, during the current financial year, the shortage of £68,000 in the expected yield from that source must be met.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that there will be a saving of £10,000 on the other subheads of the Vote and this will reduce the total of £243,000 to the amount of £233,000 for which the Supplementary Vote provides.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is to be <Col N="461" /> regretted, I think, that the Minister did not give some more information to the House regarding this additional sum of £175,000.  It is, to say the least of it, sad reading for this House and for the country that, at this time of the year, and seven years after the present Minister took office, we should be faced with the position that he has to come before this House for a further sum of £175,000 to meet the ever-increasing numbers of unemployed in this country.  The Minister, when making his Estimate, apparently thought that there was a reasonable hope that the numbers would decrease. We find that there has been no decrease in the numbers of those who are merely existing in this country or the thousands of families who are living, one might say, on the brink of starvation.  When one remembers that the maximum amount which can be paid out of this £175,000 to any married unemployed man outside the cities and the boroughs and urban districts mentioned by the Minister, whether he has five, six, seven or eight children, is 12/6 per week, and when one remembers that in urban districts with populations from 4,000 and 5,000 up to 6,000, many of these men are living in houses the rent of which is the first charge on that 12/6, and that the rents run from 2/6 to 4/- and even higher, I think we are entitled to ask the Minister whether, even now, at the end of seven years there is the slightest hope or the slightest possibility of his ever being able to make any impression whatever on the numbers of unemployed in this country.  We are entitled particularly to ask that from the man who told us that this money would not be required because he had a plan to solve the whole unemployment problem and who has repeated that year after year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only thing that surprised me when the Minister was making these statements in putting this Estimate before the House was that, side by side with asking for this £175,000, he did not tell the House and the country that the numbers of unemployed had been considerably reduced in this country.  That has been his cry year after year, and we find, as I say, that notwithstanding <Col N="462" /> all the tariffs and all the prohibition orders, and all the emigration, in the Minister's own words, in the first weeks of last year there was an increase of 10,000 recipients of unemployment assistance over the corresponding period of the previous year.  Then there was a gradual decline, and now, in the most severe part of the year, we have that upward tendency again, and so marked is the increase that, on a total estimate of £1,160,000, he must get an increase of £175,000.  I am not surprised that the Minister confined his remarks almost exclusively to the deficiencies of the local authorities, and to the £68,000 set out here.  I realise that it is difficult, if not impossible, for the Minister to say anything about the unemployment situation.  When one remembers the promises he held out to these men, the promises he made to them and to this House year after year, right up to a few months ago, and compares those promises with the actual position with which we are faced, which calls for an additional £175,000 to keep a number of unfortunate unemployed struggling along and barely existing, one can understand his silence on the point. The Minister did not give us any idea of the increase in numbers; he did not put before the House the total number compared with this time 12 months, or any reason as to why he was so far out in the Estimate.  After all, £175,000 increase on a total Estimate of £1,160,000 shows that the Minister and his Department were very much at fault in framing the original Estimate.</P>
    <P>I do not want to take up any time in talking further about the matter.  It is one which, God knows, has been talked enough about here, and even more so outside the House by the Minister and his colleagues.  There is nothing that I can say on it that I have not said on many occasions already and the only thing we can say is that, with the passage of the years, the problem becomes more grave, and the chances of these men securing employment seem to become less.  The Minister will probably be inclined to question that, but I do not think anybody, looking at the problem as we see it to-day, can question it.  I do not believe that even the Minister himself would suggest now that there is a possibility <Col N="463" /> of his tariff policy, his quotas, prohibitions and so on, absorbing into employment very many of the men now unemployed, nor do I think he will contend that there is any immediate prospect of many of these men being absorbed into agriculture in view of its condition to-day.  I should like to hear from the Minister what he thinks about the position to-day, whether he can offer any prospect of an improvement or whether he wants us to face up to the fact that, when the Estimate for the coming year comes before us, it will be considerably more than it was for the year just passing out, and whether these men are to take it that they must continue trying to exist on this miserable allowance&mdash;I am speaking now about those parts of the country outside the areas covered by this £68,000&mdash;ranging from 6/- to 12/6 a week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I admit that I had the old figure in mind and I accept the Minister's correction.  There has been a slight improvement, but while I am glad to acknowledge even that slight improvement in the scale, it was not at all sufficient to cover the increase in the cost of living which took place since the fixing of the original amount of 12/6.  I think that will be admitted by practically every member of the House.  Deputies have to face this fact, that we have a fairly big percentage of the population trying to live on this amount of money and, in these times of high prices and so on, it is utterly impossible for them to do so.  A man may do it for a short period, if there is a prospect before him of ultimately getting employment from which he can hope to obtain something in the nature of a reasonable wage, but the introduction of this Supplementary Estimate seems to me to suggest that the position is almost a despairing one, that there is very little prospect whatever of the <Col N="464" /> vast majority of these men getting anything other than temporary work, and that work merely a three or four days a week type, little removed from unemployment assistance itself.</P>
      <P>It is no pleasure to me to have to bring this matter before the House.  I have on numerous occasions stated what I think about it.  I think the Minister has a grave responsibility in the matter, a graver responsibility perhaps than any other member of the House, occupying the position he now occupies, could or would have, in view of his own statements.  I should certainly like to hear from him, and I hope I shall hear from him, that he has brighter hopes for the coming 12 months in regard to the unemployment situation than I can have in view of this Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The most striking feature of the original Estimate, as well as this Supplementary Estimate, is the extent to which the Government expects the ratepayers in certain areas to provide maintenance for the unemployed. This Government, and any other Government worthy of the name which cannot find work for a section of the population, should see to it that the maintenance of the unemployed, while looking for work, will be a national charge.  The local ratepayer should certainly not be expected to provide 50 per cent. of the total cost of maintenance.  In the original Estimate, the ratepayers in certain localities were expected to provide £720,000.  That has turned out to amount to only £652,000, leaving £68,000 to be provided.  Apart from that altogether, I think we are entitled to have from the Minister, especially when he asks for such a large increase, more details as to how it is he was so far out in the original Estimate.  Where have the 10,000 additional unemployed come from? Have they been discovered in the non-urbanised areas, that is, outside the boroughs and the urban council areas? Has a high percentage of the increased unemployed been found in the urban areas and the borough areas?  Let the Minister give us what figures he has, so that we may have a picture of the position and so that we may see where he erred in framing the original Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="465" /> Those of us who know anything about the extent to which emigration has been going on to England in the past year or two know perfectly well that the majority of those emigrating have come from the rural areas, and to whatever extent we have had emigration from those areas in the past couple of years, the Exchequer has been relieved by the fact that these people have gone to another country to find employment, or to impose themselves as an obligation on the country to which they have gone, in the event of their failing to find employment there.  I know that a certain amount of unemployment has been caused here and there, following the Trade Agreement with Great Britain, but so far as I can find out, the people who were thrown out of employment, following that agreement, were not thrown on the Unemployment Assistance Fund.  The majority of them, I am sure, were in benefit in the Unemployment Insurance Fund and were not thrown on unemployment assistance in the past year.  What percentage, at any rate, of the increased unemployed has been found in the rural areas as against the additional unemployed discovered during the course of the year in the urban areas and in the borough areas, and what is, mainly, the cause of the increase both in the rural as well as the urban and borough areas in the country?</P>
    <P>This Government cannot now complain that they are being hindered and hampered by Labour Deputies in this House and prevented from pursuing the policy that they told us they had for the relief of unemployment.  The Minister, and the Government at that time, told us that they had a plan for the cure of unemployment.  At any rate, they have a clear field now for the fulfilment of the promises they made in 1932, and they can put those promises into effect without any assistance from anybody here.  Let the Minister now produce the plan that was made in 1932.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">

      <P>Well, yes.  Of course certain things have occurred, in the years between, that might have upset that <Col N="466" /> plan, but whatever may have happened in those years there is nothing now to prevent the Minister from putting the plan into effect.  He has a complete majority of the House to enable him to put his plan into effect.  He has a clear field, not only to increase the number of the employed but, according to the plan they announced, to do away altogether with unemployment in this country.  I do not subscribe to the idea that the present rate of unemployment assistance is sufficient to maintain those who have to look for unemployment assistance either in rural or in urban and borough areas. From my experience&mdash;and I am sure that everybody here who has any knowledge of the matter will bear me cut&mdash;the unemployed and the destitute were treated in a far more generous manner when the question of relief was a matter of local rates than they are treated under this Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

      <P>I should like to remind the Deputy that the rates paid are statutory, and that it is not permissible to discuss Statutes on Estimates, either main or Supplementary Estimates.  Passing references may be made, but a discussion of the rates, or of the passing of the Acts concerned, is not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, Sir, I understand that, but I am only pointing out that when we look to the State for money for the purpose of giving work to the unemployed on relief works, we are told that the State cannot afford it. That is what we are told&mdash;that the State cannot afford it.  That is what we are told by this Christian-minded Government and by this Christian-minded Minister for Industry and Commerce.  They cannot find an additional £100,000 let us say, to provide more generous treatment for the unemployed, but they can find money for other purposes.  No money can be found for the constructive purpose of providing men with work&mdash;the State cannot afford it, we are told&mdash;but plenty of money can be found for destructive purposes.  The Minister, or the Government, cannot find money for constructive purposes, but when it comes to a question of getting money <Col N="467" /> for destructive purposes, this Government, with the bankers who are behind them, can provide plenty of money. However, I suppose we will hear more about that during the next few days when we are asked to vote the £850,000, odd, for implements of destruction.  Of course, the Minister has been treating the House very lightly, but I think that, after all, he should take the House into his confidence in this matter and give us some particulars as to where the additional unemployed have been found here, in spite of the fact that emigration to Great Britain is still going on. After all, if emigration to Great Britain is still going on, he is relieved to the extent, at any rate, of further burdens on the Unemployment Assistance Fund, and also relieved in other ways.  If the Minister were to give us a complete picture of present conditions, perhaps he would be able to give us a better reason for asking for this sum, or perhaps he might be able to give us some idea as to why the plans &mdash;which, I suggest, are now getting rusty&mdash;for the relief of unemployment, are not being put into effect.  Possibly, he might give us some idea as to when he is going to put his plan into effect for providing employment for our population rather than unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Davin, I should like to know why there is a deficiency in the amount of money expected from the urban councils.  It seems to me to be peculiar that there should be such a deficiency, in view of the Bill passed last year to enable urban authorities of a lesser population to make certain payments which would enable the unemployed in these areas to obtain higher unemployment assistance benefits.  In view of that fact, it seems peculiar to me that the amount now is less by £68,000 than what was estimated for.  As far as we can see, the valuation of urban areas has increased by reason of the number of houses that are being built for the working classes, and so on.  In this connection, perhaps I might mention a question that was asked in the House to-day about a man who was <Col N="468" /> cut off from unemployment assistance. The Minister's answer was that it was because the man concerned was transferred from a rural area to an urban area.  The case is concerned with Wexford.  Now, the position in this case is a very peculiar one, in so far as the man concerned had lived just outside an urban area&mdash;just outside Wexford.  He lived in one of a row of houses, 80 per cent. of which were inside the urban area and the rest of which were outside it.  A very severe storm occurred at Christmas, this man's house was blown down, and he had to seek refuge with friends inside the area.  Immediately that he did so, his unemployment assistance was stopped.  The Minister, in effect, says that he has no authority to deal with that case, but I submit that that is a case of absolute hardship.  It was bad enough for the man to lose his house, but it was worse to be victimised now to the extent of being cut off from unemployment assistance because he has had to take refuge in another house. Of course, I quite appreciate the reasons which cause the Minister to put that particular clause into the Act. The object of that clause was to prevent people coming in from rural areas to urban areas and trying to get unemployment assistance, and I think there was a three-months' disqualification inserted.  However, I submit that something ought to be done to enable the Minister to use his discretion in a case of that kind where there is very definite hardship.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I do not know, Sir, but I think that it should be possible to devise some method of dealing with cases of definite hardship such as this.  I think that the Minister himself will admit that it is a case of absolute hardship.  This man did not deliberately leave a rural area to seek work in an urban area, or to qualify for a higher benefit.  What happened was that circumstances, over which he had no control,&mdash;an act of God, so to speak,&mdash;forced him to live elsewhere, and I think that the <Col N="469" /> Minister should seek powers to enable him to deal with a case of that kind. As I say, it is a case of special hardship, and perhaps there might be some way in which this man's case could be met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very disappointing to find that, at this hour of the day, we have this application from the Minister. Certainly, there does not seem to be very much left of the Minister's earlier promises and hopes of the kind referred to by Deputy Davin.  When the Minister, at this stage, has to ask that a further sum of money should be devoted to this purpose, I think it is very discouraging to all of us, and particularly to the people down the country.  Deputy Davin referred to the inequity of asking ratepayers to make certain contributions towards the Unemployment Fund.  As a matter of fact, there is one side of this question which has been lost sight of altogether. It was something that I, at least, had hoped would remedy itself in the near future, but from to-day's Estimate I am afraid there is no hope left&mdash;that is, that the Government, in order to relieve unemployment, instead of putting that wonderful plan of theirs into operation raided and seized funds which belonged to the ratepayers under ordinary methods of administration. They have now allocated that fund in what they call E.S.V. grants all over the country, on condition that the ratepayers make a further contribution to these grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently we had a discussion about this at the Roscommon County Council, and there was some hope that perhaps the figure would decrease in the near future.  But I must say that it is very disappointing to find the Minister asking to-day for a further £175,000. There does not seem to be any hope left that the Fianna Fáil plan for the relief of unemployment is going to operate. Perhaps some of us never thought it would operate.  We certainly think that it is the responsibility of the Minister to find some solution for the situation other than compelling the ratepayers to come to his assistance and take the burden off his shoulders.  I protest against it, I have always done <Col N="470" /> so, and I shall continue to do so.  It is the Government's job, if it is anybody's; it is not the ratepayers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very difficult to give estimates relating to the number of unemployed which could be regarded as reliable, because the available information is always of doubtful origin. Therefore, it is important, when speaking of the number of unemployed or quoting statistics, that we should be quite clear to use these statistics in relation to the facts with which they deal and not to use terms loosely.  I am not saying that in reference to any Deputy, because I think that if there is any problem in relation to which it is important that the public, and particularly the members of the Dáil, should have accurate information, it is the problem of unemployment.  If we are going to get from the people, or from the House, the contribution, the sacrifice that will be necessary if adequate plans for dealing with unemployment are to be formulated, it is essential that the full facts should be known.  While I do not propose to discuss these plans now, or to deal in any elaborate way with the situation, I should like to get the facts clearly stated, at any rate, in relation to this Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fact that we have to bring in an increased Estimate is not in itself proof of anything, except that our original Estimate was too low.  We might, in fact, have estimated for a reduction in the number of unemployed, and be compelled to introduce a Supplementary Estimate now, which would by itself be proof of an increase in unemployment, or an increase in the number of persons receiving unemployment assistance, which is an entirely different matter But, in fact, we know that over a period during last year the number of persons receiving unemployment assistance&mdash;and I want to distinguish between persons receiving unemployment assistance and the unemployed&mdash;was increased.  About May, which was the worst period last year, it was 10,000 above the number for the corresponding date for the previous year; but it declined, until towards the end of the year there was no such <Col N="471" /> increase at all.  Now, that increase in the number of persons receiving unemployment assistance occurred simultaneously with an increase in the number of persons employed, and that is a factor which Deputies should not leave out of account.  According to the available statistics, there was a larger number of people in employment last year than in the previous year.  The number of unemployment insurance stamps was greater; the number of National Health Insurance stamps sold was greater; and, more interesting still, the average period of employment was longer last year than in the previous years.  I am making that statement on the basis of the estimated average number of contributions per individual.</P>

      <P>I can give you the figures for individual months.  I do not know whether I have the figures for the whole year.  The number of persons employed, on the average, on minor employment land reclamation schemes was practically the same, and on all relief schemes was 22,971&mdash;that was the average figure per month&mdash;in 1937, and 19,447 in 1938; a decrease of 3,524 in the average number employed monthly on relief schemes.</P>

      <P>I am quoting from a memorandum on employment and unemployment. This is the latest edition of it.  I am not sure that it has been published, but it is in print.  Copies have been furnished periodically to Deputies as they come out, and they will get a copy of this for themselves. That return shows that what I have said is correct.  I do not want Deputies to draw any wider conclusion from it than I do myself.  The number of persons employed on relief schemes was less, on the average, in the important months of the year.  The number of persons employed increased.  Judged by the number of stamps sold, the average number of persons employed weekly in 1937 was 253,000.  The average number employed weekly in 1938 was 257,000, judged by the number of stamps sold per individual.  The period of work, on the average, was longer in 1938 than in 1937.  At the same time, the number of persons receiving unemployment assistance was higher.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it has happened several times in the past six years that we have had an increase in unemployment and an increase in the number employed.  They had similar experiences in Great Britain.  I was trying to get some facts stated for the House in the hope that they would result in some appreciation of the problem with which we are dealing.  The facts are as I have stated.  There must be an explanation.  There is one consideration which Deputies should keep in mind&mdash;there is in this country a great number of people who come in and out of insurable employment as circumstances or their own interests dictate.  It is quite clear that we have not yet reached a position in which our live register statistics give us a clear picture of the number of unemployed. Deputies have made a lot of reference to the Fianna Fáil plan.  The Fianna Fáil plan was a simple one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil plan was that we should make at home the <Col N="474" /> goods we were importing and give employment thereby to our own people here.  We said on the figures of the unemployed then published that it was possible to put into work here all the people they had at that time on the unemployed register.  How many were then on the register?  The number was 30,000 odd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil plan said they would put 84,601 additional people in employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We said we could put into additional employment the number of people on the live register and when we came into office the number on the live register was 30,000.  Is that denied now?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as is known that was the number of unemployed in the country.  We did put 84,000 additional people into employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's Government put twice as many out of employment by their various policies since.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We put nobody out of employment.  It is quite clear that the live register of 1931, or in any previous year, was no more a picture of the unemployed than it was a picture of the moon or of the number of inhabitants in the moon.  But it was on the basis of that information that it was confidently asserted that it would be comparatively easy to create new employment to absorb that number of unemployed. But we absorbed three times that number into employment since.  There are still large numbers registered at the labour exchanges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not accept the figures on the register in 1931 as accurate.  He said at the time there were 100,000 unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that I did not accept those figures on that register. If there had been a live register in 1931, prepared upon the same basis as the live register to-day the total unemployed <Col N="475" /> then would be 250,000 people, or else people are coming into the country and going out of the country of whom we have no record. That is the only possible explanation if there is any sense in statistics at all. Our information is not yet complete. Last year we had an additional number of people on the register receiving unemployment assistance.  We do say that at that time the number of people employed had considerably increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot actually check up on anything.  There was the return of the additional people employed in the protected industries; upon works of construction and so on; the register at the exchanges and the sale of stamps.  All these things point in the same direction and it is fair to assume that when they are all pointing in the same direction they are pointing in the right direction.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>A very large proportion of those on relief works are not required to stamp their cards at all.  I am not saying that the amount of work given under the relief schemes has a direct bearing upon the employment statistics but there was a smaller number of people employed on relief schemes.  In 1938, the number of unemployed, according to our statistics, increased.  It is quite clear that we have still an unemployment problem of considerable magnitude.  That is a problem that cannot be settled by making debating points across the floor here.  If we are to get that problem tackled on the right lines, we have first to make sure that we know all about it and that is what we have <Col N="476" /> been trying to get definite information on, so that the public would appreciate the need there was for the impositions put upon the taxpayers and the ratepayers in order to alleviate the hardships of the unemployed.</P>
      <P>Deputies Brennan and Davin have been objecting to any impositions on the ratepayers of special areas for the purpose of the unemployment assistance schemes.  The Deputy says that we are charged with the responsibility for making some provision for meeting the needs of the destitute through unemployment, and that the responsibility for that duty rests upon the Government.  I agree with him.  We are setting out to rectify that position. But the Government, in dealing with that matter, must not put one citizen who is destitute by reason of unemployment in a better position than another citizen.  Consequently the Government scheme should provide for a flat rate of unemployment assistance all round, or a rate which would be the same for a man living in Dublin, Wexford, or in a rural area.  But Deputies must recognise that the provision which would be necessary to help a man in a rural area would be altogether inadequate for a man in a large town or city.  Consequently, it was decided that these rates should be supplemented, first of all in respect of a number of the larger towns, and, secondly, in respect of the cities.  But we did say the additional cost of providing unemployment assistance over and above the standard national rate should be provided, not by the taxpayers in general, but by the special communities which are getting the benefit of that assistance.  That is why this Appropriation-in-Aid on this Vote appears, and why this charge is put upon local authorities.  The sole purpose of that charge is to enable these higher rates of benefit to be paid in the areas from which the charge is collected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain local authorities have contested the basis upon which the amount was assessed.  The question was whether they were to pay upon the basis of their total valuation or to <Col N="477" /> deduct in respect of property that was not productive of rates.  Some authorities failed to pay the full amount we claimed, by reason of the fact that they were not required to do it, and this year local authorities have deducted from the current payment the amount they claim for overpayment.</P>

      <P>We are rectifying that matter in this Estimate.  We have a Supplementary Estimate in order to get the position right.  I do not think that on this Appropriation we can discuss plans for dealing with the unemployment problem as a whole.  I think it would be more suitable to do so on some such occasion as a Vote on Account or on the Central Fund Bill, or on a discussion on the main Estimates, when Government policy can be debated freely, or through a motion by the Opposition.  There is no desire on my part to shirk any such discussion, provided it is a question of ways and means to alleviate the position, and not merely the allocation of blame.  I think that we can, in our circumstances at the present time, afford to forget Party differences, because we all have a common aim.  If we have, we may be able to agree on a method of working which need not take into account the fundamental differences in policy that divide us on tariffs or something like that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The plan has produced the results that we claimed for it.  It has produced even greater results than we expected.  Some Deputy asked for the districts in which the greatest increase in the number of unemployed occurred.  It would perhaps be true to say that the increase was general all round.  The statistics are affected to some extent by the distribution of relief work and to some extent <Col N="478" /> by other causes.  On a particular date, namely, the 28th November, 1938, as compared with the 29th November, 1937, the position then was that there had been an increase of approximately 18 per cent. in the number of persons registered in the four county boroughs, a small increase of 4 per cent. in the rest of Leinster, a decrease of 0.2 per cent. in the rest of Munster, a decrease of 14.3 per cent. in Connaught, and a decrease of 23.3 per cent. in the three Ulster counties.  If the position on the date were typical of the position throughout the whole of the year, it could be said that there was a substantial decrease in the number registered in the West and Northern Counties, and a substantial increase in the county boroughs, but that would be a rash conclusion to jump to&mdash;that the figures for that date were typical throughout the year.  On that particular date the position was that the total for 1938 was 1.3 per cent. less than in 1937. Abnormal circumstances prevailed here last year.  One must not leave out of account the abnormal trade position following the London Agreement of last April, which undoubtedly affected employment in a number of occupations. Due to it a substantial increase was recorded in April and May.  The number of persons registered can be said to be due perhaps to temporary circumstances which have since ceased to operate to some extent.</P>

I was quoting figures of the number of persons in employment and the number of persons registered.  I was quoting the yearly average figure. That figure has no relation to the circumstances in April, May or November or to any other particular period. I have given one explanation of the figures.  It may not be the right explanation but I want the figures to be understood.</P>

The Deputy knows that it is necessary that we should have some restriction upon the free movement of persons, drawing unemployment assistance, from rural into borough or urban areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because of the higher rate of payment involved in the one case.  No matter where we fix the boundary there is bound to be some person living just inside, or just outside of it, who will have a grievance.  The Deputy mentioned a very hard case.  I appreciate the hardship which the circumstances involved for that individual, but there is no way out of it so far as the law is concerned.  That is the law. A person is entitled to one rate if he lives in a rural area, and to a different rate of he lives in a borough or urban area.  A person living in a rural area, if he transfers to another area, is not entitled to draw unemployment assistance for a period of time.  In this particular case the person lived outside the area, only a few yards outside of it, and went to live a few yards inside. The general rule with regard to this is good, even though it worked harshly in his case.  There must be some restriction. The only way you could deal with a case such as this is to give some discretion to the Minister.  That, obviously, would be opening the door to grave dangers.  Even if the exercise of that discretion was controlled as carefully as possible, you would still get people to believe that a preference was being given to one person or another, and that it was being given for political <Col N="480" /> or other reasons.  I am afraid that if you were to do that you would be creating a very dangerous position.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate calls <Col N="481" /> for provision being made under four new sub-heads.  I propose to deal with these in order.</P>
    <P>Sub-head A (7)&mdash;Expenses of withdrawal of volunteers of Irish nationality from Spain.  The sum of £400 provided for under sub-head A (7) is required to meet the cost of withdrawing a number of volunteers of Irish nationality from Spain, in accordance with arrangements made, towards the end of last year, by the Non-Intervention Committee.  As a member of the Non - Intervention Committee, we agreed to the withdrawal plan drawn up by the committee last July.  The plan embodied a scheme whereby combatants of other than Spanish nationality engaged on one side or the other in the Spanish civil conflict would be gradually withdrawn from Spain.  It was found impossible to put the withdrawal plan into operation in the exact form in which it had been approved by the committee; but, when a limited arrangement on similar lines was put into operation at the end of last year, we agreed to fall in with it so far as volunteers of Irish nationality who had left this country for Spain after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, were concerned.  Under this arrangement, we became responsible for the cost of transferring the men concerned from the Spanish frontier to this country.  The cost is estimated at about £10 per man.  So far, 18 volunteers have been returned to this country under the scheme, and the total number to be transferred is not expected to exceed 30.</P>
    <P>Sub - head A (8) &mdash; Contribution towards the Expenses of the Inter-Governmental Committee on the Austro-German Refugee Question.  The sum of £195 provided for in sub-head A (8) is required to meet our contribution towards the expenses of the Inter-Governmental Committee on Austro-German Refugees.  The committee owes its existence to the conference which met at Evian last summer, on the invitation of the United States Secretary of State, to discuss ways and means of dealing with the refugee problem.  Ireland was one of the 30 Governments represented at the conference, which, after a week's deliberation, decided to set up this standing <Col N="482" /> committee, which has its headquarters in London and the Chairman of which is an American, Mr. Rublee. The functions of the committee are to undertake negotiations with the Governments concerned with a view to improving the conditions under which the exodus of refugees from certain countries is taking place, and with a view to developing opportunities for permanent settlement.  The work of the Inter-Governmental Committee necessitates a secretarial staff, the cost of which is divided among the Governments represented on the committee on a basis of so many units each, very much as is done in the League of Nations.  Our contribution is ten units out of a total of 571 units.  In addition to our contribution to the expenses of this committee, provision is made in the present Estimate for our share of the expenses of the Evian Conference itself.  Our share of these expenses amounts to 280 Swiss francs, say, £14.</P>
    <P>Sub - head A (9)&mdash;Contribution towards the Expenses of the International Commission for the Assistance of Child Refugees in Spain.  The sum of £2,000 provided for under this sub-head is required to enable the Government to make a contribution to the funds of an international organisation set up for the purpose of relieving the terrible privations which thousands of children in Spain are suffering in consequence of the civil war.  The commission is an entirely international body with its headquarters at Geneva. It co-ordinates the work of a number of bodies such as the &ldquo;Save the Children International Union&rdquo;, the &ldquo;Friends' Service Council&rdquo;, and other official and voluntary relief organisations concerned with the provision of shelter, food and clothing for children in Spain rendered homeless as a result of the civil conflict in that country.  The objects of the commission are exclusively humanitarian.  Its work covers the whole of Spain.  Reports received in the Department testify to the enormity of its task and the value of the work it is doing.  The International Commission carried out its work with the help of a fund to which a large number of Governments (including the Australian, Belgian, Danish, French, British, Italian, New Zealand, Norwegian, <Col N="483" /> South African, and Swedish) have already contributed.  The British Government has contributed £60,000; the Australian £2,500, the Swedish £88,000, the United States Government gave a contribution in kind of £50,000 and Canada has, so far, given £2,000. As Deputies will see by the note attached to the Estimate, a first contribution of £1,000 has already been made on behalf of this country out of the Contingency Fund.  This amount will be repaid to the Contingency Fund out of the present provision of £2,000.  Since this Estimate was framed, the situation in Spain, has, of course, assumed an entirely new aspect. Areas which were previously the centre of war-like operations are now under the control of the Nationalist Government, and food supplies, the lack of which caused the distress which it is the business of the International Commission to relieve, may, therefore, soon be restored to normal.  The Estimate provides, however, for a further contribution of £1,000 being made if it should appear that conditions involving further calls on the commission's resources continue to exist.</P>
    <P>Sub-head A (10) &mdash; Promotion of Cultural Relations with Other Countries. The provision of £150 under sub-head A (10) marks the beginning of an effort to make our national culture more widely known and appreciated abroad, particularly in America.  The plans for our participation in this year's New York Fair provide for exhibits explaining our cultural traditions and the results which contemporary efforts to restore a national culture in this country have already achieved.  It is proposed to supplement this section of our exhibit at the World's Fair by an arrangement enabling three or four lecturers to visit the United States this year to lecture on different aspects of our national culture, past and present. Consideration is also being given to a further arrangement whereby the works of eminent Irish scholars and writers, such, for example, as the publications of the Irish Manuscripts Commission, would be brought directly under the notice of the American librarians, with a view to the strengthening <Col N="484" /> of the Irish sections in university and other libraries in the United States.  The arrangement would provide in each case for the payment of travelling and subsistence expenses on the usual official scale, subject to a certain maximum expenditure.  The present Estimate is required to cover the cost, in the current financial year, of an arrangement on these lines in the case of Dr. Seamus Delargy, Hon. Director of the Irish Folklore Commission. One or two other similar arrangements are in contemplation. The effort to be made in the present year is intended to be only a beginning. It is hoped, however, that it will lay the foundations for an organisation for the development of cultural relations between this country and the United States on a permanent footing. The development of such relations should be regarded as one of the most important of a State's external activities.  Most Governments devote a considerable amount of money and attention to this kind of work.  Apart from other considerations, it tends to promote trade and foster tourist traffic.  There are the further advantages in our case that it would tend in time to stimulate higher scholarship here and promote the wider circulation of official publications such as those of the Irish Manuscripts Commission. While it is thus a matter in which the Government is justified in giving a lead, success will depend, in a final analysis, on the degree of effort and support forthcoming from other than official sources.</P>
    <P>The total provision required under the four sub-heads is £2,745.  Against this total, there is to be set off savings amounting to sub-head B (1) (Salaries, Wages and Allowances) of the Vote for External Affairs for the current financial year.  The net supplementary provision required, therefore, is £1,745.</P>
    <P>As it is a matter in which Deputies have from time to time evinced a keen interest, I think I should avail of this occasion to refer to our recognition of the Nationalist Government in Spain. As the Deputies will have learned, the Irish Government on Saturday last, the 11th February, recognised General Franco's Government as the Government of Spain.  When speaking in this <Col N="485" /> House on the 27th November, 1936, on the question of recognition, I said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If you recognise a new Government you should recognise it when there is some clear indication of stability, some clear indication that the Government will be able to speak on behalf of the nation of which it is the Government....  As a prudent rule recognition is not given before there is a fair hope of stability.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>After the recent events in Spain, it became apparent that the establishment of General Franco's authority over the whole of Spain was only a question of a short time.  Further resistance could not, it appeared to us, affect the result, and further delay in recognition might only tend to encourage the continuance of a vain struggle involving further loss of life.  The question we had to ask ourselves was this: Was General Franco's authority now definitely paramount in Spain or was it likely to be so in the immediate future?  If we came to the affirmative conclusion, as we did, then our duty was to give immediate recognition. Once he had reached a position of supreme authority or a position which was potentially that, the question of non-intervention was no longer at issue and the <i>de facto</i> Government of Spain acquired a natural right to be recognised in law as the Government of that country.</P>

      <P>I might explain that as it is a matter of current interest, and as it was a matter upon which Deputies on the opposite benches particularly had evinced an interest, I thought it right, as a matter of courtesy to the House, to mention it in connection with External Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite understand the attitude of the Taoiseach, <Col N="486" /> and I thank him for conveying this to the House.  I would have appreciated it more if it had come directly to the House like this rather than come through the channels of the newspapers, as it did in a general kind of way last Saturday.  I do appreciate the fact that the Taoiseach makes this formal announcement to the House.  I must admit that the Whip of our Party had a question on this matter which was to be answered yesterday.  I do not say&mdash;far be it from me to say so&mdash; that that had the slightest influence on the Government's decision about the recognition.  I would be very slow to believe that.  Nothing that we could urge would help the recognition.  But possibly the announcement on Saturday, when it was stated in the Press that Deputy Peadar Doyle had a question on recognition&mdash;had not the time come for the recognition of Franco's Government&mdash;had some effect.  Before this question could be put to the House we had a hasty announcement&mdash;I hope I am not contradicting myself&mdash;all too long delayed, from the Department of External Affairs&mdash;or was it from the Government Publicity Department, which I would like to see occasionally doing something?</P>
      <P>As the House knows, we have pressed for this recognition for a long time and, very belated though it is, we certainly are glad that the Government at last have made up their minds to recognise, as I gather from the Taoiseach, the Government of General Franco, at least as the <i>de facto</i> Government.  I did not gather, and I think he will agree that I may be excused if I did not gather, whether there was an indication that he was recognising it as a <i>de jure</i> Government.  I think the Taoiseach said it might be natural to recognise the persons who had become the <i>de facto</i> Government, but whether he is recognising them as a <i>de jure</i> Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not catch the words that he was recognising it as the <i>de jure</i> Government.  Do I understand that that involves the formal withdrawal of our representative to the previous Government?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we in this position then, that our representative is still accredited to the head of the State with which Dr. Negrin is connected? It is so very hard to phrase a question of this kind, because our ambassador is accredited to the head of one State.  Is he still accredited to him and at the same time accredited to Franco?  I gather from the Taoiseach that if there has been no formal withdrawal, our representative is no longer accredited to the Government that have control in Madrid and Valencia. Though the position is a little obscure, that is at least an advance and, so far as we on this side of the House are concerned, we greet it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach said that by the end of last week it had become clear that in reality Franco was in effective command in the greater portion of Spain and anything that would be done by the other side would not change the situation.  I might say that to a number of people who have followed European affairs it was equally clear by last Saturday, or by the end of last week, that a certain number of other Governments, who shall be nameless&mdash; I do not want to introduce any element of controversy into this debate&mdash;were also making up their minds to recognise the Government of Franco, and it might strike a suspicious person&mdash;I am not one, luckily&mdash;that, just as the Department of External Affairs hurried into the Press to forestall Deputy Doyle's question, our Government was hurriedly acting, so that nobody could possibly accuse them that they were following the example of bigger Governments. They were following them, so to speak, beforehand, judging by the information coming through the Press for the last week.  At last we have recognition.  We cannot claim the credit for it, but we can say that we advocated this quite a considerable time ago and we think it would have been well for the fame of this country had the step been taken then.  It is now taken, when it can no longer be denied.  There, again, I think we are following the example of other countries that possibly might like to <Col N="488" /> retrace some of the steps they have taken in the last couple of years.</P>
    <P>There are other matters dealt with in this Vote.  I will take the last first, namely, the one for the promotion of culture.  I think everybody will be in full agreement with the Taoiseach in connection with that particular matter. If I were making any criticism at all, it would be that this provision is too small, and I do not think that would be a fair criticism, because I understood from the President that this is only a first step; that it is, so to speak, an earnest of what may develop into something larger.  I think the £150 is meant only to cover certain expenses up to the 31st March this year, and therefore any criticism on account of the smallness of the amount would be out of place.  I gathered that there would be further development in this direction.  Even if you limit it to one of the things mentioned by the Taoiseach, the sending of four lecturers to America, it is quite obvious that £150 would not cover the expenses of four men delivering lectures in America unless that amount were supplemented by the proceeds from the lectures, and, I presume, that is not the intention.  I want to say, simply, that we welcome it very sincerely.</P>
    <P>Just before that there is an item of £2,000, and in connection with that I confess that I am in a certain amount of doubt owing to the use of the word &ldquo;refugee.&rdquo;  From the information that is conveyed in the White Paper, giving the details of the Estimate, I understood that the word &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; meant a refugee from Spain, but I gather that is not so.  Perhaps the Taoiseach would enlighten us.  It is exceedingly difficult to discuss an Estimate of this kind without knowing what is the precise purpose of the Vote.  Does it apply to children all of whom are now in Spain and who are merely refugees from their normal homes?  It does not apply, then, to any children who have come out of Spain, and it does not make any provision for children who are refugees from Spain.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The main portion, as indicated in the statement I made, is provided for children who are in Spain, who are homeless.  I have just been <Col N="489" /> informed that there may be some few cases of those who are not in Spain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Who looks after these children?  I take it for granted that a certain amount of the £2,000 will be spent on the support of children who have left Spain.  In whose care are they? What care is taken of their religious welfare, for instance?  The Taoiseach will remember the amount of controversy there was in England a couple of years ago when a number of Basque children were brought into England. There was complaint, what often seemed well-founded complaint, about the failure to look after the religious interests of these children.  I have nothing at all against the proposal, nor do I object to the amount.  On the contrary, the Taoiseach knows well that there will be no objection from that point of view as far as we are concerned, but I should like an assurance that, if we are in an international organisation of this kind, we shall not have complaints such as were raised in the case I have instanced.</P>
      <P>I know that when children were brought as refugees to England from the Basque portion of the country, which at that time was gradually being cleared by Franco, they were put into camps in England, and there was considerable complaint, very bitter complaint very often, from the Catholic authorities in England, that proper facilities were not given for these children to get proper religious instruction and even proper religious consolation. I do not know whether that aspect of the matter has occurred to the Taoiseach or to the Department of External Affairs.  It applies possibly more to children who have left Spain. Seeing that they have left their homes in Spain, that they are refugees, that they are no longer under the control of their parents, I put it forward, as a thing requiring examination, that the Government which is contributing to this particular fund should see that there are no legitimate grounds for complaint on the score I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Taoiseach was dealing with sub-head A (8), I should have liked <Col N="490" /> if he had been in the position to give us some information&mdash;not about the fact that such a conference was set up, or that we were a party to it.  I quite admit that it is only proper that we should bear our proportion of the expenses of that conference, the secretariat connected with it and all its work, but I should have thought that the Taoiseach might have availed of the opportunity, fully in order and fully within the Vote, to tell us what progress has been made with these unfortunate people, the numbers of whom it is impossible to calculate, and the numbers of whom are going to increase every day, presenting an almost insoluble problem.  What is the present position?  How far has there been any real approach even to the fringe of the problem?  I remember, quite as long as six months ago, reading statements by some of these refugees on the Continent and in Continental papers, about the way in which they were practically kicked about from one nation to another.  I know the extreme difficulty of the problem, but the Taoiseach should tell us whether that conference that was set up at Evian has been really productive of anything.  I understand that suggestions have been put forward so far as the Jews in Germany are concerned, but these, I take it, are only portion of the refugees to be dealt with.  I do not know exactly even what their position is.  The problem is an extremely grave one.  I realise perfectly well that we cannot, or ought not, take up the very easy position that a number of people are inclined to take, and say &ldquo;What is it to us?&rdquo; If we are a nation, claiming to be a nation among other nations, then we should have a certain amount of responsibility, just as every other country has.  We cannot take up the position, taken up on a celebrated occasion before, and say that we are not our brothers' keepers.  We have obligations to humanity, and if we are taking part in affairs of that kind, perhaps we might be told what progress is being made.</P>
    <P>Coming upwards to the last item in the Estimate, can the Taoiseach tell me, perhaps off-hand now, from which side of the fighting in Spain are these volunteers being repatriated at the <Col N="491" /> moment?  Technically from both, I understand, but in fact, from which side are they being repatriated?</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">

      <P>Before the Taoiseach concludes, I should like to underline what Deputy Professor O'Sullivan has said in regard to sub-head A. (9).  The note refers to the contribution towards the expenses of the commission in connection with the provision of meals, etc., for refugee children in Spain. Everyone will be very glad to endorse any activities by which our Government contributes to the relief of the sufferings of any children whose homes may be on the fighting lines of the civil war in Spain, and I have no doubt that any assistance we may be in a position to offer will be welcomed by the Nationalist Government in Spain, but it is necessary to bear in mind that the conditions of children in Spain have been made for some considerable time an active vehicle of Communist propaganda throughout the world, and, in this matter, Communist propaganda has been very much more effective than the propaganda emanating from Burgos.  Everybody here, including myself&mdash;or anybody here who has travelled in England or the United States of America recently&mdash;has heard interested parties using the conditions of children in Spain for the purpose of blackening and defaming the good name of the forces of the Nationalist Government.  It has been suggested that they have been cruelly bombed and savagely pursued, and that they have been made the object of attack deliberately for the purpose of <Col N="492" /> demoralising the forces of the Barcelona Government.  I have myself heard harrowing descriptions of the ferocity with which Nationalist air planes bombarded children on the streets of Barcelona.  I began to believe them myself.  But when the Nationalist forces took Barcelona it was discovered that Barcelona had scarcely been bombarded at all; the only part which had been bombarded was the harbour and docks, where children would not ordinarily be.  I think, therefore, that, while we would very properly co-operate in any way we could in relieving the sufferings of children, no matter what side their parents took in the struggle, we ought to be continually on our guard to ensure that the name of Ireland is not used to lend credence to propaganda put out by a variety of international bodies concerned in fact to praise the Barcelona Government, or what was the Barcelona Government, and to decry the recognised Government of General Franco in Spain at the present time.</P>
      <P>I do not know why the Taoiseach is so reluctant to state quite categorically what he proposes to do about our representative at present accredited to President Azana.  The Government of President Azana is no longer in our eyes a Government at all.  I take it that that representative is under certain instructions; that certain documents have issued under the Great Seal of this country, and that some steps must be taken at some stage to cancel those documents.  I do not know if that is according to precedent.  Perhaps the Taoiseach or the Minister for External Affairs would outline what the precedents are.  I think it is necessary, seeing that at this eleventh hour recognition has been extended by this country to the true Government in Spain, that no ambiguity should be allowed to continue, and that no recognised document of this State should be allowed to continue in existence accrediting a representative of ours to the Communist Government in Spain, the existence of which we no longer recognise <i>de jure</i> or <i>de facto.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My friend and colleague Deputy Professor O'Sullivan has gloried in the fact that he is not a suspicious man.  I am. When I see £150 provided for the promotion <Col N="493" /> of cultural relations with other countries, and read in the note that this is to provide travelling and subsistence allowances for lectures in the U.S.A.  I get suspicious immediately. When I read that in the knowledge that the Taoiseach is himself going on a rampage next spring, I wonder will those lecturers devote most of their time to the culture of Ireland in the Middle Ages, or will they begin to explain that as soon as we got a Christian Constitution in this country learning and wisdom and erudition had blossomed in the land; that there may be a few in the audience who are unaware of the inspired genius responsible for this Constitution, but that, if there be such, they propose to enlighten their ignorance by telling them that the source of all those blessings on the Irish race is none other than that great man, Eamon de Valera.  Dramatic pause, followed by loud and prolonged applause, whereupon the Stars and Stripes and the Green White and Yellow Tricolour fall from the back of the stage, revealing a six-foot portrait of the self-same Eamon de Valera, smiling down on the cultural relations that exist between this country and the United States of America.  Does the Taoiseach consider my suspicions ill-founded? I do not think they are. Who is going to choose the lecturers? What are they going to talk about?  Is the same regrettable confusion between Queen Elizabeth and the Taoiseach that we saw before going to arise in the minds of those men concerned to enlighten the American public?  I had occasion to refer earlier to-day to the historic occasion when the Taoiseach summoned the &ldquo;March of Time&rdquo; to this State for the purpose of demonstrating what had happened in this country since we were blessed by the arrival of the Fianna Fáil Government. I see the Taoiseach is quite amazed.  He has never heard of the &ldquo;March of Time&rdquo;.  He cannot think what I am referring to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I often pity him in this wicked world, so innocent a child battling with the evil wiles of nasty detractors all around him, and I would remind him that our mutual friend and <Col N="494" /> acquaintance Niccolo Machiavelli has advised the assumption of that exterior in every crisis.  I will refresh the Taoiseach's memory.  He presented a very creditable appearance I must say sitting at the top of the Executive Council table.  I cannot say quite the same for some of his Ministers, but, if we concentrate on the head of the table, he presented a very creditable appearance, and made a very modest claim for fame.  He then handed the running over to the commentator, and there was a selection of pictures of Trinity College, Guinness's Brewery, and the Shannon Electricity Works, and we were led to believe as we sat lost in admiration that the modest gentleman who had introduced the proceedings from the head of the Cabinet table had just tossed those off as a few of his achievements during his term of office, and that they were only a promise of what was to come.  Then we were led back to the Cabinet room; there was a further modest observation and I think, a blessing in Irish was imparted to us, and the lights went up. I wonder if the cultural relations of Ireland with the United States are going to be promoted along those lines, because if they are I do not think this £150 is going to be well spent.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will take us into his confidence, and tell us who is going to choose the lecturers, or what are they going to talk about?  Are they going to start their campaign before the Taoiseach's tour?  Are they going to be held as a rod in pickle to revive the enthusiasm for Ireland that the Taoiseach's visit is calculated to stir up, or will they be precursors of the prophet about to arrive?  Those are facts on which I should like to be enlightened before I give unqualified approval to the expenditure of even this modest sum on the four lecturers. How four lecturers are going to tour the United States of America on £150 I do not know.  I think it will be very hard for one lecturer to get very far with that in America.  These are facts upon which the Taoiseach may enlighten us, before we are asked to grant this money, and I do not think he should fail to do so.</P>

      <P>The bulk of <Col N="495" /> this Estimate deals with the situation which has arisen owing to the civil war in Spain.  I am glad that in this fashion, a long time after it should have been done, the Taoiseach and the Executive Council have finally recognised the Government of General Franco in Spain.  Of course, that should have been done months and months ago.  It should have been done at the time it was urged from this side of the House, when we took up that attitude.  But, just as in the Abyssinian affair, I made a remark that the Minister for External Affairs had tamely followed a British lead, he is almost tamely following the British lead at present, except that he is rather emulating, I think, the wren in one of the oldest stories in the world. The birds had a competition as to which should be king, and the eagle got up higher than the others and proudly proclaimed: &ldquo;I am the king.&rdquo;&ldquo;Oh, no, not at all,&rdquo; said the little wren, taking a flutter, &ldquo;I am higher than you.&rdquo;  Now we find that the Executive Council here are just precisely playing the part of the wren to Mr. Chamberlain's eagle.  We got no recognition of General Franco's Government here, until we saw in all the newspapers that Britain and France are going to recognise the Franco Government.  Then, immediately, comes the little wren saying: &ldquo;Oh, I am just there a day or two in front of them.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no thought of their own, and no deliberate taking a line, as this country should have taken a line, at a time when it would be of real importance. There was no taking a line, and no taking a definite stand on the side of right, on the side of justice, and on the side of humanity, until right, justice and humanity had won, without our assistance, and without our moral help or moral support.  I am glad to see, no matter whether it is late in the day or not, that at the eleventh hour this Government has come in and recognised the Christian forces in Spain as being the true, legitimate and lawful Government of that country.  For the future, I wish that when questions of great international importance are at stake, when the welfare of the whole <Col N="496" /> world is at stake, and when great principles are being battled for, that our State would have the courage to express its own opinion, to think for itself, and not to wait until we have got a lead from other nations.  I have nothing more to add to this debate, except to re-echo what Deputy Dillon said, and sincerely to hope that, when propagandists from this country go to the United States, they will be propagandists for the country, and not propagandists for one particular Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained several times in the last couple of years what our attitude was with regard to recognition of a Government in Spain.  I said that the best thing that could be done for Spain was to keep out of interfering in Spain.  I believe that the interference of foreign Powers in Spain was bad for Spain, and was dangerous for the world, as a whole.  That has been our policy and was known to be our policy, and very largely because that was the policy of a number of States which we supported, we have got, at present, to a situation in which the Spanish conflict did not develop into a general European conflict.  Of course, there are people who talk about our being the wren.  We are the eagle at one period in international affairs and only the wren in another.  If our attitude is that until now it was that of the wren then it could be only that during the conflict.</P>

      <P>The Deputy wants to have it his way all the time, whatever way it went.  We have either influenced international affairs or we have not.  Whatever has been our influence it has been towards directing and supporting those who stood for a policy of non-intervention in Spain. No matter what our sympathies may be, we believed that was in the best interests of Spain, and in the best interests of Europe.  We believed we would be greater friends, and that the Spanish people will recognise that that has been our national attitude.  Of course, we know that Deputies on the opposite side urged another course. If they had been on these benches perhaps they would not have urged <Col N="497" /> that, if they had responsibility for it. We are not in any way dissatisfied with the policy we have pursued.  We believe that policy was right.</P>
      <P>I indicated several times that, according as the Nationalist Government got more and more authority over territory in Spain, of necessity, the <i>de facto</i> position would have to be recognised. We recognised it, as our Minister in Spain was in closer touch with the Burgos Government during the whole of that conflict, than he was able to be with the other side.  That is true.  We made various representations of one kind or another to both Governments but, in the main, we have been in closer touch with General Franco's Government, and with General Franco, than with the other side.  The attitude which we took up is this, that, in the main, our recognition is that of the people and the State, and that recognition was given to the people and the Government which represented the people at that time.  When our recognition was given in the first instance, the Government at that time was the Government that had been elected, and that appeared to represent the Spanish people.  There was a revolt by a large portion of Spanish nationals, and civil war ensued.</P>
      <P>I believed that the Spanish people, if left to themselves, were quite capable of settling the matter, that they would settle it in a way which was satisfactory to themselves and which would be a lasting settlement.  If a settlemore glad than I, but let us by outside force either the outside force would have to continue keeping the side it was helping uppermost, or, if that was not in accordance with the will of the Spanish people, when that force would be withdrawn, the will of the Spanish people would assert itself. I was for letting Spain settle its internal difficulties and I believe that if that was done the conflict would have been over much earlier.  Our influence has been on the side of trying to keep out foreign interference in Spain and trying to bring about a situation in which the Spanish conflict was not going to develop into a general European conflict.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="498" /> As I say, I am satisfied that that policy has been a right one and our recent recognition is in accordance with the principles which we laid down long ago.  Everybody knows that, with the taking of Barcelona, the situation changed completely in its aspect as far as the ultimate prospect of one side getting to a position of undisputed authority was concerned.  That position, in our opinion, has been reached.  It is suggested, of course, that the fact that Deputies on the opposite benches put down a question affected our attitude.  If we had not been affected by the attitude of Deputies over a period of two years, the fact that they were going to ask us another question was not going to affect us.  If we want to be talking about suspicion, I have just as much right to be suspicious that Deputy Doyle, seeing the situation was a suitable one to ask another question, tried to rush in with his question.  That would be just as likely to be true as the suggestion that we were trying to anticipate him, or some question put down by him, asking if it affected our attitude.  It did not.</P>
    <P>We are told, of course, that we were affected by what is going to be the British attitude or the attitude of Britain and France together.  I do not know what is going to influence their attitude or what they may actually decide to do or when they may decide to do it. What I do know is this, that, if there is for any length of time a <i>de facto</i> Government, if a national Government is going to establish itself <i>de facto</i>, inevitably, other States will have to recognise that fact and accept them as the <i>de jure</i> or lawful Government of the country, because they cannot possibly otherwise protect the interests which diplomatic relations are established to protect.  Therefore, our recognition was given, and I indicated more than a year ago, I think it was, that the moment this situation would arise, this recognition would be given.  As I say, I do not know what is going to be the British attitude, or what is going to be the French attitude, but I do know that, of necessity, recognition would have to be given the moment the Nationalist Government is in undisputed authority.  The principles that <Col N="499" /> other Governments will act upon are the very principles we are acting upon. One might as well say we gave this recognition because Holland or Switzerland was going to do it.  In this matter, and in the other matters, we have acted solely on our view of what Irish interests involved, and the merits of the particular events in regard to recognition or not, whether it was in the case of Abyssinia or in this case. Now, with regard to the question of the children&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>An act of formal withdrawal is not necessary.  I do not know, in fact, if the President of the other Government is actually in Spain at all.  Any formal act of withdrawal is not necessary so long as the mere fact of acknowledging the other Government is in itself withdrawal of recognition of the Negrin Government.  Negotiations have to take place with regard to the presentation of credentials and so on.  The usual formalities will have to be observed in that case as in any other, with regard to the accrediting of the new Minister, but there is no need, in the circumstances, for any other formal act of withdrawal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the children, I am not aware that there is any number of children who are outside Spain beyond those who are immediately across the French border.  Neither am I aware that there are large numbers of them who have been taken away from their parents.  The point is that the children were particularly suffering.  Those who had to move away with their parents were particularly suffering in both parts.  There have been stations established, not merely in the part that was recently under the control of the Barcelona Government, but in the part controlled by the Nationalist Government, and in both cases children were relieved because, in the course of a conflict <Col N="500" /> of this kind, various foodstuffs which are particularly necessary for children were lacking, and this help that has been given was mainly of a material kind, to give children the type of food which was not obtainable owing to war conditions.</P>
    <P>It is a very proper question to ask if the children were taken away from their parents.  The information, as far as I am concerned, is that the case is not a case like the Basque children who were taken away into another country.  I have got no information that there is anything parallel to that taking place in this case.  Money or food and help were given by visiting committees who visited the various areas and who provided mainly food for the children.</P>
    <P>With respect to the work that has been done by the Evian Committee, there have been various projects put forward and offers in Australia and elsewhere which may cover, it is suggested, about 100,000 persons, but there has not been anything like what we would regard as satisfactory progress made with that problem.  As the Deputy who raised the question said himself, it is an extremely difficult problem to handle.  There are not many places where such large numbers of refugees can be established, and all that has been done is that there is a committee in touch with the various Governments trying to regulate both the exodus and the re-establishment where they can get an opportunity, or where offers are made.  In our own case we could offer nothing of importance in regard to a place for refugees. Deputies know that in our own country there is not land enough to go round to those who are looking for it.  Consequently, we are unable to offer any place of refuge to the committee or to put it at their disposal.  There is some voluntary work being done by committees here of a slightly different kind, but we could not, and our representative made it quite clear that, whilst we were prepared to help in this way by participating in the conference, we were not able to make any really valuable contribution to the solution of the problem by giving territory or land in which the refugees could settle.  The <Col N="501" /> work is continuing and, as I say, from the reports I have received, I cannot say I believe that really satisfactory progress, or what we could call satisfactory progress, has been made.</P>
    <P>The question of the lecturers has been raised by Deputy Dillon.  I gave the reason.  Of course, I am not responsible for the vagaries of Deputy Dillon's imagination, and he can be as suspicious as he likes.  This £150, as I said in my statement, is covering some of the expenses of Professor Delargy, Honorary Director of the Folklore Commission. We were very glad when we heard that he was going out to give a series of lectures with regard to Irish folklore and so on, and we asked him to extend the visits which he proposed to make and the lectures he proposed to give.  Had we not said that we were prepared to make this contribution, these extra lectures would not have been given.  We regard is as a valuable beginning.  We will have the selection, and the selection will be made in accordance with the idea that those who are sent will be representative and will do the work which we intend to be done in this way.  Just the same as if we had gone in before the British, we would be told that we had done one thing, if we had waited until the British had gone in, we would be told that we had done the other, but I cannot prevent anybody who wants to impute any sort of purposes to me from doing it.  This £150 in this Estimate is intended to cover the expenses of the extra lectures and the extra tour which Professor Delargy, at our request, proposes to undertake.  This is a beginning, and when the time comes along, no doubt Deputy Dillon can again exercise his imagination.  I think that covers all the points raised&mdash;the question of recognition, the question of the Evian Conference and the children, and the American lectures.  I have no hesitation in recommending this Vote to the Dáil.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach recognises that, especially as regards item No. A. 9, my purpose was to direct attention to a certain danger.  I was particularly anxious, not to get information as to what the Government had <Col N="502" /> done in that respect, but to direct their attention to a certain danger that may exist.  I hope every effort will be made to see what the exact situation is. With the civil war, as it has been waged in Spain, the Taoiseach will admit that there must be a breaking up of families by the very course of events, and there will be many stray children about the place, whose parents are possibly dead, or, at least, lost for the time being.  There are certain societies&mdash;one was mentioned by the Taoiseach&mdash;in whom I would have every confidence.  That society has done a great deal of work for refugees elsewhere&mdash;the Society of Friends.  They have done an immense amount of work and they have been most careful to see that there was not even a hint of interference from the religious point of view.  There are, however, a number of other international bodies in which I have by no means the same confidence. There are a number of people engaged in international work who are&mdash;I will put it as mildly as possible&mdash;extremely secular in their outlook and apt to forget the spiritual side of things.  I will put it no stronger than that. Where the children are in Spain, or where they have gone into France, I think it is inevitable that a number of them must be separated from their parents, and it is in that connection that I merely ask the Minister to direct the attention of his Department to see that, so far as possible, no damage is done in that respect.</P>

      <P>It would be very difficult to say&mdash;and I am sure the Deputy appreciates the difficulty&mdash; because it is a Vote which has arisen accidently owing to the depreciation of certain currency.  It does not open up for discussion the whole question of the League of Nations.  That must be obvious to the Deputy.  It is not a function of the Chair to direct a Deputy on what he may say, but rather to inform him if he strays from relevancy.</P>

      <P>I do see the difficulty.  I am not inclined to raise the question of international currency, because I know nothing about currency, but may I put it that we are voting an extra sum of money to every department of the League of Nations?

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite admit that it is not in order on a Supplementary Estimate to discuss more than there is in the precise item.  My contention is that this item contains every portion of the League of Nations because there is a contribution of all our expenses to the League.  For instance, the amount we pay as a contribution to the League itself is affected.  The amount we pay, I presume, to our representative in Geneva is affected.  All these are affected, and every one of these then comes, not under the general Vote, but under the Supplementary Estimate.</P>

I was hoping, however, that the Taoiseach might enlighten me as to the Government's attitude on that, on the ground that, in reality, every portion of the League is affected.  The issues are of such tremendous importance that, as I say, I thought it might be possible for you, Sir, to rule that some direction might be given to us here, since the direction that people hoped to get from Versailles or Munich, and every other sheet-anchor to international security seems to be going.</P>

Giving my own personal opinion, I think that we are a great deal closer now to a European burst-up than we have been at any time, with the exception, perhaps, of the end of August last or the beginning of September. For that reason, I think an opportunity might be given to the Taoiseach on this Vote to explain the views of the Government on that very important question.</P>

    <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £173,472 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1939, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, and of certain Services administered by that Office, including sundry Grants-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>The first item in connection with this Supplementary Estimate is sub-head G (3), which amounts to £40,000 for a Fertilisers Scheme.  The purpose of the scheme is to enable farmers to purchase manures at reduced prices.  It is estimated that it will cost £88,000, but of this, only £40,000 will be spent in the current financial year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The attention of farmers has been drawn to the scheme by Press notices, notifications to secretaries of county committees of agriculture, and so on, and it is important to note that farmers are entitled to a reduction in price on purchases made by them since the 1st September last.  This scheme will apply to the following manures manufactured by members of the Irish Fertiliser Manufacturers' Association, having their factories in this country:&mdash;(a) Superphosphates, including potassic superphosphate; (b) Semsol; (c) Ground North African phosphate; (d) the compound and complete manures manufactured by members of the Association as shown in their wholesale price list.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme will also apply to similar manures supplied for use in County Donegal, which are manufactured in <Col N="507" /> the factory at Lisahally, Londonderry, owned by one of the members of the association.</P>
    <P>In respect of any of these manures supplied by members of the association during the period from 1st September, 1938, to 30th June, 1939, the Government will provide funds for the purpose of enabling farmers to obtain from their local retail merchants and co-operative societies rebates on the current retail prices, at the rate of 10/- per ton in the case of Superphosphates (including potassic superphosphates), Semsol and Ground North African phosphates, and at the rate of 5/- per ton in the case of the compound and complete fertilisers.  At the discretion of the Minister these arrangements may apply to any quantities of these manures which the Minister is satisfied have remained on the hands of retail merchants or co-operative societies since the preceding season.  The existing import duties on Superphosphates, Ground Mineral Phosphates and Compound Manures is to be continued, but as regards quantitative restrictions all applications for import licences, excepting those relating to compound manures during the period up to 30th June, 1939, will ordinarily be granted in full.  In connection with the administrative arrangements of this scheme, the manufacturer here will send a circular letter explaining that, in order to encourage the more extensive use by farmers of phosphatic manures, and of compound and complete manures containing phosphates, the Minister for Agriculture has provided funds to enable certain reductions to be made&mdash; 10/- per ton of a discount in the case of Superphosphate, Semsol and Ground North African Phosphate, and 5/- per ton on the compound and complete fertilisers. It should be stated also in that circular letter that these rebates or discounts must be passed on by the retail merchants and co-operative societies to the farmer-purchaser.</P>
    <P>The next item, sub-head I (4), deals with land reclamation in congested districts and other special areas.  The amount is £2,380.  Owing to adverse weather conditions it was not possible to close the 1937-38 scheme on 31st March, 1938.  The expenditure not estimated <Col N="508" /> for in the current financial year in respect of the 1937-38 scheme is £1,865.</P>

      <P>In the congested districts and other special areas.  In addition, it has been found necessary to employ six temporary assistant agricultural overseers to replace six assistant agricultural overseers assigned to higher duties during the operation of the scheme.  This will cost £515.  The next item is sub-head M (4)&mdash;Loans and Grants for Agricultural Purposes&mdash;a sum of £5.  It is estimated that about £500 will be required for loans for the purchase or erection of poultry houses. This can be provided out of savings in the sub-head, but as the scheme is new it is necessary to obtain the sanction of the Dáil.  Loans will not exceed four-fifths of the cost of the houses, and they will be repaid in four equal annual instalments with interest at 5 per cent. per annum.  They will not be given in respect of an imported house if a home-manufactured one is available.  Loans will not be given for a house costing less than £6 or a house or houses costing more than £50.  In the Estimates for next financial year a provision of £10,000 has been inserted for the financing of this scheme of loans for poultry houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next item&mdash;sub-head M (8)&mdash;has to do with expenses in connection with the provision of butter for winter requirements&mdash;£220,000. There is a number of items making up this amount. During the winter season, 1937-38, the statutory price of creamery butter was 120/- per cwt.  The net value to the creameries was 118/-, that is, 120/- less 2/- carriage allowance&mdash;and this was increased by a production allowance of 11/- per cwt., bringing the net value to 129/- per cwt.  This arrangement was continued to the 30th April, 1938.  To finance the scheme for March and April, 1938, the cost was £37,400.  From the 1st May, 1938, the statutory price of creamery butter was increased to 138/- per cwt.  The net value to the creameries was 130/&mdash;that is 138/-, less <Col N="509" /> 2/- taken off for carriage allowance and 6/- taken off for levy.  This increased to 132/- per cwt. from 1st May to 31st July by a production allowance of 2/- per cwt.; and from 1st August to 30th November the allowance was increased to 7/-.  That brought the net value of butter during that period from 1st August to 30th November to 137/-.  The total cost of these allowances for the summer period is estimated at £150,000.</P>

      <P>The 7/- includes the two. The total cost of this scheme during the summer was £150,000.  It was decided to bring the net value of the butter to the creamery up to 145/- from 1st December, but the retail price of butter was not raised until 10th December. Therefore, there were ten days during which this had to be made good to the creameries&mdash;that is, to bring it from 137/- to 145/-.  That cost £3,150. On the 10th December, 1938, the statutory price was increased to 147/- per cwt.  That gave a net value to the creamery of 145/- per cwt.  In addition to that, there was an amount of £28,750 required for a special allowance of 5/9 per cwt. on butter put into cold storage from June to September, 1938.  This is a contribution given out of the fund each year to cover the actual amount paid for the storage, insurance during the period, interest on the money invested in the butter, and the risk of losses, etc.  It is calculated to be about 5/9 per cwt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be noticed that these items which I have given relate to production and not to export.  Hitherto this was done more or less by way of export bounty, which had the same effect, and it was taken out of the Export Bounty Fund.  This year it was done by way of production, and therefore must be voted on the Agricultural Vote.  But it is anticipated that there will be a saving <Col N="510" /> of a similar amount on the Export Subsidy Vote.</P>
    <P>The next sub-head is M (9)&mdash;Importation of Seed Wheat.  Again, there is a token estimate of £5.  Owing to the unfavourable weather up to at least a fortnight ago, conditions for sowing winter wheat had been below expectations, and it was considered necessary to make provision for the import of a larger amount of spring wheat than we usually import.  It was estimated that we would require about 25,000 barrels above the normal quantity of spring wheat.  The seed merchants were not willing to take the risk of the wet weather continuing from the middle of January up to, say, the first week in March, because, of course, if fine weather came in that period, a considerable amount of winter wheat would be sown, and the abnormal quantity of spring seed wheat might not be required.  The Government decided to guarantee the merchants against loss on this additional 25,000 barrels, which is over and above what was brought in normally every year up to this.  If the guarantee has to be paid in full, it will cost about £1 per barrel, or £25,000, but it is not likely that anything like that sum will become payable.</P>
    <P>The next sub-head is O (8)&mdash;Agricultural Produce (Cereals) Acts&mdash;£625.  In order to prevent imported seed wheat from being sold as home-grown, permits for the importation are issued only on condition that the wheat be stained by officers of the Department. It is estimated that this will cost about £625.  There is, however, a payment of 6d. per barrel on each barrel imported, which will probably more than cover the cost.</P>
    <P>The next sub-head is O (17)&mdash;Losses&mdash; £282.  That amount is required to meet a claim against the Department in connection with an accident which occurred to the S.S. Lindenau on the 20th September, 1937, which was bringing a cargo of 202 cattle to Bremen. The vessel ran aground; the cattle were not injured, but there was some damage done to the ship.  We do not insure the cattle, and the Department therefore had to pay a certain amount of the damage, which amounted to <Col N="511" /> £282.  I should like to say, however, that our total losses on risks of this kind during the whole period we carried on a trade in cattle with Germany was £1,710, and the insurance payments would have been £5,810, so that we made money on that.</P>
    <P>Under Appropriations-in-Aid there is an estimated deficiency under various heads of £229,665.  Under sub-head O (2)&mdash;fees in respect of butter exported&mdash;there were less exports than had been anticipated, which accounts for the deficiency under that head.  As to sub-head O (9)&mdash;sales of butter and eggs&mdash;and sub-head O (11)&mdash;sales of cattle&mdash;the last agreement which was made with Germany provided for a change in the system carried on up to that.  Up to that period we had exported butter, eggs and cattle to Germany, and the Dáil provided the money for carrying on that trade.  But, in the recent agreement, Germany took on the purchase of butter, eggs and cattle herself and, therefore, from 1st January to 31st March, the estimated amount of eggs, butter and cattle we had put down does not require to be filled.  Also, under sub-head O (11)&mdash; levy on the slaughter of cattle and sheep&mdash;we did not collect as much as we anticipated.  There was outstanding on the 31st December, 1938, under this heading, £37,240.  As to &ldquo;recoupment of part cost of veterinary inspection of old and uneconomic cows,&rdquo; the loss under that arises from the fact that our agreement with the Roscrea factory ceased to operate during the year.  As to sub-head O (12)&mdash;fees for cattle export licences&mdash;the same thing arises there.  The number of cattle exported was not as high as had been anticipated. As to sub-head I (4)&mdash;additional repayments from the Vote for Employment Schemes in respect of the cost of administration of the land reclamation, etc., schemes &mdash; more money has come in from that than was anticipated.  In the same way, under sub-head M (4)&mdash;additional repayments of agricultural loans&mdash;there was more money than we had anticipated.  The next item is one to which I have already referred.  That is the collection of 6d. per barrel on imported seed <Col N="512" /> wheat to cover the cost of inspection and staining.  That is estimated to bring in the sum of £1,300.  I think these are all the items.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The first item in this Estimate is a provision of £40,000 for the subsidising of superphosphate of lime; or, as the Estimate has it, &ldquo;to enable the farmers to obtain certain fertilisers at reduced prices.&rdquo;  This subsidy will come to 10/- a ton on superphosphates and semsol, and 5/- a ton in the case of compounds and complete fertilisers.  I want to represent to the House that this item represents a subsidy of £40,000 to Goulding &amp; Son.  You might just as well write a cheque payable to Gouldings, and hand them that cheque for £40,000, for that is all that it amounts to&mdash;nothing more.</P>
      <P>Our farmers are denied the right to get superphosphate of lime at economic prices.  There is a tariff of 20 per cent. on superphosphate coming from Holland.  If we could to-morrow import from Holland superphosphate of lime, which is an essential raw material to the agricultural industry and an essential manure to our soil, we could sell this superphosphate of lime to the farmers in rural Ireland at £3 a ton instead of charging them as we are charging them now £3 15s. to £4 a ton. This subsidy will bring the price to the farmers down to £3 7s. 6d. or £3 10s. a ton.  But that means that the distributor has virtually no profit at all. If I bought superphosphate of lime at Ballaghaderreen it would cost me £4 a ton.  That would mean freight from the factory.  It would cost me 2s. 6d. more or less in other centres according to their distance from the source of supply.  If I could buy that superphosphate of lime in Holland, I could have it delivered in Ballaghaderreen at £3 or £3 2s. 6d. a ton.  I said that the consumer could get that superphosphate of lime at 4s. a cwt.  I want to correct that.  The price to the consumer will be 4s. 3d. per cwt. because the distributor must charge something for distributing it to the farmers.  This 10s. subsidy will reduce the price to £3 10s. or £3 15s. per ton according to the centre at which it is bought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, if the tariff were taken off that <Col N="513" /> superphosphate of lime we could, with the assistance of the subsidy, bring down the price to £2 10s. a ton, that is to say we would be selling it to the farmers at 2s. 6d. a cwt.  Then we would be doing something that would be a real help to agriculture.  But there is no sense whatever in passing on Monday, legislation imposing a tariff on superphosphate of lime for the benefit of Gouldings, and on Tuesday giving Gouldings a cheque for £40,000.  That is only reducing the price by the amount whereby it was increased by the tariff.  That is not a subsidy to the farmers; it is a subsidy to Gouldings.  There is only one fertiliser manufacturer in this country and that is Gouldings, otherwise I would not have mentioned the name of the firm.  The entire trade in fertilisers is under the control of Gouldings and every penny of that £40,000 is going to go into their pockets.  What benefit are the farmers going to derive from that transaction?  If you withdraw all your interference we would buy superphosphate of lime cheaper than we could buy it after you have paid out that £40,000 by way of subsidy.  If you want to improve the land of Ireland I tell you you ought to take the tariff off superphosphate of lime.  The subsidy you are giving is no use to the farmers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">

      <P>There is no tariff on English superphosphate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, the tariff has been taken off the English superphosphate there.  But the tariff on continental superphosphate is 20 per cent.  It is from Holland this country was getting superphosphate, and we were getting cheap superphosphate.  I make a suggestion and it is a constructive one.  I know that Deputies opposite are protectionists and they are prepared to sacrifice agriculture to the industrialists. We have all to sweat blood in order that the industrialists in this country may grow rich.  The ten-acre man and the five-acre man in this country have to sweat blood in order that Gouldings may grow rich.  I make no appeal to the Party opposite in the name of the farmers of the country <Col N="514" /> who are struggling to make ends meet. But I do make an appeal to them in the name of the land of the country. The land is the only asset we have and if its fertility is not maintained this country will be beggared.  The land of Éire wants superphosphate of lime no matter in whose hands it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I make one suggestion to the Government.  Let the manure ring in this country bleed the people as much as they want to bleed them in the compound fertilisers, but let us have superphosphate of lime in free of tariff. Take the tariff off the superphosphate of lime only and leave it on the compound fertilisers; let the manure ring rob the people as much as they like in the compound fertilisers.  The Party opposite enjoys the spectacle of the small man being robbed by the industrialists. Well, let them enjoy that spectacle in the matter of the compound fertilisers but give the people some chance of living and take the tariff off the superphosphate of lime. That is the half-way house.  The manure ring will grow fat on special potato manure, on the other special manures and compound manures that are tariffed and that the farmers have to buy, and Deputies opposite will be able to put their hands upon their hearts and say: &ldquo;We gave the manure ring their pound of flesh; we only demurred when we were asked for a pound and a quarter of flesh.&rdquo;  I only ask that the additional quarter pound of flesh be not taken off the farmers of this country.  Let the manure ring relax their grip on that quarter pound and give the farmer the right to buy superphosphate of lime freely.  The Government can have their tariff on semsol and the other compound manures.  The tariff put on basic slag hits every farmer.  I am prepared, from my own experience, to say that continental basic slag is a better manure than semsol or the other compound manures.  British basic slag is no longer useful because the new British methods of steel manufacture produce a slag, the soluble phosphates of which do not exceed 19 per cent. and very often much less.  This continental slag has a high soluble phosphate content.  We can get the continental slag with a 40 per cent. <Col N="515" /> soluble content and it varies from that down to 32 per cent. soluble.  In addition to that it is comparatively easy to grind continental slag because it is much softer than the British slag. Basic slag is costing up to £4 10s. a ton down the country.  If the tariff were taken off that the people would get it at £3 15s. 0d. or less.  Take the tariff off slag and super and leave it on the compound manures. Then you will be doing something useful for the farmers.</P>
    <P>The effect of the subsidy, as at present proposed, is simply to write a cheque on the Treasury and present it to Messrs. Goulding.  That is all you are doing&mdash;nothing more.  You are conferring no advantage on the farmers of this country, and you are simply adding insult to injury by depriving them of what they ought to be entitled to get. You do go and tell the people that they are receiving doles, grants and concessions from the Exchequer, when they know that, whatever the Exchequer is paying out, they are getting no benefit from it.  Picture the feelings of a man who goes in to buy 10 cwt. of super which at present prices costs him at least £2.  I am thinking now of the man with about 10 acres of land and not the fellow with 150 acres.  This man goes in to buy a bag of fertilisers, a cwt. of nitrate of potash, and the same of sulphate of ammonia.  His total bill will come to £4 or £5.  He benefits under this subsidy to the tune of about 5/-, while Goulding's benefit to the tune of about 45/-.  Surely that is silly?</P>
    <P>I freely admit that, with the negotiation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, we got a great chance.  One of the most exasperating features of the present situation is that if we only availed of that chance we could put agriculture in this country on its feet, and make it really profitable, but instead what are we doing?  By our own folly we are now pauperising the people on the land, despite the fact that we have the opportunity of getting for our people a standard of living as good as they have ever enjoyed, and higher than that enjoyed by any other agricultural community in Europe.  We will not do the things that we should do.  We <Col N="516" /> contemplate quite blandly the fact that their raw materials, the things that farmers must buy, are being made so dear that they are unable to get a profit on their work, in the knowledge that if we give the farmers a profit on their work every section in the community will benefit, and that if we fail to do that every section will perish. Deputies sitting on the benches opposite know that what I am saying in that regard is true, and yet they will stand by and tolerate their own Ministers bleeding the people on the land in order to fatten gentlemen who are bleeding unfortunate workers in back streets in the cities.</P>
    <P>Why cannot the Deputies of the Fianna Fáil Party wake up to the fact that as legislators their primary duty is to do substantial justice between all citizens: that so far as the rich, powerful, well-organised manufacturer is concerned he is well able to look after himself, and that in regard to him we owe him no obligations other than those of pure justice; but that in regard to the people who are struggling to make a living, we are more than the doers of justice&mdash;we are trustees for them, and our duty is to look after their interests and to protect them.  But we are not protecting them if we allow them to be exploited by well-organised industrialists who, in the classical words of Deputy Dowdall of Cork, are organised &ldquo;to howl and howl and howl the moment they see upon the horizon the slightest threats to their purse&rdquo;.  If anyone ever dares to raise his hand in this country to protect the people who live upon the land from the ravages of the people that Deputy Dowdall speaks of, then they will start howling and howling, and will bring all the power of their immense powerful vested interests to bear on anyone who dares to defend the persons that we are sent here to defend.  When will the Deputies on the Fianna Fáil Benches realise that?  When are they going to realise that, unless they are prepared to defend the small farmers of this country, the small farmers are going to be trodden into the dirt by the gentlemen whom Deputy Dowdall calls upon to howl and howl if they see any danger on the horizon to their purses.</P>
    <P>The Government have borrowed <Col N="517" /> this subsidy policy from Great Britain. It is a poor miserable subsidy, but even so I appeal to the Minister to give it a chance.  Perhaps it is all he can afford.  I am prepared to grant him that, although I think he might have been a little more generous.  But even if it is all that he can afford he can still make it of use if he will take the tariff off superphosphates.  I have no doubt that there are men sitting behind me who will take up the position that I am giving the case away, and think that I ought to attack the scheme much more vigorously and strenuously&mdash;that I ought to say that the whole thing is a fraud.  I do think it is a poor scheme, but still I would like to save it for the people.  Poor as it is I think that it can be made useful if the tariff is taken off the basic slag and the super.  If you do that, and give the subsidy, we will get somewhere, but if you leave things as they are you will do nothing, except to give Goulding's a cheque for £40,000 for doing nothing.</P>
    <P>So far as the statutory price for butter is concerned, I am glad to see that the price is rising.  I would ask Deputies opposite if they remember the time when we said, prior to the last general election, that &ldquo;we can foresee the day and are prepared to guarantee it on the Exchequer that the farmers of this country will get 5d. a gallon for their milk from the creamery.&rdquo;  I wonder does Deputy Meaney remember that?  The Minister for Agriculture went down the country and delivered speeches demonstrating that to give the farmers of the country 5d. a gallon for their milk would cost something like £7,000,000.</P>

      <P>The people here said, &ldquo;We will do our best to do it, and we guarantee that the Minister is bound to contradict himself.&rdquo;  I now come to wheat&mdash;poor, decrepit, downtrodden wheat.  Deputies remember the time when we were told that we were to grow wheat in order to protect the people against the danger of starvation in time of war.  Every poor simple Fianna Fáil Deputy believed that, but they heard the Minister for Industry and Commerce admit yesterday that he had no more confidence in the Minister's wheat scheme than I have, and that being so, he went to the millers and said, &ldquo;Boys, the wheat scheme is all a cod; buy in a sufficient quantity of wheat to keep the country going, because the scheme of the Minister for Agriculture has gone up the spout.&rdquo;  Is not that so?  At this moment you are paying on your loaf of bread and on your cwt. of flour so much to the miller every time you buy a loaf or a stone of flour in order to guarantee that you will have a supply of foreign wheat in time of war.  The Executive Council, of which the Minister for Agriculture is a member, has told you that they put no more confidence in his wheat scheme than Deputy Dillon does. They know that it is a cod, and that it has gone up the spout.  They would not trust this nation to it for ten minutes, much less for ten years.  In those cricumstances, does it not amount to fraudulent misrepresentation to be putting up posters all over the country and advertisements in the newspapers appealing to our unfortunate farmers to grow more wheat?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking in the Dáil on the 29th April on the Agreement between Ireland and the United Kingdom, the <Col N="520" /> Taoiseach said that the negotiations were begun on his initiative because it was impossible for any Government to do its duty by our people, or to make proper plans for defence, in view of the British occupation of our ports and the military and naval facilities which they could claim under Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty.  He indicated that, following the restoration of the ports, the Government proposed to go into the whole defence policy and lay it before the House at the earliest possible moment.  The Taoiseach also expressed his belief that the defence measures which would be proposed would impose a considerable burden on the people, but that the people would have to face that burden if they wanted to be free.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in introducing the Budget last year, made provision for spending an additional £600,000 for general defence purposes. The Supplementary Estimate which has been circulated gives details as to how £384,575 of that sum has been spent. Savings on other sub-heads amounting to £61,205 have reduced the actual additional expenditure for the financial year to £323,370.</P>
    <P>In order to give the Dáil a clear picture of the measures which the Government propose to take to strengthen our defences, I have caused to be circulated with the Supplementary Estimate a White Paper showing the details of the annual Estimate for the coming financial year.  It will be noticed that provision is being made for an increase in the personnel of the permanent Forces, the Reserve and the Volunteers.  Provision will also be made next year for spending on warlike stores and equipment £1,000,000 more than the average of such expenditure for the past three years.  This sum, together with the £239,000 in the Supplementary Estimate, gives a total of £1,239,000 to be spent this year and next on what we may term capital expenditure.  In addition, the Government have approved plans for spending on the purchase of stores and equipment, on the building of aerodromes, and the home production of ammunition, a sum amounting to £4,261,000.  This makes a total of £5,500,000 for capital equipment and stores, part of which has been bought and all of which will be bought <Col N="521" /> as quickly as possible.  I estimate that the maintenance of personnel, civilian and military, and the renewal of stores, will cause the annual Army Estimates to rise to £2,250,000, when the Army reaches the planned strength and when we are manufacturing ammunition at home.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that protests will be made against spending an additional £500,000 annually on the Army Vote, and against spending £5,500,000 for capital equipment, and I am quite prepared to admit that I would prefer to see the increased expenditure for defence purposes spent on the development of our social and economic life. But, taking the world as it is, and after the closest and most exhaustive examination of the situation and of all the proposals for increased expenditure on the Army, the Government, with the utmost reluctance, have arrived at the conclusion that it is necessary to spend at least this much for defence purposes if our people wish to be allowed continue their economic and social development according to their own wishes and for their own benefit, rather than in accordance with the wishes and for the benefit of an outside Power.</P>
    <P>The world we are living in at the moment is far from being a pacifist's Utopia.  And although the attitude of our people generally is one of peaceful intent towards all other countries; although their deepest desire is to be allowed to develop their resources and talents in peace, and peacefully to absorb our lost territory, we cannot rely in these times on that attitude saving us from attack by major Powers who might wish to conquer our country either for the sake of our resources or our market, or for use as a base from which to attack their enemies.  The final decision of a General Staff contemplating such attack will be based on whether it will bring them more pains than gains, upon the measure of resistance likely to be encountered by them.  If we wish to be left in peace we must be prepared to make sacrifices of time, energy and money for defensive preparations, and so show that although we are peaceful we are not <Col N="522" /> pacifist, and are prepared to defend ourselves vigorously if attacked.</P>
    <P>Prior to the new Constitution and the agreements made with Great Britain in April last, it was very difficult to make any plans for defence to meet the complicated situation that would have arisen in the event of a European war; very difficult indeed. not only by reason of the British Army and Navy being in possession of certain definite defended harbours, oil fuel stores and war signal stations, but because of the unlimited demands&mdash; demands without any effective limit whatever as far as Ireland was concerned, as to character or extent&mdash;the demands which might have been made, in accordance with the terms of Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty of 1921, &ldquo;for such harbour and other facilities as the British Government may require for the purpose of such defence as aforesaid&rdquo;, the latter phrase covering defence activities by British sea, land, and air forces.</P>
    <P>However, these causes of enmity and strife between ourselves and our nearest neighbour have been ended satisfactorily in the best interests of both countries, and for some time past our General Staff have been drawing up plans in the light of the following facts:&mdash;(1) That our sovereignty over the Twenty-Six Counties is complete and so recognised internationally; (2) that the only authority which can commit us to war is the assembly of the elected representatives of the people&mdash; the Dáil; (3) that it is not the policy of the Government to attack any nation, and that we have no commitment to join or be involved in any war; (4) that it is the policy of the Government to repel any attack which might be made upon our territory.</P>
    <P>These facts negative the possibility of our being at war with Britain unless attacked by her, and, therefore, the only other situations we have to plan for are: The maintenance of neutrality; attack by a power with which Great Britain is at war.  It is assumed that it is most unlikely that we should be attacked by a power not at war with Great Britain.  In all probability such an attack would come only from a power seeking to make our territory <Col N="523" /> the cockpit of its war with Great Britain, or as a base from which to attack her.</P>
    <P>Keeping in mind the general situation I have outlined and the urgent necessity for quick preparations, our problem has been to arrive at the best distribution of the funds which the Government propose to place at our disposal in order to secure quickly and most efficiently the maximum strength of the Defence Forces.  Luckily for the people and the Exchequer, we have highly trained officers at General Headquarters, at the Military College, and in the corps and services throughout the Army.  Supporting the officers we have highly trained N.C.O.s and men both in the permanent Forces, in the Reserve and Volunteers.  I have kept continually before all ranks the problems with which we would be faced should we be called upon to expand. These problems have been studied carefully for years.  Knowledge has been gained in the military colleges at home, in England, in America and in France; experience has been gained in the rapid mobilisation, training and equipment of large bodies of Reserves and Volunteers.  All types of weapons and equipment have been tried out.  I can say with confidence that every penny placed at our disposal will be used with the utmost economy and efficiency for the strengthening of our Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>When the expansion which has been planned reaches its maximum we will have an Army of 30,000 all ranks consisting of 8,000 permanent Force, 5,000 Reserve and 17,000 Volunteers. On mobilisation it will provide:&mdash;(1) General Headquarters and G.H.Q. troops highly trained and equipped; (2) a striking force highly trained and equipped; (3) an Air Force consisting of land planes and sea planes for the interception of bombing raiders and for reconnaissance and coastal patrol; (4) an anti-aircraft artillery branch for the protection of the larger cities and vital areas; (5) garrisons in the forts and principal cities; (6) school and depôt staffs for the training of officers and other ranks; (7) cycle squadrons for protection of particular areas; (8) a munition branch <Col N="524" /> for the production of small arms and other ammunition; (9) a coast watching service; (10) a coast patrol and mine-sweeping service.  In addition to equipping the troops I have mentioned, we will have a number of rifles and machine guns for arming troops which will be raised for local protection or general purposes.  Ancillary to the Army, proper A.R.P. will be organised and equipment provided for large centres of population.  Civilian first aid workers will also be organised and trained on a voluntary basis.</P>
    <P>At the present time we have an Army of 21,000 all ranks.  If to-morrow we were ordered to mobilise detailed plans exist whereby the most vital of the fighting units would be manned and equipped to the utmost possible extent. We are working at high pressure to organise, train and equip the services which have not hitherto existed, i.e., A.R.P., coast watching, coastal patrol, and mine-sweeping.  A rapid expansion is taking place in the Air Corps and anti-aircraft defence.  Arrangements are being completed for erection of an ammunition factory, and we have already secured the site.  The attainment of the planned expansion depends of course on our obtaining material and men.  Orders are being placed for the material we require, but the assurance of rapid delivery is, of course, a matter which is not entirely under our control. The obtaining of the increased personnel is, however, completely under our own control, and in order to make the most effective use of the material which we have and are purchasing we require 1,000 more men for the permanent force, 9,000 more volunteers, and large numbers of voluntary workers for A.R.P. and first aid.  Once these estimates have been discussed by the Dáil I believe we can look forward with confidence to obtaining all the men provided for.  I trust that no matter how we may differ as to details, the wisest and most patriotic sections of our people will realise the urgent importance of bringing the Army up to strength and will do all in their power to assist us in getting the best type of recruit for the permanent forces, the Volunteers and A.R.P.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the Supplementary Estimate, it will be noted that we are <Col N="525" /> asking the Dáil to approve a gross expenditure of £384,575, which, when offset by certain savings, is reduced to a net sum of £323,370.  The Estimate may be said to be due to the following main causes:&mdash;(a) The maintenance of the coastal defences; (b) the purchase of stores in connection with the transfer of the forts; (c) the increased establishment of the Army, and the consequent increase in civilian personnel; (d) the equipment of the Army; (e) Air Raid Precautions.</P>
    <P>In regard to the maintenance of the Coastal Defences, the direct expenditure borne on this Estimate, apart from the cost of military personnel may be generally said to be as follows:&mdash;Maintenance Stores (sub-head S), £3,230; Civilian Maintenance Staff, (sub-head C), £15,123; Vessels (sub-head S), £7,729; British Instructional Staff (sub-head C), £4,038; Rents (sub-head T), £158; Insurance (sub-head W), £515; Telephones (sub-head X.1.), £50; Fuel (sub-head R), £700; Transport (sub-heads H.I. &amp; L.), £1,527; Total, £33,070.</P>
    <P>Hence the direct expenditure on the forts, apart from the cost of our own military personnel will be about £33,070 for the current year, and the corresponding figure next year will be £30,817.  The cost of military personnel on the forts will be about £49,634 for the year 1938 and £69,072 for 1939, but it may be possible to reduce the latter figure to £50,995.  In future normal years we estimate that the total cost of all services in the forts will be about £50,000 a year of which about £40,000 will represent the pay and allowances etc. of military and civilian personnel. It is also intended at a future date to spend about £6,760 on modernising the signalling and fire control equipment in the forts in order to make them completely up-to-date and efficient.</P>
    <P>Stores were purchased at the forts to the extent of £30,109.  The details of the purchases are as follows:&mdash; Consumable Stores&mdash;(Petrol, Food, Medicines, etc.) (sub-heads F, K, L and R), £2,675; Engineer Tools and Stores (sub-heads Q and S), £4,381; Movable Warlike Stores (sub-head P), £12,798; Wireless Stores (sub-head O), £85; Barrack Stores (sub-head V), £9,470; Total, £29,409.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="526" /> In addition, grants were made to Private Regimental Funds in respect of private property such as squash courts to the extent of £700 (sub-head U), so that the total involved was £30,109.</P>
    <P>The third cause of this Supplementary Estimate is the increased strength of the Army, and a consequent small increase in the civilian staff of the Department.  The cost of the latter is £2,758 (sub-head Y) and the cost of the former in pay and maintenance is £24,200.  This sum is distributed over 11 sub-heads.  As regards the increased strength of the Army, it is necessary to explain that the peace establishment of the Army before the Government's recent decision was 641 officers and 6,334 other ranks.  The annual Estimate for 1938 was based on a strength of 620 officers and 5,800 other ranks.  That left a deficiency of 21 officers and 500 other ranks.  During the year, partly owing to the transfer of the forts but mainly owing to the international situation, it was decided to increase the Army by 17 officers, 4 cadets and 500 other ranks, and the cost of that increase is represented by the figures just given.  For the purpose of raising the regular Army to that strength a recruiting drive was undertaken, and the results were satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The strength of the permanent force as covered by this Estimate is 637 officers and 6,300 other ranks.  The Estimate for 1939-40 is based on a strength of 715 officers and 7,262 other ranks, which will be an increase of 1,040 all ranks.  The strength of the reserve in 1938 Estimate was 525 officers and 18,425 other ranks, but the figure in the 1939 Estimate will be 720 officers and 20,804 other ranks&mdash;an increase of 2,574 all ranks, and the total cost of the whole Force in pay and maintenance will be, as I have already said, about £1,850,000.</P>
    <P>The fourth cause of the Supplementary Estimate is the necessity of repairing deficiencies in the equipment of the Army, and the Estimate remedies that deficiency to the extent that it provides for the following capital items:&mdash;</P>

    <P>The sum provided for clothing and barrack services is simply an instalment towards building up reserve stocks which is necessary for mobilisation. The provision for new works is a carry-over from previous years which will be completed this year.  The sum of £132,965 will go towards providing machines for the air corps, as well as air and ground equipment for the corps generally.  The motor-cycles are needed for the training of all corps and services other than the cavalry and signal corps which already possess machines.  The adaptors are wanted for the conversion of horse-drawn artillery wagons into motor-drawn vehicles.  The engineering equipment consists of essential defence stores.</P>
    <P>The fifth and final service covered by this Supplementary Estimate is A.R.P. It will be observed that a sum of £101,000 is included under sub-head P (1) for A.R.P.  The Taoiseach made a statement in the House on the 26th October last regarding the question of the defence of the civilian population in the event of air attack.  He referred on that occasion to the intention of the Government to introduce legislation making it compulsory on local authorities in certain areas to carry out schemes which would cover the action required to be taken by them in the event of the areas being submitted to air attack.  It is quite possible that, during the progress of a major European war, in which this country was not directly involved, precautions would have to be taken in certain areas here such as would be necessary under conditions equivalent to the existence of a state of war.</P>
    <P>The Government will undertake responsibility for providing, at the cost of the Exchequer, certain services and <Col N="528" /> training equipment, appliances and other material, and will pay grants to local authorities amounting to a certain percentage of their expenditure on approved schemes.  The provision made in the Estimate is in respect of equipment such as anti-gas respirators, oil skin protective clothing, decontaminating materials, instructional fire-fighting equipment, and other instructional equipment which has been obtained or is on order for free issue to the public, and to the A.R.P. services to be organised by the local authorities.  A further sum of £34,544 will be included in the Estimates for 1939.  It is considered that, to meet the final expenditure on the scheme, a further sum of £375,000 will have to be provided, and this sum is included in a total sum of £5,500,000 proposed to be provided for general defence purposes to be drawn on by means of Supplementary Estimates as and when expenditure falls to be incurred.</P>
    <P>No matter what is done by the Government to afford protection to the civilian population, any such action would be largely negatived unless the civilian population were trained to take its part intelligently.  Given active and intelligent co-operation by the people, and with the expenditure of comparatively small sums by the State and local authorities, we can save the lives of many adults and children who would otherwise be killed or maimed in the case of a sudden air attack.  For this reason great importance is attached to the need for the training in advance of personnel who may be required to carry out duties in connection with schemes of air raid precautions.  The training of air raid precautions instructors has been proceeding for more than six months past at a school in Dublin which has been established by my Department for the purpose, and the following numbers of instructors have been trained:&mdash;Gárda Síochána, 48; Dublin Corporation, 35; Dun Laoghaire Borough Corporation, 4; State Departments, 37; Port and Docks, Dublin, 8; utility undertakings, 24; industrial and business concerns, 40; medical officers&mdash;local authorities, 37; medical officers&mdash;voluntary hospitals, 29.  I may say that a number of <Col N="529" /> these instructors are imparting instruction at the moment to persons who will be under them.</P>
    <P>A number of handbooks for the instruction of the civilian population and the personnel of A.R.P. services is in course of printing, and supplies will be available shortly.  I expect at an early date to introduce legislation in regard to A.R.P.  A large amount of preliminary work will, however, be necessary before an accurate estimate of the expenditure involved can be framed, but much preliminary work in the preparation of schemes can be, and is being done, in advance of the legislation. Officers of my Department are in close contact with the City Manager and Town Clerk of Dublin, and his principal officials for the purpose of working out details of the various aspects of the scheme for Dublin with particular reference to casualty service, shelter accommodation, restricted lighting arrangements, extra fire-fighting facilities, and the air-raid wardens' scheme.</P>
    <P>We commenced with Dublin because it is our largest and most vulnerable target, the place in which the most destruction of life and property could be caused by possible air raids.  The experience gained in dealing with the difficult Dublin problem will make it comparatively easy to make plans for the other large cities and towns.  An A.R.P. organiser was appointed by the City Manager at the beginning of last month.  He has also appointed a chief air raid warden and a divisional warden for each of the areas into which the city has been divided for the purpose of organising the general scheme.  Air raid wardens will be voluntary helpers chosen from responsible members of the public as leaders and advisers in small areas in which they are known and respected.  They will be constituted as agents of the air raid precautions service in all aspects of the scheme which require direct contact with the individual, e.g., a census of the population of the areas by households for the various purposes of the scheme such as evacuation, the fitting and distribution of respirators, instruction and guidance generally.  The civic authorities will, at an early date, issue an appeal for voluntary service as wardens, <Col N="530" /> and I would earnestly exhort all those who are in a position to render such service to reply readily and promptly to this appeal when issued.</P>
    <P>Officers of my Department have made considerable progress with plans for providing facilities whereby the nonessential population of the City of Dublin could leave the city at short notice if they so desired on the issue of advice by the Government that such action would be desirable.  These plans are concerned largely with classes who might not be in a position to make arrangements for accommodation in another locality, or for transport, and would include children under school-going age who would possibly have to be accompanied by their mothers, children attending primary schools, the aged and infirm.  The problem of finding alternative accommodation is being pursued and considerable facilities have already been provisionally earmarked. In this connection it is contemplated that it may be advisable to provide a considerable amount of hutments to be used in conjunction with existing buildings. Arrangements for the continuance of the education of evacuated children are being considered.  It should be borne in mind that evacuation would have to be for the duration of the state of emergency.  Those who are in a position to make their own arrangements for themselves and their dependants to stay with friends or relatives in the country would, of course, be expected to do so.</P>
    <P>Evacuation of certain sections of the population in so far as it might be advisable and feasible would ease the situation in regard to the provision of shelter accommodation.  In the latter connection I have had representations made to the City Manager and Town Clerk of Dublin with a view to ascertaining by survey the extent to which suitable shelter for those requiring it can be made available by the adaptation of existing structures.  On completion of such survey it can be seen to what extent further shelter accommodation should be provided, and my Department has under consideration different types of shelters which might be required.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Volunteers I wish to inform the Dáil that it is proposed <Col N="531" /> to make certain changes in their terms of service.  Heretofore Volunteers joined for 12 years but could resign, except when mobilised, upon giving seven days' notice.  For the future the period of enlistment will be for five years, and discharge will be obtained only on the same terms as from the permanent Force.  The age limits for joining the first line will be lowered from 18 to 17 years and raised from 25 to 30 and in the case of specialists to 40.  The initial training period for first line will be extended from 28 to 90 days, but Volunteers will have the option of doing the equivalent of 90 days' training locally where facilities exist.  The compulsory annual training will be reduced from 20 to 9 days.  The annual grant for a Volunteer will be increased from £3 to £6 but of this £2 will be conditional on attending annual training, £3 upon attending local training and upon personal proficiency and £1 upon the general efficiency of the local sluagh.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You will get a great crowd of recruits on those terms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>The allowances of officers and N.C.O.s will also be increased and will similarly be dependent upon attendance at training and upon personal and sluagh efficiency.  Existing Volunteers will have the option of continuing their service under the new conditions or of taking their discharge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lowering of the age limit and the reduction of the annual training will enable first line Volunteers to carry out their initial and annual training with the least possible interruption of their civilian occupations.  Volunteers with special qualifications, such as engineers, fitters, electricians, motor drivers, wireless operators, signallers, etc., will not be compelled to undergo prolonged initial training.  The second line will consist of men who have completed their service in the first line, or who are given permission to transfer into it.  The third line will consist of Volunteers who are over age for the first and second lines and of Volunteers who cannot devote time for training in peace times but who are prepared to <Col N="532" /> serve in an emergency.  The experience we have gained in the last five years makes us confident that the changes outlined will attract many fine young men who could not leave their ordinary occupations for 20 days each year.  The extension of the initial training period will give us a much higher standard of training than at present, and, by ensuring through tests that Volunteers keep up this standard through local training and firing practice, the nine days annually can be devoted altogether to unit training and exercises.</P>
    <P>At present we have 7,465 first line, 2,058 second line and 280 third line Volunteers.  The standard of training of the first line Volunteers is very good in the case of those who did more than 28 days initially, or who reached a higher standard through local training. Some of the Volunteers in Dublin who did all their training locally have reached a very high standard indeed, and better facilities will be provided for them in future.  At present we have 243 Volunteer officers and 967 N.C.O.s who are all very competent to handle their units.  Next year we hope to double the number of officers and N.C.O.s.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to say that taking them all round the young men comprising the Volunteer force are as disciplined and well-behaved body of Volunteers as one could hope to find in any country, and, both from the point of view of the young men themselves and the general welfare and safety of the country, parents should encourage their boys to join.  The initial physical and military training which young Volunteers undergo improves them both mentally and physically for any walk of life.  The annual training is a welcome break in the yearly routine of both those who work on the land and in the towns.  From the point of view of the community the Volunteer movement gives our young men a sense of discipline and provides us with an effective military force which we cannot afford to maintain on a permanent basis.  And while we all hope and pray that European peace will be maintained, or that, if broken, we will not be attacked, we cannot afford to take either for granted, and we had better <Col N="533" /> in these times follow the old advice: &ldquo;Put your trust in God, and keep your powder dry&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>On that Cromwellian note we return to the question of wheat.  It is interesting to observe that, in the light of the warlike preparations we are making to-night, there is one reed upon which we have resolved not to lean, and that is on the Minister for Agriculture's wheat scheme.  I remember the time when it was a bulwark of our independence, that the guns of the base, bloody and brutal Saxon would turn from us, and that we would turn to the fleshpots of Wexford and revel in the abundance of wheat but, softly and silently in the night, the Minister for Industry and Commerce went off to the millers and said: &ldquo;Whatever about the fleshpots of Wexford, you had better lay in a store from Canada and Australia.&rdquo; We have now laid in supplies of wheat to guarantee us against scarcity of food in time of war, supplies which Deputy Allen used to tell us would be provided by Manitoba No. 1 grown in County Wexford.  The farce has failed, and we are no longer told that wheat growing was a defensive measure, having been abandoned by its authors, the Fianna Fáil Government.  We are then driven back to the question: Why does anyone want to spend money under an Estimate like this to promote the growth of wheat?  Moreover, why should we put notices in the newspapers, and plaster the countryside with notices exhorting everyone to grow wheat and assuring them that it pays, when we all know in our hearts and souls that it pays nobody; that more than half the farmers who planted and grew wheat found, when they went to reap their corn that, despite the price paid by the Government, the yield was so poor, and the incidence of failure so high, the vast majority lost money, and the consumers lost £2,750,000 per annum.  In face of that, who wants to go on growing wheat?  It is perfectly legitimate for a man who has children and who <Col N="534" /> wants a bit of straight-run flour in his own house to grow some and to bring it to the local miller to have it ground. If he wants to do that he is welcome to it.  That is a charge on no one, and the man is exercising his essential freedom to use his land in whatever way he thinks is best in the interests of his family.  Why should we be squandering £2,750,000 per annum on growing wheat that nobody wants; that has been a loss to everyone that touched it, except the millers who, by licence of the Government, have plundered the country?</P>

In the old days if people went to the Government to ask for £555, even to save the State, they would be thrown out and told that they could not afford it.  These were the days when the Government was spending £20,000,000 a year, and, I agree, that now in these halcyon days, when they are spending £36,000,000, a sum of £550 does not represent much.</P>

      <P>I am only asserting that we should not import seed wheat.  It is true that the £5 is a token vote, but, as you, Sir, know, a token vote could <Col N="535" /> be used to justify the expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds.  The token Vote is an old expedient, and we are assuming that the token Vote of £5 is, in fact, opening the door for the expenditure of £25,000, or whatever sum might be necessitated by the fact that the wheat dealers would not accept responsibility.  The whole scheme is so disreputable, and so thoroughly discreditable, that it is not necessary to waste much time on it, except to ask the Fianna Fáil Party, when are they going to muster up courage to drop this scheme and save £2,750,000?  This particular piece of codology is a scheme for which there is no hope, because the Minister has admitted that as a defensive measure it is pure cod.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that at another opportunity, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would object if I went into it now.  You know, if you import this spring seed wheat, that 70 per cent. of it will never ripen.  You know that if it is sown in the middle of January, when you can reasonably expect frost to come and give it an essential set back, 70 per cent. of it will not ripen, and in September or October the millers will wring their hands and say that it was unfortunate the weather was not good, and that as the wheat failed, it could be fed to the hens.  That is poor consolation to the poor fools who were persuaded to grow wheat in order to get the guaranteed price.  But it is not wanted.  There is stored in the millers' barns enough wheat to feed this country for the next 12 months. Any wheat grown will be over and above the national requirements.  It will be surplus wheat.  Even Deputy Allen does not suggest that we should go into the world market with Manitoba No. 1 and contend that the quality is as good or better than that produced in Manitoba.  Deputies opposite are learning a lot of sense in the last five years.</P>

Anyone would suffer a nervous breakdown from the result of overwork and to teach the Fianna Fáil Party sense is overwork for a superman much less a simple mortal like myself.  But, when I read about Public Safety Acts I begin to think I have done the job too well.  I am not going to talk about the Public Safety Act to-night.  All I am asking you now is to deal with the wheat and dispose of that and if you will get that out of the way it will be a very valuable operation.  You have got the lead from the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He is a plain-spoken, rough man and he did not hesitate to tell the Minister for Agriculture that he did not give two hoots for the wheat scheme, that he would not trust the hens of the country to his wheat scheme and bought in all the wheat that was necessary in order to keep the people of this country in bread.  That is a sensible lead.  Follow him and kick the wheat scheme out.</P>

I think he is to be seen hastening through the streets of his native city with his loaf tucked underneath his arm as often as any of us.  Does he know that every time he tucks the loaf under his arm, he pays 1d. extra to the millers of this country in the sacred name of wheat? I do not know if he is to be seen rolling up his sleeves to mix a cake of an evening.  If he does he should know every time he does so he has to pay the millers 2d.

      <P>The speech is about the rotten wheat policy of this Government and the expenditure that it calls for under this Estimate to introduce seed wheat into this country to fool the farmers of this country and plunder the public.  I am asking the Government to abandon that policy and to return to a normal, sane, agricultural policy in this country that will provide the people of this country with a decent living on the land.  You have got an opportunity of starting that work now, and I urge most strongly on you that you take it.  If you do, and, at the same time, adopt the suggestions I have made here in regard to the removal of the tariff on artificial manures and the granting of a subsidy in relation thereto, then agriculture will be getting some really useful help. But the contents of this Supplementary Estimate, far from helping agriculture, are simply going to increase the wealth of the already wealthy manure ring and perpetuate the scandal of the wheat policy cod.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon reminds me always of a mourning old lady starting her ollagón.  In this case he complains of £40,000 being spent on sub-head G (3).  My only complaint about that is that I do not consider 10/- per ton a sufficient subsidy on fertilisers in this country.  That is my only complaint, that it is not a sufficient sum.  Deputy Dillon's plan would mean taking out of employment the 5,000 or 6,000 men who are working on fertilisers in this country, and throwing them out on the street to join the white army of unemployed.  That is Deputy Dillon's plan.  Deputy Dillon's first question is: &ldquo;Why are those fellows working, producing artificial manures for the Irish farmer, when we can get them across from Belgium just as well?&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Or Holland either.  That is the first line of Deputy Dillon's programme, and it is definitely at the back of every policy preached here by Deputy Dillon.  Well I know it.  Why have Irishmen employed here, manufacturing artificial manure, when we can carry it from Belgium or Holland? Deputy Dillon gave us a few prices. Deputy Dillon did not tell us something else, that on the very week that the Minister announced that 10/- a ton reduction on the artificial manures manufactured in this country, the foreign manures fell by that 10/- a ton straight off the reel.  I challenge contradiction on that.  Apparently, the foreigner was making 10/- a ton extra out of manures in this country until this scheme was brought in.  Those are facts I would advise Deputies to study, and study them a little more before they come out on Deputy Dillon's programme.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon then switched on to the wheat scheme, and to the wheat proposals, and he spoke for a very long period on the token Vote of £5.  I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will pardon me if I travel a little after him.</P>

Deputy Dillon told us that this scheme was a failure, and, whilst Deputy Dillon, a Deputy who is not a farmer, who does not grow wheat, spoke in that strain here, we had over there, sitting behind Deputy Dillon, two advocates, I am glad to say, of native wheat growing in this country.

Now, that is going too far.  I challenge Deputy Hughes to stand up here in this House and say whether or not he made money in the growing of wheat for the past three years.  That is an open challenge issued here.  I challenge Deputy Hughes, as a practical farmer, to stand up here and say whether or not wheat paid him for the past three years or since he started to grow it.</P>

On the other hand, he is telling us (he has changed his tune now, by the way) of the penny in the loaf Deputy Kelly has to pay on bread on account of the wheat.  He told us, before he adjourned to repair himself and get his second wind, as the saying is, that Deputy Kelly was paying that penny a loaf for the wheat that was imported to save this country in case of war, whereas, as a matter of plain, <Col N="540" /> honest fact, the extra price of flour in this country is largely due to the extra cost of labour in this country.</P>

If he is in a position to contradict what I say, nobody will be more glad than I, but let us not have this cry that the extra cost of flour here is on account of a few miserable shillings paid to the farmers for the production of wheat.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am complaining of misrepresentation of facts by Deputies on the opposite side.  Deputy Kelly was told here a while ago that he was paying a penny on his loaf of bread because of Irish wheat.  He is not.  He <Col N="541" /> is paying something extra on his bread on account of the extra cost of Irish labour, and he is paying it for the sake of manufacturing here and giving employment to our flour mill workers which they were not getting before this Government came into office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is profiteering, there is the Prices Commission which can be appealed to.  If I had spent half the time howling here about profiteering that Deputy Davin has spent, I would long ago have been before that commission with my case.  It is Deputy Davin's duty to go there, if he has a case, and if he has not a case, it is his duty to shut up.  Deputy Davin says that the millers are profiteering and I have heard the same statement from those benches on several occasions in the past two or three years.  If the case is there, there is a Prices Commission appointed by the Government to put an end to profiteering, and it is the duty of Deputy Davin and other members of the Labour Party who think they have a case, to go to the Prices Commission and put that case before them, instead of coming in here with this kind of cant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Up you go and put the case.  The Deputy can make his own speech later and I will listen attentively. That is the position with regard to wheat.  We heard Deputy Dillon for three-quarters of an hour condemning Irish wheat, but the farmers themselves are the best judges, and every year the acreage under wheat has increased by leaps and bounds, since the wheat scheme came in.  Despite the inclemency of the weather this year, I expect to see a still greater acreage under wheat next summer, for the sole reason that it pays the farmer.  That is the sole reason I expect to see it grown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter which, to my mind, is serious.  It is the matter of item No. 21&mdash;contributions by importers in respect of the staining of imported seed wheat.  I regret that the <Col N="542" /> Minister for Agriculture is not here, but I should like to know from him, in the first instance, why seed wheat had to be stained, and, in the second instance, what action was taken with regard to the culprits in the matter. Hundreds of tons of seed wheat were brought into this country last harvest. The bags were not even changed and they were taken down to the miller and sold as native Irish wheat.  I think it would be the duty of the Minister, whose Departmental officials came to know of it, to have prosecutions brought, and I want to know why they were not brought.  If there is extra money being paid for native Irish wheat here, as Deputy Davin and other Deputies allege, I do not see why any individuals, merchants or otherwise, should draw hundreds of pounds out of the purchase of seed wheat in England and its sale to the miller as Irish wheat.</P>
    <P>It actually travelled from the boat to the mills, in some instances; in other instances, it stayed for a night in the merchants' stores.  As this matter imposes a certain cost on the taxpayer &mdash;a double cost, in fact, because it has also put us to the expense of sending inspectors around to see that the wheat is stained&mdash;I cannot for the life of me understand why action has not been taken.  The sums involved amount to some thousands of pounds.  We see a poor devil down the country who is not able to pay his meat levy, or some other levy, harried and almost pulled asunder in one court and another, until he is shoved into bankruptcy because of his inability to pay some of the levies put on by the Minister.  Why, then, should we allow other gentlemen, who got rich quick in this game, to get away?</P>

I am alluding to item No. 21, and I want to know from the Minister why action was not <Col N="543" /> taken in regard to certain individuals who sold imported seed wheat, brought across from England, as Irish wheat to the Irish millers.  I think it is time that practices of that kind were stopped. The Minister apparently, put an end to them at a cost of £1,300, or a contribution from the importers of that amount.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Belton and the Minister can make that out between them.  All I am concerned with is that certain individuals in this country made thousands of pounds profit on the job. I carefully watched the Press to find out when the prosecutions would take place, and what was going to happen to these individuals, but, apparently, nothing happened to them, whilst here you have a poor devil down the country who was not able to pay his pig levy or something else, and you have him harried up and down the country.  It is not because a man is in a big way of business that he should be let go.  My job here is to see fair play for all my constituents at all costs, and I think this kind of thing should end now and end quickly.  As far as Deputy Dillon and his attacks on the wheat scheme are concerned, however, I think that if he would go down the country and stay with Deputy Hughes for a while, he might learn something about it.</P>

However, what I am suggesting is that, when next harvest comes along, if Deputy Dillon would ramble down to Deputy Hughes's place, he would be still more amazed when he sees Deputy Hughes occupied with his reaper and <Col N="544" /> binder, and so on cutting down the wheat that is despised and rejected by Deputy Dillon.  Perhaps Deputy Hughes might be able to coax Deputy Dillon down to his place next year, and if he were to spend a week there instead of hopping off to Australia, he would see what farming is like, and would come back here a sadder and a wiser man.</P>

I am very definite on that.  I think fertilisers are much needed for our land to-day and, if we are going to try to help out the farmers, they should be helped out generally.  Half-a-loaf is no good.  I do not wish to detain the House longer, but I should like to hear Deputy Hughes on his experience of growing wheat, and I am sure he would tell us the truth.</P>

Perhaps he will tell us that when he speaks again. Will he give us the figures as to the wages paid to the flour-milling workers at any period previous to the coming <Col N="545" /> into operation of the present wheat-growing policy, the time worked and so on, and work that out at so much per cwt. for the flour, having reference to the prices paid to the farmer and the profits to the millers themselves?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Corry told us that if the policy advocated by Deputy Dillon was put into force here it would mean throwing men out of employment in the Dublin factories where super-phosphate is manufactured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>No, in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, Cork.  That shows that, Deputy Corry has not the slightest conception or knowledge of the history of the prices of super-phosphate over a number of years.  He knows nothing at all about it.  I remember the war years and the conditions with regard to superphosphates then, and any farmer who was buying artificial manures at the time must remember the conditions then prevailing. I do not know whether or not Deputy Corry was buying artificial manures at that time.  During the war we relied here, for the supply of superphosphates, solely on Irish factories. There was no possibility of getting the foreign stuff.  After the war, when foreign stuff was allowed in, which was looked upon with suspicion by the farmers as not being up to the standard of the home stuff, the difference in price at that time was actually 17/- and 18/- a ton.  I remember the first year when foreign superphosphate came in, and the actual difference between the foreign and home-manufactured superphosphate was about 17/- a ton.  The foreign stuff was bought extensively that first year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the second year, the home manufacturers realised that, if they were to hold their position here, they would have to come into line as far as the price was concerned.  As a result, the <Col N="546" /> difference in price came down to about 9/- a ton, and in the third year the difference between the home manufactured and foreign superphosphate was only about 4/-.  I admit that the home manufactured stuff was better and was worth the difference of about 4/-.  It was not lumpy; it was free and fresh.  However, the fact remains that the coming in of the foreign super-phosphate secured for the farmers at that time a competitive price for artificial manures&mdash;one of the most important requirements for the land. I suggest that Deputy Corry, in his statement, showed that he was grossly ignorant of the real facts of the case.</P>
    <P>There is one thing upon which the whole economic future of this country depends, no matter how much balderdash is talked here about the development of industries, and that is, the main industry of this country, agriculture. That depends on the fertility of the soil, and the fertility of the soil in this country is definitely on the downgrade. It has not been attended to as it should have been attended to and as it is attended to in other countries. There is a tremendous amount of land in this country on the border-line of production.  It has been robbed to a large extent for a great number of years.  When the soil produces a crop for the farmer, it must be restored in some way, either by restoring vegetable matter to the soil and so on, or by the use of artificial manures.  A very big percentage of our land is crying out for some form of food to enable it to increase its fertility.  The most obvious and cheapest form is the provision of superphosphates.  That is the particular ingredient in which our soil is more deficient than any other.</P>
    <P>The first time I spoke in this House I advocated a subsidy on artificial manures and a competitive price for them.  As I have pointed out, we got a competitive price immediately after the war by allowing foreign superphosphates into this country.  From that time up to the time Fianna Fáil came into office Irish superphosphate manufacturers were able to hold their own on the market.  They were able to compete.  The factories that were producing manures during the war here are still in existence, although during <Col N="547" /> all that time they had to face competition from foreign manures coming in.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry suggests that the policy his Party put into force against the unfortunate farmers seven years ago is right and proper, and should be continued&mdash;to give the manure manufacturers in this country a monopoly to rob and exploit the farmers.  Incidentally, the soil of the country is suffering, and has suffered seriously as a result of that policy.  The Minister gives a miserable, paltry subsidy of £40,000 to help soil condition in this country. It is a contemptuous Vote.  It is an insult to the people who are giving any thought or attention to this question; a gross insult to the people who have studied or made any attempt to study soil conditions in this country.  I treat that Vote with contempt.  We have been trying to educate the Minister in this matter, and, after long persuasion, he comes along with this mean, paltry sum of money to throw to the farmers, with that kind of contempt which is typical of his Party.  Anything is good enough for the unfortunate devil down the country.  It is the big new industries which are going to grab the big sums.  It is like throwing a bone to a dog.  In actual fact, this money is not going to the farmers at all.  It is being given to the farmer to pass through his hands and go to swell the profits of the manure manufacturers in this country.  Deputy Corry knows that as well as I do.  Deputy Corry knows that there is no inducement whatever in that miserable 10/- per ton to increase the use of artificial manures here.  It is not going to help one iota in the increase of the use of fertilisers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry just admitted that any money put by the Government into a scheme of this kind would be the soundest and best investment possible. Fifty thousand pounds has been allocated for the development of the tourist industry, and we are told that the Minister for Industry and Commerce proposes to raise £500,000 to develop the tourist industry.  It may be of some use, but it will take a long time to increase the income from that industry by £1,000,000.  And then a few privileged people through the country will <Col N="548" /> benefit by it, such as hotel-keepers and people living in seaside resorts.  But if the Minister was courageous enough to put a decent sum of money into this sort of scheme, every active farmer would benefit, and fertility of the soil would improve; you would have better crops, better grass lands, more nutritious feeding in your grass, and, naturally, better stock as a result.  I think the Dáil should refer this Vote back, and ask the Minister to reconsider the whole matter, and that at the very least, in this first year, £100,000 should be voted for this.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not enough. It is not going to induce farmers to increase the use of superphosphates here.  To give an illustration of the necessity for a vast increase in the use of artificial manures, I may say that New Zealand uses ten times as much artificial manures per arable acre of land as we do; Holland and Denmark use about eight times as much; and the British use about seven times as much.  We are far and away below any other country in the world in the purchase of artificial manures.  This miserable 10/- per ton is a gross insult to the farmers, and nothing else.  I was here when the Minister was speaking, and another peculiar thing that struck me was that one member of the particular group of manufacturers the Minister proposes to subsidise by passing 10/- per ton through the farmers' hands in order to swell their profits has a factory in Londonderry, and that particular factory is going to be subsidised for any manure it may send into Donegal.  Why should that particular factory be treated in a privileged way?  Simply because some member of the manure ring in Dublin owns that factory in Londonderry. <Col N="549" /> That is the only reason given by the Minister why that particular factory should be subsidised.  There is no doubt about it that if a decent sum of money was put into this scheme it would be money well spent by the country, and public money could not be spent to better advantage.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corry, I am sure, felt he was putting me in a very awkward position when he suggested that I should be asked my opinion about wheat.  I will tell you honestly what my opinion is. The wheat scheme is all wrong so far as its administration goes.  People all over the country anywhere and on every type of land are being encouraged and induced to grow wheat. But there is not a big percentage of land in this country suitable for wheat production.  Poor land will not produce a decent crop of wheat, nor produce wheat at a reasonable profit even at a guaranteed price.  Low-lying land and land in an elevated position have the disadvantage that it is very doubtful if the wheat will ripen there in time. That is one of the reasons for the failure of the wheat crop all over the country.  There is a type of advertisement in the newspapers where one sees the farmer stuffing a lot of notes into his pocket, following on his selling a bountiful crop of wheat&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and thereby unfortunate people are induced to grow wheat irrespective of the sort of land they have, irrespective of its situation and of whether it is low-lying land or whether it is in a highly exposed, elevated situation.  As a result of that sort of propaganda you have failures in the wheat crop all over the country because of the unsuitability of the land.</P>

      <P>There has been in the same way a miserable loan or grant for poultry houses.  It has been pointed out here that there has been an <Col N="551" /> appalling falling off in the income from the exports of eggs.  Seven years ago we exported from this country £3,000,000 worth of eggs.  That is what our export trade in eggs was worth.  I notice Deputy Corry is leaving.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year our export trade in eggs was worth only £750,000. That is an alarming falling off in seven years.  When the new Agricultural Produce Bill was being discussed in this House we advocated that the Minister should seriously contemplate putting a decent sum of money into poultry houses.  We are suffering to a great extent from bad and defective poultry houses, and from the lack of properly heated poultry houses in the winter when eggs are more valuable than in the summer period.  If hens are not kept in warm, healthy fowl houses naturally they are not going to produce eggs.  If the Minister were to put a decent sum of money into this scheme for the improvement of poultry houses there would be undoubtedly productive results from it.  There is an enormous room for the development of our poultry industry.  I believe that loans are not sufficient and they are not going to do much good; they will not induce many people to build poultry houses.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce is going to put half a million of money into the tourist development business.  If a sum like that were put into the poultry industry it certainly would give far better results than could any sum of money put into the development of the tourist traffic here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are just one or two questions which I want to put to the Minister. First of all I would like to know, as far as this subsidy on superphosphate goes, whether he is aware that merchants down the country carried over stocks of manures since last year?  I know there are men who have ten or 20 tons of super over on their hands from last year.  Will they benefit by the subsidy or will they have to sell their stock in hands at a loss?  It <Col N="552" /> would, in my opinion, be a great hardship if they have to do so.  I would like if the Minister would clear up that point.  I do not know if the Minister is aware that there is a scale of prices issued by the Dublin merchants. I have the list here and it shows that the price for January is £3 13s. 3d. a ton; February, £3 15s.; March, £3 16s. 9d. and April to June £3 17s. 6d. Now we never had a scale operating in this country when there was any competition. The Irish manufacturers themselves stuck by a flat rate.  Because of competition the rate was a flat one. But the moment they got protection and had a monopoly the scale price rose from £3 13s. 3d. in January to £3 17s. 6d. in April to June.  I do not think there is any justification for that scale.  The figure of £3 13s. 3d. for January ought to obtain right through the season.  If the Minister is going to grant monopolies to people he ought to have the courage to see that prices, to some little extent at all events, are right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CorneliusMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at the disadvantage that unfortunately I was not in the House when Deputy Dillon started to speak.  Just as I entered the Chamber Deputy Dillon was expressing his sympathy with the farming community. He pointed out the duties of Deputies as far as the farming community was concerned.  He suggested, as agriculture was our main industry, that all Deputies in this House should endeavour to do their best to help the agriculturists.  I listened attentively to what he had to say and as he proceeded, although I could not say that his speech was very enlightening, it was, at all events, enlivening.  It helped to add a little bit of life to the drab proceedings in the House.  Before he finished, the Deputy changed his tune and decried the Government's wheat scheme.  He had sympathy for the farmer in one breath and in the other he wanted to deny him the State assistance he is getting from the Government.  So far as the wheat scheme is concerned, the Deputy was blowing hot and cold.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hughes and Deputy Dillon tried to make a case for the admission of foreign phosphates free of duty.  I purchased some which were guaranteed <Col N="553" /> to contain 35 per cent., of soluble phosphate in 1925.  It happened to be 5/- per ton less than the home product.  As a result of my experience I will never again buy foreign phosphate, no matter what the price.  They do not give within 50 per cent. of the results to be obtained from the home-manufactured article.  I certainly would not buy the foreign phosphates now.  Deputy Hughes dealt a good deal with the fertility of the soil, and with the policy of his Party some years ago so far as the farmers are concerned.  The records show that financial assistance given to the farmers by the previous Administration did not reach anything like the amount given by this Government. I challenge contradiction on that.</P>
    <P>I would feel happier if the provision under the first sub-head of this Supplementary Estimate was larger than it is. It can be said, at any rate, that it is a start in the right direction.  If the Deputies on the opposite benches are serious in their efforts to help the agricultural community they should not be declaring that this is a miserable scheme.  If they were earnest in what they say they would encourage farmers to avail of its provisions.  By doing so they would be helping agricultural production, the farming community and the country as a whole.  If, as Deputy Hughes says, the farmers are not cultivating their land in as efficient a manner as they might, I hold that the responsibility for that falls largely on the Deputies opposite, because they have tried consistently to discourage farmers from taking advantage of schemes put forward by this Government.</P>
    <P>I am glad that this subsidy is being confined to the Irish fertilisers.  After all, when money is to be spent, it should be kept in the country as far as possible.  I would appeal to Deputies opposite not to be minimising the advantages of schemes brought forward in the interests of the agricultural community. We all realise that agriculture is our major industry, and that it deserves all the support, financial and otherwise, that we can give it.  But the full benefits of any schemes will not be realised if certain people go round the country trying to dissuade farmers from availing of them.  I think it is the <Col N="554" /> duty of all members of the House to encourage farmers to avail of all those schemes, and thus help to put the world's first industry and our country's greatest industry in the foremost place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I had hopes some time ago, following a preliminary announcement by the Minister on this matter, that he had at least got his feet in the ground and was about to take his courage, so to speak, in his hands; that, irrespective of what his past may have been or that of his Party, and God knows it is not a past to be proud of so far as agriculture is concerned, he would at least realise that this is an agricultural country, largely dependent upon live stock.  The Minister realises that now.  Having realised that, I thought he would also have the courage to say that the fertility of the soil must be improved to produce more and better live stock.  I was sadly disappointed when I saw the proposal to give a subsidy of 10/- per ton on manure.  I do not regard any money given for manure as a subsidy at all; I regard it as a national investment.  The Minister for Finance, whose opinions on agriculture, I fear, I never valued, recently placed himself at the mercy of the Minister for Agriculture.  I am sure the Minister for Agriculture will make the case that £40,000 was as much as he could get from the Department of Finance for this purpose.  At a meeting of the Institute of Bankers recently, the Minister for Finance said that the future of this country would depend on the export of agricultural produce into the one market we had&mdash;the British market.  That is not my statement, though I said it often enough; it is the statement of the Minister for Finance. What do we export to the British market? We do not export potatoes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very little.  Live stock is what we export.  When the Minister for Finance goes about the country mouthing sympathy with the farmers, and telling of the advances that could be made by greater productivity, he should not refuse the wherewithal for the improvement of the soil, with a view to that greater productivity.  I should like to know what was at the back of the mind of the Minister for <Col N="555" /> Agriculture when he thought of this scheme.  I had thought that there would be such a scheme of subsidies as would induce a man&mdash;particularly a poor man &mdash;to double or treble the amount of manure he was putting on.  The price of the best superphosphate in Roscommon is £4 14s. 6d. per ton.  Imagine the Minister for Agriculture saying to the small farmer in Roscommon, &ldquo;We are conferring a great benefit on you by giving you your ton of manure at £4 4s. 6d.&rdquo;  That is no use.  It is not going to induce him to apply an extra pound of manure.  The man who can find £4 4s. 6d. will find £4 14s. 6d.  But as for inducing the small farmer to spread more manure, this scheme will be of no benefit whatever.  It might be a benefit to the man who was putting on four tons of manure in the year.  He might add half a ton; or the man putting on eight tons might put on an additional half ton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said some time ago that what he had in mind was the cheapening of manures for grass lands.  I agree with him.  That is what he ought to have in mind.  There are 8,000,000 acres of grass land in the country, and, if you divided the £40,000 amongst them, it would not amount to a penny per acre.  If we trace the history of that one item&mdash;cattle&mdash;which stands to us better than anything else, what do we find?  That the calves are reared by the small farmers.  If we want to put the small farmer in a position to rear five calves where he was only able to rear three heretofore, can we do anything better than say to him &ldquo;You can have two tons of manure for the price of one&rdquo;?  That would be a national investment and not a subsidy or loan. There is no use in Deputy Meaney or Deputy Kelly saying that everybody knows that agriculture is our main industry. If we know that, why do we not act on it?  If agriculture is our main industry, then the wealth of the country is in the soil.  Are we satisfied that the soil is producing to capacity? Everybody knows that the soil is being robbed&mdash;completely robbed.  We know that it is difficult for the Fianna Fáil Party and the Government to attune themselves to the conditions they now see.  We are no longer living in the <Col N="556" /> fools' paradise sketched by the Taoiseach here in 1928, when he said he wanted to see the country with a big wall around it, without ingress or egress.  That was his idea of self-sufficiency. We have got away from that.  The Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture have got away from it.  That is something for which to be thankful.  We are learning as we go on.</P>
    <P>Think of the position in which we are now.  There is an opportunity for taking advantage of the British market while there is money there.  This is the time to get in.  There is no use in trying to get in when the money is gone. I am not a prophet, but we all know the spending that is proceeding on certain lines in practically all the countries of the world.  We, ourselves, are to spend practically £1,000,000 on war materials, and we are offered £40,000 as a subsidy on artificial manures to make the soil more productive, and enable us to pay our way. We are to spend £1,000,000 on guns for &mdash;I do not know what.  I suppose it was too much to expect that the Minister for Agriculture would stand up for what were his new convictions. I thought he had come to the point where he realised where we were.  The Minister for Finance, who is a city man, realises that if we are to stand the racket, if we are to make up for the reduction in our foreign investments, we must have greater productivity and more agricultural exports. How are you going to have them?  You are not going to get them by a subsidy of £40,000 for manures.  Why should we confine ourselves to the products of Irish factories if the Irish factories are not able to meet our demands?  Would it be any loss to Irish factories if there was such a scheme of subsidisation as would enable the farmers&mdash;particularly the small farmers&mdash;to double or treble the amount of fertilisers?  Are the Irish fertiliser factories more important than the people of the country?  It is like the &ldquo;codology&rdquo; we were treated to about Deputy Hughes making money out of wheat.  Who wants individuals to make money out of the rest of the community?  There are people who make money out of wheat at the expense of <Col N="557" /> the poor.  How many people are growing it?  How many are making fertilisers?  We want to get this country into such a condition that it will produce more, and that it will produce a better article.  How are you going to do that?  This will not do it.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Agriculture thinks that the subsidy of 10/- a ton is going to induce people, and particularly the small farmer, to do all he expects, then he is very much mistaken.  The small farmer is the man who wants one ton of manure; he is the man who feeds the calves more than anybody else. The Minister possibly does not like calves.  People are very often haunted by the ghosts of those they have slain. With all that, if the Minister did the decent thing over this I would be inclined to kill a fatted calf for him to celebrate the prodigal's return; but that has not come yet.  If the Minister had any real interest in the small farmers, whom he and his Party pretend to represent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;they would not bring in that type of Estimate, which will enable the man who buys eight tons of manure to benefit, but the man who buys one ton will not be in a position to take advantage of it.  This is no inducement to him.  Deputy Corry talked about manure manufacturers, and I was wondering what was the significance of it.  I think the significance was entirely lost on Deputy Corry.  The meaning of the whole thing was quite different from the meaning Deputy Corry took out of it. Deputy Corry said foreign manure dropped 10/- a ton immediately the Minister announced his scheme.  What is the meaning of that?  It does not mean anything more to me than that the whole lot of them were in a ring. If the Minister was convinced that there was something in his scheme of subsidisation for fertilisers, and if somebody has prevented him putting that scheme into operation, he ought to announce that, or else, if his own Executive has prevented him doing it, he ought to resign off the Executive. This whole thing is a pretence and a <Col N="558" /> sham.  I do not agree with Deputy Dillon in regard to this thing.  He says it will do some good, but I do not see that it will do any good at all. The people we want to get at are the small farmers, but this will not get anywhere.</P>
      <P>There is another matter to which I wish to refer.  Loans and grants will be issued for agricultural purposes. There will also be loans for the purchase or erection of poultry houses, and the amount is given as £500.  I hope the Minister will tell us more about the money provided for poultry houses and will inform the House if the Department still adheres to the scheme they circulated, that whatever loans are given out in this manner they have to be repaid within three or four years. If the Minister thinks that is going to be a success, if he thinks any woman who goes in for fowl and gets a loan of £15 to build a poultry house will be able to pay back £5 a year in the first three years, when she is endeavouring to establish her little industry, he is making a big mistake.  Nobody will be prepared to chance it.  If anybody is to take advantage of the scheme, the repayments will have to be spread over a longer period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to say much about the importation of wheat.  We have it here in a small way and I do not wish to talk about wheat schemes generally, but at any rate it arises.  Do you know what my opinion of wheat-growing is? I grow it, although I must admit I had not any this year or last year.  Anybody can grow wheat in this country when the people pay him for it at the price they are being charged.  But I submit it is a national loss.  Do you know what wheat-growing is?  It is a war-time measure and nothing else.  If a man can make equally good money at anything else without a loss to the community, why should he not do it and why should that carrot be held out to him?  If the Ministry felt that we were in a crisis and that certain things should be done and that wheat should be grown, we ought to grow it, but unless we are bitten by the war bug I do not see anything in it except to compel people to pay double what they ought to pay for flour.  A very small number grow wheat.  How many <Col N="559" /> farmers grow it in comparison with the number of people who are paying £1 a sack too much for the flour?</P>
    <P>I am very dissatisfied with the scheme the Minister has brought in. The main thing in the Estimate that matters to the people is the subsidy for artificial manure.  It was the one thing upon which I had pinned some faith in the Minister.  I felt he was going to do something for the small farmers.  We are a nation of small farmers.  With the exception of two or three countries, if you went to find out from the Census the number of people under £15 valuation you would be amazed.  These people will reap nothing at all out of this proposal.  The Government could as easily find £1,000,000 for this as for guns for the Army, but they will not do it.  The Minister for Finance can tell the people at a bankers' dinner that the right thing to do is to increase productivity. He ought not to be allowed to refuse proper assistance to agriculture and I do not think he would have the cheek to do it if it was properly put up to him.  I am afraid the Minister for Agriculture never had the courage to stand up to his post.  Even Deputy Corry had to complain about people who brought wheat into the country, at his instigation, seed wheat, and sold it to the Irish mills as Irish wheat at 10/- or 12/- a barrel more than they paid for it, and they got away with it. If we have any belief at all our belief is in live stock; it is in the soil, and let us try to put more into it in order to get more out of it.  The Minister is not helping us to do that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesFitzgeraldKenne" hpid="Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Meaney asked that Deputies on this side of the House should help this scheme along.  One would almost imagine that this scheme for giving £40,000 as a subsidy towards the sale of artificial manures was some new brain-wave which the Minister had suddenly acquired.  Again and again&mdash; this is the second time to-day I have got up in this House&mdash;I have said that I am glad that Fianna Fáil is doing the right thing.  I am sorry that it has taken so many years to drive the right thing into the heads of Fianna Fáil Ministers.  Why, it is over four <Col N="560" /> years since I myself put down a motion in this House stating that, owing to the way the Fianna Fáil Party had dealt with agriculture, it was a matter of necessity, if the fertility of the soil was to be preserved, that help should be given to the farmers in the purchase of artificial manures.  Then the Minister was dead against any such idea.  Then the Minister's chief satellite was dead against any such idea. It has taken four years, during which the fertility of the soil has been steadily deteriorating, to bring the Minister to recognise the necessity of taking such a course.</P>
      <P>Let us take this Estimate as it stands.  Forty thousand pounds is a matter of very small importance. Forty thousand pounds is going to do very little, indeed, to help Irish farmers in restoring to the soil the fertility which the economic war, promoted by the benches opposite, took from it.  The Minister should be aware that, certainly in the West of Ireland and I believe all over the poorer parts of the country, three or four seasons' crops of meadow were taken off land to which no manure had been applied.  The land has deteriorated and it would take a tremendous amount of manure to get that land back into the condition of fertility in which it was before Fianna Fáil came into office.  What do we get?  We get simply a sum of £40,000 at the rate of 10/- per ton on superphosphate, semsol and ground mineral phosphates and 5/- per ton on complete and compound manures.  I should like to know from the Minister if, as I understood, one of his ideas was that grass-land and meadow-land should be improved, why the Minister has left out the most important manure for second class and indeed for any class of grazing land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anybody who has tried, let me say, semsol or ground mineral phosphate as against basic slag, will know that basic slag is far and away better, out in a class by itself, for the improvement of land.  The great thing about basic slag is the way it brings out clovers on second class land, especially white clover.  Surely the Minister cannot deny that on any land, especially land of a moory nature, basic slag <Col N="561" /> simply works a revolution.  I can say from many years' experience of putting out basic slag on land, very second class land, and seeing how it has improved, that it is superior and that it retains that improvement for many years.</P>

      <P>Passing away from that question to deal with the subsidy for fertilisers, I may say that that is a proposal of which I approve thoroughly.  It is a scheme which should be conducted on a very big scale and a real effort should be made by the Government to get the land of the country back to a proper state of fertility.  Now surely when one hears all over the House, of late days at any rate, an admission that agriculture is the foundation of our national life, that the agricultural industry is the industry upon which the whole State depends, it is the height of folly, criminal folly, to tax the raw materials of that industry.  If you want to have an industry flourishing, if you want an industry to go ahead and expand, one thing you must do is to try to get its raw materials as cheaply as you possibly can.  The idea of saying that we want to encourage industry, while at the same time we tax the raw material of that industry is simply absurd.  Yet that is the attitude which was taken up by the Minister and, in the course of the debate, was also taken up by that eminent agriculturist, Deputy Kelly.  It is entirely and absolutely unsound.  If you want to have Irish agriculture put upon its feet you must at the present moment not only take all taxes off the raw material of that industry but you should subsidise, and subsidise to a very considerable extent, the raw material of that industry.  Sir, you will be relieved to hear that I am not going to mention the word &ldquo;wheat.&rdquo;  I will pass on to another part of the Estimate.</P>

The deficiency in Appropriations-in-Aid is the main item which we are voting on here.  It is due to the fact that the Minister's estimate of what would be available as Appropriations-in-Aid has fallen short by the enormous sum of £230,000.

We are asking for the deficiency in Appropriations-in-Aid, <Col N="564" /> £229,655; that is at least as I understand it.  The total Vote is £173,472; there were savings of £319,490 on the general Estimate, but we have to vote the sum of £229,655, because the Appropriations-in-Aid have fallen that amount below the Estimate.</P>

I am glad that he is now in a position to state that he has been converted to the view that Irish agriculture requires financial assistance as far as getting the raw material is concerned. I hope that having come to that conclusion, and having given up the theory for which he battled for so many years, the Minister will at some time or other during the course of this present year bring forward a revised and better Estimate.  I hope that when he introduces his Agricultural Estimate, he will make this offer to help by subsidy the sale and purchase of artificial manures a general reality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>A Leas-Chinn Chomhairle: all sides of the House are agreed that anything which will increase the productivity of the soil will add to the wealth of the nation, and, therefore, the move that the Minister has made is a step in the right direction.  However, anybody <Col N="566" /> who looked into the statistics showing the acreage of grass land and tillage in this country would have imagined that there was a misprint, and that it was £400,000 the Minister meant to give instead of £40,000, which if it was availed of by every farmer in this country would certainly give a very disappointing amount of help.  But there is this hope, that the Minister may only be trying it out as an experiment, and that next year or when he comes to consider the general Estimate he will give a very much larger sum, which will add to the wealth of the country.  Those who have used artificial manures on land know what an important item it is in farming economy.  Farmers who do not use artificial manures in order to fertilise the soil are simply clogging work on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a large factory in my constituency, that of Messrs.  Goulding, and I am naturally anxious that everything should be done to foster the production of that factory, so long as the prices fixed are economic.  The Minister, when considering giving a subsidy for manures, should remember that that might be a dangerous thing, unless there was a certain amount of price control, because a subsidy might very easily go in the wrong direction without such control.  Deputy Meaney referred to the difference in the quality of foreign superphosphates and home-produced superphosphates.  The only way to find the difference is in the texture.  Naturally every farmer who experiments takes good care to see that the analyses of the manures he uses on his land are all right.  If the analyses of the foreign and the home products are identical, then the only difference is in the texture.  I must say this much for the home-produced commodity, that it is placed on the market in fresh condition, and free from that rougher character that some other manures possess.  The first thing to be done, however, is to let the land have the manure, as, if we can do anything to cheapen agricultural production, it will add to the wealth of the country.  The way to add to that wealth is to cheapen overhead charges.  The Government that is going to explore means of reducing overhead expenses of agriculturists <Col N="567" /> will be helping development in the great national factory, the land.  I consider that this is only an experimental step.  Surely if defence and other forms of enterprise are helped with large sums of money, the industry that will increase production more than anything else is the one that should engage the special attention of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, the Minister for Agriculture should be the most important Minister on the Government Benches. He is the one we all look to for that relief which is absolutely essential to agriculture.  We should not forget that farmers have not been able to make use of artificial manures in recent years because they had not the money to buy them or to pay rates and land annuities. As they had not the money to carry on agricultural activities on their farms, they were not able to get cheap means of encouraging production. In addition, they were not able to give the land farmyard manure, because they had no live stock.  The result is that the land is less fertile. That is a point that should engage the attention of the Minister and his advisers when framing their future agricultural policy.  We cannot ignore the important fact that grass lands have deteriorated, having in some cases been laid down with bad seeds.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney pointed out, an essential thing, basic slag, has been left out of this particular scheme. I feel that the use of basic slag should be encouraged.  If the Minister thinks it too dear, then he should explore the reasons and find a method to enable farmers to get back to a solid agricultural economy.  It is most important that pure lines of seeds for cereals should be imported, and I ask the Minister to try to remove some of the difficulties that are clogging the progress of agriculture in that respect.  I had a letter from a merchant in Midleton complaining that he had been refused a licence to import seed for cereals.</P>

      <P>The importation of good strains of wheat is very important. This was a great wheat growing country at one time, and it must be a matter of surprise to farmers to-day to know how those who went before us were able to grow very large crops, seeing that times were not very different to what they are now.  If certain good strains of seed wheat were imported, I think that that would add to the fertility of the soil, taken in connection with an increase in the subsidy. I ask the Minister to bear that question in mind when bringing in another Estimate.</P>

      <P>I am glad that the Minister, like his colleagues, has learned or, at least, has given expression to a lesson learned for the last six or seven years, but that was disguised or obscured from the knowledge of this House.  On many occasions I stated here that while I, personally, supported the policy of wheat growing, I disapproved of the policy being pursued by the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is easy to be on the right side, and the Government is endeavouring to get back there now by a back door.  The growing of wheat was not an agricultural proposition as carried out under the Minister's ministry.  It was wheat-ranching. Year after year, wheat was grown on the same land during the last six or seven years, and the increase in wheat growing was due to wheat-ranching, not to the ordinary methods of husbandry. The Minister will not deny that.  I have said here on many occasions that there was no difference between the manner in which wheat was grown and how the soil was robbed&mdash;there was no difference between that and a highwayman who would go into a bank manager and demand of him to hand money across the counter&mdash;no difference whatever. The Minister has now realised that. His Government have realised it. Other members of the Government&mdash; after their colleagues had said the British market was gone for ever, thank God&mdash;have now told us that the British market is our only market, after the Minister had hawked his wares around Europe.  Even the few Reds we had in this country sent bulls to Barcelona and Valencia.  Now we are recognising it, but another day will come for that.</P>
      <P>The Minister now realises that there is only one market.  He realises that the soil of the country has been robbed of its fertility, and he offers to restore that fertility by the paltry sum of £40,000, appropriately explained by Deputy Hughes, that it was about a penny an acre to grass land.  Let the Minister, when he is replying, tell us how much grass land there is, and how far a penny an acre on that grass land will go to improve the quantity and quality of the herbage on that pasture land.  Now, I understand that the subsidy is on super-potassic, super and semsol.  He is not allowing it on potash or ammonia.  Am I correct in that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>And why?  The three <Col N="570" /> ingredients of manure are phosphates, potash and ammonia.  Any good farmer with regard to manures is going to handle his manures just as any good farmer will handle his feeding stuffs, and it was because of that that I was always against this compound mixture promoted by people who never fed cattle successfully.  We pass away from that.  Now, he is going to give a subsidy to a compound manure, and he will not give a subsidy to the ingredients of that compound manure, the three mainstays of a well-balanced manure, to give the intelligent progressive farmer the same privilege that he will give the other type of farmer. The Minister knows that every progressive farmer in this country mixes his own manures, and men who mix their own manures differ very widely, according to their land, and according to their experience in the ratios by which they mix the manure.  I suppose the Minister is aware of this, that in European countries, it is possible for a farmer to go to the Ministry of Agriculture there.  Just as if a cow was sick you send for a vet., he will go and diagnose and treat that cow, similarly, the Minister for Agriculture will send out an expert to diagnose the soil, give advice on what that soil is lacking and, following on that, manures can be mixed to supply the deficiencies of that soil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>A few years ago&mdash;I will not mention the official's name, but he is one of the principal men in the Minister's Department&mdash;I met an officail at Mass.  We rambled up to a field of about 20 acres that I was manuring on the grass and it had not been tilled for 40 years.  I said to him what I have just said to the House.  He said, &ldquo;I am afraid you will wait a long time, <Col N="572" /> Mr. Belton, before we will have reached that stage in this country.&rdquo;  I am sure we have not reached it yet and no manure manufacturer ever attempted it in this country except a syndicate from France and Belgium that started a few years ago here. They would do it and they did it but they were crushed out&mdash;the Irish Novo Company.</P>
      <P>Let us assume that it can be done, that does not affect my point, whether it can or cannot be done.  In fact, it goes to strengthen my argument.  It can be done, of course, if the Minister says it is done, and he has machinery for doing it.  I accept that.  Will the Minister agree with this, that, to do it scientifically, no two soils will require exactly the same compound, that nitrates, phosphates and potash will be in different proportions, according to the deficiencies in the soil?  Is not that the position?</P>

I do not want to classify myself as a good farmer, but I would rather lose the 10/- on any compound mixture. I would prefer to lose and mix it myself than to take any compound mixture.  So, I would appeal to the Minister to consider that the potash and ammonia get the maximum subsidy and give people who will go to the trouble an opportunity of carrying out their own methods.  There are many rough and, ready ways of analysis.  It can be done on the head of an old shovel, good enough for practical purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>If it has increased, all the better.  The Minister, however, mentioned a sum of £100,000.  Personally, I would rather see derating or some big thing like that done for the farmers so as to give them a fair chance rather than the spoon-feeding, but if we are to have spoon-feeding, I should like the Minister to use a bigger spoon than he is using.  A sum of £100,000 would not be enough as a subsidy in this matter because, as the Minister will appreciate, much of this country has gone into rushes.  There are minor and major drainage schemes which are helping to banish the rushes, but, in addition, you want manure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have great sympathy with what Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney said about basic slag.  There is a large lime content in it, or, at least, it does the work which lime does on land.  I am sure that basic slag, if applied in time, is a much better dressing than semsol. For a crop for this coming year, semsol is better than basic slag at this stage, but if basic slag were applied last November, it would give better results this coming year than semsol applied at any time.  I am sure the Minister will agree with that.  With regard to lime, I put a question to the Minister the other day and he spoke of a subsidy of 1/- a barrel, or 8/- a ton.  The Minister will appreciate that 8/- a ton on slag lime represents 100 per cent. <Col N="574" /> of the price, while 8/- a ton on good fresh roach lime would represent about one-quarter or one-fifth of the price.  I think the Minister should increase the subsidy for lime, or give it only to roach lime.</P>
    <P>There should be an encouragement to people to use lime, especially in the areas in which the Government is spending a lot of money on drainage, because the best dressing for land that has been drained is a good lime dressing. It is not fair to the State to give 8/- a ton subsidy on the refuse from the lime kilns because I can get as much as I want of that stuff delivered to me for 8/- a ton, and if I were to put that on land, and get the Minister's 8/- subsidy, he would be paying the whole price of the lime for me.  That is obviously not fair.  On the other hand, 8/- a ton is not a sufficient subsidy for good fresh roach lime which will cost 35/- to 40/- a ton delivered.  It is only the roach lime, hot from the kiln, that will do a first-class job on wet land which has been recently drained, and I suggest that the Minister should consider increasing the subsidy, or confining it to freshly burned lime, or graduating it and giving the maximum amount to freshly burned lime because it will then work out at an equal proportion of the total cost.  In that case, of course, he will have the trouble of supervision.</P>
    <P>We have a good deal to say about wheat growing and I would be tempted to test the Chair on that question, but we are on the eve of the Estimates and we will have sufficient latitude to discuss wheat growing and the growing of other crops, together with general policy, when the Estimates come before us.  Finally, I strongly appeal to the Minister to give the full amount of subsidy for potash and ammonia. He may have a very good reason for it, but I should like to know what it is. If we are not producing those things in this country, it is no reason why we should not get a subsidy, if the intention behind this is to improve the fertility of the soil.  We cannot improve the fertility of the soil on a manure which is not fully balanced, just as we cannot relish a dinner of all potatoes, all cabbage or all meat.  We want a balanced food.  So it is with soil and <Col N="575" /> if the Minister wants a properly balanced food, and is giving a subsidy for it, he should give it for the various ingredients that go to make a good compound and a good, properly balanced manure.</P>

      <P>In this Estimate, there is really only one sub-head that needs the immediate attention of the Government, sub-head G (3), fertiliser schemes.  It was not my intention to take part in the debate at this late hour were it not that I have been interviewed by farmers on a few occasions in the past month or two, and particularly since the Minister made the statement that he was to give 10/- per ton reduction in respect of one manure and 5/- in respect of another.  My reason for intervening is that we have two industries down in the West of Ireland which, I learn from the farmers down there, have been suffering very much for want of manure.  They are the beet and potato industries.  I have also been told by these farmers that this 10/- per ton is being given on the wrong manures for tillage purposes, that it is principally given for grass and the 5/- for manures for tillage purposes.  I cannot see the idea of that where you have beet and potato industries and alcohol factories, and in view of the fact that the Minister and his Government were not interested in grass.  It is a good sign, at the same time, to see the Minister realising the mistake of his Government when they said there was no further use for live stock.</P>

I should like the Minister to state in his reply whether the acreage of beet for 1937 was greater or less for the Tuam factory than the acreage for 1938, that is, the acreage under beet for 1938 as compared with 1937.  I think that the 1938 crop suffered more than the 1937 crop for the reason that the crop did not get sufficient manure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister need not tell us that.  Anything that applies to England applies to this country now. However, there is one crop that I know well, and that is the potato crop.  In 1937 and 1938 we had about 10,000 acres grown in part of Galway.  The tonnage exported on the 1937 crop was 5,000 tons, whereas the most that could be exported of the 1938 crop is 3,000 tons. If the Minister enquires of any farmer in the West of Ireland or any of his inspectors, he will find out that the reduction in tonnage to the acre, for <Col N="577" /> certified seed potatoes for export purposes is from 6½ tons to 4 tons per acre. That is the position there.  Of course, the Minister might say that we had bad weather, that we had too much rain and that the weather was not suitable for planting.  Probably, he will also say that the farmers left their potatoes too long in the soil and the frost got at them, but the fact remains that the yield has been reduced from 6½ tons to 4 tons per acre from 1937 to 1938.</P>
      <P>I want the Minister to take this matter seriously.  He knows very well that the 1/- a bag or the 6d. a bag for phosphates, ammonia, and nitrate for tillage purposes, is no use to the farmer.  He is also aware, from the losses that the farmer suffered during 1938, that the subsidy or benefit he is getting is of no use.  The Minister is not taking this matter seriously.  The Minister for Finance, in answer to a question last week, I think, said that up to £100,000 was being given for fertilisers, but then that includes what is being done by the agricultural committees, and so on, through the country.  The Minister knows that the farmyard manure is being taken from the farmers, and the land requires more artificial manure to-day than it required two or three years ago, because the farmers have been deprived of the farmyard manure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahRyan" hpid="Colonel Ryan Colonel Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>While not in any way opposing this Estimate, I feel that it falls far short of what it might, and could, have been.  In fact, this very first item in the Estimate, about which we had so much talk, of £40,000 for a fertilising scheme in this country, seems shameful.  It is awful to think that £40,000 would help even in the smallest way to fertilise the land of this country, especially after the last five or six years, when the Minister and everybody else in the House know that there were no fertilisers used for what he seemingly meant it for, on the grass lands of this country.  Whatever fertiliser was used in the last five or six years was used to grow wheat or beet&mdash;purely artificial manuring&mdash;and this scheme, as the Minister has put it, looks as if it were for the purpose of fertilising grass lands.  Others have <Col N="578" /> commented on what £40,000 would do as regards fertilisers for about 8,000,000 acres of grass lands or more. The Minister must know that it is of no real use.  Three or four months ago great things were expected when the Minister made a statement at some meeting that he was about to subsidise fertilisers, and everybody was waiting to hear about the great scheme, and now we get this thing of 10/- per ton. That may be all right for the man using about 100 tons of manure, but that would be a very small subsidy for the people who buy one, two or three tons in the year&mdash;in fact, two tons might be the more general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, it is admitted by the Minister for Finance that we have to export more agricultural produce from this country in order to balance how things are going, and in order to receive more money here instead of the money that used to come from investments.  The Minister for Finance has stated that we must produce more, and that the land must be made better.  Is this the way you are going about making it better? I think it would have been better if this had not been introduced at all.  I regard it as an awful mistake, and, while I welcome it, I should like to oppose that £40,000 as being altogether insufficient.  I say it is foolish madness. It is like throwing something into the sea which never can be found.  If you throw something into the ocean, you cannot find it, and I say that £40,000 for fertilisers on the land of this country is of no use at all.  It should never have been thought of. Even if it had been twice as much&mdash;£1 a ton&mdash;it would not be much use.  Then, take the question of lime.  Lime is a thing that is dealt with through the county committees of agriculture, and there is a certain amount of money for it.  Seemingly, there has never been proper respect for the land at all.  I suggest that each particular area should be studied, and that the amount spent with regard to lime in certain areas should be added on to the £40,000 in the areas which require phosphates instead of lime.  Deputy Belton referred to the three mixtures which, as he said, are mixed by all good farmers&mdash;phosphates and so on.  There <Col N="579" /> are two of those on which a subsidy is not given to its full extent.  I would impress on the Minister that encouragement should be given to that type of farmer to buy their own stuff and mix it, as they have practical experience of dealing with their own lands.</P>
    <P>Any good farmer at one time or another has tried the different ingredients and has a practical experience of them.  Instead of helping the manufacturers, as this looks like doing, which I am sure is not the intention of the Minister, I think that he ought to see that every ounce of benefit that is got from this scheme should reach the people working the land.  For that reason, I ask him to reconsider this matter from the point of view of lime and of the different manures and give the farmer a chance of getting the most benefit he can from the practical experience he has had.  That is what the Minister, I am afraid, is not doing in this.</P>
    <P>As I said in the beginning, the whole thing is no use whatever.  We want to produce more.  The Minister believes that and he wants to have a scheme of subsidy so far as the fertilisation of land is concerned.  At the moment, we have more cattle than we had 12 months ago.  We should try to increase our dairy cows even more.  But what is going to feed them?  It is admitted on all sides, I think, that grass is more profitable than anything else we might grow.  No matter what else we grow, we will have to continue growing 8,000,000 acres of it, and about half that amount is nearly non-fertile at present.  This £40,000 will be of no avail whatever.  The Minister should say to the Minister for Finance: &ldquo;You will have to give a lot more money to try to make the land fertile, to see that the cows produce more milk.&rdquo; Manures will do that.</P>
    <P>Another matter which has been talked about a great deal to-night is wheat growing.  I am not a lover of wheat growing; neither am I against it.  I think the people, if they wish to grow wheat, should be allowed to do so, and I would encourage them to do it if they would do it.  But I wonder what is the opinion of the Minister and <Col N="580" /> the Department as to an economic price for wheat per barrel?  Is £1 per barrel an economic price, in their opinion?  I am afraid this wheat business is a war-time measure.  I think it has been proved definitely this year that it is a war-time measure&mdash;the people here are being forced into growing wheat.  I am not against growing wheat, but I am against growers not manuring the land properly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahRyan" hpid="Colonel Ryan Colonel Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Colonel Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry for that. I want to remind the Minister that without manures wheat cannot be grown.  Without a big subsidy for manures wheat will not continue to be grown.  Therefore I think the Minister should not spend any more money than he has spent already from public funds for the growing of wheat.  The consumer is paying enough.  I do not think there should be a penny in this Estimate for wheat because the public have paid too much already for the growing of it.  But, because that is hidden, and because the people do not see it, it is supposed to be all right. Therefore I could not stand even for £5 being spent under this Estimate for the growing of wheat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind the Minister that with the number of cattle increasing in this country, and with better conditions being likely, more manure is wanted for the land.  I ask him to impress on the Minister for Finance to give a big subsidy for manures in the next financial year in order that the fertility of the soil may be improved. There is no other way of doing it.  No matter how much potatoes or other crops we may grow, our most valuable asset is grass.  We have to depend on grass to increase the production of live stock.  If we are to send live stock to the British market we must have good live stock, and there is no means of producing that live stock except by having good grass.  I <Col N="581" /> would, therefore, impress on the Minister the necessity for a big subsidy for manures.</P>

      <P>I must say that I am very disappointed with this debate, although I suppose I should have sense by now.  When a scheme is brought in here, be it ever so small, to confer some benefit on agriculture, we have the spokesman for the Party opposite &mdash;Deputy Dillon&mdash;making most nonsensical statements.  Then we have had his satellite, Deputy Hughes, who should know a little more about agriculture, adopting the wise sayings of Deputy Dillon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not my fault.  It is the fault of the people opposite who talked so much nonsense.  First of all, they say that this subsidy is going into the hands of Messrs. Goulding.  But the price lists had gone out long before this scheme was thought about, and these price lists have been followed up by a discount of 10/- per ton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that it is a competitive price?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Col N="582" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The price lists went out before Messrs. Goulding knew that any subsidy was being given, and they sent out what they considered a competitive price.  When the subsidy was arranged, a circular was sent to the merchants, saying that 10/- per ton would be taken off whatever manures they received since September last, and that that discount was to be given to the farmers.  So that the first thing Deputy Dillon said is not true.  It is not a subsidy to Messrs. Goulding, but to the ultimate purchaser&mdash;the farmer.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon's next point was: &ldquo;Why not give this on imported super?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Why not take the tariff off imported super?&rdquo; He said if the tariff were taken off imported super it could be sold here to the farmer at £2 10s. a ton.  That means that it can be sold here now at £3 a ton.  But, according to his own figures, with the subsidy on the home-manufactured material, it could be sold at £3 5s. or £3 7s. 6d. a ton if that is true.  If the home-manufactured phosphates with this subsidy is going to cost £3 5s. to £3 10s. a ton and if the imported super is coming in at £3 a ton why not take it?  It is obvious that Deputy Dillon will quote any figure.  But the worst of it is that his figures will not add up properly when you take them down and they do not support his arguments. But though he gives figures that will not support his arguments you have his followers coming along and making the same statement that Deputy Dillon made because, as they argue themselves, what Deputy Dillon said must be true. That is the way Deputies opposite look at it.  Then the Deputy said that we have borrowed the scheme from Great Britain.  I am sure the other Deputies opposite hold the same view on that as Deputy Dillon did.  But the fact is that we had the lime scheme here three years before Great Britain had it. Deputies may accuse Great Britain of borrowing from us.  Anyway we did not borrow it from them, but they had a scheme of basic slag&mdash;&mdash;</P>

But Deputies opposite speak about these schemes in such a way that if farmers were to listen to them no farmer would be inclined to avail of any scheme put forward by us no matter how beneficial it may be to them.  On this matter of manures, no farmer would buy artificial manure at all if he were to listen to Deputies opposite. They took up the same attitude on the Bacon Bill.  They should not think so much of their own political future; they should think more of the country.</P>

Deputy Hughes says that this subsidy offers no inducement to farmers to increase their purchases of artificial manures.  The Deputy may look on Deputy Dillon as an expert on agriculture.  He may think it good policy to repeat what Deputy Dillon says, but I think that Deputy Hughes should take a line of his own, and if Deputy Dillon wants to talk politics, well, that is no reason why he should follow him.</P>

      <P>I am glad to hear that. We have heard a great deal about this £40,000.  The attitude taken up by the people opposite is this: &ldquo;Make it look as small as you can.&rdquo; I had already pointed out that this £40,000 is for this financial year, about six weeks of which are still to run.  The attitude of the Deputies is: &ldquo;Do not say to the farmers that the Government are trying to do something for them with this £40,000.  Do not say that, but say that it is a penny an acre, and what is the good of that to any farmer, and why should he buy artificial manures if that is all he is to get?&rdquo; That is the sort of encouragement they are giving the farmers to avail of this scheme.  Then we had Deputy Belton on the wheat scheme.  In passing, I might say that the first time I met Deputy Belton was at a meeting held in the Rotunda called for the purpose of considering the question of wheat growing.</P>

How high should the land be above sea level to be suitable for wheat growing?  Deputy Hughes then went on to talk about poultry houses and said that the grant for them was miserable.  He said that for fear there might be some poor man in the County Carlow who would like to take a grant for poultry houses and thereby make a few more shillings out of his eggs.  But Deputy Hughes says it is all wrong.  Fearing that anybody might avail of the grant he described it as a miserable one.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Deputy ever hear of a grant being miserable when in fact there is no grant at all?  Deputy Hughes thought there was a grant, and although there is no grant he says it is a miserable one.  According to him everything is miserable&mdash;the things that are in the Estimate, and the things that are not.  As a matter of fact this is a loan and not a grant.  It is a pity, I think, that Deputies do not read the Estimates and prepare themselves before they get up to speak here. Deputy Hughes told us that our exports of eggs have fallen in seven years from £3,000,000 to £750,000.  But in the two years before we came in, when the Fine Gael Government was in office, the exports dropped in value from £4,000,000 to £3,000,000.  The Deputies sitting opposite to me now were not on those benches then.  They were on different sides of the House at that time.  Well, at least we can claim that we slowed up the decline.  The figures have gone up again.  They are higher for 1938 than for 1937, but of course it would not suit Deputy Hughes to mention that. He had to get the worst figures he could, so he took 1937.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not a prophet.  I would advise the Deputy, if he wants that sort of information, to buy and read &ldquo;Old Moore's Almanac.&rdquo; Deputy Hughes tells me that the grants are miserable and that the loans are no good.  What am I to do?  Deputy <Col N="589" /> Hughes has condemned this scheme because he says all the benefit is not going to the farmers.  He says the benefit is going to Messrs. Goulding, but having said that he asks: &ldquo;What about the poor merchants who bought artificials last year?&rdquo; So that now, according to Deputy Hughes, who was so concerned about the farmers a short time ago, we are to do something for the poor merchants.  The Party opposite attacked us because we happened to come to an agreement with Messrs. Goulding.  They told us about all the sympathy they had for the farmers, but now they ask what about the poor merchants who bought artificials last year, and they want to know if they are at a loss.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan put his arguments on a mathematical basis.  He said a man using four tons or eight tons before, will only use 4½ and 8½ now, and that if he used anything less than four tons before he will not use any more now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Deputy Brennan argued that even if we were giving £2 a ton this subsidy was going to be of no benefit in increasing the use of artificials.  Do Deputy Brennan and the Deputies opposite think that if manures are £4 and that if we give a subsidy of £2 a ton that farmers will spend nothing additional on the purchase of artificial manures beyond what the Government give by way of subsidy? We expect that when we give a subsidy out of State funds for a thing like this farmers will purchase more artificial manures, and spend more of their own money on them, in addition to what they get from the <Col N="590" /> State.  Deputy Brennan made a most remarkable statement.  He said that we should take advantage of the British market while the money is there because, he said, it may not be always there.  That was a remarkable statement, because I have always thought that it was an article of faith with the Fine Gael Party that the British Empire would last forever.</P>

      <P>The conditions that existed in 1931, the good conditions, as we are told, have been referred to by various Deputies.  If Deputies will go through the figures relating to the use of artificial manures, the imports and the outputs over the years, they will find that there was not a very big decline in the last seven years compared with the years before that. Several Deputies made attacks on Goulding's and they declared that we were putting money into Goulding's pocket.  Deputy Brooke Brasier, because there is a factory of Goulding's in his constituency, adopts a different attitude.  He wants everything possible done to foster the industry there.  I often noticed that before in the case of the Fine Gael Party.  A man will do anything there for votes.  Because there may be a few people working in a factory in his constituency, Deputy Brasier would not say anything against Goulding's. He said that the native phosphates were better than the foreign phosphates; the foreign, he said, were rougher and not of such good texture and so on.  He indicated that in every way Messrs. Goulding were turning out a better article, and the industry should be fostered.</P>

There are three ingredients in an ordinary mixture of manure, phosphates, potash and nitrates, in whatever form it may be.  We are giving an advantage to the compound manufacturer. I think the Deputy will agree in this.  Suppose we say we will have 10/- a ton to give on phosphates.

      <P>I do not think it is true, as alleged by Deputy Brodrick and Deputy Ryan, that this scheme gives an advantage to grass manures rather than to tillage manures.  I suppose that on certain types of grass lands and in certain places, farmers do use phosphates alone, but I think that where a farmer goes to the trouble of doing the thing scientifically, as Deputy Belton says, he will use the three ingredients, practically as much on grass as he would on tillage crops.  Therefore, there is no greater advantage to grass than to tillage.  Deputy Brodrick also made the point that the yield of beet was lower in his area because of insufficient manure.  I do not think that the Deputy could come to that conclusion on the results of last year's crop.  I told the Deputy that it was the same in England.  If there has been a big reduction in the yield in England in 1938, as compared with 1937, it shows that there is something universally wrong.</P>

      <P>The season was bad and that probably applied to both countries.  The weather in England was much the same as here&mdash;very dry in the early part of the year and very wet in the latter part.  Of course, the yield of the beet crop was down in the case of all the factory areas here, and it was also down in the case of the English factories, but I do not think the lower yield could be attributed to insufficient manuring.</P>

      <P>I will deal with these two questions together.  The only loan was that granted to the Roscrea Meat Company, Limited, for the erection and equipment of a factory at Roscrea for the manufacture of canned beef, meat and bone meal, fats, sausage casings, etc.  The loan amounted to £16,000 and was advanced in four instalments, viz., £5,000 on 1st April, 1935; £4,000 on 3rd May, 1935; £5,000 on 3rd September, 1935, and £2,000 on 14th October, 1936. The loan was to be repaid at the end of four years and three months. Interest was at the rate of 2 per cent. for the first year and 4 per cent. thereafter and was paid as it became due. The loan was repaid in full on 26th September, 1938.  There are, therefore, no arrears of either principal or interest.</P>
