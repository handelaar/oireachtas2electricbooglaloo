      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that decrees for possession have been obtained against certain widows in Éire to surrender possession of cottages under the Irish Sailors' and Soldiers' Land Trust, which were formerly occupied by their deceased husbands; and if he is prepared to devise a scheme on similar lines to those authorised for local authorities, under which the occupants of the cottages would be enabled to purchase their houses, and which would enable the Irish Sailors' and Soldiers' Land Trust to provide further houses for unhoused British ex-servicemen with their families.</P>

      <P>I have on previous occasions referred to my desire that an aerodrome of first class standard should be available at Cork for the purpose of civil aviation. The provision of such an aerodrome I regard as primarily the responsibility of the local authorities; the possibility of a condition of national emergency does not affect this view.</P>
      <P>From my Department's discussions with the local representatives it became clear, however, that there was no immediate prospect of the establishment of an aerodrome without substantial assistance from the State.  The Government have now approved of such assistance from State funds subject to the necessary financial support being forthcoming from the local authorities and I am about to issue an invitation to the local authorities to re-open discussions.  In these discussions the site at Midleton will be borne in mind, the cost of land acquisition and development being important factors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CorneliusMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last day that I was speaking I was just going to refer to the matter of giving help to the agricultural industry.  To my mind, help of a reproductive nature is of more benefit to agriculture than direct relief.  The subsidising of certain schemes, such as the dairying industry, the wheat and beet schemes, the provision of artificial manures and lime, and such schemes as these, are far more beneficial, to my mind, to the farming community and to the country as a whole, than anything in the way of direct relief of taxation on the farmers.  In that connection, while I realise the enormous amount of State assistance that has been rendered to the dairying industry, and while I realise that winter dairying would not be an economic proposition owing, of course, to the fact that, with the cold storage facilities in other countries, they have butter when it is summer with us and winter with them, and so on &mdash; I should like to ask the Minister to consider if something could be done to increase the price of milk delivered to the creameries in the months of March and April, because, as every dairy farmer knows, these are the slack months of the year.  I must say that the dairy farmers, with whom I come in contact, fully appreciate the help that the creameries and the dairying industry generally are getting, but a good many of them have pointed out that the months of March and April are the only months in which there is an exceptionally low price for milk.  I certainly appreciate &mdash; and so do the farmers &mdash; the advantage to the country of the subsidy given in connection with artificial manures and lime.  Both of these schemes give great encouragement for the purchase and application of manures and lime to the land.  The only thing I would say in that connection is that I should like to see a little bit more encouragement being given. because I think that the results would prove that that extra help would be well justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand how certain Deputies in this House who always profess to have the farmers' interests at heart can take exception to the beet and wheat schemes.  Of course, we may <Col N="1827" /> as well be candid.  I myself feel, as a farmer, that, as far as the beet scheme is concerned, although it has been of great assistance, those employed on one end of the industry are getting more advantage out of it than those employed on the agricultural end of the industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CorneliusMeaney" hpid="Mr. Meaney Mr. Meaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Nevertheless, the fact remains that a large number of our farmers are still engaged in that industry, and I think that that is an indication that the farmers of this country consider the beet scheme to be an economic proposition.</P>

I suggest that we ought to be a bit broad minded in connection with these matters and that we should not set our face against anything that would be likely to benefit agriculture.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the wheat and beet schemes have proved to be a great addition to the farmers' incomes all over the country.</P>
      <P>We have heard a lot about the bacon schemes.  It is quite possible that those engaged in the bacon-curing industry have larger profits than the farmers and, while I would not object to a decent profit to anybody on the money he has invested, I think that anything in the line of profiteering should be checked&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am stating what I know to be facts and they cannot be questioned.  I ask the Minister to take the agricultural labourer into consideration also and I would suggest a very specialised scheme of seeds and manures for labourers who derive their living from work on the farm and to be confined to those.  There is an Agricultural Commission sitting at present, and if the different sections who represent the agricultural community want to do a service to that great industry, they should submit their views on agriculture to that commission. I am not one of those who believe that when a commission is set up the object of setting it up is purely and simply the shelving of something. Deputies know practically the entire personnel of that commission and, from what we know of them, we expect that they will give the problems of agriculture full and due consideration, and if they are assisted by being supplied with intelligent evidence from the different sections interested in the industry, I have no doubt that good results will accrue from the setting up of that commission.  In conclusion, I wish to express my appreciation of the work of the Minister and his staff, and to say that on any occasion on which I had to approach them I found them always courteous and willing to assist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>My object in intervening is to contradict some statements repeatedly made from the Fianna Fáil Benches that the farmers are at least as well-off as they were before Fianna Fáil came into power.  Listening to the previous speaker, it seemed to me that he had no ideas except to congratulate the Government on what they have done for the farmers.  Is it not true that everybody in the country, the Hierarchy, the clergy and even Ministers <Col N="1829" /> themselves, when they are not speaking in a debate of this kind, have expressed grave anxiety for the position of the agricultural community?  Do we not see every day attention being called to the flight from the land.  What is it all due to?  It is all due to the agricultural policy put over by Fianna Fáil since they came into power.  They started off with new schemes, and, judging by the remarks of the previous speaker and of the Minister the other day, we are to have more new schemes. We can well ask what have the schemes already put into operation done for the farming community?</P>
      <P>Deputy Meaney spoke about the benefits conferred on the farming community by the growing of beet.  I do not want to run down any scheme and what I feel about wheat and beet is that, notwithstanding anything said here or anywhere else in connection with wheat, beet or any other scheme, the farmers will try them and the acid test is whether they continue to grow these crops or not.  Any Deputy from Tipperary knows that the acreage for the beet factory in Thurles has gone down by thousands of acres, but, of course, if one said a thing like that in days gone by, one would be told that it was unpatriotic, that there was a national issue at stake and that one dare not criticise any action of the Government during these years.  I have grown wheat and beet myself.  I have grown good crops of wheat, moderate crops and bad crops.  There is a very small farmer living in my locality. Some years ago, about 10 or 11 o'clock in the morning, he came to my place and said that the bailiffs had come to his house in connection with land annuities or rates&mdash;I cannot say which &mdash;and he asked me to buy some cattle from him.  I did not want them and he sold three to a neighbour for £7 and he had to have the money in at the local barracks before 12 o'clock.  He managed to stave it off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His economy was five or six cows and he sent his milk to the creamery, and sold the calves when they came to maturity.  He did not indulge in any of these schemes.  In early March of this year, he came to my yard and <Col N="1830" /> asked for the loan of a horse or two to put in some wheat.  I believe he had some in last year.  I naturally lent him the horses and he put it in, but it is not a fortnight since he came in asking for the loan of my horses again to harrow up that wheat and put oats in. That is the economy to which he has been driven.  I know a farmer in my district &mdash; he is not exactly in my constituency and I am glad to say that he is not &mdash; whose 14 cows were seized in the times I speak of and sold in Clonmel pound for £42.  That unfortunate man had to go around to the neighbours next morning to get milk for his children.  As I say, he is not in my constituency and I do not believe such a thing would occur there, because the sheriff's officers have been as impartial and helpful in regard to the collection of land annuities as it is possible for an official to be.  They will never again seize anything like that off that man's land.  It is these circumstances which militate against the farmer at present.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the dairying industry.  What subsidy has it got?  What has been the price of milk for a number of years?  This year and last year, I think, the price is 5d. The year before, it averaged 4d. Taking everything into consideration, it is not a paying proposition.  It is computed &mdash; and I believe it cannot be contradicted &mdash; that it takes the milk of seven or eight cows to pay a man's wages at the present time, and that is a fair estimate.  I am not saying &mdash; and I do not want to be taken as saying&mdash; that the agricultural labourers of this country are getting too much wages. The only thing about it is that the farmers are not in a position to pay them.</P>
    <P>It is very hard to find out what is the real position of the individual farmer or of the country, as a whole. We know from statistics that our exports have gone up for the last few years.  I have here in my hand an account of a farmer's economic position over a number of years.  Those who were in this House in 1928, 1929 or 1930, need only look up the debates in this House to find out how solicitous <Col N="1831" /> the Fianna Fáil Party were for the farmers at that time.  They won the admiration of every farmer in the country by their anxiety over the farmer's position.  I am going to quote some figures in order to compare those times with the position nowadays. For the purpose of my argument, I am going to take the years 1929 to 1938, and I think that is a very fair argument. This particular farmer kept very strict accounts over a number of years, and he is a fairly extensive farmer in my constituency, one who farms a couple of hundred acres of land.  In the year 1929 his gross income was £1,194, out of which he had to pay land annuities, rates, labour, and so on.  His labour bill in 1929 was £283 and his rates were £84.  His annuity was something like £100&mdash;I cannot find the exact figure at the moment.</P>
    <P>I do not want to worry the House by going into every year's activity on behalf of this individual farmer, but I will take the year 1933.  His gross income in that year was reduced to £198.  One would hardly think it is credible, and yet I have statistics here &mdash;and I can get further statistics&mdash;to prove that such was the case.  I have never made a statement in this House knowing it to be untrue, and my whole object in intervening here is to put the facts as I know them and the facts as I get them, having checked up this man's ledger very recently.  I would like to know what anybody in any other section of the community would do if he found that his gross income had been reduced from £1,100 to £200. How could they stand it?  You may well ask how these people are able to carry on.  There is no denying the fact at all that this particular man had other sources to draw upon.  Of course, he had other sources and reserves, and if he had not how could he carry on? I think it will be admitted by everybody &mdash; irrespective of whom they represent &mdash; that farming at all times, with the exception of a few years during the war, was always a lean job in this country.  The margin between a reasonable living and otherwise was very small, and in the case of a moderate-sized farm or of a small <Col N="1832" /> farm, the loss of a cow had a very serious effect at the end of the year. I candidly admit that this man had reserves.</P>
    <P>Now, the Government is constantly saying that they reduced the annuities by half.  I remember very well reading some debates that took place in this House when the Taoiseach &mdash; or Deputy de Valera, as he then was &mdash; was constantly saying that the overhead charges on the farmers would have to be reduced.  What did he reduce this man's overhead charges by?  He reduced them by £47 18s. 6d. &mdash; that is the amount of his halved annuity.  But he reduced his gross income from £1,100 in 1929 to £198 10s. in 1933.  Is not that a terrible state of affairs? The reason things are allowed to go on as they are, and the reason the present position of the farmers is such as it is, is that the farmers do not know exactly how they stand.  They have never kept accounts: if they did, they would know more about their business than they do at the present time.  The unfortunate thing about the farmer is that he is prepared to carry on until he can get no more credit from the Land Commission, from the rate collector, or from anybody else; and he does not realise the position until he is up against a stone wall.</P>
    <P>I will now take the figures for last year.  This man's gross income in 1938 was £674; his labour bill was £365; and the loss on the working of his farm last year is estimated by him to be £316 13s. 1d.  The income-tax authorities have allowed his loss to stand at £314 5s. 4d.  You cannot get behind these things, and I suppose it is only because he was liable for income-tax that he kept these accounts at all.  That is the position, and what is the use of saying that the farmers are as well off now as they were in the past?  I know this man very well and I put it to him that he did not grow any wheat or beet or indulge in these schemes.  His view, as a farmer, was that it is vandalism to plough up land and grow wheat or grow anything else indiscriminately without being able to put something back into the land.  The farmers of this country are as jealous of the fertility <Col N="1833" /> of the land as the Minister would be about a nice garden around his own house.  He would not like to see it knocked about, shrubs torn up or anything like that, and exactly the same thing applies to the farming community.</P>
    <P>I know very well that the Agricultural Commission is inquiring into the position of the pig industry.  I can only talk about these things as I see them in my own locality and as I come into contact with them myself.  It is very easy to interfere with the economics of a farm, just as it is easy to interfere with the economics of a country.  The maize-meal mixture was put over by the Government on the hardest working section of the community &mdash; the pig feeders and the poultry feeders &mdash; and what is the position to-day?  There are no pigs and there are no poultry, and it is going to be a hard job to get these people to produce again.  I live within a couple of miles of a local market and was accustomed some years ago to see pigs being walked down the road to that market or being sent down by ordinary conveyances. There was a good market then, but all that economy has gone: I do not see any of it now.</P>
    <P>I do not know what other Deputies may find the situation to be in their own areas.  Certainly you could go into a town now on a regular market day and see scarcely a dozen pigs. That has been due largely to the increased cost of foodstuffs in this country.  We can pass legislation here and pass all the laws we like, but, in the last analysis, when it comes down to the farmer, if he has not got something out of it you cannot get him to produce the commodities or the articles &mdash; and the same thing is happening in the case of beet at the present time. I do not want to say anything or be critical of these schemes, but I do say that, so far as I can judge the situation, it will be a big task to get the same economy in the future for mixed farming that we used to know in the past.  I put the question to this farmer, who had made a profit of £200 on pigs in 1929, how was it that his economy did not show anything in that respect now.  His answer to me was that he <Col N="1834" /> had to sell his pigs in 1932 or 1933 at such a price that he got out of them and stopped out of them and that the houses in which he had housed them had tumbled down and were in ruins at the present time.  Those are the things that have been happening.</P>
    <P>I know the Agricultural Commission is sitting now, and I do not want to criticise commissions in any way or anybody who wants to try to help the agricultural industry.  It is a serious problem and, as I said a moment ago, everybody in this country at the present time, the hierarchy, priests, ministers and so on, are talking about the position of agriculture.  Yet nothing is done.  Quite recently here in this House we had the Minister for Finance talking about all the money that the farmers had in the banks.  He said that they had £12,000,000 in the banks.  I think Deputy Corry said that he had never met any of these gentlemen.  Mind you, I did, and as late as yesterday I met a farmer who runs three Austin motor cars.  But these are very exceptional gentlemen and they never made their money on the land.  They got it some other way. I would like to see more of them, every one of them with two or three Austins.  But I do not know a farmer anywhere who, during the last four years, has been able to keep going.  To give you an instance of the situation: there is a small farmer in my district &mdash; one of the men who never grew wheat. I met him a couple of months ago.  I said to him: &ldquo;I hear you sold some calves at Carrig fair and got a nice price for them.&rdquo;  He said: &ldquo;I did; I got £8 a head for them.&rdquo;  I said: &ldquo;Well, that is not too bad.  It is a big improvement on some years ago.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;I sold calves as good as they were at 30/- apiece.&rdquo;  That man, or any other farmer, was able to keep going when he was getting 30/- a head. It is an enormous difference.  In one case he would get £12 for eight calves, and in the other case he would get £64 for them.  Is it not a fact that it is because of the things that happened in those days, the fact that the farmer had to go into debt to the shopkeeper, the Land Commission, the rate collector, that the farmer is being kept in <Col N="1835" /> the position he is in at the present time, even though cattle are not such a bad price?</P>
    <P>That is the situation.  The difficulty is how to get over it.  It is not my problem here to solve any difficulty for the Government or anybody else.  I know it is a difficult problem to solve now, having gone so far, but it will have to be dealt with and it will have to be dealt with in no half-hearted manner if this country is to keep going. If the country is going to be left in its present position, with labourers and farmers' sons running out of it, picture the situation, even in ten years hence. I realise that it is a difficult problem. I would like to see a bold effort made to solve it.  Judging by the statements that have been made from time to time by the front bench of the Government, I see very little hope for a solution of the problem at the present time.</P>
    <P>I have quoted these figures, and I will stand over them, to refute the argument that the farmers are as well off as they were before Fianna Fáil came into office.  I am prepared to stand over every one of those figures and to submit the ledger to any accountant that anybody may appoint.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I did not make these statements just for the sake of something to say.  I made them because they were given to me and I asked for them.  Everybody realises how difficult it is to get a proper statement of account of a farmer's economy over a number of years.  I have procured such an account.  This man had an income in 1929 of £1,100.  In 1933 it was down to a couple of hundred pounds and it was about £600 last year, and yet, there was a loss last year, certified by the Government's own department, of £314.  How long is that going to continue? I quoted the wages paid. Nobody can say that a farmer who has a couple of hundred acres and pays £1 a day wages&mdash;£365 a year&mdash;is a rancher or anything like that.  If we had more farms in the country like that, with that production and paying that wage, we would have a better country.  That is a situation to which I want to call the attention of the <Col N="1836" /> Minister and this House.  I think it is a serious position.  I hope that somebody&mdash;whether the present commission that is sitting, or the Government&mdash; will, even now, take steps to remedy a situation which calls for the most serious attention on behalf of every section of the community in this country.</P>

      <P>I am anxious to avail myself of this, which is, as far as I understand, the earliest opportunity provided by the Government for Deputies to discuss a most important report, which appeared towards the end of last year &mdash; the report of the investigation into the prices charged for bacon &mdash; a report which was suppressed for a considerable number of months.  It appeared at the end of October but was not published in the Press until about the beginning of March.  However belatedly it has made its appearance it is more remarkable still that no attempt has been made by members of the Government to state their point of view with regard to the report.  The Minister told us some months ago that he intended to bring in fresh legislation and in his opening speech on this Estimate, I think that he more or less made the same suggestion. The Minister thinks that his duty begins and ends by saying that he will have to introduce fresh legislation, and that the situation, bad as it is in the revelations of the Prices Commission Report, is to be patched up by some new type of legislation.  Apparently, control is to go on to some extent, and apparently the Minister is still under the control of the curers in connection with this industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have heard Deputy Dowdall, on occasions when he spoke in this House, express himself frankly as a capitalist. His attitude has been &ldquo;I am out to make profits, as great profits as I can and excessive profits if I am allowed to.&rdquo;  The only counter he puts to that is that it is the Government's duty to catch him out if he makes excessive profits.  Deputy Dowdall, as a capitalist, considers that profit-making is the beginning and the end of business in the country, and he is going to make as much profits as he can if Government regulation, in the absence of <Col N="1838" /> competition, does not stop him.  That was not a casual remark of his.  He has repeated it about three times.  He indicated the few chances there were for profit-making in this country.  On one occasion he said of the business-men in this country who were waxing fat on the profits they were getting because of the tariff policy of the Government, that it was a damn scandal those men were not greater supporters of the Government than they were.  Deputy Dowdall has said of business-men that the key to their existence is profit-taking.  Although they may now and again pay lip service to the Pope's Encyclicals and talk valiantly about their interest in service and service of a national type, in the background, according to the Deputy, you have the point that you cannot keep business-men going unless you give them profits.  Deputy Dowdall's view is that the business-man is entitled to unbridled profit-taking unless some sort of Government regulation catches him out.  Deputy Dowdall, in any event, is honest as a capitalist.  This report is the greatest revelation we could seek with regard to what comes from a bastard type of capitalism which sets out to plunder the country.</P>
    <P>Suppose you had a capitalist of the type that Deputy Dowdall represents himself to be, a capitalist of the socialist text-book type, red in tooth and claw.  He would want to get all he could, not sparing the consumer and only stopping when he finds that excessive profit-taking will ruin the market. Suppose you have that man in a situation in which he can wax fat on profits, what better situation for that man could there be than that described in the Prices Commission Report brought about by Government intervention?</P>
    <P>On page 26 of the report, the commission, considering the factors affecting bacon prices on the home market, dealt with three points.  They say that there was a complete absence of external competition due to the virtual prohibition of imports; secondly, that there was rigidity in the control of production resulting in the elimination of the element of <Col N="1839" /> internal competition; thirdly, that apparently the pig supplies were not adequate, that there was no overwhelming number of pigs on offer, so that there was no clamour from those producing; and, fourthly, that consumers were entirely at the mercy of the bacon curers, and that there was no regulation of prices.  Now, let us get those conditions together.  In the first place, there was no external competition. You had the virtual elimination of internal competition; the consumer was at the mercy of the people who were said to control this industry.  The bacon curers themselves were the people who were in control, so that you got what Deputy Dowdall said is to be expected, excessive profit-taking.</P>
    <P>With regard to the composition of the board itself, you had a certain number of people on it.  You had the ordinary members and one man who was there as the appointee of the Minister. I imagine that the idea of constituting the board in that way was that even if there was a roguish idea to have excessive profit-taking the Minister could possibly rely on his nominee, when the thieves fell out, to fix prices.  Unless the ordinary members were unanimous in their view, the Minister's appointee was to be there to guard against any excess.  If any one of the six ordinary members disagreed with the rest, then the decision of the board became the decision of the Minister's nominee.  He was given control in the circumstances in which the other members of the board decided against him.</P>
    <P>I have said that the consumers were at the mercy of this board.  You set up a board and you let them, after a bit, realise their power.  If the six ordinary members agreed, they could not merely do to the detriment of the board what it was given to them to do, but they could divert the Act from its proper purpose.  That is the finding of the commission.  Suppose you have a board set up in that way, and that on to that board you put a man whose course of business has been on the decline, so much so that it forces him to raise debentures on his business.  You give <Col N="1840" /> that man influence and control on that board so that he can make up certain losses that he has accumulated against himself in the previous years.  I again point to the weakness of the consumer. The consumer is at the mercy of this particular group.  Of course, the board had a purpose.  Attached to that purpose was particular machinery for a duality of prices.  It is pointed out in the report that the board could appoint two different sets of prices. The purpose of that was clear: that it had been represented that there had been amazing fluctuations in the prices paid for pigs.  The scheme of the duality of prices was to enable the board to level out the discrepancy in prices between one time and another. It is pointed out in the report that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the early stages it might be necessary for the board to raise money by means of a loan and, accordingly, the board should have power to borrow.  In times of acute depression in the industry as a whole when, it might be very difficult for the board to fix a reasonable price, we contemplate that the bacon curer might have to forego his profit, that is, the board would fix pig prices in such relationship to bacon prices that provision would be made only for costs of manufacture.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is part of a quotation which the Prices Commission gives from the report in 1933 of the Pig Industries Tribunal.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the report that the purpose of this aim of duality of prices was to enable price levels to be scaled down if they were going too high and to raise them if it were found that the bacon curers had to work without a profit.  That must have been a shocking thought to put before the particular group on this board.  It has to be remembered that if the bacon curers on the board had accepted the purpose of this scheme of duality of prices honestly and had carried out their duties honourably, they still could have made a profit, because it was as much to their advantage as it was to producers of pigs that the price of pigs should be kept at a certain level.  As long as it was a level which <Col N="1841" /> remunerated the pig producer and the pig curer, there was good business to be done.  The only thing was that the business was to be better spread.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the scheme was clearly stated and so the board was started under the Pigs and Bacon Act. What has been the result?  The result, as we know from looking around the countryside, is that the consumer has been fleeced, but the extent to which the public had been fleeced was not fully realised until this report was published. What do these people do?  For a bit, they accumulated a fund apparently with the main objective in view but, at a certain point, it struck them that there was a fund there to be looted and that it was theirs for the taking.  They decided they would loot it.  There is an amazing paragraph in the report which indicates that in a very delicate way and in most courteous language but the verdict is still there.  The Prices Commission reported and what did they find?  They say that they found on one occasion that payments were authorised to curers of 43/- per cwt., on the quantity of bacon exported.  There are two points to be dealt with; first, that the machinery of the Act has been diverted from its proper purpose, which was to equalise the price of pigs, and that it has now become an agency for subsidising exports to England.  The Minister has denied that he had hand, act or part in that but the bacon curers still insist that he had and between the two the truth will somewhere emerge.  It might easily be suspected that he would accept this method of subsidising exports to England because he tried previously to subsidise the export of butter to England, by making the people here pay more for their butter in order to ensure cheap butter for England.  The consumer of bacon here had to pay very heavily indeed in order that the Englishmen might get bacon more cheaply.  As I say, the machinery of the Act has been diverted from its original purpose with the results that we all know.  What did the Prices Commission say about the 43/-?  On page 19, the report says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The first payment of 43/- per cwt., <Col N="1842" /> judging by the magnitude of the amount and the circumstances surrounding the payment, is related in no way to the period in respect of which it was technically made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later, after suggesting that it is possible other standards may have been adopted by the curers and the board for the division of the money, they came to this conclusion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Unless the amount of the available funds be taken as a measure, there appears to have been no exact basis on which the amount of this payment was determined.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>What does that mean?  Strip that of the courteous language of the Prices Commission and it means that, at a certain point, the bacon curers realised that there was a certain sum of money in hands to be looted and they sat down to divide it and asked themselves this question: &ldquo;How much is there in the till, and we will take it all.&rdquo;  The only measure by which the standard of 43/- was struck was: how much was there to divide?  They took it all. The Prices Commission follows that up.  They ask how did that all come about and they say in one very vivid phrase that the machinery of duality in prices had been diverted to this purpose.  They go on later, on page 29, to say, when they are talking of the unreasonably high prices charged home consumers:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This has been due to the fact that the powers conferred on the Bacon Marketing Board have been utilised, by the curers who compose the board, for promoting the interests of the curers with insufficient consideration for the interests of the consumers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They found that the prices were grossly excessive and they say that some curers even considered them excessive.  A distinction should be made there as not all the curers and not all engaged in the industry are damaged by the report.  It is only the self-seeking profiteers on the board who are involved because there is evidence, and it was produced to the commission, that some curers considered the prices charged home consumers excessive and objected to people <Col N="1843" /> pocketing what was robbed from the people by excessive prices.  What has been the result?  Look at it in two ways.  The home consumption of bacon has dropped.  On page 13 certain figures are given as to the consumption in cwts.  If you make a comparison between the years 1931 and 1937, there is a drop of 250,000 cwts. of bacon.  The people of this country were prohibited from eating an amount of bacon which comes to that figure, 250,000 cwts., and they are forced to do that because of the amazing powers given to this board and the desperately dishonourable use which these people made of the powers given them.  Naturally, they destroyed their market to that extent, but they overcharged to such a point that they were still able to make excessive profits.  The Prices Commission came to the conclusion that for three years the curers got away with what they describe as excess profits of about £310,000.  That was £310,000 on a foodstuff, with the result that the people of this country were deprived to the extent of 250,000 cwts. of bacon &mdash;a foodstuff they liked.</P>
    <P>When this report came out, the curers said that the Prices Commission had failed to call attention to a couple of points.  One was the insistence by the Department on too high prices and, secondly, the encouragement given the Pigs Marketing Board by the Department to fix the minimum prices at an excessive point.  The Minister replied that they were telling a falsehood, but the members of the board said that was the fact.  The Minister said the board lied, but he let members of the board who were given the lie direct by him continue on the board.  One would have thought that decent men when a report of this sort became public and was criticised by implication in the way in which it was criticised here would have thought fit to send in their resignations.  I suppose you can pocket many an insult if you put it into a pocket already lined with £307,000 of the citizens' money.  In any event they stay, and the Minister allows them to stay on the board.  If an unemployed man in this town gets <Col N="1844" /> a job for a few hours and draws unemployment assistance to the extent of 7/6, while getting a few shillings in this way he is promptly paraded before the court.  He is prosecuted and fined, but the curers of this country who pocketed £307,000 of the people's money are allowed to stay on the board and, as far as the Minister is concerned, they can continue there until the crack of doom.</P>
    <P>There is one other body concerned, the millers.  Milling has not been gone into in the same detail, and the commission do not give any capital sum as the amount that the millers got away with.  But what do we find? There is a commission sitting dealing with vocational organisation and I think there is a miller on it and a curer on it.  They will certainly teach the Government something about vocational organisation and certainly their report ought not to be in the framework of the Papal Encyclicals.  It is all very well for businessmen to pretend to accept Papal Encyclicals in their affairs.  That is theory.  An ounce of the Prices Commission report is worth all the nonsense talked and all the lip service given to the Papal Encyclicals by these people.  I cannot conceive it possible that this could happen in any other country.  Certain men have been prosecuted for gangster methods in America.  Does anyone consider that President Roosevelt would, if he set up a commission, place Dutch Schultz and Al Capone on it to advise on vocational organisation? This country decided that it could put millers and curers on boards and could allow&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If he has no redress, the Minister will give it to him.  I presume we will get an opportunity of discussing the miller in another place, but the miller is as much in the profiteering scheme as the bacon curer.  There is a definite statement in the calculations made in the one case, based on the returns and the profits; it was a mere phrase used in connection with the miller.  There is the situation.  These people are still helped and honoured by the Minister. The Minister has responsibility for the chairman who allowed this thing to develop.  It is presumed that the chairman can acquit himself of moral delinquency by saying that he was blind enough not to see what was going on under his eyes, or he may say, &ldquo;I was wide awake enough,&rdquo; and he may tell us, &ldquo;I do not believe morals or ethics have anything to do with what the bacon curers were doing.&rdquo;  As the nominee of the Minister, it was his duty to call attention to this sort of performance, particularly when it was so blatant as it appears to have been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This particular piece of roguery was conducted by a group of people who have hitherto borne a high repute in this country in connection with industry. These are not any new, get-richquick <Col N="1846" /> parvenus in the country's industries. These people have been running industries lucratively for themselves over a number of years, and they got their chance; they had temptation given to them.  There were no safeguards for the public against them and they simply availed of the opportunity. Of course it is a shocking thing to find, and most people in their enquiries hereafter into industry and its development will very often have before them the picture that is revealed here by this report.  These are prominent industrialists in the country's life, men who should have had, and we believe they had, a good industrial record.  We believe they were sufficiently well in in the industry to weigh this in the balance, that it was better to continue in the industry in an honest, decent way, taking profits when they came, instead of doing this rack-renting performance that they were unfortunately permitted to do.</P>
    <P>It appears, even against the viewpoint that Deputy Dowdall alleges to be that prevailing amongst business men and capitalists and even men with a good industrial tradition, that there is no safeguard.  You do not even get boards properly composed.  The personnel is built up out of a particular sense of duty.  As Deputy Dowdall revealed the situation, if the chance is given of making profits and making them fast, there is no question of service to the country, no question of mercy for the consumer; it is only how much at any time can be made, how much can people get away with and there is no thought of whether there is in the end to be an exposure or not. The Minister has a duty in this regard. To-morrow we will be hearing that this country is sadly lacking in new sources of taxation.  No doubt we will be hearing pitiable appeals of how low the country has sunk and of the difficulty of tapping new sources.  In all that picture we have this definite fact standing out, one group of people exposed. There were countless opportunities for industrialists to have made profits in the past.  We have this sum of £307,000 and I have not heard of any attempt by the Minister to get one penny of that back.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1847" /> The board have been criticised. They did not know whether the percentage on which they took their normal profits was a fair rate or not. In any event, the board have given us a vivid picture.  They show the prices paid to producers for pigs and the prices exacted from consumers for bacon.  They give us two graphs. When the same distance is kept between the two points the same margin of profit will have occurred and they show in the end in a vivid way this black cloud, which represents the increase and what they call the excess profits kept by the pig curers.  This is a cloud like most other clouds; it has a silver lining.  The consumers get the cloud effect; only a limited number of curers got the £307,000.  There is what good expert industrialists, imbued with the profit notion, can do when they get the chance a Minister can give them.</P>
    <P>There is another side to this.  There was a cruder attempt made to make profits out of the bacon business.  I am only speaking of the curers who formed the board or swayed the decisions of the board.  There was another attempt recently discovered and brought out in court.  There is a curing association in County Monaghan.  It is not any collection of whole-time industrialists.  They are rather parvenus, newcomers to industry. They had even a cruder form of looting the public than this.  They are brought into court, and what is discovered? It is disclosed that they keep two sets of books.  One set is false.  In one set they enter false weights, supposed to be the weights of the pigs brought into them, on which the payments are made to the farmers. They have a different set, which show the real weight of the commodity handled by them, the weight on which they look for their returns.  That has been permitted.  That association has been fined for the falsification of books, and they have defrauded farmers by that blatant method of the wrong entry of the weight of pigs. Have they been struck off the register?</P>

      <P>There was one set of falsifications proved.  We should not be prevented criticising people who have been found to have defrauded others, simply because there are further frauds alleged against them.  I will accept the standard that we should not discuss a fraud until it is clearly proved.  I understand the situation to be that a particular set of falsifications has been regarded as proved by the district justice up to the point that he has fined, and there are other charges of falsification pending.  I am dealing with the charge that was decided.  The principle is there.  I think it was admitted&mdash;I do not think the matter was contested&mdash;that the books were falsified.  One crowd were a little bit more experienced in industry and profit-taking than the other.  One is crude in its methods, the other is subtle.  Both have been allowed to do what they have done by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When you run an industry by a series of boards and when you do away with the only effective guarantee for value that the consumer has&mdash;that of competition&mdash;it is almost impossible to check prices by any system of boards or academic bodies or discussions.  The only way in which that could be made effective would be when the commission reports, and when the report of the commission is of such a decisive character as would put it up to the Minister to do what one would imagine <Col N="1849" /> the Minister would do at once&mdash;to take action.  Now, in this case, does the Minister intend to prosecute the men who sat on that board?  Does he intend that these men should be brought before a court; does he intend that any penalty of any type, social or otherwise, will be put upon these people for the crime that the report reveals them to have committed?  Or is the Minister to say: &ldquo;We will adopt new machinery and we will draw up regulations once more&rdquo;?  That is not a scheme which will please the public.  I would have expected that the Minister would have taken action the very moment the commission reported.  I could have understood the Minister having held up that report for four months to enable him to decide as to the most ruthless course of action he could decide against these people.  I would be satisfied if, with the report, there emerged the statement that these curers had been dismissed the board, and that the whole scheme was under consideration and that this House would quite understand that the men on that board were definitely for the future ostracised.  The Minister did not do that.  I thought, however, when the members of the board got into the public Press and accused the Minister of complicity in the matter that he would be stung into activity. The directors said that they got encouragement from the Department to charge these prices and that the Minister knew what was happening.  I had thought&mdash;but the thought was one on which I could not repose much confidence&mdash;that when the Minister had given them the lie direct these men would show some sense of honour and have said: &ldquo;We will have nothing more to do with his board or his scheme of running an industry.&rdquo;  Instead of that, however, the Minister is pleased enough to let this scheme continue and they are pleased enough to pocket the Minister's insults and carry on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMcGovern" hpid="Mr. McGovern Mr. McGovern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGovern</NameTxt>
      <P>My excuse for intervening in this debate is that I have no hope that any good is to come out of the Commission on Agriculture at the present time.  I think I am not alone in that opinion.  The manner in which the report of the Prices Commission, <Col N="1850" /> which had been mentioned by Deputy McGilligan, has been treated makes one feel that no good is to come out of it.  I am aware of numbers of other commissions that have been appointed on which individuals have been paid large salaries and much public money paid in connection with the printing of the reports.  Yet nothing has been done.  In some cases the majority report has been turned down.  I know of one commission where 13 members reported in favour of a certain policy and one against it.  The view of the 13 was turned down and the report of the minority of one was acted upon by the Government.  It is for reasons like that that commissions are looked upon with suspicion.  Deputies on this side of the House have no conndence in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A commission can make good recommendations but unless the Government is honestly desirous of giving effect to them no good can come out of the reports of the commissions.  So far as I can see, when a favourable report from the point of view of the Government is furnished by the commission something may be done, but if otherwise the Government ignores the reports of these commissions.  There is another thing and that is that neither the Minister nor the Government give any evidence whatever that they are prepared to consider sympathetically the position of agriculture.  The Government has not shown that it is prepared to give a fair deal to people on the land.  On the contrary the Government has given evidence of an unsympathetic attitude towards agriculture. In shelving from day to day a discussion of a motion on the Order Paper that has been there for a long time referring to the flight from the land&mdash;refusing to deal with this very important matter as a matter of urgent public importance, which is so urgent and important that the Bishops have referred to it in their Lenten Pastorals&mdash;the Government have shown what they think of agriculture.  The Government would not give a day or an hour to discuss this matter.  If the Government had a good case would they not welcome the opportunity of having it discussed in the House?  If <Col N="1851" /> the Government have no case to put up should they not welcome the opportunity of discussing it and showing the country that they were prepared to do their part to deal with the matter? Instead of that they run away from it and they resort to every subterfuge to prevent such an important matter from being discussed&mdash;one of the most important national questions that could be considered in this House.</P>
    <P>At all events with regard to the seting up of the commission it is acknowledged that Fianna Fáil have lost confidence in their fads.  They no longer rely upon their fads so far as agriculture is concerned.  The result of their policy has been the impoverishment of the farmers and the farm labourers; the deterioration of the land, the deterioration of the stock upon the land, and the general deterioration of our cattle notwithstanding all we read in the newspapers and elsewhere about the superior cattle at the show.  Let the Minister or any Deputy go round the country, walk through the fairs and see the ordinary type of cattle from which the people have to make their living and they will see the truth of that for themselves.  It is at the fairs the commercial cattle are to be found.  It is not at the show at Ballsbridge. That is where a practical man would go to look for them.  If one meets a practical man at the fair, a man who has been attending fairs year after year, one will find that that man will simply laugh at one if he mentions &ldquo;improvement&rdquo; in cattle.  The fact of the matter is that cattle have depreciated. This is especially true of the shorthorn stock.</P>
    <P>It is impossible now to get decent shorthorn heifers.  Yet shorthorn heifers are the foundation of our stock. We can have no good cattle without having shorthorns.  The position with regard to shorthorn stock is that the Department by its restrictive regulations, refusing to sanction the licensing of enough shorthorn bulls, has done an immense injury to agriculture.  The inspectors of the Department admit that they have no effective remedy for dealing with sterility and contagious <Col N="1852" /> abortion in cattle.  Yet the policy of the Department is to refuse to licence a sufficient number of bulls to deal with the situation.  The Department are unable to deal with the disease and to stamp it out and one would imagine that they would adopt the next best thing&mdash;to licence enough shorthorn bulls.  In Northern Ireland all the reasonable type of shorthorn bulls that are presented at the local shows are passed.  That is a good idea and one that I would recommend to the Department. Let the farmers themselves decide which is the most suitable.  The deterioration of the cattle is ample evidence that when the farmers were left to themselves they were able to select a better animal than is selected now when the matter is strictly controlled. This is part of the policy of controlling and restricting the enterprises and the rights and freedom of people in their individual business.  It is characteristic of the Government in their every activity.  It is similar to the attitude of the Minister in all sections of the Department over which he has control.</P>
    <P>I will give an instance of the inconvenience caused by that control.  Last year, in County Cavan, an organisation of farmers who knew what they were doing were anxious to change their seed oats.  They had a good deal of correspondence with the Minister. That correspondence extended over months and months.  They desired to import a certain amount of Scotch seed oats.  They had imported it time and again, year after year, before those restrictions and regulations came into force, and found it was a great benefit. They found, when they were deprived of the right to import this seed oats, that the quality of their oats was very inferior.  Therefore, they desired to import a certain amount of seed in quantity, to distribute it amongst themselves individually in a manner which would cause the least amount of inconvenience to the individual farmer, as well as to the Department and to the people from whom they were importing it.  They could buy it in bulk and get a cheaper rate.  By distributing it amongst themselves, they would save the Department all the <Col N="1853" /> unnecessary trouble of dealing with the cases individually.  The Minister refused them that right.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Let them apply individually. Let everybody who wants to import oats send his application to the Department, and it will be dealt with.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course the majority of them did not bother, because they did not think it worth while getting into the correspondence which would be necessary to deal with the matter.  They did not apply&mdash;with the exception of perhaps a few&mdash;and they sowed the inferior class of oats.  This year I myself wanted two or three cwt. of oats for seed, and I applied to the Department for a licence.  I could have got the oats from Enniskillen without any trouble, as I often did before.  I thought I had nothing to do but formally to apply, because the Minister had said: &ldquo;Apply individually and you will get the licences.&rdquo;  I have the reply to my application here, and the House can judge for itself.  This reply is dated 19th April&mdash;at a time when the seed should be in the ground.  It is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With reference to your application of 15th instant for a licence to import seed oats, kindly furnish a guarantee from the suppliers that the oats will be of best quality, has been purchased by name and will be invoiced to you under such name.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>As I said, that reply is dated 19th April, and was received by me about 21st April.  I would then have had to communicate with the merchants in Enniskillen or wherever else I was to get the oats.  That would mean another week's delay if I had been foolish enough to do it, and if the business people would be foolish enough to bother about me.  I suppose by the 1st May I would have had a reply.  I should then communicate with the Department again, and I suppose by now I would have been getting a reply.  After that I could get the seed oats.  That is the kind of tomfoolery that is going on in the Department.  The oats has now been <Col N="1854" /> sown, whatever the seed was like.  I leave the Minister to guess; I might have sown dock seed, but whatever it was, it has now been sown.  Some 6,000 or 7,000 farmers in Cavan were in an organisation.  They wanted to get their oats in quantity, in one or two lots, and divide it amongst themselves in the simplest and easiest way they could devise.  It was a business method.  They could buy the oats more cheaply, and yet the Minister would not allow it.  He wanted each individual farmer in County Cavan to apply as I did, and enter into a correspondence which would go on for three months perhaps.  The seed would not yet have been put into the ground if that correspondence had been started.  Is it any wonder that this country is in its present position?  Is it any wonder that an inquest upon the remains of agriculture is going on at the present time&mdash;because that is what I call the commission which has been set up to inquire into agriculture? If everyone of the 16,000 or 17,000 in each county has to apply individually to the Department, and then start a correspondence as between the exporter, the importer and the Department&mdash;a correspondence which would go on for three months&mdash; is it any wonder that every Department in this State has had to increase its staff until the country has broken down under the burden of paying those additional staffs?</P>
    <P>Is it not time that something should be done about it?  While this attitude is taken up by the Minister there is no hope for this country, no matter how many commissions are sitting.  It is only adding still further to the burden. There is the added cost of printing and circulating the reports, and all the rest of it, and nothing will come of it. Nothing could come out of it until the Government show a desire to deal with the matter sympathetically.  They have not, so far, shown that desire and I am afraid that they will not, until something takes place which will force their hand.  The farmers are driven to despair at the present time, and the strike in Dublin a few weeks ago gave us an indication as to how they are feeling.  Of course it is difficult for the <Col N="1855" /> farmers to strike.  It is difficult for them even to organise.  They have varied interests and, because of those varied interests and because they are scattered at such long distances apart and cannot conveniently meet, it is almost impossible for them to carry out a successful strike.  Because of those disabilities, the Government is mean enough to take advantage of their position and to crush them out of existence.  Now the country is beginning to feel that it is not the farmers alone who will suffer; that it is going to come home to everybody if agriculture is crushed.  If agriculture is crushed, how can those petty industries, those parasites which are battening on the agricultural industry, thrive and survive?  If agriculture is killed, those parasitical industries will die a natural death.</P>
    <P>I heard a speaker on this side of the House refer to the economic war as responsible for all the trouble.  I do not agree with that.  That would be a very dangerous opinion to get abroad. Certainly the economic war has done a great deal of damage, but that is not all.  Even to-day, the economic war being over, if the farmers were to get the credit which they need very badly, there is still something more necessary. The position is that the farmers are selling their agricultural products at something like 9 per cent. or 10 per cent. more than in pre-war days.  It is costing them from 70 per cent. to 100 per cent. more to produce them, so that their net income is reduced to less than half what it was then.  Those are facts which can be proved by the statistics which are issued from the Minister's Department.  That means that the farmer has to live on half his former income, although the cost of living has been increased by 70 per cent., as is admitted and proved by the statistics in the Minister's Department. How can that be done?  That position is not merely the result of the economic war; that is the position even now that the economic war is over.</P>
    <P>A good deal must be done for agriculture before it can be said to be on an economic basis.  It is no use in <Col N="1856" /> saying that, if the farmers are restored to the position which they occupied in 1931, they will be all right. That will not do.  The cost of living and the cost of production have been enormously increased.  These two factors, taken together, coming on top of the effect of the economic war, have brought the farmers to the position in which they find themselves to-day. The cost of machinery, manures and everything that the farmer requires, has increased in some cases by 200 per cent.  The average increase would be 100 per cent. at least.  Although the agricultural labourer is not getting the same deal that other labourers are getting, yet the cost of labour is beyond the farmer's capacity to pay. That state of affairs, of course, cannot go on.  It may go on for a time, but the break is coming.  Many farmers have reached a point beyond which they are unable to carry on their industry any longer.  They are unable to get credit from the Agricultural Credit Corporation or from the banks. There is no use in waiting until they all reach that unfortunate position, because when that stage is reached it will be impossible to retrieve the position.  Time should be taken by the forelock and, while there is yet time, something should be done to relieve the position of agriculture.  One thing that the Government, if they had any honour, would have done long ago and that was to carry out their promise to lessen the burden of overhead charges by relieving the farmers of rates on agricultural land.  Agricultural land could have been derated long ago. That is one way in which the Government could help the farmer without waiting for the Report of the Agricultural Commission.</P>
    <P>I blame the Minister for Agriculture, not so much for the fact that he failed to make a success of agriculture, as for that he acquiesced in a scheme of which I believe the Minister for Industry and Commerce is the father, namely, to give the people on the land, whether farmers or labourers, the lowest standard of living in this State. They have a lower standard of living than similar classes in any other walk of life.  That is a fact, and I believe <Col N="1857" /> the Minister for Industry and Commerce is the man responsible for it. If I were not a farmer I could congratulate him on the success of his scheme and the way in which he has played off the Minister for Agriculture. The Minister for Agriculture is not fit for his job or he would never have acquiesced in a scheme such as that. It was his business to see that the position of the people who work in the industry over which he has the honour to preside was relatively as good as the position of other people. The position of the farming community should have improved in proportion to the improvement in the position of other classes of the community.  If the position of other classes had disimproved, then, of course, the farmers would not have the same cause of complaint.  The Minister for Agriculture has failed in that most important duty and, therefore, he is unfit to be Minister for Agriculture.  He should be ashamed of himself, because he simply allowed the setting up of two or three different standards of living, the lowest of which is, as I have said, allotted to the farmer and his workman.</P>
    <P>Of course, as other speakers have stated, the position of the people on the land was never very prosperous. They never could make much money or never could live very well.  They never had money to spend, such as other people had, but they could at least make a living out of the land. By husbanding their resources, by working longer hours than people in other walks of life and by living economically, they could carry on.  That was always the position, even in pre-war times.  The war years, of course, were an abnormal period, but in normal times the position of the people on the land was very difficult and they had to be very careful in order to make ends meet.  At the present time their position has become impossible, and the Government has shown no indication that they are prepared to do anything to improve that position.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said about the destruction of calves, but I would <Col N="1858" /> rather stress the necessity for looking after our cows.  The destruction of the calves is, of course, a thing of the past and we cannot recall the past, but we can improve the position of our live stock by paying more attention to the licensing of bulls and by trying, by research, to find some remedy for this disease that is destroying the cows of the country.  When a cow runs idle for a year or two, she is dry and she is of no use.  The calf is lost and the milk is lost and the people who have to sell these cows have to dispose of them at a sacrifice if they own land of inferior nature, that is unable to fatten them. They have practically to throw them away.  This disease is doing a terrible lot of damage and something should be done to increase the number of bulls, especially of the shorthorn type.  I notice that although the dairy shorthorn was supposed to be a dual-purpose cow, in many cases she has proved to be only a single-purpose cow.  So far as I can see, calves that are bred from the dairy shorthorn bulls are poor, weedy little animals and they are not any use for beef or as store cattle.  The only purpose they serve is that of dairying, if they really do serve that purpose.  I am not in a position to give an opinion on that, but I know that the bull calves are no good, and the heifers which are not kept for dairy purposes are of a very poor type also.  I think the Department should not confine their efforts entirely to producing cattle for milk.  They should try to get a dual-purpose cow. If they can get a good dairying strain, which would have good qualities otherwise as beef and store cattle, they would be doing a good service.  I should say that more than half of the farmers do not mate their cattle with the shorthorn bulls.  They mate them with bulls of the beef type, but if they have not a good type of cow it is impossible to produce a good type of calf.  The Minister should pay some attention to this matter so as to prevent deterioration in the value of our stock.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister in conclusion to pay attention to the matters which I have mentioned.  Now that the two Ministers are sitting together, I would ask the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="1859" /> to acquiesce no longer in the views of the Minister for Industry and Commerce in so far as these views tend to provide for the people in industries over which the Minister for Industry and Commerce presides a much higher standard of living than that enjoyed by people engaged in agriculture. The people engaged in agriculture are not inferior to the best workers in any other industry in the State, whether or not they are trained workers.  The workers in agriculture must be all-round men.  They are almost experts, not merely in one particular branch of production, but in many other branches.  The Minister for Agriculture should see that the farmers get a chance, that they are able to pay a decent wage, that they are able to provide as much employment now as heretofore, and that they are able to recover not only the cost of production, but that they are also able to make a reasonable profit out of their industry.  Is it any wonder, if they find they are to be made the hewers of wood and drawers of water, that the more enterprising, the brainest, and the best of them are flying from the land and leaving the country.  That is what is happening.  They are leaving behind people who are a burden on the State &mdash; the old age pensioners, the people who are drawing the dole, and everybody who is a misfit.  The fittest are going.  The potential taxpayers and wealth producers are decreasing out of all proportion to the decreased numbers remaining on the land.  In view of this fact, the matter has become too serious and it is not a matter to jest about any longer.  I think the Minister has a big responsibility, and that he should give some little earnestness that he is prepared to do his part to bring about a remedy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinRyan" hpid="Mr. M. Ryan Mr. M. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened with interest to this long debate on this very important Estimate.  It has been admitted by all speakers that agriculture is our basic industry.  Fine Gael speakers pointed to Deputies who spoke from the Government side and tried to indicate that this is the first time that anybody on this side of the <Col N="1860" /> House admitted that anything was wrong with the agricultural industry. I, for one, have never heard the Minister, or any of the spokesmen of the Government Party, claim that all is well with agriculture, or that agriculture wants no assistance whatsoever. I think the facts show that the very opposite is the case.  When the Fianna Fáil Government came into office their very first move was to come to the assistance of the agricultural community by reducing the land annuities by 50 per cent.  The Minister and the Government very soon after coming into office took strong measures to protect, for the benefit of our agricultural producers here, the only market over which they had any control.  The Minister took measures to provide a guaranteed market and economic prices for many of our agricultural products. Those things in themselves should be ample evidence that the Government were not satisfied that all is well with agriculture.  Recently an Agricultural Commission was set up, which should be concrete proof that the Minister and the Government were not satisfied that all is well with agriculture.  I do not see, therefore, that the suggestions which I have mentioned as coming from Fine Gael are very helpful at such a time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have stated, I have listened with interest to the debate and I have not heard any practical suggestions from the Fine Gael speakers.  They enumerated our woes and pointed out the things that are wrong.  It is all very fine to do that, but, if we are to have any constructive suggestions, we must have something besides the continuous pouring out of grievances. Everybody seems to have a fair idea of the things which are wrong.  What I should like to hear, and I am sure the same applies to the Minister, is some helpful suggestions.  We have had the cry about the increased cost of production, but no word as to how that can be remedied, as to what overhead expenses should be reduced, and in what way they could be reduced.  There is no suggestion, for instance, as to whether the admixture scheme should be dropped and, if it were dropped, what our grain producers should do with their products.  To my mind, <Col N="1861" /> these are the lines which should be followed by critics of the Minister's policy and which would be much more helpful than the continuous pouring out of our grievances.</P>
    <P>We also heard the very popular cry about high rates and taxes generally, but no suggestion as to what item of our social services should be dropped or reduced in any way.  They want a continuation of all the social services and yet complain about the rates and taxes.  It is not very encouraging to listen to the debate and find that there are no hopeful suggestions put forward. I hope for the welfare of the agricultural community that the Minister's plans will bear good fruit, and that from the Agricultural Commission which is sitting we shall have some helpful suggestion, because, as I have said during the course of the debate, I have heard none from which we could expect any hope.</P>
    <P>I should like to suggest to the Minister that if not the present Agricultural Commission, at least some such commission, should be made a permanent fixture here.  As agriculture is our principal and fundamental industry, I think such a commission would be very helpful.  I believe that the members of the commission, for instance, would be more closely in touch with our producers than the officials of, say, the Department of Agriculture.  For that reason, I suggest that that commission, or a commission on somewhat similar lines, should be made a permanent fixture here.  Some speakers mentioned our dairying products, and went on to point out the record milk yields obtained in Holland, Denmark and other countries.  I have discussed this matter with certain farmers throughout the country and a good many of them suggested to me that beef and milk can be produced economically.  I believe myself that that is very questionable, but there is at least something worthy of investigation in their claim.</P>
    <P>I think that anybody with a knowledge of agriculture or of farming generally will admit that we should not look to the Government for everything. <Col N="1862" /> The Government can formulate schemes, but it is up to our farmers to avail of such schemes.  Unfortunately, I think our farmers are not at all alive to the situation.  For instance, during the economic war it was alleged, and I think rightly so, that the bounties and subsidies provided for the advantage of our people were not finding their way into the pockets of our producers.  I think a great many people will agree that our cattle dealers formed a ring at that time, and that the bounties, as I say, did not find their way into the pockets of our farmers.  That was alleged by many people.  The Minister took up the matter and, as we all recollect, he fixed a minimum price.  The people who formed the ring took steps to evade the regulations laid down by the Minister and, unfortunately, our farmers assisted them.  That is a thing that our farmers should not do.  As I say, they should be alive to the situation and, if anything is being done for their advantage, they should be the first to help and assist, and not take steps to encourage and assist those who are out to fleece them.</P>
    <P>Now, in like manner, with regard to the Agricultural Commission now sitting, I myself know that, in my own county, the agricultural committee there took steps to call meetings of farmers together in a body at certain centres in order to take steps to submit evidence that might be helpful to the Agricultural Commission.  Unfortunately, in a great many cases, the farmers failed to turn up at these meetings &mdash; I suppose, because each man was leaving it to the other fellow &mdash; but I think, that in one sense, some of our people are lacking in that respect: that they take things too easily and will not come forward to assist in providing for some scheme for their own advantage.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say very much more with regard to this vote, but I should like to say that I feel that, generally speaking, enough work is not being done on the land.  I remember that, previous to the Great War, when a farmer wanted to engage a man to <Col N="1863" /> work for him &mdash; at least this is true of my own part of the country&mdash;he could not get a man unless he engaged him for 12 months.  Following the war, that period was reduced to about ten or 11 months, and to-day it has been reduced much further, with the result that most agricultural employees, nowadays, are only engaged for five or six months of the year &mdash; for the sowing of the crops in spring, the saving of the hay, and so on, and for the reaping-in harvest. That means that for the rest of the year such important matters as drainage, fencing, and general improvements on the land are neglected.  The result of that is that our land, generally, is deteriorating, and I myself believe that that has a great deal to do with what is wrong with agriculture in the country generally.</P>

As I have said already, we have heard our woes being poured out again and again from Deputies on the Fine Gael Benches, but we have no suggestion in the way of a constructive remedy being put forward from those benches.  I suggest that if we had some constructive suggestion put forward it would be much more beneficial to the country, and even to the members of Fine Gael themselves, than this continual pouring out of grievances.  At any rate, I do hope that something in the way of helpful suggestions will come from the commission that is now sitting, because we have certainly got very little in that way in this debate. I also hope that our farmers, as a whole, will be alive to the situation and, notwithstanding the pessimistic <Col N="1864" /> outlook of Deputy McGovern, I hope that the farmers of this country will come forward and give that commission every assistance in their power.</P>

Ní minic a bhíonn sé scríobhtha mar sin nuair a bhíonn rud maith a dhul dó. Tá sean-rá ann: &ldquo;Fághann na ba bás fhaid is bhíonn an féar ag fás.&rdquo;  Tá faitíos orm gur fíor é seo agus gur cuid den aicíd seo an gorta.  Tuige a ndeirim seo?  Mar go dtí le a ceathair no a cúig de bhlianta o shoin bhíodh go leor fátaí curtha ag na feilméirí beaga i gConamara agus ní bhíodh mórán turnapaí ná a leithéidí curtha acu. Fataí na borthaí is mó a thugann siad do na beithigh ann.  Ní raibh na fataí curtha acu i mbliana.  Deirtear: &ldquo;An té nach gcuireann san Earrach ní fhéadfa sé baint sa bhFómhar.&rdquo;  Deirfear: &ldquo;Tuige nár chuir siad iad?&rdquo; Bhuel, ní féidir leis an ngabadán an dá thraigh a fhreastal, sin é, an tEarrach a chur agus bheith ag briseadh clocha agus ag déanamh bóithre.

Nár cheart don Aire Talmhaidheachta iallach a chur ar an Aire Tionnscail agus Tráchtála é seo a atharú agus an obair a stopadh san Earrach agus é thabhairt do na daoine sa Samhradh nuair nach mbeadh tada le déanamh acu dhóibh féin agus nuair is géire a theastuíonn sé uatha?  Na daoine seo is le láigheantaí is mór a chuireann siad a gcuid earra agus tágann siad i ngar do ráithe an Earraigh leis.  Ní féidir é dhéanamh de léim ar nós na háiteacha a bhfuil céachtaí agus a leithéide.  D'íocfainn <Col N="1865" /> sé iad san Earrach, dá gcaithfí a dhéanamh, leis an Earrach a chur mar is mó a bheadh dá bharr acu dhóibh féin agus dá gcuid callaigh ná as rud ar bith a d'fhéadfaí a dhéanamh dhóibh.  Ach ní shin é a rinne an dream atá i réim anois.  Nach an rud céanna a rinne na tiarnaí agus leithéidí tar eis bhain am droch-shaoil.  San am sin cuireadh na daoine bochta ag obair i lár an Earraigh ar deich bpingne sa ló agus nuair a tháinic na tiarnaí ag iarraidh a gcuid cíosa sa Samhradh dár gcionn ní raibh pinghinn acu agus nár caitheadh amach iad as a gcuid teach agus talamh?  Shílfeá go gcuimhneochadh an tAire agus a dhream air seo agus gan íad féin a bheith ag déanamh an rud chéanna.  Marach sagart pobail Cloch na Rón agus na bráithre a fuair trí lorraí féir agus thug do na daoine iad ar níos lugha ná thug siad féin air, tá faitíos mór orm go mbeadh go leor leor eile beithíoch caillte.  Nach áit an scéal é gur chuir an Dr. MacÉil, Ard-easbog Thuama, na bráithre go Cloch na Rón le haghaidh congnamh a thabhairt do na daoine an gorta a choimeád uatha féin agus nár thainig sé ar ais an choicíos seo caithte go raibh a rian ina sheasamh i gcomhnaí nuair a d'fhoillsigh siad ar na daoine an féar seo a fháil.</P>
    <P>Níl mise le buntáiste polatíochta ar bith a thogáil as seo.  Duine ar bith a dhéanfas a leithéid seo tagann sé ar ais air féin ach tá mé ag iarraidh ar an Aire breathnú isteach sa scéal seo go grinn agus luach na mbeithíoch a thabhairt do na daoine seo.  Mara bhféadfa sé an t-airgead a thabhairt dóibh in aisce, bá cheart dó ar a laighead é thabhairt dóibh ar iasacht fada gan gháimbín.  Ghabhfadh ocht no naoi de chéadtaibh punt tamall maith sa damáiste atá déanta sa gceanntar seo faoi láthair.  Tá me cinnte nach bhfuil aon Teachta sa Dáil a bheadh ina dhiaidh seo a thabhairt do na daoine mar ní shiad féin ba chíonntach leis.  Dá mba iad, ní bhéinn-se ag labhairt ar a son.  Nach iomdha míle púnt caitheadh níos measa ná an méid seo a thabhairt dóibh seo. Mar sin, oscluíodh an tAire a chroidhe agus déanadh sé an rud mór.</P>
    <P>Anois, níl mise a rá nach bhfuil an <Col N="1866" /> tAire a déanamh maitheasa i gConamara. Tá na hoifigigh atá i gConamara aige ag déanamh a ndícheall as an méid airgid atá siad a fháil.  Sé an locht atá ortha nach bhfuil siad ag fáil a ndóthain airgid le caitheadh. Marach na ploit ar thug an tAire an oiread seo £5 an acra as ucht sléibhte agus áiteannaí garbha a bhriseadh, ní bheadh leath an chuir déanta atá déanta, dá laighead é, agus marach an méid síl, síol fataí agus coirce, a thug sé amach i mbliana bheadh na daoine bán uilig.  Mar sin, rinne sé maith ach níl siad ag déanamh a ndóthain. Dubhairt me go míon agus go minic sa Teach seo cuid den airgead atá á chaitheadh go mba cheart é thabhairt do na daoine sna ceanntair seo le haghaidh sléibhte a bhriseadh suas. Thiubharfainn-se £40 as ucht na sléibhte a bhriseadh suas ar an achréidh agus go ndéanfaí i gceart é. D'fheicfeá go dtiocfadh maith as seo. Bheadh beatha ag go leor daoine dóibh féin agus dá beithíoch agus dá gcuid eallaigh agus ní bheadh oiread seo caint faoi bhochtaineacht Chonamara. Acht ní dhéanfa dream ar bith blas ar bíth sa tír seo go n-éireoidh rud eicínt suas.  Annsin, beidh gleo mór go ceann seachtaine agus gan blas cur leis.</P>
    <P>Anois tá mé ag iarraidh ar an Aire éisteacht liom go grinn.  Sna blianta caitheadh, bhíodh &ldquo;vet&rdquo; againn ina chomhnaí i gConamara ach creidim gur cheap an fear seo nach raibh Conamara sáthach maith aige agus fuair sé cead a dhul isteach ina chomhnaí go Gaillimh trí scór míle ó áiteacha i gConamara.  Nach mór an náire é seo? Nach 'spáineann sé nach bhfuil meas ar bíth ar Chonamara?  Labhair mé air seo cheana ach níor tháinig blas ar bíth as.  Anois, tá fógra faighte ag an Aire agus tá súil agam go gcuirfe sé iallach ar &ldquo;vet&rdquo; bheith ina chomhnaí i gConamara.  Nach bhfuil fhios aige féin chó maith is tá agam-sa nach féidir le na daoine bochta é íoc amach as Gaillimh?  B'fhéidir nár bhfiú an beithíoch faoi láthair leath-oiread is d'íocfadh sé leis an &ldquo;vet&rdquo; air féin agus ar a charr a thuibharfadh amach é.  Ach dá mbeadh sé ina chomhnaí i gConamara b'uiriste glaoch air nuair a bheidh sé ag teastáil.  Iarraim go <Col N="1867" /> speisialta ar an Aire é seo a dhéanamh. Deirtear nach bhfuil aon mhaith sa seanchas nuair atá an anachain déanta ach tá mise ag iarraidh aon mhaith amháin air, rud éicint a thabhairt do na daoine seo ar cailleadh na beithigh ortha.

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It was rather surprising to hear a Deputy say that very few constractive suggestions have been made on this subject.  It was clear, I think, to most people's minds that an expansion of profitable production is particularly essential in this industry. In order to see how best this can be done, one of our first investigations should be to see how far it is within the competence of those who are engaged in agriculture to do that. According to the Banking Commission's Report, approximately 125,000 farmers are in debt to the banks.  It is quite true that the balance, which would be approximately 135,000, have to their credit some £36,000,000, but the 125,000 farmers owe approximately £13,000,000.  If, by reason of that indebtedness or other causes, the 125,000 are unable to get into profitable production, it is as much a responsibility of the Ministry to consider them as it is to put before the House proposals for improving the quality of agricultural production in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The efforts that have been made during the last few years have been, on the whole, very expensive.  The two items which are particularly mentioned &mdash; beet and wheat &mdash; have benefited a relatively small number of persons engaged in the industry, about 50,000 farmers engaged in growing wheat and possibly some 13,000 or 15,000 engaged in growing beet.  These are not phases of agricultural activity: they are Government experiments and they should be placed in a category entirely apart from the Government's policy with regard to agriculture.  They benefit one in five; in practice and in essence they are of no benefit whatever to the agricultural production of the country.  In so far as they are political experiments or Government experiments, or even agricultural <Col N="1868" /> experiments, the cost incidental to their being put into operation should not be charged to agriculture.</P>
    <P>Now, during those years there has been a marked drop in the revenue which agriculturists were in the habit of getting from some very simple lines of agricultural production.  If you take poultry, dead and alive, and eggs; during the war the egg production of this country was more important than ship-building was in Belfast.  Anywhere over the whole world that one goes, one hears boasts from anybody from Ulster in connection with the great ship-building business.  Even as far back as the year 1931, the value of our exports of eggs and dead and alive poultry amounted to £3,065,000 odd; in 1935 it had gone down to £1,452,000; in 1936 it was £1,472,000; in 1937 it was £1,312,000.  Now one does not need to be either a financial expert, to be good at figures, or to be even a good agriculturist to realise that in that item of poultry an expansion of the value of our exports ought to be possible and ought to engage the attention of the Minister much more than the expensively advertised wheat scheme. They can go on with that if they wish, but the wheat scheme will benefit only some 50,000 farmers, while this will benefit practically every farmer in the country, and those of them who are not conscious of the advantage of raising poultry ought to be persuaded to do it.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made here this evening to the Report of the Prices Commission on pigs and on the price of bacon.  There was one omission from that reference.  It appears that the Prices Commission discovered that the bacon manufacturers benefited to the extent of £300,000 odd over and above a fair price.  They were not the only beneficiaries.  By reason of that extra profit, the Minister for Finance must have netted approximately £100,000.  Therefore, into the Exchequer rolled from the pockets of the poorest people in this country, as well as from the well-to-do, from the middle classes, and all up and down along the line, £100,000.  They were liable for that in respect of income-tax <Col N="1869" /> and of corporation profits tax.  That is one of the complaints regarding this particular industry in this country, that it is saddled with costs in every direction.  Whatever they buy is dear; it is not as dear as has been asserted here, because if the cost of living has gone up to 170 or thereabouts, if it is 70 points over what it was in 1913 or 1914, not all of those costs fall upon the agricultural community; but some costs fall upon them that are not calculated in the index, and fall upon them with particular severity.</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants suggestions in connection with how the agricultural industry should be improved I will make him a present of a simple suggestion. When he was over here some six or seven years ago, both he and his colleagues were continually drawing attention to the high costs which agriculture was said to bear in connection with production and to the low prices they were getting.  In the last year of office of the previous Government there was a sum of £750,000 extra granted in relief of rates on agricultural land; the Minister will recollect that because he and his colleagues suggested it should be £1,000,000.  When they came into office they gave an extra £250,000, but only for a short period, and they are now giving some £78,000 a year less in relief of rates than was given before they crossed the House from this side.</P>
    <P>That £78,000 might be employed in making manures cheaper to the farmers.  If they are to get the best out of the land, it is manifestly necessary to have the land improved and that the price of manures should be decreased.  In fact it would be a great benefit to the country if manures could be supplied free of cost.  This is one &mdash; perhaps the only &mdash; industry that we have got where an expenditure of public money wisely expended in improving the land or in improving our live stock is money very well spent. Manures are much cheaper in the North of Ireland and in England than they are here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It so happens that <Col N="1870" /> in certain businesses a very small percentage is the thing that counts and agriculture is in that position and has been in it for years past.  I think I have already told the Ministry about the lecture given from Belfast radio some time ago in which listeners were informed of the revenue derivable from farms &mdash; some 13, I think, in number &mdash; over the whole of the Six Counties. With one exception the average was about £2 1s. per week.  That was income derivable from farms which varied in extent from 25 to 130 acres and, in one year &mdash; I forget whether it was 1933 or 1934 &mdash; the income was as low as 9/9.  The Minister will appreciate that in connection with any item &mdash; manure or anything else &mdash; a single £1 in that year was much more important than £5 or £6 in another year.  So it is with regard to this particular industry at the moment, particularly when one bears in mind that 125,000 farmers owe money to the banks.  My suggestion to the Minister in connection with those people is that, taking land commission annuitants, because they represent, I suppose, about 95 per cent. of those engaged on the land at the moment, taking them as a whole, within the last year or two, they have paid their liabilities with remarkable promptitude.  Bearing in mind the difficulties under which the industry suffers at the moment, if financial accommodation is required, is it not much better to give them that help now, when it is needed to put them into production, than to be spending, let us say, £500,000 on industrial alcohol or something of that sort? Perhaps it would be better if we did not refer to any of these things.  The fact is that, unless money be made available to get the full value out of the land, it is obvious that, not only agriculture, but other industries in the country, and the general business of the country will deteriorate and be affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My recollection of the reasons why the Pigs Marketing Board and that other board were set up was to regulate, as far as possible, a level price for pigs, to induce people to get into pig production and to keep them in it and to ensure, as far as it had an <Col N="1871" /> effect on that, that our supply of the quota of bacon which we got for the British market would be regular.  It happens that it did not effect that purpose, because we have fewer pigs in the country now than we had.  I think the number has gone down from five to four, possibly from four to three, but certainly from five to four.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I was informed that during the particular period in question it cost £1 more to rear a pig in this country and it took about three weeks longer than in the North of Ireland. The Minister may shake his head, but the fact is that if there is one hard-headed set of individuals in any place in the wide world it is the farmers of this country.  If there was money in it they would still be in it. There must be some reason, other than argument, for people reducing their stock of pigs.  In those two items&mdash; poultry and pig-rearing&mdash;you have a means of increasing production at a more rapid rate than perhaps anything else in agriculture.  A cow gives but one calf in the year.  Sometimes she may have twins.  Other times, of course, there may be a miss.  Taking it all round, a man is lucky if the cow has one calf a year.  The same thing does not apply to the other two items. They are capable of more rapid production and every effort ought to be made to make it possible for people to carry on poultry rearing and pig rearing at a profit.  The efforts that <Col N="1872" /> have been made by the Minister to do that have, apparently, failed in both these directions.</P>
      <P>Another suggestion that we make to the Minister&mdash;and I think we made it before&mdash;is in connection with horse-breeding. It is not his business.  An opportunity will be afforded the Minister for Finance to-morrow, if he has not already made up his mind on the subject, of relieving those engaged in horse-breeding from the liability for income-tax on stallion fees.  The revenue derived from that is negligible.  May I ask the Minister, in connection with his Estimate this year, why no reference was made, even in italics, to item G (2)&mdash;Purchase and Insurance of Thoroughbred Stallions?  There was a sum of £35,000 down in that connection last year and the item is not even mentioned this year, unless it escaped my notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No; you are quite right; it is not mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose the Minister spent that £35,000 and the Minister for Finance will be five years collecting the fees.  Although not as valuable in its revenue side, from the point of view of bringing money into the country, the sale of horses is of considerable value to this country for many reasons.  It gives employment to an immense number of people.  The country has made a name for the production of horses of better quality than there are in any place in the world. While the Minister may say it is a small item, these small items, in a business of that sort, are of considerable moment to those engaged in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a pity that, in his answer to Deputy O'Neill to-day, the Minister did not propose to do anything in connection with draught-mares throughout the country.  The Royal Dublin Society has a small scheme on hands in that connection.  The war, unfortunately, deprived us of a certain percentage of our foundation stock of draught-mares and every effort ought to be made by the Ministry to bring them again into a flourishing state.  Apart from their value to the farmers, the Irish <Col N="1873" /> draught-mare has been a great breeder and has earned for this country a wonderful reputation.</P>
    <P>With regard to hunters, the heavyweight hunter is not produced in anything like the same numbers as formerly and the quality, unfortunately, is not as good as it was.  In a recent show, among some very fine-looking animals, the percentage of sound horses was rather small, although it was something in the nature of 60 per cent.  That is small for a country like this.</P>
    <P>In the course of his statement, the Minister mentioned about cow testing. That is another phase of the industry of agriculture which should be brought to the attention of farmers.  It would pay far better to advertise that than some of the other things that are costing a lot of money.  If it were possible for us to increase the milk yield and to get people to take a greater interest in the value to the farmer and to the country of cows having a big milk yield, it would be capable of producing very much more revenue and, generally speaking, of improving the quality of our herds.</P>
    <P>Presumably, it would be unwise to address the commission that is sitting at the moment upon what it ought to do.  It is obvious that, if the revenue going into a business is going down, as it has gone down during the last few years in connection with agriculture, and that, along with that reduction in revenue, the costs of production are rising, something more than mere talk here in this House will be necessary if we are going to bring that industry back, into the shape in which the Ministry got it, in 1932.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ryan, speaking from the Fianna Fáil Benches, stated that this was an important debate.  I thoroughly agree.  I think this is probably the most important debate which we have here every year. We have reached a stage in our economic and Parliamentary history when everybody admits freely that agriculture is our most important industry. But is that fact properly <Col N="1874" /> appreciated?  Is it appreciated that, apart from some of our old-established industries such as biscuit factories, breweries, etc., the entire of our export trade depends upon the agricultural industry?  Is it further appreciated that all the other trade of the country depends upon that agricultural industry?  The man who walks into his office in O'Connell Street.  Grafton Street or Dame Street in the City of Dublin is as much concerned with the welfare of the agricultural industry as the shopkeeper in the country town who takes down his shutters on a fair morning.  It is needless to emphasise that the worker and the farmer are wrapped up in that industry.</P>
      <P>I have sat through the whole of this debate, and what surprised me most was that the members of the Government made themselves conspicuous by their absence from it.  The Minister for Agriculture has been left there all the time by himself except for short intervals when it was necessary to replace him.  Supposing some distinguished agricultural experts from abroad, men steeped and versed in their subject, decided to visit the Dáil after hearing that a debate was taking place on the agricultural policy of the Government, they would naturally rub their hands and say: &ldquo;We are going into the Parliament of this agricultural community and there we will see the Government of the country in full session taking a deep interest in a matter that vitally affects the welfare of the whole country,&rdquo; but what would their surprise be if they did visit the Dáil?  As I have said, the members of the Government have been conspicuous by their absence.  I agree that the Minister for Industry and Commerce was in for a short time this evening. I think it is a terrible state of affairs that when the most important subject that could be debated in this House is before us&mdash;the welfare of the agricultural industry&mdash;that the Minister for Agriculture should be left alone to hold the baby.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that we on this side are doing nothing but criticising. That is not so.  I do not propose to go into details.  I appreciate the <Col N="1875" /> Minister's difficulty&mdash;the difficulties that any Minister for Agriculture will have to face in this country.  I am not going to put the blame for all our ills on the economic war.  I appreciate, as much as anybody, that there has been depression the world over and that this country has had its share of it.  The Minister for Agriculture has a difficult job to perform.  In my opinion it will always take a superman to do the job properly.  He must have the full support of all the other members of the Government for the projects he brings forward.  The Minister's job is difficult because you have different problems in different constituencies and in different part of the country.  The Minister and myself are two of the representatives of a tillage constituency.  The problems there are not the same as in other constituencies.  The Minister's job is to co-ordinate those various problems so that there will emerge a solid whole which will give a policy that can be operated to the advantage of every interest in the country.  Probably, when the Minister took office all that he had in mind was that his job represented one-eighth of the responsibility for Government policy in this country.</P>
    <P>I believe that when this Government came into office they regarded agriculture just as something that might be treated as the purchase of a new dog kennel by the Board of Works.  I am sure that projects brought forward by the Minister's Department have not received consideration from the Government as a whole.  We all know who the members of the Government are.  They are clever men and good politicians, but do they represent, as the back benches of the Fianna Fáil Party do, the agricultural community of this country?  How could the majority of the members of the Government Front Bench have any sympathy with the agricultural community of this country?  I was pleased to observe during the last few months that back benchers of the Fianna Fáil Party have been popping up now and again and giving expression to their views.  I hope they will continue to do so and, further, that they will make their views felt at the Party meetings so <Col N="1876" /> that the other seven members of the Government may be made realise that it is their duty to support the Minister for Agriculture in the measures that he brings forward to safeguard our most important industry which is rapidly dying.  There can be no doubt but that the problem is an urgent one. It is not a question of giving £10 here, £50 there and £100 somewhere else. This great industry is on the point of being shipwrecked, and urgent measures are needed if it is to be saved.  The Government will have to put every ounce of its energy into that task if agriculture is to be put on its feet again.  It is in such a bad way that the Government cannot afford to await the report of the commission that is sitting at present.  Something must be done at once.</P>
    <P>I am not going to attempt to suggest what ought to be done.  The farming community have been pleased to give their confidence to the Fianna Fáil Party and to the Government.  The people have reposed their confidence in them, and it is their responsibility to provide the remedy.  The Minister for Agriculture owes the agricultural community a deep and lasting duty to put the industry back on its feet.  The members of the Government willingly accepted the position they are in.  It is, therefore, their duty to solve this problem.  There is no use in tinkering with it.  The problem will have to be faced in a big way.  The country ought to be able to do that since we are going to spend from £5,000,000 to £8,000,000 on arms and ammunition.  The spending of that money will help to put British workmen into employment. While we are able to do that we are not able to find the money to make advances to our farmers to enable them to buy seeds and manures.  But we are able to find the money for bombing planes, to spend it here, there and everywhere.  We are doing all that while our own great industry is dying before our eyes.</P>
    <P>The first thing that you require is a proper scheme of advertising, and a recognition of the importance of the English market.  We should advertise our goods in such a way that we can <Col N="1877" /> convince the consumer that we are able to supply her with the type of goods she requires; secondly, we must create a new demand for goods not asked for already.  We should send people over to places in England where our agricultural produce is sold to ascertain what the public there wants.  That is what other countries with which we are competing are doing in these markets. The first thing we require is a proper scheme of advertising.  Then the farmer must be subsidised.  That must be done at once.  I do not care whether it is done by derating or by advancing money for seeds and manures, but the industry must be subsidised.  If it is not subsidised all the other industries will go down.</P>
    <P>There are one or two matters to which I wish to call the Minister's attention in connection with his constituency. I agree with what a Deputy on the opposite benches said regarding the fruit industry.  It is an excellent thing that crops, such as fruit, which are becoming more popular, should be dealt with by the Department of Agriculture. I have had correspondence with the Minister about the tobacco crop, and the County Committee of Agriculture has been in touch with him, and I make bold to say that the Minister will help, because I think his heart is in the right place in that respect.  As far as Kilcarbery station is concerned, I think the Minister has probably been overborne by the officials of his Department, and by the indifference of other members of the Executive Council, but I ask him, even at this late juncture, to see if the decision come to about the station could not be altered.</P>
    <P>We heard at one time about alternative markets.  I was never one of those who believed that we could not get a market in any country except Great Britain.  I think the British must be always our principal market, but there are plenty of other places where we could get markets for our produce.  I have just returned from a Continental country in which there was a shortage of eggs.  That country would be prepared to take all the eggs we could supply.  The leader of the Opposition <Col N="1878" /> referred this evening to the importance of the egg industry.  The country from which I returned recently is already taking a considerable quantity of eggs from us, and the difficulty of increasing it is, I understand, because it is a barter trade.  That difficulty could be overcome, and is one the Government should face.  While there is only one great market for our produce, there are additional markets that could be developed.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is an industry of which this country should be proud.  It has been built up on the experience of generations.  To-day the number of people engaged in agriculture is decreasing.  Even though they have to get up and say certain things here, I appeal to back benchers in the Fianna Fáil Party, coming as they do from rural districts and pursuing rural pursuits, to realise the importance of the agricultural industry.  The man who lives on one side of a fence has to face the same problems as the man on the other side, and the problem here is the decline of the agricultural industry.  I ask the back benchers in the Fianna Fáil Party to get away from the Party political aspect, and, as men who were born and bred on the land, to make their influence felt with the leaders of their Party, so that at this juncture, pressure could be brought to bear on the Government to deal with the problem.  If the Minister for Agriculture chooses to produce a remedy he can then, at least claim the support of the Cabinet for it.  The Department of Agriculture should be the most important Department in this State.  No measure should be introduced into this House without that Department being consulted as to what way it might interfere with the agricultural industry. I do not think that happens now.  I have great sympathy for the Minister, but I believe he is left sitting alone in the corner at meetings of the Executive Council, unsupported by any member of the Cabinet.  I ask back benches on the opposite benches to get away from Party politics, to realise that they come from the land, and to tell city and town-bred people who form the Government of this country that rural Ireland will die <Col N="1879" /> unless something is done for the agricultural industry at once.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak in this debate somewhat in the character described by Deputy Esmonde, and not being a farmer, the only thing I can do in this House is to report the impressions I gathered from spending many hours with the people, talking with farmers of every kind for hours about their problems, and giving whatever impressions I can of their position in relation to this Estimate.  At the same time, I want to bring to bear on it whatever knowledge I could glean in the ordinary way as to how this country stands in comparison with other countries that depend on agriculture.  I want to make the position clear, because anyone who does not practise farming as a vocation has no right to speak except he speaks as the mouthpiece that caters for their point of view. Undoubtedly the position of farmers at the present time is far from happy. There is not only distress amongst them but, what is far worse, there is complete lack of decision as to what their future is to be.  I would say that their lack of a certain future is quite as important an adverse factor as their actual position, or as to how they may be adversely affected.  The lack of decision with regard to the future of agriculture is in itself a terribly serious factor.  The reasons are well known to the House.  They are due partly to the crisis which overtook agriculture after the war, accentuated here, to a large degree, by the economic war and partly owing to the unfortunate fact that there came immediately after the economic war a period of intense dryness, followed by a period of extremely bad weather, which adversely affected their whole production in the first year that they were able to recover their position.  I think another reason, and it is a serious one, is the extremes of exaggeration of which we have had evidence even in this House, some people speaking in the depths of despair about the position, and other people trying to cover that position, and to deny certain evils that exist, while the farming community waits and <Col N="1880" /> watches and is not allowed to take any action to advance its position or to spend the small credit that some section may have until this House once and for all clarifies the position.  There is a constant demand on one side for extraordinary measures of help, and constant denials, in some respects, from the other side.</P>
      <P>I am not trying to plead that all that members in opposition say in regard to farming is incorrect.  I notice that even among members of the Opposition their description of the farmer's position varies enormously, from extreme pessimists like Deputy McGovern, for example, to other people who speak more cautiously and, shall I say, more wisely, such as Deputy Cosgrave.  That is so throughout the House.  It is the same with members of the Party that forms the Government at the moment.  You hear expressions of view which hinge almost on despair, and there are others who say the position is comparatively satisfactory. To put it colloquially, that is playing almost hell with the farmers, the complete lack of decision in this House as to their position.  It is one of the most serious items in the present situation.</P>
      <P>There is no need for us to exaggerate the position, because that will not serve the country well.  In the middle of a most serious crisis in England, or at least as soon as the first crisis was over and the National Government took office, people in that country and in other countries did their best to adopt an attitude of securing that the prestige of the country and the credit of the country should remain high.  I suggest that, when this debate is over, we must try to reach the position when this extreme exaggeration of opinion will end, for the sake of the farmers adversely affected, and we should take the same attitude as was taken in England when she went through her extreme economic crisis, that the position cannot last for long.  If we do not, there will not be the normal improvement that should be effected under present circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1881" /> The actual position is that things are not at all bad.  Our exports have increased considerably in the last two years.  The volume of output from agriculture in this country is high, and I think it is a credit to the farmers that it should be so.  Right through the entire period of the economic war it was to the credit of the farmers that the volume of output remained amazingly high.  The agricultural output was at one period £52,000,000.  It went down to £48,000,000 and then it rose to £51,000,000 in 1936 and 1937.  I suggest that it is a very good thing that we have that position at the end of the economic war.  I mention that one factor to show that things are not so bad as they might seem.  The same thing is reflected in the actual cattle population.  It decreased by a small number and it has shown a slight increase in certain directions.  On the other hand, there was an insufficient increase in pigs.  Heifers in calf increased by 20 per cent. in 1938 over 1937.  All these things tend to reveal that the position is far from being as desperate as it is made out.  Another reason which is making it difficult for farmers to progress is the false promises put before them and which were put before them&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Derating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;by certain groups in the country.  And another good reason for ending the extreme exaggeration of opinion on both sides of the House, but more particularly on the Opposition side, is that the people in this House who believe in sound finance have to face the unsound arguments made by miscellaneous farmers' federations spread throughout the country&mdash;to mention one item, the suggested suspension of the annuities. That was dealt with in the debate connected with the Department of the Minister for Lands.  All the members of the Opposition were agreed that the Government were doing what they could about that, and any kind of suggestion of a national suspension of annuities would be fatal to the credit of the country.  Another suggestion made by the farmers' federation which <Col N="1882" /> has not been followed up completely by the Opposition Party, but is suggested by some of them in a different form, is the question of immediately advancing towards farmers very extensive loans at a low rate of interest, without stating how these loans should be repaid, what guarantee would be offered, over what period they should be spread, or giving any detailed information as to how matters should be arranged without causing inflation. That is a matter which should be regarded with the greatest care by persons who do not believe in undue inflation.</P>
      <P>The third question is the question of derating.  Members of the Opposition Party were in the Government at the time the Derating Commission was formed and all of them recall the figures provided for them as to the extent to which the farmers bore the burden of taxation.  It will be recalled that in 1931 the farmers paid 43 per cent. of the customs duty, 30 per cent. of the excise taxes, 10 per cent. of the motor taxes and 2 per cent. of the property and income-tax.  In return for that they received 59 per cent. of the entire expenditure on central and local government services; that came back eventually to the farmers.  I think the Opposition will agree with the Government in this respect, that if there is to be any change in the derating policy it would be insane to make that change without having the most minute examination to see how far those percentages have altered, if they have altered, and to what degree they have altered.  There is no practical or theoretical economist who will advise any country to transfer £1,750,000 of taxation from one group of people and distribute it amongst the rest of the population without the most careful examination in advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that the farmers' federation believe that if you were to derate the farmers you would be in the position of leaving them with a surplus which they could use for production, for their own amusement and leisure and for their well-being, a surplus which is at present being used <Col N="1883" /> by the non-agricultural part of the community.  For instance, if there are 5,000 wireless sets bought by the industrial community for the 2,000 bought by the agricultural community, by derating or transferring taxation from one section of the farmers you would enable these farmers to have the position reversed and they would be able to buy wireless sets and there would be less sets for the other sections of the community.  I suggest that there is no economist, no member of the Department of Finance, no person acquainted with practical finance, who will guarantee in advance that the transfer of taxation of that kind would have the effect desired.</P>
    <P>There is nothing to prove that if you were to transfer taxation from the farmers to the whole community, and particularly to the industrial community, the result would not be that the non-agricultural part of the community would make the farmers pay for a great deal of that by increased costs.  If you prevent the man who carries the farmer's eggs from buying a wireless set and give the chance to the farmer to buy a set, you have no proof that the man who carries the eggs will not charge more for carrying them and go on buying his wireless set. The spread of that demand for derating is a most serious thing for the finances of the country, and the Opposition should agree with the Government that it requires most careful consideration to see that if that incidence of taxation were to be changed an examination would have to take place, and it would be necessary to determine what would be the economic results of transferring the taxation and whether they would work out in the direction desired.  If both Parties could agree about that, it would help to stay a most unreasonable demand which, in the end, would not be of service to the farmers.</P>
    <P>There are some of us who believe that the non-agricultural portion of the community may, in the course of the next five years, have to make sacrifices in order to restore production for <Col N="1884" /> the farmers.  I think that is quite possible. Let us be sure, when we make the sacrifices, that they will be sacrifices that will maintain the demand for agricultural produce and at the same time will not have the wrong effect of merely increasing the cost to the farmer. I mention that because it is up to the whole House to consider that position most seriously.</P>
    <P>Another reason why the farmers feel in an adverse position is undoubtedly the question of land division.  Over 9,000,000 acres of land have been dealt with under the Land Acts in this country.  If one studies the history of any other country in Europe which went through a period of rapid land division, one will find from their statistics that their agricultural production never increased while the land division was being carried out.  With the best will in the world, when land is constantly changing hands, going from one person to another, there is not to be got the same stability that exists in a country where all the land has been divided.  The great increase in agricultural production in Denmark took place after the land had been divided.  That is a fact that cannot be disputed.</P>
    <P>Another factor which affects the position of the farmer is the question of emigration.  Emigration, as I stated already, is not due only to adverse conditions here.  It is the result also of the continual draw from England. There is no doubt if the British Government continue their programme of expansion in armaments there will be no unemployment whatsoever of a certain kind in England in the course of 12 months from now.  The Government here, when initiating a new agricultural programme, will be in the position that they will find there is an increased demand for labour from this country in England.  In eight months' time there will be only 500,000 people unemployed in England, that is people who could possibly get work in the new industries resulting from armaments expansion.  England will be in the position shortly that there will be a heightened demand for the kind of <Col N="1885" /> labour that we can provide, rather than a diminishing demand.  The factor of emigration is one of the most serious things in permanently preventing increased agricultural production in this country.  That is because there is always the alternative between increasing production and emigration. Assuming that the Government did everything that the Opposition ask&mdash; that they carried out the most extensive reorganisation of agriculture&mdash;the fact will remain that the family will have the alternative of taking full advantage of these measures of Government reorganisation and increased agricultural production or sending some of their family to England.  There is always this alternative of emigration. That is one of the most serious things with which this country is faced. The continual demand in England for labour constitutes the most absolute menace to increased profits for the agricultural community.  No one who studied Dr. Geary's pamphlet on emigration and its relation to prosperity in adjacent countries, as distinct from prosperity in the country from which the people are emigrating, can deny that position.</P>
    <P>I am not arguing that the Government's economic war did not accentuate emigration.  But no accentuation of emigration by the economic war can equal the permanent emigration of the people of this country in diminishing the initiative that is found in Denmark or in the Balkan countries. In Denmark and in the Balkan countries where they cannot emigrate, they have to scratch every grain of wheat out of the surface of the earth. That will always be a factor in our life.</P>
    <P>Another reason for the adverse position of the farmer is the fact that, so far, we have lacked any general plan. We have been at the mercy of having to conduct a national conflict which now is ended as far as this part of the country is concerned.  But there is no general plan.  The farmers have no feeling that they are expected to take advantage of any system which will improve their position.  They have never been told to do anything which related purely to <Col N="1886" /> the farm.  Since 1922 the House has never really agreed to any policy in connection with the farm in which there was not intermingled a question in connection with our status in the Commonwealth of Nations.  That has been a serious menace, but, thank God, that is ended and, for the first time in the history of this country, people on both sides of this House agree and people talk more freely than they ever did before, because it is possible for the Government to evolve a plan that had not been possible before.</P>
    <P>The Opposition spoke about immediate measures having to be taken. The Opposition, and even members of our own Party, disagree as to what measures ought to be taken.  Listening to practical farmers, I can reiterate what Deputy Brennan said, that there should be a commission on agriculture. I think it is hard to find agreement on many matters discussed in this House. Down the country one can get farmers to stand up and fight for three hours on all sorts of factors in connection with agricultural production on which there is no sort of agreement.  We have members of the House saying the Government is interfering too much with agriculture.  Deputy Hughes made what is the most excellent suggestion &mdash;that there should be a complete change in the entire technique of farming. That is a matter not for the Government but for a commission to settle, because it involves enormous changes in the general position.</P>
    <P>We have only to read back to the reports made by the Opposition Party on agriculture when they had the administration of this country in their hands.  I have spent hours and hours reading them.  I find if one reads what was then suggested and the statements that were made by the then Minister for Agriculture, the late Deputy Hogan, that there were suggestions of the kind which would bring immediate and temporary relief to the farming community and definite improvement to the farmers' position.  But over and over again one will find in these reports remarks suggesting that there was something fundamentally wrong, <Col N="1887" /> that there was something fundamentally lacking in the way of agricultural technique.  Many suggestions were made.  And the suggestions made by some indicated that these suggestions, wise as they were, did very little to change fundamentally the position of agriculture in the country.  It could only effect a certain improvement.</P>
    <P>I believe that the position is serious from the standpoint of securing any immediate effect.  The fact is that if one takes the figures of agricultural production it will be found that since the beginning of this century we have advanced less rapidly in agriculture than any other country in the world which specialised in agriculture.  The members of this House should stop debating about the economic war and get down to the basis of what we have to consider.  It is not what this Government did or did not do since 1922, but the fact that there has been a complete lack of agricultural development since 1900.</P>
    <P>If we can get back to the mentality of seeing what can be done for agriculture on the standpoint of what has been done since 1900, then we can get down to something, and get away from all the exaggeration of the people who speak from the point of view of special interests, and not from the point of view of the country as a whole.  I should like to have some of those figures burn themselves into the minds of Deputies in this House.  For instance, to my amazement I discovered that the increase of cattle in this country from 1900 to 1927 is only 8 per cent., and from then on it remained practically the same, that is roughly 4,000,000.  The production of sheep in this country went down by 4 per cent. from 1900 to 1927, and from then until 1937 remained roughly the same.  The number of pigs increased by only 20 per cent. up to 1927, and has gone down by 16 per cent. from 1927 to 1937.  The number of poultry went up by 50 per cent., and then went down by 10 per cent. since 1927.  Those are the really serious figures.  The fact that the total amount of land under cultivation went down since 1900 is in <Col N="1888" /> itself a serious factor.  The fact that what is described as &ldquo;other land&rdquo; has increased&mdash;the land which has gone back to rough grazing has increased&mdash; and the fact that the actual acreage of cultivated grass land has increased by only 5 per cent. since 1897, are very serious things.  I merely repeat some of the matters which Deputy Hughes mentioned, and which are very valuable as indicating where our interests really lie.  There is the fact that the production of butter went up in New Zealand from 172,583 cwts. to nearly 3,000,000 cwts. in 1936; there is the fact that they increased their production of chilled and frozen meat from 2,000,000 cwts. to 5,000,000 cwts., and increased their wool production from 140,000,000 lbs. to 314,000,000 lbs.  Then once more there is the surprising point raised by Deputy Hughes, namely the comparative output&mdash;the fact that we produce £96 per agricultural worker in this country, compared with £169 in England, £84 in Scotland and £196 in Denmark.  Those are rather different from the figures given by Deputy Hughes, but they come to exactly the same thing.</P>
    <P>We in this country, as our economists have frequently said, have always done our best to approximate to the standard of living of the two countries to which our people emigrate, that is England and America, and have been making a desperate effort to increase our standard of living in every possible way, while at the same time the income of the agricultural population has never increased to the extent necessary in order to justify it.  We have to face that very serious position. The cost of our social services has gone up.  The cost of our governmental services has increased, and at the same time we have lagged in production. That raises immediately the question of the future of agriculture in this country.  I do suggest that, for the purposes of this Estimate, there should be some definite conclusion reached by the Minister&mdash;which I am sure he can reach&mdash;as to what is the future market of this country, as to whether we can strive towards greater production, and whether it would be usefully absorbed. I had hopes&mdash;on reading the British <Col N="1889" /> Medical Association's suggestion that they needed 80 per cent. more butter and 40 per cent. more eggs in England, and that the farmers who attended the conference had stated they could not possibly supply them from native sources&mdash;that there was a larger market; that with scientific methods of lowering our cost of production we could provide far more foodstuffs both for our own people and for the English; and that, particularly in view of the international situation, if we could begin to cut in on the New Zealand and Danish farmer, the British Government would do nothing to stop us.  In fact it would be to their immense strategic advantage to help us.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he founded the Agricultural Commission to inquire into methods of increasing agricultural production, but I hope he will be able to go further and make a general statement to the public that for the present anyway he can envisage an increased production of 15 per cent. or 20 per cent. with perfect safety to the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  He should not leave some of the farmers in the country wondering whether it is worth while increasing production.  Let us have some interim statement from the Minister&mdash;if possible when he is replying&mdash;that there is definitely room for a very large increase in certain directions.  I myself think that we need two plans in connection with agriculture. We need an immediate plan and a long-term plan.  In connection with the immediate plan, to my mind the first and most important thing is for the Minister to ascertain definitely the position with regard to the credit-worthiness of the farmers of this country. We cannot go on in this House debating for the next 12 months whether the farmers are bankrupt or whether the farmers are not bankrupt. The question must be decided finally.  I asked the Minister whether I could suggest this to him tactfully, and he said that I could.  I do suggest that if the figures were made available to the Banking Commission for 1934, 1935 and 1936 on the credit position in the country, it would be possible for the <Col N="1890" /> Government in the course of the next three months to find out what is the position with regard to credit.  I do not believe it is anything like as bad as has been indicated by members of the Opposition.  On the other hand, I know very well it is not nearly so good as has been indicated sometimes by members of the Party to which I belong.  I myself have asked questions of ordinary farmers over and over again about this position, and I should like to give an indication to the House on the matter so that they may see how difficult it would be for the Minister to ascertain the credit position of the farmers.  For example, in places like South Roscommon I have questioned the farmers&mdash; perhaps 30 or 40 of them in a group&mdash;on this matter, and they said that about 10 per cent. of the farmers in their area are in the position that they have absolutely no money to purchase the necessities for their production, and no money with which to restore the stock which they had lost through having had to sell stock during the economic war.  In another place I asked a very prominent agricultural instructor, who must be nameless, and he tole me that about 50 per cent. of the farmers are in that position.  To my mind it is a very difficult thing to ascertain, because there are two kinds of credit-worthiness.  There is the type of credit-worthiness which will enable the farmer to conduct his production as it was in previous years, and there is the type of credit-worthiness which will enable him to take advantage of expansion, to go ahead and produce more, and find a market for that produce. My principal reaction to this debate is that this question must be settled, and I suggest that the Government should come out with a statement as to what they think is the position with regard to credit.</P>
    <P>The next question to decide as rapidly as possible is what type of credit is needed by the farmers.  To my mind, it is not enough simply to leave it to the Agricultural Commission to examine over a period of months and months, perhaps years, and to go into the long term question of how to <Col N="1891" /> provide credit suitable for agriculture. We ought at least to have a clear explanation to the effect that certain kinds of credit will not be made available because they would not produce the effect that was desired; in other words, that the plan of the farmers who follow the Farmers' Federation, and the farmers who follow some members of the Opposition&mdash;the plan of extending large loans in money to farmers for repayment over a stated period&mdash;is discountenanced, on the grounds that it might result in inflation of prices, followed by a decrease later on.  All the members of this House will have read something of what is called &ldquo;pump priming&rdquo; in the United States, and if they read the American agricultural magazines, as I do on occasions, they will find hardly an economist in America who will approve of everything President Roosevelt did in the way of credit expansion because, they said, it did not have the effect he desired, and that the pouring out of money into a community which had been terribly damaged by economic adversity, without having regard to the circumstances, is most dangerous.  In this country we would have immediate reactions to inflation, immediate reactions in the cattle market to the sudden purchase of stock and the sudden disposal of them afterwards.  It is a matter which requires the very gravest consideration. There are other kinds of credits which could be made available, credits in kind, which could be guaranteed to produce results; that is to say, the Minister might consider the expansion of things like subsidies for manures, subsidies for lime, and subsidies for the various poultry schemes carried out by the Government.  That form of credit is a thing about which there possibly could be some early decision but, at least, I claim from listening to the debate that within three or four months of this date there must be some definite pronouncement as to the provision of credit in this country in regard to agriculture.  There is no doubt that Deputies are more in contact with people who are in distress than with people who are not in distress and it is very easy to exaggerate <Col N="1892" /> the position, but I claim the position must be clarified in the course of the next few months.</P>
    <P>As far as the long-term plan is concerned, Deputy Hughes demanded a complete revolution in the technique of farming, and I agree with him.  I see no other way of providing for all social services or preventing our dead-weight debt increasing or bringing about the position which this country should have, in my opinion, of being a country which pays for itself and which never indulges in the kind of inflation that has nearly ruined the Balkan countries, has nearly ruined France and which has brought Germany to the position of having a very low standard of living.  If we are to have that satisfactory position, we have got to increase our agricultural production. If there is to be a change in the technique of farming, then we shall have to bring about an entire change in the methods of agricultural production. I have the highest praise for our agricultural instructors, but if we are to have that change in the technique of farming, it will be necessary for us to have 20 times the present number of agricultural instructors. We shall have to embark upon a rural education which has never yet been conceived.  If the members of the Opposition and the members of the Government Party advocate this instruction, and if they seriously believe in it, sacrifices will have to be made by the rest of the community in order to provide the cost of that instruction.</P>
    <P>I was speaking to an agricultural instructor the other day, a man who works from morning to night, during his office hours and after them, to help the farmers, who gives classes everywhere, who gives advice to the farmers at the market, and who goes to visit them in their houses, a man who works absolutely full time in his efforts to improve the condition of the agriculturist. I asked him: &ldquo;If you take the best-run type of farm in your county, how many farms out of ten do you know that would approximate to that best type of farm in efficiency of production and in the use of the most <Col N="1893" /> modern methods,&rdquo; and the answer was: &ldquo;Barely one in ten.&rdquo;  That is, I presume, what Deputy Hughes had in mind when he advocated a change in the technique of farming.  Up to now we never had an opportunity of carrying out such a scheme.  There has never been that condition of political stability under which such an attempt would have been possible.  The last Government had to contend with the reactions of the civil war, and this Government had to carry on an economic war up to quite recent times.</P>
    <P>I myself think that one of the most serious questions to consider is the fact that we are the only country in the world that can produce a large amount of agricultural produce, but who are adopting neither the plan of the small farm countries who carry out co-operation to the last possible degree, nor the plan of the other type of agricultural countries where they are changing small farms into big farms.  That is one thing we have to consider in the course of the next couple of years.  We are still carrying on land division.  It was carried on by the last Government and it is being continued by this Government. It is a policy which has a democratic tradition.  It is a policy which very few would suggest should be changed, but yet we are the only country who are attempting to compete in the world's market with similar small farm countries who have adopted a high degree of co-operation in distribution and marketing.  Equally we do not follow the methods of those countries where the small farms are being grouped together to make large farms and where costs are being reduced in that way.  I submit that if the Government cut 10 per cent. off our tariffs, and reduced the cost of living of the farmer in that way, if the Government were to reduce the taxes on agricultural implements and abolish the quota for fertilisers, remembering that the total amount expended on fertilisers is only about 3 per cent. of the farmers' total expenses; and if you carried out a number of other suggestions for reducing the cost of production, you would never get down to the basis on which you could compete with the Danes and the New Zealanders on <Col N="1894" /> the world market so long as our methods of farming are so fundamentally different from those carried on in Denmark and in New Zealand.  You cannot get away from the fact that no matter how you reduce the cost to the farmers by the methods suggested here, that the fundamental costs represent only a small proportion of the profits compared with those of the farmers in Denmark and New Zealand who have gathered unto themselves the whole processing and the whole marketing of their produce.  That is the suggestion we have to consider.</P>
    <P>If Deputies opposite work out the result of reducing the cost of production in this country by 10 per cent. and regard that as a saving; if they go on to press for a measure of derating for agricultural land and add the relatively small sum which that will bring by way of relief to our farmers, they will still find that if we are to keep people on the land and if we are to compete with the people of New Zealand and Denmark on our principal market, we shall have to co-operate with our farmers in a way that has so far never been seriously attempted.  There is no alternative to that.  I defy anybody who has studied the economy of agriculture, simply looking at it as a matter of the market price of produce and the proportion taken by the farmer for himself, to deny that the future of this country must lie either in the development of slow persistent co-operation amongst the farmers or else in the grouping of small farms into big farms, a thing which is not politically desirable and which is not politically likely to happen.  I am not saying anything original.  Heaven knows it has been said often enough. Deputy Hughes suggested quite rightly that the Government should enlist the services of a number of experts, and I am sure the first thing they will say is that up to a certain point you can reduce your costs, but that you will still approximate to the position in which you will have to compete with those people who have cut their costs by co-operation and by the breaking up of small farms.  If anybody can deny that, I should like to hear him put forward his views in this House.  As I <Col N="1895" /> say I am not a farmer.  I am merely a person who has listened to farmers, who has read a great deal about the subject and who has been in a position to make a comparison of the figures available in the different countries.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, might I suggest that neither this Government nor the last Government could have possibly taken up the idea of instilling belief in this scheme into the farmers?  During the economic war and the civil war it would have been utterly impossible to attempt to do so.  I suggest that the adoption of this long-term plan is absolutely inevitable in future. Deputy Dillon made a number of very valuable suggestions in the course of a very long speech, but I would say that valuable as these suggestions are, the farmers of the country will never reach that condition of prosperity which we all desire for them unless they make up their minds to practice that co-operation in distribution and in marketing which has been the basis of the success of agriculture in other countries.  I feel that so intensely that I am afraid I have repeated myself; but the House will doubtless forgive me because I have not often had an opportunity to speak about it.</P>
    <P>There is one more question which was alluded to by Deputy Mulcahy in the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce. He made the very interesting statement that the mere improvement of agricultural production in this country, the mere increase of the farmer's prosperity, would not of itself very largely increase the number of people employed on the land on agriculture and, therefore, there was great need for soundly developed industries.  That is one of the hardest facts of all that this House has to face, that in those countries whose prosperity has greatly increased in the past few years, who have not had any of the serious crises which have taken place from time to time, like Sweden, Holland, etc., there has been a progressive decrease of employment on the land, while the prosperity of the people on the land increased.  That is the sad position which has to be faced&mdash;that the mere <Col N="1896" /> increase of agricultural production would not increase the number of people gainfully and permanently employed as agricultural labourers or otherwise working on farms to any very great degree.  One fact which has to be faced is that there is no example in Europe which can be given that it will actually help definitely to increase employment.  We can increase employment to a considerable extent; I am not making any suggestion to the contrary. We might employ thousands more than we do to-day, but that it would solve the question of employing people on the land permanently is not the case, as can be seen if figures are examined for countries which have greatly improved agricultural production.</P>
    <P>I think I am right in saying that Denmark is the only country where the number of people who work on the land has not decreased in the past 20 years. But the number of agricultural labourers in that country actually has decreased in spite of the enormous increase in production.  The question we have to ask ourselves is: what are these people going to do?  The answer is, that we can be quite certain, if things work out here the way they have in other countries which have relatively little unemployment, they will be employed in carrying out the kind of services the farmers will be able to pay for when they are more prosperous. Some of them will be employed in providing agricultural machinery and providing the farmers with goods and services that they were never able to purchase before.  That is the answer, and that is what happened in countries which, relatively speaking, are prosperous. But there is no use in hoping that a large increase in agricultural production would have the direct effect of employing more people on the land.</P>
    <P>I should like to close what I have to say by pointing out that I am not in any way trying to minimise the danger of the position or to make excuses for having carried out the economic war. That was national policy.  We achieved the solution of the greatest part of our difficulties.  We ended a great part of the conflict with England <Col N="1897" /> by so doing.  We deliberately went out to ask a certain part of the agricultural population of this country to undertake sacrifices for the sake of the country.  They undertook these sacrifices. They were offered a chance, after having a year of sacrifices, to say that they did not want it; but they went on and undertook the sacrifices. The result has been that we have obtained a remission of £88,000,000 of debt, and we have concluded what has been an enormous cost financially to this country&mdash;the establishing of our national position.</P>
    <P>As to the figures I gave of production, from 1900 to 1931, that lack of increase was due almost entirely to the fact that we had a national conflict in this country, and the ending of that conflict, as far as this part of the country is concerned, is beyond financial measure, because it will result in our being able to get down to the realities of life in this country in a way we could never do before.  I am not attempting in saying this in any way to minimise the sacrifices we imposed on the farmers.  I am saying that there are a number of Deputies on both sides of this House who have been thinking instinctively of agricultural production, whether they mentioned it or not, as it has been from 1900 to the present day.  If we think of the matter as a whole, and of the great problem before the country, that will lead us, to my mind, to the most useful suggestions for improving the position. With that, and an exhortation to the Minister to let us have some fundamental answer about the position of credit, I will close my remarks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrookeWBrasier" hpid="Mr. Brasier Mr. Brasier">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brasier</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to a number of Deputies commenting on the absence from the Government Front Bench of members of the Government except the Minister for Agriculture.  That may be an indication that they are willing to let him carry on the greatest work this country can undertake, the rehabilitation of agriculture, or that they have such absolute control over the policy of that Department that they are satisfied to say what they have to say in another place.  There is one thing <Col N="1898" /> certain, however, either agriculture will have to be rehabilitated from the effects of the economic war, which, as the last speaker said, was carried out as a national policy, and, therefore, the country is bound to contribute towards the relief of agriculture, or at any rate you will have to stop revolutionary tactics with regard to agriculture and let the farmer know where he stands so that he can get to work. That is the position that the farmer is demanding.  The farmers ask to be let alone, and allowed to carry on the traditions of agriculture in which they have been educated, as to a certain extent they were allowed to do in the past, when they had uninterrupted markets and neither quotas nor anything else were allowed to interfere with their export of products from this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was interested in listening to the Minister refer to the value of cow testing. I do not think that anything he said on that could be contradicted. There can be no question as to the value of cow testing, as the increase of milk production is one of the most important assets to this country.  I think we must pay a tribute to the Dairy Shorthorn Breeders' Association who have done so much to foster and develop that, as well as to foster the breeding of the dairy shorthorn cow. It must be a matter of concern to the Minister that as the net production of our dairy stock has been at least doubled, if not increased still further, that there is a continual cry for relief from the very class of people we are discussing&mdash;the dairy farmers.  The Secretary of the Dairy Shorthorn Breeders' Association, at the meeting on Saturday of the Cork County Committee of Agriculture, proposed a motion that the price of milk should be increased to 7d. in the summer and 9d. in the winter.  If they have already increased the production of dairy stock, there must be some very strong reason for prominent and intelligent farmers asking continually for an increase in the price of milk.  You certainly have increased the price for farmers in the liberties of our large towns so far as the sale of new milk is concerned, and it is only a natural <Col N="1899" /> expectation on the part of the dairy farmers all over the country that they should at least get a guaranteed price to the extent I have mentioned.  That, naturally, must come from some portion of the State, and as many of them have suffered during the last five years from the activities and policy of the present Government, there is an obligation on the Government, as representing the majority of the people, to adopt such measures as will give those farmers some form of relief, or otherwise leave them alone and let them develop and work out their own salvation, whether that means that they will be able to carry on or not.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this question.  Some years ago I carried on a campaign in the Cork County Committee of Agriculture for the provision of premiums for other classes of bulls besides dairy Shorthorn bulls, because, as I have already pointed out, the development of the milk breeds of cattle, while a very desirable thing, will eventually injure our greatest asset, and that is our store cattle trade.  The brains of all the cattle associations are devoted to exporting our cattle and, undoubtedly, they have exported a very considerable number of our most valuable heifers.  I think I can say that that has had the effect of depleting very considerably our dairy stocks. Those heifers, probably, would be the best product of our farmers, and yet the farmers had to sell them in a time of great national stress and national emergency.  Undoubtedly, that was a great loss to the farming industry generally.  There is no question at all about it, our production from dairy stocks would be very much increased, but I think that there ought to be a cross with the Hereford and Polled Angus, because continuous breeding, even from the best dairy shorthorns, would result in ferior strains.  There should be a bull of the beef breed with a dairy bull in every area, and the mixture with the Hereford and Polled Angus breeds would tend to increase the value of our export of store cattle from this country and, needless to say, increase the price.</P>
    <P>Nobody, I think, will say that the <Col N="1900" /> product of the ordinary dairy shorthorn store is fetching the very best price on the English market, by any means.  It is only when you export the beef breeds that you get the value that will add materially to the wealth coming into this country.  The position of the dairy shorthorn cattle is that these cattle constitute a foundation stock, but, on the other hand the development of our store cattle is very important, and would be a very important national asset as well as being an item of export that would be even much larger than our butter export trade.  It is a question as to whether or not we are doing the very best with our milk, and whether we might not do better to feed new milk for a more prolonged period to our calves, and in that way increase their value in the quickest manner possible and turn them out so as to be fit for export at a much earlier period than is the case at present.  I have seen calves reared in that way and turned out, and there is an enormous increase in value of calves reared in that way over calves reared in the ordinary way, on separated or skim-milk, that calves are reared on in this country.  I suggest that that is an aspect of the matter that it would pay farmers to consider.</P>
    <P>There is also an important factor with regard to our manures.  The Minister has given a very small subsidy on manures.  That subsidy is supposed to benefit the small farmer, but I do not think very much benefit is given to him.  However, anything that will increase the value or the use of these manures is a thing to be encouraged by the Minister, and certainly the giving of a subsidy such as is given in England will tend to encourage the use of manures amongest our farmers, and particularly our small farmers.  The aullusion has been made here from time to time to a former Minister for Agriculture as the &ldquo;Minister for Grass.&rdquo;  That former Minister for Agriculture in this House had a reputation that was worldwide, and he was applauded for his work, wherever his name was known, all over the world.  I think that the time has come to realise that the small farmers, while tilling a portion of their land, could make the portion of land <Col N="1901" /> they have under grass just as productive if that land were top-dressed with artificial manures; and the Minister can help to increase the use of artificial manures in the manner I have stated. As a matter of fact, the leader of the Opposition has referred to the fact that it would pay, and even be a national asset, if these manures were given to the farmers for nothing. Whether or not the Minister can afford to do that is another matter, but I certainly believe that it would be a case for the Minister's consideration to give an increased subsidy.  I see that he has increased the amount available, but at the same time I do not think that is nearly enough, considering the importance of the matter and the importance that other countris, such as England, attach to this question.</P>
    <P>Now, the consumption of feeding stuffs that are grown on the land here is a very important factor, and I am glad to see that the seed-testing station at Ballinacurra, carried on by Messrs.  Bennett, is developing and that their activities are being extended, and that at any rate we are increasing the production of the pure type of seed that is being developed there.  I must agree, however, with Deputy McGovern in his reference to the obstruction of the Department in connection with the importation of Scotch seed oats.  That is a vital necessity for this country, because no matter how careful a farmer may be, the continual growth of one particular type of speed oats will bring about deterioration, and it must be well known to the Minister and to the Department that a change is necessary and that the importation of seed oats is a very urgent matter.  Accordingly, I would ask the Minister to take off the restriction on the importation of seed oats altogether.</P>
    <P>Now, I should like to mention the horse-breeding industry.  The horse-breeding industry is vital to this country, and the export of some of our most valuable mares, undoubtedly, has deprived us of a foundation stock, and our county committee of agriculture at the moment has under consideration how best to devise a scheme, which will be put before the Minister in due <Col N="1902" /> course, for keeping in this country our most valuable mares in order that the breeding of first-class hunters will be maintained.  As matter of fact, I think the Minister will be asked to receive a deputation on that matter before very long.  It is one of the most important industries in this country from the point of view of bringing money into this country.  Apart from the actual value of the animals themselves, a great number of visitors come to the country for hunting, and the difficulty of providing horses at the present moment is very great.  A very considerable amount of employment is given in that connection, and I think it is hardly necessary for me to emphasise the importance of availing of every possible asset that would help the agricultural industry at a time of its most trying need.</P>
    <P>I see that, in his Estimate, the Minister has a sum of £750, for the Bloodstock Breeders' Association of Ireland.  I agree that that is a step in the right direction but I do not think it is enough in view of our magnificent successes at the recent Grand National &mdash;both the English Grand National and the Irish-bred horses and Irish-trained horses had such a wonderful success. Therefore, I think that this is a very important matter, and I hope that the Minister will contemplate further increases and further work in connection with that matter.</P>
    <P>Certain references were made by Deputies to the horticultural side of the Department's work.  There is no question at all about it, that is a side of the Department's work that can be developed.  For instance, a company, on a site adjoining my own place, is doing very extensive work of that description; they have some 50 acres of apples and some seven acres under glass, where tomatoes, and so on, are grown.  In fact, every form of horticultural production, such as tomatoes, rhubarb and onions by the acre, are grown, and is being carried on there on a very extensive scale.  I think that that side of the Department's work could be developed, and I would respectfully suggest that very little attention has been paid in the past to <Col N="1903" /> that matter.  While I admit that a certain amount of protection has been given to horticultural production, I think that efforts should be made to spread the knowledge of that class of work around among the smaller farmers of the country.  The agricultural labourers are not taking it up with the enthusiasm I should like to see.  If more instructors were appointed, I believe it would be taken up, and its advantages more readily availed of.</P>
    <P>Derating has been discussed here and, in that connection, there is a point to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention.  An allowance is made in respect of men employed on the farm, and I suggest&mdash;it has been put to me by a great number of farmers&mdash; that an allowance should also be made for women who are engaged whole-time in agricultural work.  I think it only equitable that that matter should be attended to.  With regard to derating, when it is remembered that the greater portion of the expenses of the public services falls on one section of the community, and that a much larger section, and probably a much wealthier section, escape with a very slight amount, surely it is a matter for reform.  Now that roads and every other form of expenditure by local authorities are availed of by those who are non-agriculturists, and pay little or nothing to upkeep, and rating has been divested of its local character and extended more and more to larger areas, the time has come when the expenses in these respects should be borne by the whole community, and not by an improverished section who have now to bear a greatly increased burden of rates which their ancestors had not to bear, and they themselves had not to bear a decade ago.</P>
    <P>Rates are increasing, and I expect that they will continue to increase. There is an insistent demand for immediate relief, and I do not think that any more immediate relief can be given than to release the farmer from the tyranny of the demand note.  The demand note is the one thing that <Col N="1904" /> strikes him immediately.  It has to be collected, and it will be collected by taking his last cow and his last horse, and if relief in that direction is not given, I say emphatically that his burdens will become greater and greater.  There is an insistent demand from non-agriculturists for an extension of local services, and there is sympathy on the part of the Local Government Department for this demand, but it is inequitable that the ordinary agriculturist, who does not avail of these services and who perhaps avails himself only of purely local advantages, such as by-roads, should have to bear the whole burden, often with a very high poor law valuation.</P>
    <P>Many cures have been suggested by the non-agriculturist.  I often hear agriculture discussed by the non-agriculturist&mdash;more often than by the agriculturist&mdash;and what he does not know about agriculture is not worth knowing, in his own estimation.  The farmer who perhaps may not be so glib of tongue, who may not have such well-arranged phraseology as the non-agriculturist, can answer only very badly.  His pocket is the only thing that can answer.  My suggestion to the Minister is that the time has come to give that relief which is the demand of the agricultural population and of those who cannot continue to bear the ever increasing burden of local services.</P>
    <P>Reference has also been made to agricultural credit.  If a farmer is not able to avail of the national asset that is in the land, through lack of credit, through lack of the necessary capital, surely it is not asking the State too much to provide the facilities to enable him to restock his land which was denuded of stock during the last five or six years.  Rates had to be paid and land annuities had to be paid in those years.  They had to be paid because the cattle were taken, whether they liked it or not, and they were paid in full.  They were collected by every means possible and lands were denuded of stock, which, ten years ago, were thriving agricultural holdings with prosperous families living on them. National policy, as I say, denuded the farmer's land of stock and some <Col N="1905" /> national effort must be made to rehabilitate him and to provide him with facilities for carrying on.  Otherwise, what is well known as a national asset will lie idle and unavailed of.</P>
    <P>In the parish in which I live, there are a considerable number of derelict farms which cannot be used, but there is a much bigger area of unstocked lands whose owners are only too glad to try to let them to their neighbours and who are trying by every means in their power to till them without the aid of farmyard manure which should be provided by well-stocked lands. Unless these facilities are provided, unless the farmer is able to purchase stock to carry on farming in an economic manner, there is a loss to himself and to the State, and a still greater loss to the local authority.  If his rates are not paid, his neighbours have to pay them for him; if the land annuity is not paid, the local authority has to make up the difference&mdash;the Minister has safeguarded himself in that respect&mdash;and, therefore, there is an implied duty on the State to furnish the means of carrying on agricultural production by every means in their power, even if there is a certain risk in it.  The heifer scheme did a certain amount of good in a small way and if it could be developed to a greater degree, where you insisted on the farmer putting stock on the land, it might help, but I say, most emphatically, that if the lands are left unstocked, if these people are left without the means of carrying on, the State is losing and the farming population are losing as well.  If we are not to try to bring about some change in the present position, it would be better for the Minister to confess his failure, to confess that he is not able to carry on and to let some other Party come in who will carry on.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture ought to be the strongest man on the Government Front Bench; he ought to fight&mdash; as the Minister for Industry and Commerce has fought&mdash;for his particular Department; he ought to demand those services and those remedies for the people who were in the front-line trenches, who had to fight bitterly and hard for them, and who perhaps <Col N="1906" /> through lack of organisation&mdash;failed to secure for themselves the rights which were theirs and for which their fathers fought.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The development of our agriculture is, and ought to be, the most important item to be discussed in this House.  There is one particular matter I would like to touch upon before going into the Estimate proper, and that is, the statements that have been made here both by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Brasier in connection with the Minister for Agriculture.  Now, as a member of several agricultural organisations, it has been my part on various occasions to seek interviews with the Minister, and I can say that I have found him the most approachable Minister in the Executive Council&mdash;and that is saying a lot.  On any occasion that any farmer came here with a grievance, or with a problem to be solved, the Minister was at his disposal. As for his ability, the Minister who has successfully carried the farmers of this country, by his agricultural policy, through the economic war has in that fact a tribute to his ability that nobody can deny.  When I hear comments made here by hobby-farmers and crank-farmers of all descriptions as to the ability of that Minister to carry on, or as to the manner in which he has carried on, I have to say: &ldquo;Thank God, none of those Deputies were in his position through that crisis&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In 1931 there were 1,222,000 milch cows in this country; in 1938, that number was 1,281,000&mdash;an increase of approximately 60,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard comments as to the number of heifers that had to be exported.  There is the answer: despite Roscrea and all that we did to it into the bargain, there was that increase in milch cows.  The trouble I see in regard to the live-stock industry in particular is this.  The Minister for Agriculture, in a statement here in this House a short time after this <Col N="1907" /> Government came into office, said as follows: &ldquo;If the administration of live-stock breeding is carried on in the manner in which it has been administered for the six years previously, you may get very fine looking cattle in this country, but it will be practically impossible to get a decent milch cow.&rdquo; That statement has been proved up to the hilt.  You have more cows, but less milk and less butter.  This fad of a dual-purpose animal should be played out.  Where you have live-stock inspectors licensing bulls throughout the country and examining those bulls, not on their milk record but on their appearance and on their condition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Whilst you have that condition of affairs, you are bound to have inferior milking cattle year by year.  Our problem is that sufficient attention has not been paid to the milking strain from which the bulls come.  Though Deputy Brasier passed a very nice remark when he said that every farmer who had a premium bull should have three of them&mdash;a Hereford, an Aberdeen Angus and some kind of a milking bull&mdash;how he was going to manage that, I do not know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon also made an attack on the wheat scheme.  The farmers of this country have proved their approval of the wheat policy, for year by year the acreage under wheat is increasing, despite all Deputy Dillon's attacks on it.  Each year the acreage has gone up, and I am personally very glad to see it.  Despite all that Deputy Dillon says, I think that in the event of a European war we would be in a very bad position indeed if we had not native wheat of our own to feed our people.  My only regret is that the acreage has not gone up more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I hear statements made here about increased production being one of the cures for our agricultural troubles, and loans for farmers being another, I say that neither of them <Col N="1908" /> will be a cure so long as prices are roughly around the 1914 level and the overhead charges and costs of production remain increased, doubled and trebled, compared with what they were in 1914.  And that is the actual position.  You are not going to cure it by giving the farmer a loan which will be gone and cannot be repaid, nor by making him produce more at a loss. There will have to be increased prices for agricultural produce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Or lower overheads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>And lower overheads. Until you have some sanity here in this House where it is most needed, until you have some definite step taken here to cut off the vicious system that was brought in here from the old British Government time with regard to the Civil Service and things of that description, you are not going to have agriculture here worked on any kind of sound basis.  What hope has agriculture, the one producing industry in this country, of finding the necessary money?  What hope is there of finding it, and it must all, in the final phase, come from agriculture, and it cannot come from agriculture.  It cannot be found. Where you have farmers drawing 1914 prices and paying three times what they had to pay in 1914&mdash;both in overhead charges and in cost of production&mdash;you cannot do it.  Until that is realised in the first instance, there is no use in this House or any commission trying to find a cure that is not there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You had a position in regard to beet.  All I have to say in regard to that position is that so long as the system of setting up of committees and commissions composed of &ldquo;hobby&rdquo; farmers and &ldquo;book&rdquo; farmers to fix the price of agricultural produce in this country, is carried on, so long will you have agricultural production declining year by year and day by day.  That is what is wrong. Gentlemen with £400, £500, £900 or £1,000 a year are formed into a committee and told to say what is the proper price a farmer should get for his beet.  Five or six highly-skilled, well-trained solicitors and engineers <Col N="1909" /> sit on one side while four or five farmers make their case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>They pay for all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am more than anxious to see the beet industry in this country carried on and increased but I, for one, am very nervous as to what the position in regard to the beet industry is going to be after this year.  In my opinion, that tribunal, or whatever crazy name was put on them, have killed the beet industry in this country.</P>
      <P>Then there is the position with regard to credit.  If any Deputy will make the comparison between the freedom with which industrial credit is forthcoming as compared with agricultural credit, he will wonder.  Anybody that proposes to set up any kind of industry and employ half a dozen men can walk into the Industrial Credit Corporation and draw from £5,000 to £25,000 without any bother at all, but if an unfortunate farmer happens to go looking for it, they nearly go back to what he did with the potatoes that he grew in 1914. There is also an enormous difference in the interest charged to those industrial concerns for credit as compared with the interest charged, even by the Agricultural Credit Corporation, to farmers&mdash;an enormous difference.  If money can be got at so cheap a rate for industrial credit in this country, surely the same rate should prevail in regard to agricultural credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question that we have got to consider is how to cure the present position. There is very little use in talking of increased production, because nine-tenths of the agricultural produce that is exported has to be subsidised going out.  There is a subsidy on butter, a subsidy on practically everything that is exported.  Whether we like it or not, we will have to increase the prices of our agricultural produce at home.  It is all very well to talk of the position of the farmers to-day as compared with 1914.  The position of the farmers has completely changed. I remember in 1914, 1913 and years earlier than that, when farmers coming home in the evening were very glad to sit down to tea and dry bread. <Col N="1910" /> Those days are gone, and thank God for it.  The farmer to-day, and the farmer's family, consider that they are entitled to as decent a livelihood as any industrialist or anybody living in the towns or cities.  If this country cannot afford as decent a livelihood for the only producers of wealth in the country, then it is very little use in looking elsewhere for it.</P>
    <P>I have commented here previously on the enormous difference between the position of the agricultural worker and the worker in the town and city. It is most unfair to give only 5d. or 6d. an hour to the agricultural worker when his brother who goes into the beet factory gets 1/- an hour.  The worker in a factory gets his half-day on Saturday and works a 48-hour week, but the unfortunate agricultural labourer has to be there to milk the cows in Sunday morning and Sunday evening as well as the rest of the week. So long as you have that wide differentiation between the position of the rural community on the one hand and the city and town people on the other, so long will you have the flight from the land, which has been deplored from all sides of the House.  There will have to be both a levelling up and a livelling down.  There will have to be both.  If you are going to cure or make any improvement in the position of agriculture in this country you will have to tackle that problem also.  The people of the towns and cities will have to definitely make up their minds that they will have to pay more for their sugar, bread, eggs and bacon, and that they will also have to bear some portion of the overhead burdens that are thrown on the farmers of the present day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite prepared to admit this much to Deputy Belton&mdash; that Deputy Bennett's statement was true.  I expect to see all our farmers prosperous, and very prosperous, during the next twelve months.  So long as John Bull and Hitler are both agreed on preparing munitions to kill one another, we will profit by that. <Col N="1911" /> Prices of agricultural produce will go up.  As a matter of fact, if Hitler should fire a shell it would raise the price of cattle £4 a head.  But you are then going to have the aftermath, the aftermath that you had after the Great War.</P>
      <P>I saw in one of the English papers to-day a boast that they had taken 385,000 more people into employment in England during the past three months.  They probably have.  The reactions of that are telling here in the price of our agricultural produce that we export, as long as we can export it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>They have been doing very badly under Article 10 of the Treaty that the Deputy agreed to, as well as under a number of other little articles which put the civil servants behind a barbed wire entanglement.  It put them in the position of being able to say: &ldquo;I do not give a hang how the general body of the people of the country are going to carry on; my salary is safe and secure.&rdquo;  We had Article X which enabled a man of 45 years of age down in Cork to walk out on a pension of £500 a year.  The farming community did not do well under that kind of business.  What is troubling the farming community is the burden of their overhead charges.  This is not a wealthy country like England.  All the money required here has to be got out of the sweat of the farmer and of the farmer's labourer with his 27/- a week.  The farmers of the country have carried on far longer under that burden than I had hoped they would.  That <Col N="1912" /> position of affairs has got to go.  Are the farmers to be asked to provide roads for motorists costing £2,000 and £4,000 a mile to construct?  I say that position has got to go, and the sooner that all Parties realise that the better.</P>

When I sat on the benches opposite in 1927 and 1928, I made precisely the same statements that I have made them this evening, and have made them every year since.  But still this thing has gone on.  A man cannot find a £5 note in his pocket when he has only a £1 note in it.  The farmers of this country, and the agricultural community in general, cannot any longer afford to keep up in prosperity and happiness the cargoes of drones placed on their backs from 1922 on.  That has got to end.  The cure for the future that Deputy Belton is looking for is this: that the overhead charges on agriculture will have to come down, and that the people in the towns and cities must be prepared to pay for their rasher and their egg.</P>

      <P>There is one other matter I want to refer to, and that is the question of land reclamation.  When a comparison is made with 1914 we find that there is very little of this work being done through the country to-day. The cost is high.  If it does not pay the farmer he will not do it.  He is not going to do anything that will not pay.  There is no use in saying that the farmer is going to continue to make sacrifices in the national interest.  He is not going to do that any more.  It is time that the other fellow made some sacrifices.  What I suggest is that it might be wise to consider the introduction of a scheme by which those who are on the dole might be employed on land reclamation work, the amount of the dole to be added to the wages they receive from the farmer. I think that this dole system is a bad one.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brasier referred to the difficulties that farmers had in importing seed oats.  I did not hear of any farmer in the County Cork who found any difficulty in doing that.  The farmer wrote to the Department, and a merchant in his nearest town got authority to import for him.  With regard to Deputy Dillon's exaggerated statements, I want to say that in my opinion his references to the Minister for Agriculture cannot be described as being other than scandalous.  It would be God help the country if it gave Deputy Dillon the opportunity of trying out his plan, the plan that he outlined on the Land Commission Vote last week.  He talked of community farming, of small farmers coming together, pooling their resources and providing work for all. I wonder what would happen if some of them were to lie down.  Would they be all lying down together?  Who would work the farms?  Who would divide the profits?  That is Deputy Dillon's cure.  That is what he is going to do when he becomes Minister for Agriculture.  He is going to have community farming.  All the small farmers are to come together and work a day with pay all round.  Of with Mick, with pay all round.  Of course, they will all work hard.  I would like to see the plan tried.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1914" /> If Deputy Dillon has any land I suggest that he should try it there first.  We had any amount of cures of that description from Deputy Dillon, who does not want wheat, does not want beet, or anything that would help to provide a home market for farmers.  That is the only market in which the price can be controlled.  It is the only market in which farmers can hope to get a price.  It must be admitted on all sides that whatever agricultural produce is exported has to be sold at the world price, and I respectfully suggest that we cannot hope to complete at world prices with ranching countries.</P>

      <P>As I consider this to be the most important Vote that comes before the House, I was glad to hear some Government Deputies admitting that they are turning our way, and coming to realise that the agricultural industry is the most important one we have.  They are begining to realise that the farmers are in a desperate position.  Roughly 50 per cent. of our population get a living out of farming. For a number of years past the position has been desperate.  Farming is in a bad way owing to the world fall in agricultural prices, and still more to domestic troubles of our own in this country for the past five or six years. The result has been a big flight from the land to the towns and cities and to Great Britain to seek industrial employment.  The most serious problem to be faced is the growing hopelessness and want of confidence in the future of farming as a means of living.  The farmers' children are flying from the land because they see no prospect before them.  They know the hardships that their fathers and mothers are enduring.  I am glad that the Government are, at last, beginning to realise the position.  Deputy Childers admitted that that position was the effect of a policy that had been deliberately imposed on the farmers.  The economic war had brought destruction on farmers.  That was the admission of a prominent member of the Government Party, that they deliberately imposed the economic war as part of a policy to destroy the farmers.  The economic war is over for the past 12 months.  Why has the Government not done something since <Col N="1916" /> then to remedy the wrong that was done?</P>
      <P>If you take the price of cattle in the Dublin market last week, and the price in the same week in 1914, the average was somewhat more in 1914 than it is now.  Taking the average price for sheep in the Dublin market last week, and the average price in 1914, the price then was bigger.  That proves that their income from cattle and sheep is less than it was in 1914. The cost of production has gone up 200 per cent. in some cases.  Rates have gone up 200 per cent. in some cases, and the labour farmers employ has gone up over 100 per cent., and justly so, because the men could not live otherwise.  The cost of feeding stuffs has gone up 50 per cent.  The cost of everything the farmer has to buy has gone up.  In 1914 a mowing machine could be bought for ten guineas, but it costs £25 to-day.  The ordinary plough could be bought for £4 5s. in 1914, but it costs £8 to-day. The cost of horses, carts, harness, has gone up 100 per cent.  Along with the increased cost of production the farmer has to face an increased cost of living. The cost of boots, shoes and clothing has gone up by 100 per cent.&mdash;in other words, a farmer has to sell twice as many cattle and sheep to buy a plough now as he had in 1914.  Therefore I maintain that the position of farmers could not be otherwise than going down and down.  That is due partly to world production and low prices, but it was aggravated here by the economic war, which a Government Deputy farmers.  It is the duty of the Government, 12 months after the economic war ended, to help the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Childers admitted that in one place 50 per cent. of the farmers had nothing, but on the question of full derating he said if they had the money they would run and buy wireless sets.  That is the mentality of the Government Party.  They begrudge the farmers wireless sets.  I remember some years ago, after a meeting had been held in Naas to protest against the payment of annuities, hearing the Minister for Finance making a laugh <Col N="1917" /> of farmers who were at the meeting and who had motor cars.</P>
    <P>He never stopped until he left hardly a farmer with a motor-car.  That was the policy.  This Government grudges the farmers the right to live and they are showing it every day.  I had some hope that the position would be righted when the economic war stopped but the Government are not showing any interest in the farmers.  What good is a reduction in the cost of manure to 50 per cent. of the farmers who are not able to buy a bag of manure? What 50 per cent. of the farmers want is a grant.  They must be put in a position to produce for the people and, to do that, their cost of production must be reduced.  I may be asked where the money is to come from. Where is the £5,000,000 to be invested in aeroplanes and bombs to come from?  Where did the £2,000,000 put into the alcohol factories that have gone brust, or are likely to do so, come from?  These factories were no benefit to the farmers.  Where is the £600,000 for tourist development to come from? These things are aggravating the farmers.  It would break your heart to read the letters I get from the farmers. It is the duty of the Government, as it would be of any Government, to come to the aid of the 50 per cent. of farmers who are in a desperate position. Low-priced manures are no good to them.  They are only of use to the farmers who have money to buy them.</P>
    <P>This Government is supposed to be a poor man's Government.  Why, then, throw money to the people who can afford to buy manures?  Why not give free manures to the farmers?  Manure is not worth anything to many farmers because, owing to the annuities and other charges, their lands are held up. I know people who sold their last calf to pay rates, so that Westmeath might be the best rate-paying county in Ireland. It is saddening to see how people were harassed to pay their rates.  There should be parish committees set up who would administer grants by the Government to the 50 per cent. of farmers who require them and to whom loans are of no use. If they got a loan, the sheriff would come for the annuities or something <Col N="1918" /> and it would be all gone.  They want a grant or something to put stock on the land which will put them in a position to carry on.  I suggest that the heifer scheme should be put in force again but not in the way it was put in force before.  You had actions in connection with these heifer schemes and smart fellows going around and making profit on broken-down farmers. These heifers, when given out to the farmers, should be marked on the ear so that no sheriff could come and remove them from the land.  The farmers would have to keep them for five or six years and, in that way, calves would be produced and the wealth of the country would be increased.</P>
    <P>This business of greater production is all &ldquo;codology.&rdquo;  If farmers were going well and if there were a need for their products, they would produce. All the farmers want is a reduction of the cost of production.  The Government should give them a grant to buy mowing machines and every other implement which the farmer requires. In that way, the cost of production would be reduced without reaction on the rest of the population.  If a grant were given in respect of all the machinery and all the things about the house which a farmer has to buy, the money would be well spent.  The farmer should also receive full derating. It may be said that that would benefit only the large farmers but the small farmers found it very hard to find £5 or £6 for rates this year.</P>
    <P>Rating is a grave injustice to the farming community.  The charge is solely borne by the farming community who derive hardly any benefit from it. Take the money spent on roads.  Can any farmer use one of these roads? They cannot go out on these roads with their donkey and cart or pony and trap, while every man with a motor car can go flying by.  Neither can the farmers get the services of a doctor free.  If they go into a hospital, they are charged £2 2s. 0d. or £3 3s. 0d. a week.  I know several farmers who had to leave hospital because of the high charges.  The farmers derive no benefit whatsever from these social services and it is unfair that they should have to bear the <Col N="1919" /> cost of them.  I know people with from £500 to £700 a year&mdash;I do not grudge it to them&mdash;who are living in semi-detached houses in the country and who are not paying ½d. in rates. They may have their houses rented. They can drive about in their motor cars and enjoy every service provided by the rates, which shows that the rating system is not fair.  The charges for these services should be taken off the farmers and put on the community as a whole.</P>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the question of our bulls.  I was struck forcibly in connection with this matter at the Show.  I stayed watching them the whole day long and I came to the conclusion that if 25 or 30 per cent. of the bulls were in normal condition you would not give a £5 note for them, because they were very blown up with excessive feeding.  There should be a more strict inspection of bulls because, when these animals go home to the farmers, they go back and one would not know them in three or four months or allow them to go with any cows.  I should like to impress on the Minister that he should give more money for shorthorn bulls because we are gradually coming to the position in which we will not have a good type of cow in the country.  To get a good type, we must encourage the farmers to keep shorthorn bulls.  Everybody knows that the whitehead and the black give the biggest return to the small farmer.  A lot of farmers would like to buy a good bull but they are not in a position to do so because they will not get a loan.  Loans should be given to ordinary farmers so that they could go up and compete for the bulls against the men who get premiums. Numerous farmers would buy good bulls if they got a loan.  The amount of premiums in the counties for shorthorn bulls should be increased and the radius should also be altered.  At the present time, the radius is three miles. Encouragement should be given for the keeping of shorthorn bulls anywhere and everywhere and more money should be given for premiums.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ryan mentioned something about the bounties not going to the <Col N="1920" /> farmers.  That was all the fault of the Government.  It was their way of administering those bounties.  It looked very like as if they wanted them to go to certain people.  The licences were given for a certain time, until numbers of people got rich.  The bounties went in a certain way.  As regards these things that Deputy Ryan mentioned, the reason was that they were not properly administered.  With regard to the heifer schemes, there should be a different way of dealing with them, so that certain men will not get all the benefit.  The heifers should be marked in a way that they cannot be taken by the sheriff or sold by the farmer.  There should not be any such thing as a backhand there and a backhand here.  We do not want the condition of affairs again applying when some poor fool of a farmer would be giving double the price for an animal.  I think the Minister should bring out the heifer scheme again, and have it administered in a different way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. J. Flynn Mr. J. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>In his opening statement the Minister referred to the development of his creamery scheme and, on behalf of the people in my own area, I wish to thank the Minister and his Department for the excellent work carried out in that connection.  Heretofore, great doubt existed as to whether this portable creamery scheme could be a success.  Being more or less unique in that part of the country, being unknown and a somewhat doubtful quantity, so to speak, people thought it could never be of very great benefit to those areas.  We who have seen it in operation are in a position to state that it has saved the small farmers in the mountainous areas.  So far as we are concerned, we appreciate what has been done, and we desire to thank the Minister and his Department for their efforts in that connection.  It is the first big development so far as the Gaeltacht areas are concerned.  It is a definite departure from the small experimental schemes that have been tried within the Gaeltacht districts, and it has proved itself a success.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been asked to put forward a <Col N="1921" /> scheme in regard to the restocking of mountainy areas with sheep of good quality.  The case that has been made, in my opinion, calls for consideration. As a result of the economic war, the small farmers in these mountainy districts have had to dispose of stock which, in previous years, were their mainstay for breeding purposes, and for the continuance of what is the only means of livelihood.  As the years went on, these mountainy areas became depleted of stock suitable for breeding purposes.  The people there make the case now that for that reason, and also because of the fact that some of the sheep had become inbred, the quality of the stock has depreciated.  The people there make the case that the Department might advance loans to enable them to restock their mountainy lands, and it has been further suggested that the stock might be imported from Scotland and allocated in the various districts by the Department's inspectors.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister could usefully consider such a scheme.  I understand there was a somewhat similar scheme inaugurated some years ago on behalf of the farmers in the mountainy districts of Wicklow, and it worked out very well and the people availed largely of it.  We are simply making the case that, through no fault of their own, the people in my part of the country are placed in circumstances which call for some sympathetic consideration.</P>
    <P>There is a further case in regard to the question of premium bulls and the bulls allocated by the Department to congested districts.  There is a certain anomaly where the Department allocates what they call a special term bull, and, through a certain system, they arrange for recoupment.  They allow the people to repay the amount advanced by four yearly instalments. In that way the people in the congested areas have availed of the scheme, but on examination we have found out that the people who obtained the bulls under the committee of agriculture scheme are entitled to about £16 or £20 more than the man in the <Col N="1922" /> poorer district.  Assuming a special term bull costs £40 or £50, and he is allocated to a man in a congested district and is given to him at the reduced cost of £15 that £15 is repaid by four yearly instalments.</P>
    <P>Realising that the man in that district can have no premium or no remuneration so far as fees are concerned, he has lost from £16 to £20, because the man who is allocated a bull through the committee of agriculture pays £50 or £60 for the animal, and there is a premium which is valued over a period of years at £60 or £65.  Therefore, there is a net difference of £16 to £20 between the man in the poorer area and the man in the richer district.  We have had this brought to our notice through the committee of agriculture, and we have submitted the facts as best we could to the Department.  I would like the Minister to investigate the matter, with a view to having an adjustment which, I am sure, will work out in favour of the man in the congested district.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much afraid that it is more or less a foolish thing for one to take any part in this debate at all.  For the past six or seven years we have been appealing to the Minister for Agriculture to do something for the farming community. Nothing has been done for them.  It seems the Minister is contented to go on the same old way and provide no remedy for the relief of agriculturists. We have had all sorts of suggestions as to the farmers' ills.  Some said they were due to the plague of rabbits; others that our troubles were because of the invasion of the markets by Argentine sheep.  My opinion is that the main cause of our trouble is that we have a Minister for Agriculture in charge who does not know his job.  If he does know his job, then he allows himself to be dominated by the city mentality of the Executive Council. The real cause of our trouble is that we have men sitting on the front benches who are city men.  I do agree that the Minister for Agriculture is an eminent medical man, and that his vocation in life is to ease the sufferings of the people.  Instead of easing the sufferings of mankind, he is intensifying the <Col N="1923" /> sufferings of the whole agricultural community.  The first thing the Minister should do is to take his courage in his hands, dictate to the Executive Council, or else take a back seat.  This House must not allow the whole agricultural community to wither away because the Minister will not do his job.</P>
      <P>The second item that is wrong in the country is the shortage of cash.  Until we have a sufficiency of cash in our countryside, we cannot revive the agricultural industry.  The first remedy in the way of resurrecting rural life is to bring money to the farmer's home. How that is to be done does not matter. It may be done either through grants, through subsidies or loans. But the Government must give the farmers cash to stock their lands.  That is the initial step.  At present the lands of the country are unstocked, the soil is deteriorating, much of the land is getting overgrown with rushes, the ditches and hedges uncared for, the sons and daughters of the household flying away from the land, and nothing is left.  Well, if the country is to survive these things must be set right.</P>
      <P>A few months ago the Minister for Defence stood up here and in a bold manner said he wanted £8,000,000 here and now in order to put an Army of 40,000 or 50,000 men into the field to defend this country.  Defend it against what?  He said nothing about that but he demanded his £8,000,000, and he got it.  We do not see the Minister for Agriculture getting up and saying he wants £8,000,000 to spend on a far more important business&mdash;that is, to resurrect the whole farming industry and to aid the entire mass of the people in the producing community. If the Minister for Agriculture stood up and said he wanted £8,000,000 for that purpose he would get the full support of this House.  The Minister is a man with a weak will.  He does not dominate the situation.  He should be able to dictate to the Executive Council for he is a man who belongs to and knows all about the land.  What the men on the land now want is cash to buy a cow, a plough and a sow, and all these things which go to make for production on the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1924" /> Another item that is wrong is the one for overhead charges.  Every Deputy who spoke to-day said the overhead charges were too heavy and there were too many overhead charges. Until these charges are lowered the farmers will not be able to make the land a paying proposition.  Another evil is the horde of officials we have in the country.  Year by year there is an increase in this horde and everyone of these officials earns from £200 to £1,500 a year.  We could do with a tenth of these officials.  Not alone have we too many officials but we have too many Governments.  It is unfortunate to see a little small country with 3,000,000 or 4,000,000 people having to maintain two costly Governments competing with one another and both competing with the British Government.  Everything that &ldquo;John Bull&rdquo; does in England must be followed here by our Governments. We were told for generations how cheaply this country could be run by a native Government.  But the position now is that whatever the English people try for, we have got into such an imitative way that we follow them in that cry and we must get the same thing.  We must get away from that whole idea of living, the English idea, and get back to the old Irish way of living, the way that is peaceable, religious and in every way sound.  Let us get away from being a little empire.  We were never more than a small impoverished nation and that is what we will be until the end of time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers gave us a very reasonable lecture on the whole position of agriculture.  But that lecture came from a man who got his knowledge through delving in books.  He put up a number of theories and tried to solve them.  I want to tell the Deputy that the fact is that one must live on the land in order to be able to solve these problems.  The ordinary man living on the land can tell the Deputy more about the general facts of agriculture than he can learn from books.  the average man working his land knows more than Deputy Childers or anybody else about it.  The Deputy argues that a man has so many cattle, that he keeps these cattle for a certain time and that he must make so much <Col N="1925" /> profit out of them.  That is all right on paper.  But the Deputy says nothing about the number of beasts that die, the cows that do not produce a calf because they have got white scour.  He does not tell the House that very often at the end of the year instead of a profit it is a loss the farmer has to face.</P>
    <P>Then there is the unfortunate situation with regard to the weather.  The part of the year when rain is wanted we have a solid spell of dry weather. That was the position last year and the hard, dry spring was followed up by wet weather, the worst we had for 20 years.  These are the reactions against the farmers.  The wet weather of last September practically destroyed a great deal of our land.  Nearly all our good land was saturated.  One can see land that had been good, dry land going back into rushes; this land never before grew rushes but when the soil was saturated, cold and impoverished by the wet it went back into that condition.</P>
    <P>The main source of wealth of the agricultural community is cattle, horses, sheep, pigs and poultry.  These are the natural resources of the people and the farmer must be put on his feet so that he will have a sufficient stock of these on his land.  At the present moment the Minister for Industry and Commerce can command and get any money he likes for industries.  More power to his elbow.  That Minister is a fighter.  He gets through by determination. But there is nothing given for agriculture because our Minister does not look for anything.  The Minister for Agriculture sits there.  He is a happy-go-lucky smiling man and no matter what one says to him he will laugh it off.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce will not laugh it off. He comes here and says: &ldquo;I want so-and-so&rdquo;, and he gets it.</P>
    <P>I say to the Minister for Agriculture that the people down the country are losing confidence in him.  Many of these people a short time ago would travel miles to hear him.  The farmers who held the demonstration through the streets of Dublin a few weeks ago were some months back 100 per cent. <Col N="1926" /> supporters of the Government.  These men heard about the Minister for Agriculture making sneering remarks about them&mdash;that they would be better off at home than marching through the streets of Dublin.  That statement will follow the Minister to the end of his life.  A short time ago these men were, I should say, 80 per cent. supporters of the present Government. They came there, keen, patriotic men, to let Dublin realise that there was something wrong with their position. Some people in the City of Dublin say that &ldquo;the farmers are always growling; no matter what they get, they are complaining, the devil mend them.&rdquo; Now the people of Dublin and other towns should realise that the farmer has to work from morning till night to produce the food they have on their tables.  The Minister should stand up now and apologise for the words he said about the farmers.  One of the most unfortunate things that happened in the economic war was the position that our Government found itself in so far as the farmers at least were concerned. They had to try all kinds of stunts in order to blind the people and get them to follow them.  First of all, they started one of the most unfortunate schemes that this country ever heard of, a scheme which I think has brought a curse on our country, that is, the slaughtering of the calves.  That was a most foolish scheme.  If they only gave the calves to the unfortunate people of the country for nothing, there would be some return, because it would help to keep them working on the land.</P>
    <P>Then there was the free meat scheme.  Every idle man in the country got his junk of free meat.  If there were ten in the family they got ten junks of meat, with the result that they had to go round and sell some of it, while the unfortunate men who were working hard trying to produce wealth for the nation could not get a bit of free meat. Oh, no; they were not idle, but we had to feed our idle men.  They could get free meat, while the men who were producing it could get nothing.  That was another curse on the country.</P>
    <P>Then we were told we would have to grow wheat.  The farmers grew it, not for love of growing wheat but because <Col N="1927" /> it was the only chance they had of getting a few &ldquo;bob&rdquo;.  There was a guaranteed price for it, but there was certainly no guarantee that the weather would be suitable.  A good many farmers ripped up fine soil&mdash;ten or 20 acres of it&mdash;at a big cost, and put it in their wheat crop at the proper time, but when it came to the reaping it did not yield three or four barrels to the acre.  When they went to the Government for assistance, stating that they had destroyed the land and had got no return, the Minister said: &ldquo;Try it again next year; perhaps you will be lucky.&rdquo;  Some of them were able to try it in the following year, and they did try it, but for the last three years of the wheat scheme they were definitely put out on the dole, because the crop was worse and worse, and even the little they could produce was not millable.</P>
    <P>In other counties the Government brought in a great factory called the beet factory, which I think the Minister himself said was a huge white elephant, and should never have been started.  Of course some stunt had to be carried out, and therefore they had to put up three or four big factories at a cost of thousands and thousands of pounds.  To-day they are definitely white elephants, and the Minister cannot deny it.  It is a pity that that money was not expended on the production of something else.</P>
    <P>In my county the Fianna Fáil representatives were told to go around to the different meetings and announce a grand new industry for Ireland, the tobacco industry.  They went from club to club and told the farmers to get ready for the new crop of tobacco.  The clubs became as active as possible in getting the farmers to apply for licenses.  Down in Randalstown a huge concern for tobacco, in the past, was cleaned up and painted.  Speeches were made every week; secretaries were appointed, a staff were employed, and a certain hand picked group of men in my county got licenses.  I want to say they made a huge profit on the concern.  On an acre of land they made anything from £40 to £100.  Of course they tried it again in the next year, and were successful in getting a <Col N="1928" /> huge crop.  Then they thought that all was over&mdash;the war was won.  Those men thought they had a permanent agricultural system which would produce £40 to £100 an acre every year.  What is the result this year? The Randalstown factory has been closed down.  Nobody is allowed to grow tobacco in county Meath.</P>

      <P>The tomfoolery of the last eight years has ruined the country.  Forty million pounds has been thrown away on wild cat schemes, all for the purpose of deceiving the people and bolstering up a dying policy.  It is the duty of the Minister to take off his coat and stand in front of the Executive Council and demand what he wants.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Defence can get whatever they want.  If they want £50,000,000 they can get it.  But the Minister for Agriculture cannot get anything, because he is too slow and too quiet. I say that he should get up, do his job, and try to redeem himself, because he has gone down a great deal in the estimation of every farmer, big and small, in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>My contribution to this debate will, I hope, be brief.  As I see it, the tendency in this country is like that in every other country&mdash;the tendency towards the ending of the small farm and the creation of the big farm.  I suppose world economic conditions make for that.  In every county &mdash;whether it be the congested counties in the west and south, or counties which are not congested, like those in the Midlands&mdash;the tendency is for the small uneconomic holder to sell his holding and get out, the holding being bought by his neighbour who is a bigger holder.  If we are concerned with the flight from the land, and if we want to maintain the rural population, to my mind the State will have to come to the aid of the small holder, especially the £10 valuation man, not in the form of loans but in the form of free grants of various kinds.  I am not a believer in loans.  I have seen the Agricultural Credit Corporation operating for a number of years, and I am convinced that the farmer was far better off on the four months' bill in the joint stock bank&mdash;when he had that accommodation&mdash;than he is under the system of loans from the Agricultural Credit Corporation, because unless he is lucky, unless his stock lives and are healthy, unless he is very hard working, he will not be able to pay back the capital and interest <Col N="1930" /> which become due half yearly.  Should he lose a cow, should he lose a store beast, or should he lose pigs through swine fever or other things, the possibility of his paying back the loan become very small.  He gets into difficulties, and becomes financially embarrassed.  In the old days, before the war, when he went in and got £30 or £40 on a four months' bill, he could pay a few pounds off, or explain to the manager of the bank that he had met with losses and could only pay the interest which became due at the end of the four months.  He was very much better off under that system.</P>
      <P>I believe that the small farmer is taking too much out of the soil, and that he has not the wherewithal to put back into the soil a corresponding amount.  The Government have done something this year in the form of cheaper artificial manures.  I think they should do something to ensure that the very small holder&mdash;say under £10 or £15 valuation&mdash;would have artificial manure every year.  In my own county the necessity for artificial manure is not as great as, say, in the adjoining counties of Cavan or Longford. I have spoken to people from these counties, and they tell me that unless they can put artificial manure or farmyard manure on the land, the milk yield from the cows is very poor. There is a remarkable contrast between the yield and the quality of milk given by cows on a farm that has been treated with artificial manures, and the yield and quality of milk which comes from cows on a farm that has received no manures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have done a lot in the matter of providing free sows, and the Minister is to be congratulated on his efforts in that regard.  At the same time, I understand the pig population is falling.  That is not due to the free sow scheme, and I assume that that problem will be tackled from another angle.  The scheme initiated in giving free sows should be extended to other forms of livestock.  It should be extended to heifers, and a direction should be given to see that every smallholder in the country has the <Col N="1931" /> right sort of horse.  Where a farm can carry sheep, a half-a-dozen or so, the occupier should be supplied with these.  Ever since I became a public representative, I have advocated that stock, where necessary, should be given free, gratis and for nothing. That is the only solution.  To my mind the farming industry is under-capitalised. It should be capitalised by the Government in the form of free grants, free sows, free heifers and free horses, until each farm carries a full complement of stock.</P>
    <P>The Minister has certainly gone a long way towards encouraging the co-operative spirit amongst farmers.  I do not often agree with what Deputy Dillon says in this House, but I certainly pay the compliment to him that on a previous occasion, when speaking of land division, he advocated that when a ranch of 500 or 600 acres was being divided, the houses should be built in the form of a village and the lands should be worked co-operatively &mdash;that the profits from the land should be divided, and that there should be proper management of these lands.  I have seen that system worked on the Continent, and it worked very well.  I have seen such people enjoy all the amenities of town life.  They have electricity, water supplies, sewerage, and every other modern comfort.  They have to work very hard, no doubt, both men and women.  They work from sunrise to sunset, but, at the same time, I believe that under a co-operative system like that we would get a better return from our farms and a better life for the people working on the land than is possible under the individual kind of farming carried on in this country at present.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I advocated that various things should be supplied free for farmers under £10 to £15 valuation. In the Gaeltacht subsidies are given for Irish-speaking children.  The time may have to come when the Government will have to consider subsidising families of a certain number and paying towards the maintenance of large families out of the Exchequer.  Anyone conversant with rural conditions&mdash;and, mind you, you have uneconomic holdings <Col N="1932" /> in the Midlands just as in the West&mdash;knows that a farmer of £5 or £6 valuation, with a house full of children &mdash;say seven, eight or nine children&mdash;is in a desperate plight.  He is in a far worse position than the agricultural labourer, because in the case of the agricultural labourer there is a steady income, even though it is small; it is a steady flow of cash weekly.  On the other hand, the farmer is dependent on the turnover of a couple of cattle twice a year, and of a few sets of pigs. That is all his land is able to give him. If you want to prevent the drift to the towns you will have to consider seriously subsidising the farmer who has a large family.  It has been done in other countries, and it can be done here. Unless that is done, the rural population will continue to drop.  Economic circumstances will force them to leave the land and go into the towns where they can get a living more easily.</P>
    <P>The last matter with which I want to deal has reference to the position of the middle-class farmer.  For a number of years past I have advocated the liquidation of the debts created a quarter of a century ago&mdash; from 21 to 25 years ago&mdash;on farms on which mortgages were taken out and on which interest has been paid again and again.  The payment of that interest has paralysed the middle-class farmer, and the big farmer, too.  In evidence before the Banking Commission, I advocated the liquidation of these debts, as has been done in practically every continental country.  The banks should bear in mind that they cannot take blood out of a turnip. The Government should indicate to them that it is time now, after a quarter of a century, to liquidate these debts and to let farming get on.  It is no harm to repeat.  If these debts were liquidated and a certain sum fixed in settlement of these debts, that settlement would relieve a very large portion of the community in Munster, Leinster and East Connaught.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind, the way to make this country prosperous again is to encourage the farmers to go in for mixed farming.  I remember that in the 'eighties, in the constituency <Col N="1933" /> which the Minister and I represent, the farmers, big and small, tilled 75 per cent. of their land.  Then, because of the fact that some new countries came into corn production, the farmer got a setback.  His circumstances disimproved and his condition was nearly as bad as it is to-day and, goodness knows, that is bad enough. However, about 1911 and up to 1914 the farmers in that county were fairly well-off.  They had even a little money in the bank and the farmer was able to provide a fairly decent living for himself and his family on the land.  After some years, we got a native Government and the first thing that happened under a native Government was that the minority forced a civil war on the majority.  After ten years there was another change of Government. The Government that took up office then said that the majority must rule, a thing that, I believe, was equally true in 1922.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party should jog their memories and think of the promises they made to the farmers as well as others before the 1932 election. They told the people: &ldquo;If you return Fianna Fáil to power your land will be derated.  We believe the land annuities are not legally or morally due to England.&rdquo;  That was very good news. A good many farmers swallowed that and voted for Fianna Fáil; but like Fianna Fáil Deputies to-day, they found out that these were false promises.  I am glad to see Fianna Fáil back benchers finding out the state of the farmers.  I am glad that when we speak now we do not hear such cries as &ldquo;The ranchers,&rdquo;&ldquo;Up Dev,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Cattle must go.&rdquo;  When the economic war was first started an ex-Senator stated that it took 100 years to build up the cattle industry but, thank God, it would not take 100 days to wreck it.  Are not such statements foolish, coming from people from whom you would expect something better?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not instructing the Chair in any way.  I have respect for the Chair.  I am sure that if the Chair had its way things would not be as they are.  There are so many city men on the Government Front Bench that I feel for the Minister for Agriculture, who is a countryman, like myself.  In the Land League days his father and I stood side by side on the same platform.  But, unfortunately, things which have sprung up since have divided families.  I am sure there is a hope that we will all come together again to work this country for all it is worth, and the only way to do that is to make agriculture prosperous, give the farmer a living wage and encourage him and his children to remain on the land.  Farmers' wives, sons and daughters are no more than slaves at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those who leave the land to go into the towns or across the water when they come back have nothing but contempt for those who are left at home. No wonder they would.  We hear a lot about the economic war and how it was fought and finished, but who bore the brunt of that war?  The farmers and the agricultural labourers.  In 1933, when the prices of cattle were at their lowest, for a beast which realised £12 on the British market the farmer here got £4 1s. 8d.  Six pounds had to be paid as a tariff to the British Government.  You can blame whom you like for that&mdash;the British Government or the Irish Government&mdash;it was immaterial to the poor unfortunate people who had to pay it.  They got £4 1s. 8d. for a two-and-a-half year old bullock or heifer, as the case may be.  Before the economic war, that beast was worth £4 when three days' old.  After being kept for two and a half years, it had to be sold for the same amount of money.  Then you will <Col N="1935" /> hear Fianna Fáil Deputies saying that the farmer has so much money in the bank.  I know what he has in the bank. He has bills that he is not able to meet. Any farmer who has money in the bank did not make it by farming.  If a farmer did make money in the good times, he has drawn it all out now.</P>
    <P>There is another class of the community which is very badly treated&mdash; the agricultural workers.  In the Land League days the agricultural workers fought side by side with the farmers. By supporting our representatives in the British Parliament they got fixity of tenure for the Irish farmers and they got Land Purchase Acts passed. The fathers and grandfathers of some Deputies here were delighted with their bargain.  They said: &ldquo;When we pay off the principal and interest, our holdings will be our own.&rdquo;  What did our native Government do?  They passed a Land Act depriving the farmer of fixity of tenure.  It is time for that Act to be amended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>As to the agricultural worker, how is he situated?  Some time ago I asked a question about hundreds of labourers' cottages in the County Wexford being badly in need of repair, some of them not being fit for human habitation.  The board of health attacked me for that, and said they thought that I was a decent, honest man.  Some of these agricultural labourers had been reporting for years that their cottages were in a bad state, but there was nothing done for them. Yet I was attacked by the board of health.  They said that I had disgraced the County Wexford.  But I only did my duty, and I am doing it still.  There are many of these cottages not repaired yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister for Agriculture any responsibility for that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The board of health have.  I know the Minister will <Col N="1936" /> help me in getting homes for the labourers of Wexford which will be fit to live in.  Many of them at present are not fit for human habitation.  Another thing I want to impress on the Minister is to get the Pigs Marketing Board to insist on pigs being graded alive, and not dead.  It is no wonder that the pig population has gone down under the present conditions.  When a pig is slaughtered the producer is not going to bring it home again.  If the pig is graded alive, if it is too fat or too lean, too leavy or too light, he can take it away again.  But when it is dead he has to put up with the grading made in the factory.  I am sure Deputies will agree that the producer of pigs is not getting a fair deal.  The prices given for pigs are good, but the price of feeding stuffs is too high.</P>
      <P>If farmers are to be able to send their produce to the British market at a competitive price, agricultural land and farm buildings will have to be derated and the price of feeding stuffs will have to be brought down to the British and Northern Ireland level.</P>
      <P>Farmers are being handicapped in every way.  Some time ago there was a new food put on the market called cooked wheat.  I do not know whether it came from Russia or not, but I know that it was sold at £5 10s. per ton in England while it costs £9 per ton here. When the second cargo came the &ldquo;red flag&rdquo; went up and it was stated: &ldquo;There is no more of that to come in here.&rdquo;  That is how our farmers are treated.  That is the reason why the people are flying from the land.  There is no encouragement given to young men and young women to stay at home and work the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another thing which the Government would be wise to do and that is to offer some encouragement to agricultural labourers to marry.  The State should come to the aid of married labourers by giving them some help to rear their families.  It is not fair that a married labourer should only receive 14/- per week and his board.  He will want 1/- or 1/6 per week for tobacco and other things, for himself and his wife cannot be expected to buy a week's food for 10/- or 11/-.  The sooner the Government come to the aid of the farmers and the <Col N="1937" /> agricultural workers the better for the country, as the city people and the townspeople cannot be prosperous as long as agriculture is bankrupt.  As long as the agricultural labourer is badly fed, and badly clad, he will not take any interest in his employer's business, and it could not be expected that he would take such interest.  The towns-people and the city people should realise that this country cannot be prosperous if the farmer is not prosperous. I myself have always encouraged the use of home-produced agricultural machinery.  I have always purchased and used the machinery of Messrs.  Pierce, of Wexford, long before this Government came into office.  They are doing very well there now, but, as a result of the tariffs that have been imposed, the farmers is being made to pay more for everthing that he wants.  The result is that the farmer, just like a poor man with an old suit of clothes, who will make the suit last as long as possible, is making his machinery go as far as it can, in order to try to keep going.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would ask the Minister to put his hand to his heart&mdash; he came from a good family and a good county, a tillage county&mdash;and to encourage the farmer to till and also to do everything possible to encourage those gentlemen, who speak so much about bullocks in this country, to realise that the more live stock is raised in a country the more employment you can give.  The man who is going in for mixed farming caters for his live stock in the spring, summer and autumn, and he has to provide for feed for his cattle in the winter.  I myself find that the most work has to be done at Christmas.  There is no question of unemployment in a country where that class of farming is being carried on, because you will need to employ men both in winter and in summer, and I say that it is up to the Minister for Agriculture to impress that on his colleagues in the Cabinet.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I intervene in this debate with some hesitation, because I may be told that I have little right to talk on this subject.  I am not a farmer and, besides, I belong to a Party the attitude of which, I think, <Col N="1938" /> is very often misunderstood, if not misrepresented, in relation to agriculture. There used to be an idea in this country that farmers and workers were a sort of natural enemies and that very deep antipathies prevailed between them.  That is not true, I believe, and even the people whom I have met in the Party to which I belong, or in the movement with which I am associated, have never shared that idea.  I think the ultimate salvation of this country must come as a result of a combination between farmers and workers, and I sincerely hope that in a very short time we shall see that hope realised in the installation of a Government of that type in this country. There are in this country 200,000 farmers whose valuation does not exceed £10.  A very large proportion of holdings, of that kind are situated in the county I come from, and I should say that the great majority of the holdings, in the constituency I have the honour to represent in this House, are holdings of that type.</P>
      <P>I think that nobody who knows anything about West Cork could deny the industry and perseverance of the farmers and workers there in their efforts to win a living for themselves on the soil under very considerable difficulties.  I have had 16 years' association&mdash;and very intimate association &mdash;with these people, because I sit in this House by virtue of the support of the working farmers and the agricultural workers in West Cork, and that enables me to approach their problems with some sympathy and, at least, a desire to understand them.  If there is one thing that has struck me during that time, and particularly during the recent years of that period, it is the fortitude with which such people bear their burdens, and the fortitude with which they endure their sufferings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has struck me, as a member of a local authority there, that to the average farming household in West Cork, faced with domestic illness that, unfortunately, sometimes has an unhappy knack of occurring in the case of two or three members of a family at the one time&mdash;that illness often means almost complete ruin, because there are hospital fees, medical charges <Col N="1939" /> and other costs associated with illness, to be met.  To my own certain knowledge, such illness has meant the piling up of debt in households of that kind that cannot possibly be redeemed during the lifetime of the present head of the household.  Very unfortunately, also, that is very often coupled with losses of another description, such as losses in capital from one cause or another.  I often marvel at the resignation and fortitude with which troubles of that kind are borne.</P>
    <P>Now, my observation on the present position of the working farmers of West Cork, as I know them, is the great poverty that exists amongst a very large number of them.  I heard from the lips of a parish priest in West Cork, some time ago, the story that 300 young girls and young men had left his parish, and I heard from an eminent ecclesiastic from another country, with whom I had the opportunity of talking recently, that his impressions, after consulting a number of people who had visited his diocese across in England and who were resident there, were, according to the information of these people, that they had left this country, not because of any desire to seek the &ldquo;lure of the pavement&rdquo;, as it was called in another House, but to get a living there because they could not get a living here at home.  I think that that is the most terrible indictment of native Government that could be put forward, and I think it is a tremendous confession of failure on the part of all of us in this country&mdash;and I do not want to make any narrow, Party capital out of this matter&mdash;that, 15 years after this House was established, that should be the condition of affairs.</P>
    <P>I intervene in this discussion at a time when the debate, presumably, is drawing to a close, and I do not want to labour the position, and neither do I wish to exaggerate it; but there seems to be a suggestion, here and there in this debate, that the present position was, to some extent, the result of an unwillingness to work on the part of the workers.  I suppose it is inevitable that we should have statements <Col N="1940" /> of that kind.  I do not want to refer to statements of that kind in any harsh terms, but I very definitely and confidently repudiate the existence of any such state of things in that part of the country that I know intimately, and I think that, in view of that fact, it would be very interesting to examine the present position with regard to employment on the land in this country. The figures that were returned in that respect are very striking, it seems to me.  In the period between 1934 and 1938 there were 25,500 fewer wage-earners on the land in this country; 13,000 people who had gone out of paid employment in agriculture were permanent employees, and it is well to remember that, in view of many things we are told about the number of new workers who have got into employment.  The remaining 12,500 were casual employees, but, in all 25,500 fewer people worked on the land in 1938 compared with the number similarly engaged in 1934.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been said in this debate with regard to wheat and other crops.  Here, again, the figures available are extremely interesting.  In 1938, there were 10,000 additional acres under wheat compared with the acreage in 1937, but another situation also manifested itself in that period. In 1938, there were 920,000 acres under corn crops; in 1937, there were 926,000 acres, and in 1936, 946,000 acres under the same type of crops.  If we turn to root crops, the figures are equally striking.  In 1936, there were 662,000 acres under root crops; in 1937, 653,000 acres, and, in 1938, 635,000 acres. It seems to me that the cause of the decline, very definite, very marked and very striking, in crops and in human beings actively associated with agriculture is quite definitely due to uncertainty with regard to prices and markets, and I echo some of the very interesting suggestions made here for an improvement in that position.  It is, quite frankly and definitely, a very vital and important part of the policy of the Party with which I am associated in connection with agriculture.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear this evening references <Col N="1941" /> to New Zealand, and I hope Deputies will remember that what has been achieved for the benefit of agriculture in New Zealand, the very striking improvement that has been made in that country from the agricultural, the social, and various other points of view, has been largely achieved by Irishmen.  A very large percentage of the people who comprise the Government of New Zealand are Irish men or of Irish descent.  May it also be said that they belong to a working class Party, and that they have been able to achieve there what unfortunately has not yet been achieved, and unfortunately looks unlikely of achievement for some time yet, in their own mother country.</P>
    <P>Quite definitely, in my opinion, credit facilities for farmers are necessary, and necessary immediately.  I speak in no spirit of appreciation or disparagement of the Agricultural Commission.  Obviously because of suggestions that radical remedies are necessary, the whole problem of agriculture requires examination in that way, but I speak of what is necessary in the meantime. The Agricultural Commission will deliberate for a considerable time, and perhaps a very much longer time to consider a report, and nobody who has had experience of the tedious manner in which the investigations of a commission have necessarily to be carried out will expect any early remedy.  In the meantime the position of the small farmers particularly grows steadily worse.  I take no pleasure in stating that fact here.  I think it would be a pleasure for all of us to be able to point to an improvement.  No matter to what Party the credit for that improvement was due, and no matter what the value politically of that improvement would be, I think it would be something of which all of us could very well be proud.</P>
    <P>I advocate credit facilities as a very urgent reform.  Whether they take the form of money repayable at a nominal, very trifling rate of interest, or the form of grants to people in that position, they are certainly necessary.  After all, when the Great War terminated in 1918, the first job undertaken was rebuilding in the war zone.  I suggest that that might be applied at home. <Col N="1942" /> The agriculturists of this country have had a strenuous time, and there has been a no less strenuous time for the unfortunate workers who were engaged on the land during the past five or six years.  It will serve no purpose now to go into the history of that period. Like Deputy Childers and others, I think it wise to avoid any discussion of the matter, but there is certainly the accepted principle that there ought to be compensation for losses in war-time and I suggest that an endeavour to put the farmers, harassed, in great difficulty, many of them in acute poverty at present, on their feet is very urgent, and that method might reasonably be considered under that heading.</P>
    <P>I also think that this question of the endowment of the family is one which ought to be considered at an early date.  It is of very special importance to the working farmer and to the small farmer, blessed as he very often is with a large family.  His difficulties, during the years of childhood of his family, are enormous.  Nobody but some person very closely in touch with such people, and not always even such people, can appreciate these difficulties. We have the pointers, wherever we look in this country, to the decline in our people.  Whether we look at the schools or whether we look at the records of local authorities in one way or another, there is that clear and unmistakeable evidence of a decline in the population.  This principle has been given effect to in other countries, and I think it is one which ought to be considered, with special reference to the position of the small farmer and the agricultural labourer.  I say that because I believe that the cases of such people typify very specially the need for some reform of that kind at present.</P>
    <P>I have heard references here to co-operation, and I am wondering what exactly is meant in that respect.  If co-operation means continuing the policy that puts a few people into business and puts another section out of business, then, I would not be a very enthusiastic admirer of it.  I have seen evidence of something <Col N="1943" /> described occasionally as co-operation in various parts of West Cork at the present time that I am not in agreement with.  I say that with all respect and without any desire to say anything that is vitally controversial in a debate of this kind, where I think such matters ought to be avoided.</P>
    <P>One other problem besets the small farmer and his wife and children, the working farmer and the agricultural labourer, and generally the person with small means in this country at the present time.  That problem is living costs.  A good deal could be done to improve the position of such people by a reduction in living costs.  Take for instance, the position of the labourer who works for wages, or of a farmer whose income is rather uncertain and inclined to diminish: his living costs have soared very rapidly in recent years.</P>
    <P>The suggestions I have made were not many, but at least I have tried to make them with the desire to be helpful and with the desire to ensure that the difficulties of the agriculturists of this country might be sympathetically remembered, not by one Party, I hope, or by two Parties, but by all sections of the representatives of the people in this House.</P>

      <P>It is sad to listen to the statements made in this debate now, as compared with those made four or five years ago.  Yet, those of us who criticised the policy of four or five years ago welcome the increased intelligence that is now being brought to bear on these problems of national existence. It was amusing&mdash;if not tragic&mdash;to listen to all the suggestions about giving something for nothing.  Anybody who understands or studies the national position at the present time will see that the whole trouble is that you cannot get anything.  You are face to face with a national financial crisis&mdash;thanks to the destruction that was, by a huge majority in this House, perpetrated on agriculture for five or six years. You cannot destroy wealth and have it.  And that is what the Government did.  A half million calves killed! <Col N="1944" /> What would they be worth to-day? Fifteen pounds to £20 a piece.  Make it up: it is a simple sum in arithmetic. That is the borrowing power which has been destroyed.  What did Deputy Kennedy suggest?  I think he suggested the repudiation of debts on mortgages.  Repudiate your debts, and who is going to get a loan then?  And if a loan cannot be got&mdash;if you have not credit you will not get a loan, you will not get money to carry on&mdash; national bankruptcy is staring you in the face.  The Government are responsible for the condition of agriculture at the present time, and no Deputy from their benches&mdash;or from any bench in this House&mdash;has got up to suggest that any branch of agriculture is in a flourishing condition, and I challenge anybody to get up and say that it is.</P>
      <P>After seven years of government by the Party that had a plan for everything, now it turns out they had a plan for nothing.  Agriculture has borne the whole brunt of the economic war.  Periodically the English Chancellor has said he has got all he has asked for, he has squared accounts; while at the same time the cows from Munster were being seized and sold in England and in the North of Ireland, and the Government was bringing down its servants to bid under the name of Mr. O'Neill for the cattle they were taking to liquidate a debt that had already been liquidated by the farmers through the British tariffs.  Agriculture is now bankrupt, thanks to the Government Party and to the Labour Party that supported them.  Make up your mind that no soft talk here is going to placate or cod the people outside who are pretty nearly on the verge of bankruptcy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are told by Deputy Kennedy that the small farmer should get free cows, free sows, free horses, free everything.  Who is going to give anything free?  He told us, too&mdash;perhaps in an unguarded moment&mdash;that the farmers were better off when they could go into the joint stock banks and sign a bill that a neighbour would back, and pay back the whole of the bill with a seasonal crop.  Why were they better off?  Because they were honest, and the country with national <Col N="1945" /> honesty has national credit.  The man who comes back as soon as the promissory note matures, and pays it, is always sure of being welcome to another loan when he comes again. The farmers in this country who had enormous credit in the banks&mdash;not only themselves, but their fathers and grandfathers had that credit&mdash;find now that that credit has been ruined, not by any fault of their own but by the action of the Government, who have beggared the farmers.  The economic war was won, we were told last year when the surrender of our economic freedom was made to save the faces of the politicians who adorn the Government Front Bench, when the ideal and conception of freedom preached by Arthur Griffith for a generation was sacrificed to save political faces.  We had peace&mdash;the peace that Deputy Childers quoted a few days ago in my native country as a mile stone in the national development of this country, the surrender of what was won by the old I.R.A. nearly half a generation ago.  That freedom was sacrificed in order to face-save the politicians opposite.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see Deputy Corry coming to his senses.  He gave quite an interesting address here this evening. We have the prices of 1914 for agricultural produce, but for anything that the agriculturist has to buy we have, not the prices of 1914, but war prices.  We have to pay as much as we had to pay in the height of the Great War.  It did not require superhuman <Col N="1946" /> intelligence to know that when an attempt was made to industrialise this country at an accelerated pace this country should have some reserves to call upon.  I have often given a quotation in this House from a famous European statesman&mdash;that agriculture is the mother of the nation's wealth which industry employs.  When we set out to accelerate our pace for the industrialisation of this country there should be a capital reserve in agriculture. But, what was the condition of agriculture? It was taxed by the British. The net price the farmer got was about one-third of the world price.  The figure was quoted here by Deputy Keating.  I hope the Minister will contradict that, if he can.  I hope, at any rate, that he will allude to it.  With one-third of the world price for agricultural produce, the Government, with super-intelligence, set out to accelerate the pace of industrialisation, and that industrialisation could only be carried on by an increased tax on agriculture.  Was agriculture able to bear it, at one-third of the world price?  Of course, it was not.  It would have been unwise, even apart from the economic war and the British tariffis, at that stage, to go at such an accelerated pace with industrialisation. But it was carried on. Anybody could come from anywhere and say they would start an industry. There was a prohibitive tariff put up at once.  There were prohibitive tariffs put upon goods in this country that were not being made in this country but because some fellow had promised to make them.  Who had to pay for it?  Agriculture.  And, mind you, the Labour Party supported that and the Labour Party supported the subsidisation of industry to give a manual worker £3 or £4 a week, and subsidised it at the expense of agriculture that was only able to give 24/- a week.  Those are figures fixed by the Government.</P>
    <P>Let us all face up to our past.  It is the past records of Parties in this House that I am quoting.  As a farmer, I did all classes of work on a farm with my own hands, day and night.  I often worked in the moonlight because I was not able to pay a man.  The Minister laughs.  He never had to do it, but I <Col N="1947" /> am sure he will accept my statement when I say I did it.</P>

But now his eyes are open, and I hope he will not be so gullible in believing everything now as he was obdurate in believing nothing a few years ago.  The cobwebs are taken off his eyes now.  Let him tell this House and this country where the profits arising out of his policy are.</P>

      <P>We will give you a chance.  If you did not get it to-day, to-morrow is another day.  We will be glad to listen to you, but we will have our chance first.  The Minister set out with a scheme for mixtures, and he argued here in this House that because he mixed corn here and fixed a price that that was good for agriculture.  He flouted the economic truism that the ultimate price that could be paid for corn in this country was what the product of that corn, namely, beef, mutton, pork or bacon, would fetch in the world market.  He learns it now.  He is going to abolish the scheme.</P>
      <P>The economic war has brought agriculture to where it is&mdash;and it is in a deplorable condition.  Agriculture bore the cost of the economic war.  No compensation has been given to agriculture since the settlement.  I will not go into the settlement, whether it was good or bad or what it surrendered, but the economic war was settled and no compensation has been given to agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of derating was put up. Why is not derating effected, and stop all this nonsense about spoon-feeding? No farmer in this country will ever be able to make a success of agriculture by spoon-feeding.  If you are not able to produce a class of men to work the soil of this country who can stand on their own two legs and look everybody <Col N="1948" /> in the face without any sops from anybody, then your country is going down. Put agriculture on an economic basis, and let agriculturists work it, and if they fail let them fail just as the workers in any other industry migh fail.  But stop spoon-feeding.  It is due to agriculture to be compensated for what the industry suffered in the economic war.</P>
    <P>A demand has gone from all over the country&mdash;for which I take a certain amount of pardonable pride, because I was the first, in 1928, to raise the banner&mdash;for derating in this country. What reason has the Minister for refusing it?  He comes in with a Vote of something less than £600,000 to administer the whole agricultural machinery of the country.  The Minister for industry and Commerce comes in with a higher Vote to accommodate a few holidaymakers coming into this country.  Are they to come in to see agriculture bankrupt?  Why did not the Minister ask for money for derating?  What is his objection to it? I think I have read where the Minister stated that derating would help the big farmer, but would not help the small one.  It shows the Minister's lack of appreciation of what derating is.  Did the Minister ever consider that derating was advocated, not for the individual, but for the industry? Is the Minister going to argue that complete derating, which would mean a lightening of the burden on agriculture of over £2,000,000, will not be good for that industry?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that £1,000,000 going to agriculture in the shape of derating would not help the small farmers.  Live stock is one of the principal branches of agriculture.  Who produces our live stock?  Are the small farmers of the country not the breeders of that live stock?  The Minister would devise a scheme for derating the small farmers.  The small farmer who has a yearling or a year-and-a-half to sell has to sell that beast to a bigger farmer.  The latter can give one price for the yearling if he can put it on derated land, but he must give a lesser price for the yearling if he has to put it on land that is highly rated.  I remember the Minister saying here, when he was defending the giving of cattle licences to the dealers: &ldquo;That will work its way down to the producer.&rdquo;  Will the Minister not accept this: that by derating all agricultural land, the increased prices for live stock will be distributed over all farmers, big and small?  If the Minister is not satisfied with that way of partially helping agriculture we will be glad to hear what other suggestion be has to make for helping it.  I hope he has travelled some distance in that direction since the time when the people of this country were taxed, to pay the &ldquo;John Browns&rdquo; to buy the cattle that were seized from the farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A great deal of play has been made about the growing of wheat here.  I always stood for the growing of wheat. The Minister claims to be a champion of wheat-growing.  I say that the growing of wheat successfully and permanently in this country will depend on the success of the laboratory.  I see here in the Book of Estimates that the Faculty of Agriculture is costing to-day precisely what it cost when it was set up in the University&mdash;about £24,000 a year.  The plant breeder is still a lecturer there and not a professor, so that the very key to the making of this country a successful wheat-growing country has been neglected.  The growing of wheat successfully, in any country, and I challenge the Minister to contradict this, depends upon breeding a strain of wheat suitable to the soil and climate of that country.  That <Col N="1951" /> must be done in the plant breeding section up in the laboratory.</P>
    <P>It must be done through the Faculty of Agriculture, and it must be financed. As a member of the board that set up this faculty in the university, I endeavoured to get a professorship in plant breeding.  I failed, and it is still a lectureship.  There is not a penny more available for plant breeding than there was at that time, and yet the Minister and his Party go out shouting: &ldquo;Grow more wheat!&rdquo;  I believe in growing wheat, and I think that I grow as much of it&mdash;and that I grow it as successfully&mdash;as the Minister.  That, however, is not here or there.</P>
    <P>I believe in the growing of wheat. It is wrong to say that wheat is not a profitable crop on suitable land.  It is artificially profitable.  I got over 30/- a barrel in my haggard, and so did others, for my wheat this year.  It was carted away free in sacks at a time when good milling wheat could be bought at 14/- and 15/- a barrel.  I believe in the growing of wheat on national grounds and on defence grounds, just as I believe that the best defence for this country in the face of a European war would be to have agriculture in a strong position.  Yet, in spite of that, it is doubtful business to produce an article at 30/- if you can buy it at 15/-.  I am as strongly in favour of tillage as any member of the House.  I probably do as much tillage as anybody in the House, but there is no crop I will grow if I can buy it at half the price that it costs me to grow it.  Any man who does that is inviting bankruptcy, and the nation that does it is inviting bankruptcy.  I would like to hear the Minister justify the utilisation of land in this country for the growing of a particular crop if that crop can be bought at a less figure than it costs to produce here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a sad reflection that the Minister for Agriculture, addressing not only this House, but the nation, has to come here and tell us that every crop we grow in this country can be more cheaply imported, and that there is no cure for that. I think that is the most defeatist policy that I have ever heard coming from the lips of a man entrusted with responsibility.  I do not subscribe to that view, and I ask is it not time that some effort was made to remedy that position?  Did it ever strike the Minister that if our effort must be to produce food in this country at an economic cost to the producer and at an economic price to the consumer, that we must review our land policy? Did the Minister ever consider that the breaking up of ranches and cheap food are diametrically opposed?  The only way to produce cheap food and pay a decent wage in its production is by the use of modern machinery.  The only alternative we have to the use of the most up-to-date machinery on the farms is low wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1953" /> I would like to hear some of the Labour Party on this before the debate closes.  There is no use in talking about a decent living standard and cheap food in agriculture, because you cannot have it both ways.  If you want cheap food you must have slave conditions, according to industrial standards.</P>
    <P>If you want to have decent conditions in agriculture, then you must have dear food and high living costs. Which are we going to have?  I would like to hear the Labour Party on this. Are we going to have long hours, low wages, and cheap food or an eight-hour day?  As a large employer of labour I would welcome an eight-hour day, and I would welcome high wages, if I got high economic prices for the stuff I produce.  There is no use in playing to the gallery here.  Members of all Parties must face up to the position that agriculture is on the verge of bankruptcy.  National credit was never lower.  I say that without fear of contradiction, knowing full well what I am talking about.  I challenge contradiction of this statement, that national credit was never lower since we got our own Government.  I challenge the Minister or any of his colleagues on that.  Why?  Because our income is so small.  We have used up our savings, not only here but our investments abroad.  We are face to face now with a national financial crisis, thanks to the incompetency and recklessness of the Government.</P>
    <P>The biggest industry we had in this city is practically idle&mdash;the building industry.  Let any Labour representative contradict that.  I challenge representatives of the City or County of Dublin to contradict it.  What is the reason?  Scarcity of money.  Why have we scarcity of money?  Because our national credit is low.  Why is our national credit low?  Because agriculture, our principal industry, and the pillar of our economic life, is bankrupt, thanks to the Government. Where is the remedy?  The only one offered was a piecemeal remedy, with a hit here and there; but not to give loans because that is adding a millstone around a man's neck.  Give grants.  We would all like to get <Col N="1954" /> grants.  Who will give them?  Are we to have nothing in this land but a whole lot of paupers, waiting for some dole or queueing up for one?  Is that the freedom we fought for?  Is that what the Sinn Féin policy of self-reliance has come to?  Are we to watch like hungry dogs for crusts and run off with them?  Is that what we have come to?  Has there been any other suggestion made?  Deputy Flynn and Deputy Kennedy made certain suggestions.</P>
    <P>I stand for a different type of agriculture. I stand for agriculture that is able to stand on its own legs.  In the past a farmer was able to go into a bank and say he wanted a loan of money, and he got it.  Instead of being able to go in and do that now, not only is he not able to pay what he owes, but he is not able to pay the interest.  Yet we have representatives standing up and saying, because debts were long overdue to banks, repudiate them.  I wonder if we have gone mad altogether.  I belong to bodies that severely criticised banks for not handing out money, but I realise that money in banks is entrusted to them and is not their own. Is any public representative prepared to get up and, in his privileged position, tell the people to repudiate debts because they are overdue?</P>
    <P>I do not know if wheat is sound nationally.  Individually it pays.  I grow wheat because it pays me, but I do not believe in the extensive growing of wheat, as has been advocated, at a guaranteed price.  It has robbed the land of fertility because during the economic war nothing else paid and people ranched in wheat. They put a tractor into a big field of seven or eight acres of good land. Such land would not be long going out of fertility.  At the rate it could be cultivated after being sown and rolled, there would be no more labour needed until a reaper and binder was put in in the harvest.  That machine would deal with eight or ten acres in a day.  Next year there was wheat there again, and then wheat the following year, until the land was rendered useless.  That is what we have got where wheat was grown <Col N="1955" /> extensively.  Now the Minister wakes up and says that we must restore fertility, after bribing farmers to rob the land of fertility in the last few years.  Wheat ranching on the system I have explained, with a guaranteed price, was nothing else but bribing farmers to rob the land and to rob national wealth as truly as if the Minister sent gangsters to rob money out of banks.  Now we have to call in the taxpayers to subsidise the land in order to restore fertility, and the munificent sum of 10/- a ton is given on artificial manures.  As a previous speaker very properly asked, what is the good of offering 10/- a ton to a farmer who has not the price of a ton of artificial manure?  That is what the Minister and his colleagues in the Government have done, while the John Browns, the O'Neills, the Tom Carpenters and all the rest of that type have grown fat on the plunder of the farmers.</P>
    <P>Deputy Corry said that we have no exports that are not subsidised.  Roughly speaking, that is true.  How are we to keep up our credit if we have nothing to sell in the world markets?  I leave it to the Minister to explain that. Deputy Corry said there was no land reclamation now.  Of course there is not.  Who would be mad enough to reclaim land when the best land is not paying?  Why should we reclaim land that, at its best, will be secondary land, when first-class land will not pay, and is going into rushes?  Some Deputy suggested subsidising farm labour.  As a practical farmer I am against any subsidies.  I stand for a fair hunt for the man on the land just as I stand for a fair hunt for a man in any other occupation; but, if he is not able to keep his place in the race, he must fall out, just as a man in industrial or commercial life has to fall out.  I do not blame the farmers for falling out of the race in the last few years, because they were spancilled and starved before the race and could not run.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence gets £8,000,000 to defend the outpost of Western Europe here.  I put it to the Minister for Agriculture that if we had this country teeming with foodstuffs, <Col N="1956" /> would not that be a better first line of defence than 30,000 of an army, armed with British guns, firing British ammunition at some unknown enemy, doubling our navy, or providing five bombing planes?  Would it not be better if that £8,000,000 was producing foodstuffs?</P>

      <P>Not subsidies but in making restitution for the plunder of the last six or seven years that the Deputy supported.  There are ways of doing that besides subsidies.  Deputy Murphy said that in some quarters farmers and labourers were looked upon as natural enemies.  I never saw any attempt at cultivating that animosity except on the basis of the O.B.U.  I wonder does Deputy Hurley remember when the <i>Voice of Labour</i> talked in military language in advocating the O.B.U. and described everything in the phraseology of &ldquo;fronts&rdquo;? That time is gone and I hope it will never come again.  Deputy Murphy objected to co-operative farms.  I think he was thinking in terms of co-operative trading.  I am at one with him in regard both to co-operative trading and co-operative farms, for one reason if for no other&mdash;that the Irish people are not co-operatively inclined, that they want to work out their own salvation. They are very individualistic, and I think they are the better for that. Deputy Corry fears that he would not know what to do with the fellow who wanted to lie down on a co-operative farm.  It would be very hard to know what to do.</P>

      <P>I am afraid the Minister is short of imagination.  He will have to tax his imagination in connection with this question of the depressed state of agriculture.  Does he admit that it is depressed and, if so, what is his remedy?  If he does not admit it, let him show where it is prosperous. If he can do that, he will do more than I can do.  The Minister is Minister for Agriculture not on behalf of a Party, but on behalf of the nation.  He has been in that position for the last seven years, and agriculture is admitted by his own Party to be in a more serious position to-day than it was when he took up the running seven years ago. Deputy Corry says we have more cows. But we have less milk.  Efficiency has gone down.  We have more cows because of the period when, except heifers were turned into cows, they were of no value.  That gave us a surplus of cows.  Let the Minister tell us what remedy he has for the position as regards Deputy Flynn's people on the hills of Kerry and West Cork. They want free sheep.  Deputy Kennedy wants free sows and free money in Westmeath.  What remedy has the Minister for all the people who want something for nothing because of the depression in agriculture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to tell the House and the country what his opinion is as to the state of agriculture and, if it is depressed, as has been stated in this House, what is his remedy.  I am not going to say anything personal to the Minister.  I am not going to say that he is not fit for his job.  Perhaps there were circumstances over which he had no control.  Perhaps he had a very difficult job to perform.  I agree with Deputy Corry when he says that nobody has any difficulty in obtaining approach to the Minister for Agriculture. Whether a person belongs to the Minister's Party or any other Party, there is no difficulty in that connection. Even though he and I fire exchanges across the floor of the House, I find him the most approachable of Ministers. I hope he will not take anything I have said in a personal way.  I <Col N="1958" /> should like that he would apply himself to the question I have put and state what is the condition of agriculture and what is the remedy.  I submit that it is in a very depressed condition. One way of helping it would be to reduce overhead charges by abolishing rates on the land.  That would stop the ramp going on in local expenditure over the last six years or seven years.  If the Minister will not accept that remedy, let him tell us what his proposal is and why he puts up with less than £600,000 when the Minister for Industry and Commerce was able to get away with £600,000 to accommodate holiday-makers whom we are to invite to this country in a year when the ordinary law was not sufficient to maintain the peace, and we had to pass Public Safety Acts.</P>

      <P>Some of them bring their food with them.  As regards beet growing, Deputy Corry will agree that that is the hardest work on the land. There is no harder work than the handling of beet.  The reason the industry was taken up by the people is that it was put over when there was no cash in any other crop and also because of the propaganda of men like Deputy Corry who told his own constituents, as well as other prospective beet growers, that 30/- a ton for beet was a good price.  I think that was the price in the Act&mdash;30/- per ton with 15 per cent or 17½ per cent. sugar-content, with a 2/6 per ton rise for each point in excess of that percentage. The Deputy and the Government were told here at the time that it could not be grown, that beet growing was not an economic proposition in any country. The only way to make beet growing an economic proposition is to raise the sugar-content of the average crop of beet to about 25 per cent.  If you had a 25 per cent.  Sugar-content for the average crop, then you would be able to produce sugar at an economic price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think Deputy Corry will agree with me in that.  The only way to arrive at a 25 per cent. sugar-content <Col N="1959" /> is to try the breeding of a good strain of beet.  The present strain was originally bred from a 4 per cent.  or 5 per cent.  sugar-content and it is now up to 17 per cent. or 18 per cent.  The Minister has done nothing in connection with the breeding of a special strain of beet.  I do not think that the seed for our beet is raised in this country but I am open to correction on that.  I believe it is all imported and, if the people over the way did not send us the beet seed, we could not grow beet at any price.  I think I am right in that statement.  We have a faculty of agriculture.  It is about 12 years' old and nothing has been done with reference to the raising of beet seed or the breeding of a new strain of beet.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will tell us the cure for agriculture, if he will not accept the suggestions that have been made.  From my own point of view, I should be sorry to see agriculture propped up by any system of doles. If it is down and out, it is no harm and no shame to accept doles to put it on its feet; but for the permanent relief of agriculture, or for the putting of agriculture on a sound basis, it must be done in an economic manner and not by any doles, subsidies or anything of that kind.  If the charges on agriculture are too high, take them off; if the rates are too high, take them off; if annuities are too high, take them off, but give the agriculturist a chance of producing food at an economic price.  Take off the overhead charges and, if he fails in the race, let him pay the price just as the industrialist has to pay.  The commercial man who does not mind his business will fail.  Let us put efficient people on the land who will be able to produce food.  I believe that is possible if the other condition is fulfilled &mdash;that is, if democracy works properly and puts men on the Government Front Benches who are fit for their jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are just a few points that I would like to make on this particular Vote.  So many things have been said from all angles that <Col N="1960" /> there is no need for me to repeat them, but there are two points, at least, that I should like the Minister to consider very seriously.  It is agreed, I think, that the agricultural community have been hard hit and that many persons engaged in agriculture have been specially hit because of the set of circumstances in which they found themselves. They were put by the Government into the front line trenches.  Some of them perhaps, were not willing to go into the front lines.  The result was that they did not, perhaps, grow the wheat or beet that they should have grown; they stuck to their cattle and lost very substantially.  They suffered financial embarrassment.  They were unable to meet the many calls that were put upon them.  One farmer, perhaps, was unable to meet his bank liabilities; another farmer was unable to meet his rates; another was unable to meet his land annuities.</P>
      <P>The Government, rightly or wrongly, felt that the farmer must live up to all his responsibilities and meet every call that came upon him and, when he was unable to do that, they decided to compel him.  The result was that in regard to land annuities you had Mr. Brown and Mr. O'Neill buying the farmer's stock at an enforced sale at a fraction of their true value.  I want to stress this point particularly for the Minister's benefit.  Even though he is in the Government there is a moral responsibility on the Minister.  When he takes a man's property at much less than its true value, there is a moral responsibility on him and, if the farmer now wants to do what he can and the Government are satisfied that he is not a deliberate law breaker, there is the moral responsibility on the Government to give the farmer reasonable value for whatever stock or property was seized.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>In a way he has, because the Minister for Agriculture assured the Minister for Finance that the farmer was thoroughly well able to pay were it not for the fact that he wore a shirt of some type or kind, and if he had not that shirt he would <Col N="1961" /> be well able to pay.  Therefore that farmer must be made pay, and between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture they broke that farmer, whoever he was. The point I make is that now we have arrived at a certain stage.  The Minister is fully cognisant of all the facts, and he should take a clear view of the position of these farmers who were so broken and at least do something to restock their farms.  There are some of them large farmers, some of them small, but the obligation is upon him, and I should like to know from him what steps he is taking, or if he proposes to take any steps, or if he is satisfied that everything is rosy in the garden and that he does not need to take any steps.  I would like to remind him that that moral law is there for him just as it is for me, and it is the same for the Government as for the individual.  I am not going to stress it any further than that.  I would just like to know if the Minister is examining that particular point and if he is going to do something for the farmers who have been broken in the front line trenches into which the Government put them.</P>

    <P>I regret I was not here when Deputy Childers was speaking.  I have read reports of some speeches of his in the country.  So far as my information goes &mdash;I speak subject to correction&mdash;he made a speech here this evening which would remind me of a story that I heard when I was a young fellow. A young student left college and he was talking big about farming. An old parish priest was listening to him.  He listened very attentively while the young fellow talked wisely and well and criticised somebody who might be described as an average farmer.  He said: &ldquo;That man does not know anything about farming, because, if he did, he could do so-and-so, and it would be far better.&rdquo;  The parish priest said: &ldquo;You are right; he is a bad farmer; as a matter of fact, I was just thinking that he does not know the difference between a ewe and a wether, and, surely to goodness, you know that?&rdquo;&ldquo;I do, well,&rdquo; replied the young man. &ldquo;Well, just tell me what is a wether,&rdquo; said the priest.  &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; was the reply, <Col N="1962" />&ldquo;sure everybody knows that.&rdquo;&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said the parish priest, &ldquo;but I want you to tell me.&rdquo;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the young fellow, &ldquo;it is quite easy to tell you that.  It is a heifer that has had her first calf.&rdquo;&ldquo;That is right,&rdquo; said the parish priest, &ldquo;you should take up farming because you would make an absolute success of it.&rdquo;  Now Deputy Childers comes in and tells the farmers of this country and the people of this country what they should do to make farming a success.  When I heard Deputy Childers speaking here that story that I have told came to my mind.</P>

      <P>Then I have only, in these circumstances, to ask the Minister for Agriculture to see to it that he is not influenced by any so-called economist, whether he is on the Banking Commission or elsewhere, but that he will try to maintain the present farming population of this country in the position that they fought hard to get and keep.  By doing that, by maintaining these small farmers where the best people in the world have been produced&mdash;including men like the Minister and you yourself, Sir&mdash;he will maintain the stock that has given you your doctors, your priests, your solicitors and every fine type that this or any other country could produce. Break that farming stock and you will break the best thing that this country has.  I ask the Minister to see to it that whatever steps he takes in dealing with this problem he will take them with this object in view&mdash;that of maintaining this farming stock.</P>
      <P>I had not intended to speak at such length and I am sorry for detaining the House so long.  If I were not interrupted I would make one point, but Deputy Childers does not like it.  I bow to your ruling.  But I point out again to the Minister for Agriculture that he has the responsibility on him of maintaining that type of farming in this country, because in doing that he will be maintaining all the things that this country has ever regarded as of paramount importance&mdash;a fine peasantry, a nation's pride.  Let him keep that there.  The present policy of the Government is to break that poor fellow&mdash;to give him no help whatever. I am aware that some relief in rates has been given but it does not point in the right way.  The Minister tells us that he is spending £40,000 upon fertilisers.  I can get 10/- of that just as well as the poor small farmer down the road.  Why should I?  I say, therefore, that the Minister should examine that question very carefully.  The farmer should be given that which he is entitled to and deserving of.  That is what the farmer should get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BridgetMRedmond" hpid="Mrs. Redmond Mrs. Redmond">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Redmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to speak at any length on this Estimate, which has been already discussed for <Col N="1965" /> several days.  But there are a few points to which I would like to refer. The main thing is that the farmer should not have been pressed to pay rates or annuities during the economic war.  As has been pointed out already, the farmer has no longer the stock by reason of the fact of those seizures for rates and annuities and the forced sales throughout the economic war. But the economic war is now past and done with: I do not mean to have a rehash of it again.  But it is necessary to explain that the economic war is the reason why the farmer finds himself unable to make up the annuities and the rates that are now due.  I was told on several occasions during the last few months that no matter what help the farmer is given now by the Government it is useless to thousands of them because they have no stock, having lost it in the economic war, and they have not the wherewithal to meet their liabilities.  As the farmers now stand they have neither capital nor stock.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that a commission has been set up to inquire into the position of the farmer and to suggest means of helping him out and putting him on his feet.  I think while that commission is sitting it should be made possible that the farmer should be no longer pressed for the arrears of annuities.  The same thing might be said in the matter of rates.  As a matter of fact I was told recently by one farmer that at a particular fair he got good prices for his cattle.  &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what use is that, because on the one hand I had to pay most of it away in annuities, and there was the rate collector staring at me from the other side while I was selling the cattle?&rdquo;  That man finds himself in an impossible position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This country cannot find it possible to find money for every class of person who finds himself in want.  But I put it to the Minister that the farmer is the main stay of this country, and unless he is put on his feet everything else goes down.  There is one way in which the farmer can be helped, and that is by relieving him of his arrears of annuities.  The Agricultural Commission is sitting in the hope that it will be able to suggest some way of <Col N="1966" /> putting the farmers on their feet. Much has been said about feeding stuffs, the cost of living, and the cost of the farmers' machinery.  I do think that with these two other points being dealt with in a business like way, the farmer would be able to meet the liabilities and calls now upon him. Actually he has not got the capital to furnish his farm with the necessary implements.  Those implements cost a high price now on account of the extra tax.  I think something should be done to put those things within the reach of every farmer, whether he be large or small.  In regard to artificial manures, it has been mentioned that the 10/- grant is of no use to the small farmer, who does need the manure for the betterment of his land.  That is true, because those farmers cannot buy a ton of any kind of foodstuff, much less manure for the land, although their land needs the manure far more than the land of the well-to-do farmers.  I suppose there are some well-to-do farmers in the country.  The whole matter should be carefully examined and revised in order to devise some way of putting the small farmer&mdash;who has been down and out for the last few years&mdash;again on his feet.</P>
    <P>There is one other branch of the farming industry in which I am interested, and that one is the pig industry.  Much has been said about it, and at this late hour I do not intend to have a re-hash of it.  At the same time I think that a revision of the Pigs Marketing Board would do an enormous amount of good both for the producer and the consumer.  There is some sort of loss in between, from the time it leaves the producer until it reaches the consumer, and none of us is quite clear exactly how it comes about.  The farmers have many grievances in this respect.  The pig dealers formerly kept the fairs in the small towns of this country going, but those fairs are now practically finished, and that is due to this Pigs Marketing Board.  It is not doing good for anyone&mdash;certainly not for the producer, who finds that he is no longer the controller of his own pig.  The pigs have to be graded, and the producer is not <Col N="1967" /> satisfied with the way in which this grading is done.  He feels, in a word, that he is being &ldquo;done.&rdquo;  That is putting it very bluntly, but it is a fact. I have been told on numerous occasions that there is something radically wrong with this system of grading, and that it should be as it used to be, that the pigs should be graded alive rather than dead.  The farmer has no redress.  He is simply told that his pigs belong to class B or class C.,&mdash; pigs which possibly belong to class A.  He has no redress.  He simply has to take what he gets, and there is no use crying over spilt milk. I think the Minister should look into this particular matter, and on careful examination he will find that I have been stating the facts of the case.</P>
    <P>Another problem which we have to face is the matter of emigration.  We all know why it is happening; it is simply because the people cannot get a living on the land.  It is not that they particularly want to go to England or any other place, but simply because they see all this struggling going on at home, and realise that there is no living there for them.  While the cost of living has increased, they are getting a lower price for their produce. To put the whole thing in a nutshell, in this country there never before has been anything like the scarcity of money which there is in the farmers' households at the present time.  Without wanting to make any political kudos out of anything I may say, we all must admit that the farmer is genuinely in a bad position, and it is the duty of the Minister and the Department to find some way by which his hardships can be alleviated.  If the Minister will examine those few facts he will realise that something must be done in order to preserve the farmer, who is the mainstay of this country.</P>

      <P>I should like to say a few words on this very important Estimate.  I think it is agreed on all sides that the farming industry is a very important one in so far as this country is concerned, and I should like to ascertain from the Minister whether the position of agriculture to-day is anything better than it was six or <Col N="1968" /> seven or eight years ago; whether the industry as a whole is giving more employment to-day, than it provided say, seven years ago, because when all is said and done, the acid test of the success or non-success of any industry is the number of people earning a living in that industry.  So far as I can ascertain the facts, I am of opinion that employment on the land is much lower to-day than it had been in the past 10 or 11 years, and I think it is the duty of the Minister for Agriculture to ascertain the reasons for that reduction in employment.  I distinctly remember, when the Minister was hot on his scheme of wheat growing in this country, one of the members on the Front Bench of the Government gave it as his opinion that when the wheat scheme was in full swing it would provide employment for an extra 20,000 or 30,000 agricultural labourers.  That Front Bench member on that occasion must have been convinced that that would be so; otherwise he would not have made that statement.  I should like to know from the Minister at the conclusion of this debate what extra employment, if any, the growing of wheat has given.  I am not expressing any opinions as to whether it is wise or unwise to grow wheat.  I believe in the national interest it would be good policy to grow a certain amount of wheat, but then we have to consider the cost to the nation as a whole and the hardships imposed on other sections of the community.  We also have to bear in mind the fact that even if we grew all the wheat necessary for the needs of the people of this country we would thereby absorb only about a million acres of land.  As we have from 13,000,000 to 15,000,000 acres of arable land in this country, I should like to know what we are going to do with the balance.  As I said, I want to know whether there has been that increase in employment which we were promised on that particular occasion. I want to know whether even an extra thousand have been employed.  In fact, is the position at the moment such that, instead of an increase, there has been a decrease?</P>

    <P>Everybody must know that agriculture has experienced a very trying time <Col N="1969" /> during the last four or five years.  In fact, one might liken it unto a very healthy man who, in say the year 1932, was struck down with a very serious illness which lasted for four years.  Nobody would expect that man to have the same vitality to pursue his ordinary employment as he had prior to his illness.  The farmer is in that position.  He endured an agricultural illness during the three or four years of the economic war, and, although he has recovered his strength somewhat, he is still badly bent.  I think it is up to the Minister for Agriculture to take some steps to put those farmers in the same position as they were in prior to the commencement of the economic war.  The Minister ought to consider the best means of helping the farmers at the present time.  I am not one of those who advocate the granting of <Col N="1970" /> subsidies or loans.  I find myself more or less in agreement with Deputy Belton that possibly it would have been better for the farmers of this country if they had been allowed to remain in their old position, that is if they had been allowed to pursue their own line of agricultural policy, the line which they believed would pay them best, but unfortunately the Government started to subsidise them and to change their policy.  I think that was the first downfall of the agricultural industry in this country.  I move to report progress.</P>
    <P>Progress reported; the Committee to sit again to-morrow.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until to-morrow, Wednesday, 10th May, at 3 p.m.</P>
