      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the reason for an order made by him prohibiting the removal of material from the foreshore north and south of Cahore Point, County Wexford; whether he is aware that this order is causing great hardship in the locality, as it has been an established custom for people living within six miles of the shore to draw material from this beach; whether any of the persons likely to be affected by the order were notified of the intention to make it; and whether the Minister is prepared to receive evidence from persons so affected with a view to considering the rescission or amendment of this order.</P>

      <P>I have made no order prohibiting the removal of beach material from the foreshore mentioned in the first part of the question.  The other parts of the question do not, therefore, arise.  The question probably owes its origin to the steps recently taken to bring the provisions of the Foreshore Act, 1933, to the notice of persons, found removing beach material without the authority of a licence granted under that Act.</P>

      <P>So far as information, under the first part of the question, for the years 1934-5 to 1937-8 is concerned I would refer the Deputy to the reply which I gave to Deputy Mulcahy on the 14th June, 1939 (Official Report. Cols. 837-8). Assessments to surtax are still being made for the year 1938-9 and tax will be payable on the 1st January, 1940. It is estimated that the number of surtax payers in respect of the year 1938-9 will exceed 2,500.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take the questions numbered 6, 7 and 8 together. The Deputy apparently misconceives the position of the Minister for Finance in relation to the Industrial Credit Company, which is an independent body operating under the Companies Acts.  It would be unreasonable to expect me to answer questions relating to a broadcast by the chairman of the company, or to the interpretation to be put on statements made in the course of such broadcast.  In reply to specific questions of fact included in the Deputy's questions, the following is the information asked for:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present chairman of the Industrial Credit Company is the nominee of the Minister for Finance pursuant to paragraph 4 (a) of the Schedule to the Industrial Credit Act, 1933.  I gather from the Deputy's question that the said chairman broadcast from Radio Eireann on 23rd March, 1939, on the subject of the industries of Leinster.  I have explained my position in relation to the company and its officers and accordingly I have no responsibility for the broadcast and my permission or approval was not required, sought or given.  The extent to which the chairman or other members <Col N="1962" /> of the board of the company or any of its officers are free to express their uncensored views on questions within the scope of their duties is a matter for the board.  Members of the Civil Service, as the Deputy is aware, are not in the same position.  The nature of their duties and their association with public administration naturally preclude them from giving public expression to their personal views on (these) matters except with the permission of their superiors.  No undertaking other than the Peat Fuel Company has been operating at Ticknevin bog.  It is presumed that the chairman of the Industrial Credit Company keeps himself informed, to the extent to which it is necessary for the proper conduct of the business of the company, of the working and prospects of concerns in which the company is interested.  There is no direct investment of public money in the industries referred to by the Deputy at Athlone, Tullamore, Portlaoighise or Arklow and accordingly I cannot be expected to furnish information on the financial position of these companies.</P>

      <P>As to paragraph (a) of the Deputy's question, I am aware that the Monaghan Curing Company was fined £6 10s. on 13 summonses for failing to make proper returns.  As to (b) the summonses covered the periods March 28th, 1937, to first week in May, 1938; the week commencing November 29th, 1937, and the 11 weeks beginning 17th January, 1938, and ending April 2nd, 1938.  The sums withheld from producers, therefore, covered a longer period than two months and were in fact greater than the amount quoted by the Deputy.  In regard to (c) as far as records are available the sums withheld over the periods referred to in (b) would appear to amount to approximately £450 and arrangements have been made under which these sums have been or are being refunded to the pig suppliers.  As to (d), in May, 1937, a loan of £10,000 was made to the company under the Trade Loans (Guarantee) Acts.  I have not at my disposal the particulars for which the Deputy asks in paragraph (e).  As to (f), the company was not charged with or convicted of fraud.  As to (g), the answer is in the negative, and as to (h) the answer is in the affirmative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This question, which is one of some difficulty, has been raised recently in correspondence by various Deputies and is at present under consideration by the Land Commission. All allottees do not require cowsheds which comply with the regulations of the Milk and Dairies Act, 1935, and to equip every holding with such accommodation would seem to involve the Land Commission in unnecessary expense. Out-offices, with other buildings, are in most cases built by contract and where an allottee desires a departure from the standard plan it is usually arranged that any additional cost will be borne by him.  Normally the Land Commission would have no information that an allottee intended to engage in the sale of milk.  In the present standard plans of the Land Commission for out-offices, the cowsheds are an integral part.  In order to conform to the Milk and Dairies Act Regulations the cowsheds should be erected some distance apart from the other offices, and the extra cost of such separate cowsheds would if made general and borne by the State entail a considerably increased financial liability.</P>

This Bill is being introduced immediately prior to the Dáil going into recess, and as the matter is mooted I think the Taoiseach ought to give the House some information as to what is intended. The Long Title, as shown here, suggests the putting up of an institute which will supersede, to some extent, our universities.  The Title says:</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is almost impossible to deal with a matter of this sort without entering into a discussion of it.  The point is this: With regard to Celtic studies, it is quite clear that, if we want to do certain work, we want something in addition to what is provided at present in the universities, in the Royal Irish Academy, and in some other institutions which we have for the purpose of advancing Irish studies and Celtic studies generally.  At the present moment, there is a huge mass of Irish manuscripts, particularly those relating to early modern Irish, lying unedited.  For the proper study of those, and for their publication, we require an expert body of people at work over a considerable period of time.  We have this situation at the present time: We have turned out from the Celtic faculties in the universities young men who show promise from the point of view of Celtic or Irish scholarship.  Those, after spending a period of years in the university, and after some of them, for example, get travelling studentships and spend a number of valuable years of their lives in the study of the language, go into the Civil Service or occasionally into business or into the professions. The result is that those people, who are badly needed as scholars, to pursue work of a scholarly character, are lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead of providing scholarships of that sort it would appear to us to be very much better if the best of them&mdash; those people who were really fitted&mdash; could be availed of under expert direction to make available that large mass of material which is so necessary in order to give a literary background to the spoken language.  It is bound to enrich the spoken language, and it is work which ought to be undertaken in a systematic way.  The only way in which we can see that it could be done would be to get a number of experts, in the Irish language particularly, and put them in charge, getting from time to time those people who show that they are specially fitted for work of <Col N="1968" /> the kind indicated, and putting them to work on those documents, and editing them.  We want, therefore, expert direction and expert knowledge.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, I think there is work to be done somewhat of the type of the work that was done by the School of Irish Learning in the past. Those who would be in the institute and would be directing research could from time to time give public lectures in the two universities.  In fact I think it should be made a part of their duties to give public lectures in the universities in regard to these particular matters.</P>
    <P>The institute, therefore, would be of a two-fold character.  It would have, in the first place, the systematic publication of these documents.  It would have the provision of suitable text books.  For example, there is no doubt that we want authoritative grammars. There is a need for a scientific examination also of the spoken language whilst the language is still spoken in a state of purity by people who have practically no other language. You have, therefore, the production of the texts, and the examination of this mass of material.  You have the production of textbooks of standard types, such as grammars and dictionaries, and you have the scientific examination of the spoken language. In addition, you have the duty of giving lectures.  I think there should be public lectures, open not merely to be public lectures, open not merely to students in the colleges at which the lectures would be given, but to members of the public qualified to avail of them.</P>
    <P>It is in no sense intended to replace the existing universities.  The existing universities have two main aims. One is to teach and the other is to conduct research.  But, if you want to have this particular type of work done systematically, and if the State should, as I think it should, take over responsibility for seeing that it is done systematically for a time, I see no way in which it can be done except by the establishment of an institute of this kind.  It is not unusual in university centres to have institutes specialising in work which is also being done in a less specialised way in the universities, <Col N="1969" /> and the establishment of this school, so far from being likely in any way to interfere with the work done, for example, in Celtic studies in other colleges here in Dublin, is much more likely to stimulate the work that is being done there.  If we establish an institute of this kind, it would be well to have the framework of such a kind that, if at any particular time it was desirable from the public point of view to add other schools, there would be room within the framework for the establishment of such schools.  For that reason there is included in the scheme an enabling power to add other schools, if the need or opportunity from the point of view of public service arose.</P>
    <P>One of the purposes of the institute will be to attract here from countries abroad people interested in Celtic studies.  On account of the large mass of material available and the part that the ancient Irish language, particularly, plays in Celtic studies, I think that we ought to be a world centre for Celtic studies.  We ought to aim at making the institute one to which scholars from every part of the world who are interested in Celtic studies would come.  If there are people abroad who have a reputation, the purpose of this institute would be to enable to be brought here, as used to be the case in the days of the School of Irish Learning, scholars from abroad to give courses of lectures here.  But the main purpose would be to have a centre which would attract Celtic scholars from all parts of the world. In fact, it ought to be the beginning of trying to get back a little of the reputation which we once had as a centre of learning.  The stress under which the universities work prevents them from specialising to the extent to which the institute would be able to specialise.</P>
    <P>There is another direction in which I think we ought to aim at attracting students and occupying an important position, and that is in the realm of science.  In experimental science there are tremendous difficulties.  It would be of great value to have an institute doing advanced experimental work. But the equipment would be altogether <Col N="1970" /> beyond our means to do modern experimental physics.  Research work would require equipment altogether beyond our means.  There is, however, a branch of science in which you want no elaborate equipment, in which all you want is an adequate library, the brains and the men, and just paper. We have already in the world an important place, or had in the past an important place, in mathematics and theoretical physics.  The name of Hamilton is known wherever there is a mathematical physicist or a theoretical physicist.  This is the country of Hamilton, a country of great mathematicians.  We have the opportunity now of establishing a school of theoretical physics which would be specialised in the same way as the school of Celtic studies can be specialised, and which, I think, will again enable us to achieve a reputation in that direction comparable to the reputation which Dublin and Ireland had in the middle of the last century. There are people who are available as professors or fellows, or whatever name we wish to give them in that school. I do not want to go into that matter now, because it is only when we have the Bill before us and the scheme completely copper-fastened, so to speak, that we will be in a position to mention names.  But I know that we will be able to get three men of world reputation in that particular branch to start with.  I venture to say that, when it is established, from the point of view of the eminence of the people in it, there will be no school in the world which can say it has better direction or better material than will be afforded by the professors or fellows who will be in the theoretical physics school.</P>
    <P>There are other directions, too, in which we might reasonably hope to establish ourselves here as a centre of higher studies from a world point of view.  I am not going to mention any of them now.  Some may suggest themselves to other people, but there might be difficulties in connection with some of them which, in my opinion, do not exist here with regard to the two schools it is proposed to found.  These will not be degree-giving institutions <Col N="1971" /> of any kind.  They will be devoted solely to the advance of learning and the establishment of the reputation of our country as a centre of learning, which will bring students of the postgraduate type from abroad.  I do not think we have any such at present except in certain branches.  This is to attract such students, and to establish this country as an intellectual centre in regard to certain matters.  It originated really in regard to the school of Celtic studies, and the idea is, in providing for Celtic studies, to utilise the opportunity we have with regard to theoretical physics, and generally to provide the framework if, at any time, it would be desirable to add schools of a similar character.</P>

      <P>I suggest to the Taoiseach that it does require very great consideration if a school of Celtic studies, such as has been indicated, should be divorced from the work of the National University, and I suggest to him that, between this and the time the final draft of the measure is put before the House, a very substantial case must be made before such divorce takes place.  With regard to the school of theoretical physics, I think it was Bougaud who when a school of civics was being instituted in French State schools as a substitute for religious instruction wrote: It was <Col N="1972" />&ldquo;a pale flower without a root but not perhaps without a perfume&rdquo;. The development of a school of theoretical physics in this country at the present time would merit the same remarks in view of the position disclosed in the Education Department report on the position of mathematics in the primary schools and the recent change in regard to mathematics in secondary schools.</P>

    <P>This Estimate is introduced in connection with the establishment of a representative of this State in Canada. When I was speaking a year ago, I think it was, I indicated that one of the developments that I foresaw was an exchange of diplomatic representatives, with countries in which there was a large Irish population. Canada and Australia suggest themselves immediately in that connection. I am not quite sure if I indicated at the time that I proposed in the near future to try to secure an exchange of representatives between ourselves and Canada.  This Estimate, and the announcement recently of the appointment of a representative to Canada, show that my hopes have materialised.  Canada is already a very important State in the world and, from its position, its size and general resources, it is likely to be still more important in the future.  A large section of Canada's population can trace their origin to this country and, consequently, I think it is advisable that we should have the representation for which the Estimate provides.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to go at any length here into the importance of the establishment of these diplomatic relations.  The Canadian Government and our Government&mdash; Canada and Ireland&mdash;have been all the time on the most friendly terms and we hope that the establishment of direct diplomatic relations will improve those good relations, if that were possible, and will ensure that they will long continue.  I would like to take this opportunity of expressing the goodwill of the Government, and the goodwill of the Parliament and of the Irish people to the Government and the people of Canada.  I know that <Col N="1982" /> the House will rejoice at the fact that the project which I have indicated has been brought to a successful conclusion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly, so far as this side of the House is concerned, we would be anxious to join with the Government in expressing goodwill and, indeed, admiration for the Dominion of Canada, and I think it will be a source of gratification to all sections of the community that we should enter into closer relationship with that great country than that which we even at present enjoy.  I am glad to hear that steps are being taken also to solidify and strengthen the bonds that associate us with Australia, where there is also a very great number of our people.  On a recent visit to that country I discovered that one in four of the total population regarded themselves as being persons of Irish birth or Irish extraction.  It is also true that in New Zealand one in seven claims the same associations, and I think we ought to consider seriously the desirability of extending the same association, which is here indicated, to that country as well.</P>
      <P>There are those who may take the view that the immediate financial return of such an exchange of representatives will not be commensurate with the outlay.  That I believe to be an obscurantist view, because the establishment of close relations with outside countries, very frequently, may be measured more effectively by results other than those measurable in terms of money, and, as the Taoiseach has pointed out, in the case of Canada and Australia, we are not dealing with foreign countries: we are dealing with countries that look back in a large degree to this country as their mother country, and the action we take to-day emphasises the intimate bond that binds us to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to know from the Taoiseach, explicitly, when we may expect to receive the Canadian High Commissioner in this country, and, secondly, I should like to know from him whether negotiations are proceeding with the Commonwealth of Australia with a view to sending a <Col N="1983" /> High Commissioner here, and whether the Government has considered the desirability of opening similar negotiations with the Dominion of New Zealand.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the questions asked by the Deputy, I expect that there will be an exchange of representatives, within a reasonable time, and that the Canadian representative will be sent here then, but I cannot give the precise date at the moment.  With regard to Australia, we have not entered into negotiations in that matter.  I simply indicated that, on account of the fact that Canada and Australia and, to a certain extent, New Zealand, were countries in which there was a large Irish population&mdash;and referring to what I said a year ago&mdash;these were countries with which, naturally, we would wish to establish diplomatic relations as early as possible.  We would have to consider the question as to what would be a suitable time, and, naturally, we should have to enter into consultations in advance, more or less informally and unofficially, in order to find out whether it would be possible for the Australian Government to consider the matter, and also to ascertain if we are in a position to consider the matter ourselves.  I do not think I can go any further than that at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of New Zealand, naturally, will arise at a later stage, and I think that the same considerations which we will have to give in the case of Australia will hold in the case of New Zealand.  It is true to say, of course, that it is a mistake to try to estimate in terms of pounds, shillings and pence, the value of representation of this sort, but we have to consider, generally, our means in these matters, and we have to move according as our resources will permit. I think that this is about as far as we can go at the moment.  However, naturally, I shall see whether, if we were in a position to adopt the course suggested by the Deputy of sending representatives to Australia, they would consider the matter, and they would also have to consider questions <Col N="1984" /> such as we have to consider, as to means and so on.  I would endeavour to find out informally whether the time is opportune to make an approach in that matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In that connection, will the Taoiseach also bear in mind that a special bond of sympathy exists between this country and the Union of South Africa?  The Taoiseach will remember that they are not unmindful that, in their time of tribulation, they had a sympathetic friend in Ireland, and I think they have given evidence since then that they remember that and feel that it establishes a special link between us.  When the further consideration, to which the Taoiseach has referred, comes to be given, will he also bear in mind the case of the Union of South Africa and consider whether they might not also be included in the scope of this proposal?</P>

      <P>Quota No. 34 Order related to electric filament lamps.  One of the provisions of the Order was designed to exclude from the prohibition affected by the Order lamps constructed and intended to be energised from a dry battery. The Revenue Commissioners found, however, that that particular provision enabled some importers to evade the general purpose of the Order. Futhermore, they reported that they found that, in practice, it was impossible to distinguish between lamps intended to be energised from a dry battery and lamps which would be supplied from a dynamo.  The purpose of the Amendment Order, therefore, is to remove the exemption granted by the original Order and thus prevent that method of evasion of the purpose of the Order.</P>

      <P>If that is so, what actually happens is this: that three or four warriors get control of the entire supply, the price shoots up, and they reap a golden harvest.  I admit freely that the individual who pays 50 per cent. for a flashlight bulb is not going to be crushed by that burden of expense, but I cannot see why the legislative powers of this House should be used in order to line the pockets of the fly-by-nights who come in here and set themselves up as pedlars of these various commodities.  That is what <Col N="1986" /> happened in connection with quota order after quota order.  The legitimate traders cannot get their supplies, and these fly-by-nights and small pedlars grab the whole control of a certain commodity and hold the legitimate trader to ransom.  The Minister's reply to that is: &ldquo;Well, let the legitimate trader refer the matter to the Prices Commission.&rdquo;  Now, nobody is going to go to the expense, worry and annoyance of referring such a matter to the Prices Commission when the total amount involved is perhaps ¾d. or 1d. on each flashlight bulb concerned, but the whole thing means that our community contributes to four or five pedlars a very substantial annual income under these infernal quota orders.  The Minister has admitted in the Trade Agreement made with Britain that the quota system has to go.  Nevertheless these idiotic orders are rehabilitating the evils that flow from the quota system.  These evils are not unique to this country.  In every country in the world in which the quota system has been introduced, that system has been exploited by the most unserupulous elements in the community. This instance of the bulbs is not going to make any great difference but it is well to avail of this occasion to warn the Minister that this quota scandal has got to stop, that if it continues steps will be taken to collect the names of the exploiters of these quota orders who are sheltering behind the Minister to rob consumers in these countries and that they will be exposed.</P>

If the Deputy cares to invest 1/- for that purpose, he can get all the information he requires. The law provides that he must get that information.  I cannot possibly withhold it from him.  The procedure under which the register is formed is laid down by law.  The law provides that those who are ordinarily engaged in the business of importing particular commodities must get preference in the allocation of licences.  Therefore, established traders are by statute protected against those other people against whom the Deputy has fulminated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that Dáil Eireann hereby approves of Control of Imports (Quota No. 38) Order, 1939. This is a new quota order recently made and it applies to wood screws and metal screws with a slotted head and a tapered thread.  As the House is aware, the manufacture of wood screws was protected here by a customs duty which was imposed at the comparatively high rate of 75 per cent. <i>ad valorem.</i>  It was found, however, that the duty was ineffective against certain Continental countries which met the duty by allowing 75 per cent. discount off their list price for goods sent to this country.  In such circumstances, it seemed that a prohibition of imports or a quantitative regulation of imports was a desirable course to follow but as a quantitative regulation of import of goods from the United Kingdom would be contrary to the spirit of the Trade Agreement made with that country, it was necessary to have consultations with the Government of the United Kingdom first.  These consultations were held and this quota order was made with the consent of the Government of the United Kingdom. It provides for a restriction of importation of all forms of wood screws capable of being manufactured <Col N="1988" /> here.  The balance, which consists of certain classes of screws not used here in such large quantities as to permit of their economic manufacture, will be imported from the United Kingdom.</P>
      <P>When making this arrangement certain agreements were entered into. One of them was that the price of screws, whether manufactured here or imported, would be the same here as in Great Britain.  That arrangement has been brought into effect and has resulted in a reduction of 10 per cent. on such screws sold here.  The full requirements of all screws, whether manufactured here or imported, will be supplied through the same organisation so that adequate machinery will exist to ensure that supplies will be available of all classes and all types and sizes of screws without any difficulty arising for the retail or wholesale distributors of them.  The result of the order is that the manufacture of screws, which had commenced here and which had ceased for a time because of Continental imports, has been resumed and will be developed until it has reached the stage at which every class of screw capable of economic manufacture here will be manufactured within the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The practice of <i>suppressio veri</i> in this House has now been reduced to a fine art.  The implication of this motion is that a big bad wolf on the Continent, when Irish Wire Products, Limited, Limerick, started to make screws, by giving a large discount under-cut Irish Wire Products, Limited, and that nobody ever saw a Continental screw until this big bad wolf came along and forced them down our throat.  What are the facts? Nobody but a lunatic has ever used a Nettlefold screw in this country for the past 20 years.  Guest, Keen and Nettlefold bought the old Chamberlain family patent which made a fortune for the late Joe Chamberlain.  That patent showed merely how to put a point on the end of a screw.  They became screw manufacturers in Great <Col N="1989" /> Britain.  They made magnificent screws. I bought hundredweights of them in my day but they could never compete with the Continental screw.  For the rough carpentry job, a sane man would never use a Nettlefold screw because it would be there in his great grandson's time when the woodwork came to be taken down.  They were much too good for work of that kind. For ordinary work, 90 per cent. of the screws used were Continental screws.</P>
      <P>What has happened?  The boys floated a company in Limerick.  To my sorrow I went and put some money into it.  They then discovered that they could not make nails without charging about 80 per cent. more than the price at which you could buy nails on the Continent.  We plundered the public in the price of nails and screws and we are now being asked by the Minister to give a licence to plunder them still further.  If supplies of raw materials from the Continent give out this industry will go up the spout, with all the other crazy schemes for which the Minister for Industry and Commerce has been responsible.  Has it struck anybody as a bit odd that old man England, having stipulated against quota orders in the Trade Agreement has suddenly relented and said, in regard to screws, that a quota order may be permitted.  It was sabotage, it was playing England's game, it was striking at the foundation of an Irish Ireland, to protest against these quota orders in former days.  Now we are bound to contribute to a tariff of 75 per cent. to keep out the big bad wolf.  We had been putting on a quota to protect the quivering person of this young Irish industry in Limerick, and then we discovered that it had grown a beard overnight, and that it is our old friend, Guest, Keen and Nettlefold from the South of England.  The quota that was put up to keep this wicked man out of the country, the tariff that was raised to enable Irish industry to plunder the consumers of this country, is now being used to enable Guest, Keen and Nettlefold to do it as it never was done before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, I will be told that screws here are to be sold at the same price as in England.  Anybody with any knowledge <Col N="1990" /> of the carpentry trade knows that there are 140 different types of screws, and that in each type of screws there are about ten lengths, so if I buy a package of screws for sixpence I have got to satisfy the Prices Commission that they are of a strength and quality and length similar to a package of screws sold in Bristol.  The difference in the price may be a penny, and I am told that my ability to do that and to recover from Guest, Keen and Nettlefold, situated in Limerick, one penny, is sufficient guarantee to ensure that their undertaking to sell screws at the same price as they are selling them in England will be carried out.  Will anybody believe that?  Here again, no individual citizen of this State is going to be crippled by the extra cost of screws and nails, because none of us buys very many screws or nails in our lifetime, but it all contributes to the fact that the cost of houses is getting dearer.  It all contributes to the fact that the manufacture of goods in Irish factories is being made dearer because their raw materials are being made dearer.  It all contributes to the fact that another company in this country is being given a wide open licence to rob the consumers in this State.</P>
    <P>Sooner or later we have got to face the fact that every penny of public money, or money from the citizens' pockets, that is invested in companies which depend for their survival on a licence to rob the community, is money thrown away, because the community may stand that for a certain time but they are not going to stand it for ever.  There is no reason on God's earth why I or any other citizen should be given a licence to plunder the public through shares in a bacon company or in a nail factory either.  It is unjust.  It is contrary to public policy, and it is fated to arouse an opposition from the public in this country which will eventually overwhelm not only this kind of &ldquo;cod&rdquo; factory but also good industrialists, who, if given a fair chance, would be able to do a useful job.  If the Irish people are led ultimately to believe that every industry <Col N="1991" /> is run in this country by chancers who only want to shelter behind a quota to rob the consuming public, ultimately the public will come to lump all Irish industrialists together and say &ldquo;They are a bad lot.&rdquo;  To do so would be a libel on many good citizens in this State who have built up good industries, paid good wages, and charged fair prices for their products. All of us know that.  There are individual manufacturers in this country who have done and are doing a good job.  It is this kind of transaction which is besmirching their name.  I submit, in view of the fact that we have to deal here with two import quota orders, and a prohibition order to follow in a moment, that I am legitimately entitled to refer to the consequences of this type of order and the way in which they are exploited.</P>

      <P>Those quota orders are authorised by legislation which requires that they be submitted to the House.  On each order, the House is confined to a discussion of that order.  Otherwise the result would be that possibly three times in a week there might be a full-dress debate on tariffs, quotas and effects on industries.  That would make the conduct of business impossible.  The Deputy is confined to the one actually under consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to direct the attention of the House to the abuses that this order makes possible.  We get a control of imports quota order; the next step is that you proceed to dole out licences to certain selected individuals. As the Minister says, anyone who pays 1/- can go and find out who those licencees are.  The number of persons who want to import nails is very limited.  That limited group of persons who want to import nails get together, and they say: &ldquo;Now, boys, let us import the nails, and, having got them in, why cut one another's throats to oblige the purchasers of nails?  If we agree amongst ourselves to screw out of the public the last penny we can get out of them, we will make a killing, and who gives a <Col N="1992" /> damn?&rdquo;  They proceed to make the killing.  The difficulty in exposing those matters in Dáil Eireann is that it is dreadfully difficult to find out the facts.  I need hardly tell the House that the restricted group of warriors who exploit those quota orders are not going to come and tell me about it. Very rarely, I do discover what they are up to.  I know of one quota order, analogous to this, which is at present being used to steal from the people of this country 80 per cent. of the cost price of the commodity, the stuff being brought in here at the present time at 12/- a cwt., and the public being charged £1.  The importers will cock snoots at you if you remonstrate with them, and tell you if you do not like to take it from them you can so-and-so do without it; that there is only half a dozen of them bringing it in, and if you do not deal with them you can send your customers elsewhere.</P>

      <P>All I say is that the ability with which the Minister waxes eloquent without dealing with any of the relevant facts&mdash;surely that is parliamentary language&mdash;is magnificent. The Minister says that he has no hand, act, or part in preventing all and sundry importing anything they want if they choose to register.  That is strictly true within certain limits.  Anyone who goes for the register at the proper time can get on it.  Suppose he does, he is first asked: &ldquo;How much of that stuff did you bring in during the last two years&rdquo;?  He says: &ldquo;None, because I could get my supplies on the quays in Dublin.&rdquo;  Then he is told: &ldquo;Your quota is three onions, and in importing the onions I may add that no ship which carries the other fellow's onions will carry yours, so you must hire the mail boat, put the three onions on the main deck, transport them to Dublin and sell them if you can.  They will not let you into the fruit market so you can peddle them as best you can.&rdquo;  The normal fellows dealing in onions can get in the usual supply.</P>

      <P>Yes, but they are being brought in at 12/- and sold at £1.  The Minister contends that the right to import those commodities is available for everybody.  How can you import those commodities if you are not in the trade?  What use is it to me to tell me I can get on the importers' register?  What use is it to tell any importer of screws or onions in this State who sells only three bags of screws or onions in the week, that he can import them?  The only man who can import them is the man who can bring in a quantity to justify the freight rate.  The cheapest freight rate from abroad, on screws&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That does not bring the matter into order.  The Deputy should appreciate this fact, that legislation in this House has authorised these orders, and it is obvious that the annulment of that legislation cannot be advocated on every quota order that comes up for approval.  The Chair, therefore, must confine the Deputy to screws, and nail him down to that subject.</P>

      <P>I put it to the House that this order means that a very restricted number of persons who are in a position to buy screws in large bulk are now made monopolists of the screw and nail industry.  In fact, this is going to operate to make Irish Wire Products, Ltd., the sole concessionaires in respect of this commodity and will result in the producers of these commodities making a fortune.  I feel bound to say this: A public man is in a difficulty because, if he speaks strongly, and it is subsequently discovered that he is interested in the concern he is denounced as a hypocrite. This is jam for me personally.  I hold stock in Irish Wire Products, Ltd., a small quantity from the point of view of the company, but a very consider able investment from my point of view. So far as I am concerned, this is jam for me.  I am going to make profits such as I made in the bacon industry.  I want to say now that you ought not to give me the right to rob the community here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I say to you that the companies to which I have referred made rings around the Minister, pulled wool over his eyes, tied him up in a bag, and threw him away, and we robbed the community in spite of him. I tell the House that if this monopoly is given to Irish Wire Products, Ltd., the community will be robbed in exactly the same way as the Prices Commission found that the bacon industry robbed the community in the past.  I say to the House that they ought not to do it.  You ought to go <Col N="1995" /> to these people, if you are determined to protect them, and say to them, &ldquo;What degree of protection do you want; is it 10, 20, 30 or 40 per cent.?&rdquo; If they say that they cannot do it with less than 100 per cent., then I would say to them, &ldquo;Blow up your factory and clear out; you are not a benefit to the country; you are a nuisance.&rdquo;  If they can say that with a modest protection they can develop the industry and build it up here, I would say: &ldquo;There is your protection; produce good goods, charge the British price plus three-quarters of the measure of protection we are giving you, and you will be able to compete with any competitors who come along.&rdquo;  If you say to them, &ldquo;Not only are we going to give an adequate tariff but we are going to prohibit imports altogether,&rdquo; it does not matter what Prices Commission you have or what attempted supervision there is by the Minister, that company will rob the community here, because that company will want to make profits, and it will make them. Every Deputy knows that that is true.</P>
      <P>As I say, our loss as the result of the manufacture of nails and the monopoly therein is not going to be great, but what alarms me about the whole business is that when we prove that this factory or that factory has made excessive profits and the temptation is put in its way by these quota orders, we cannot segregate that factory in the public mind, and instead of protecting the industrial life of the country we inevitably build up in the public mind the idea that every Irish manufacturer is doing the same thing. That is not true.  We have never so alleged.  What I am trying to impress on the Minister is that he should not, by this order, tempt this company or any other company to make excessive profits at the expense of the public and that that is what he is doing, because by putting that temptation in their way and by inducing them to do it, they are going to bring discredit on the entire industrial life of the country, to the ultimate grave detriment of the State as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate a great deal <Col N="1996" /> of what Deputy Dillon has said but, in this particular instance of screws, from information at my disposal I understand that the price for screws is a world price made by Nettlefolds.  I have seen invoices for screws with 83½ per cent. taken off the world price. These are Continental screws.  I seriously suggest that if we are starting an infant industry here and are up against battalions of Continental capital, with low prices, low wages, etc., it would be impossible for us to compete against a firm sending in stuff on the terms I have mentioned if the protection sought is not given.  I am not defending all that is being done under quota orders.  I contend that some quota orders are not justified. But, where there is a definite attempt being made in this country to manufacture articles that are protected, it is a different matter.  My information is that there is a world price for screws laid down by the firm of Nettlefold and from that standard price the invoices stated that 83½ per cent. would be taken off.  How could any Irish factory, starting off compete with that?  We are compelling that factory to pay good wages and have decent conditions of employment, and they are doing it.  If it gets proper protection, I believe that the factory is capable of making good.  But that cannot be done if there is not some protection against the dumping of screws at an uneconomic price.  The British will not send in screws at that price. We have nothing to fear from them.  If it is said that the screws can get in by backdoor methods, that is another matter.  The real menace is the Continental screws which are not made under decent conditions of labour.  In these circumstances, I am suggesting that this is a very necessary precaution and that we ought to approve of this quota order.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy went to the Library and examined our trade and shipping statistics for the last ten or 20 years, he would not make that statement; he would know that it is absolute nonsense.  Unless, of course, the Deputy alleges that our statisticians were fooled by these people who are such nefarious and dishonest men that they will only tell Deputy Dillon about them, or that the Revenue Commissioners were misled by false certificates of origin.  Anyway, so far as the statistics show, more than 80 per cent, in volume and value, of the screws imported here before the duty was imposed came from the United Kingdom.  That is fact No. 1.  Fact No. 2 is that the factory in Limerick has not sold out to Messrs.  Guest, Keen and Nettlefold.  There has been no change in the ownership.  The Deputy could have found that out quite easily in a manner which I do not like to suggest.</P>

      <P>Irish screws.  Deputy Keyes knows a little about this matter.  Screws everywhere are sold at the same price, Dutch screws, Swedish screws, Belgian screws, Irish, English and Ballaghaderreen screws. The difference in the actual cost to consumers was due to very exceptional discount on the price that was allowed in this country, and only in this country, by certain Continental firms exporting screws here.  The Irish firm was unable to compete with screws sold under these conditions. However, the position in future will be that quality for quality, size for size, and quantity for quantity, the price here will be the same as in Great Britain.  The Deputy said we could not expect a young Irish firm coming into the business for the first time to compete on the same terms as old established firms.  Well they are going to do it.  They are going to manufacture screws as good as those manufactured in Great Britain and sell them at the same price.  That is something of which the average Irishman would be proud, and boast of, but Deputy Dillon merely indulged in a tirade.</P>

      <P>The Deputy said that this order was designed to give an <Col N="1999" /> opportunity to make excessive profits in an industry run by &ldquo;chancers&rdquo;. These were the words the Deputy used. If he wishes to withdraw them I will give him ample opportunity.  The Deputy said that eminent people associated with this industry were &ldquo;chancers&rdquo;.  I do not think they are. I think those people who put their capital into an Irish industry are people of enterprise, and I hope it will be successful and that they will get reasonable profits.  It is essential that profits should be earned in successful Irish industries.  I do not think we can develop industries unless profits are made.  I assure the House that the price paid here will be the world price, the price at which screws are sold in other countries, and that is a sufficient guarantee that there will not be excessive profits.  If in the making of screws, quality for quality, size for size, this company makes profits, I say more luck to them.  The Deputy said a few words about quotas in general and tried to make us believe that certain abuses were going to arise out of the operation of the quota order.  The procedure under which quota licences are issued are laid down by law.  The law provides for the establishment of a register and prescribes the principles upon which licences are granted to those names who appear on the register. I notice that the Deputy hops from one foot to the other with extraordinary speed.  When I referred him to the quota order he said that if the name of a newcomer was put on the register he would be given the minimum quota.  That is correct.  In the discussion of item No. 4 the Deputy's complaint was the reverse, but the point of the complaint then was that we were giving licences to newcomers going into a trade to the detriment of old established business.  Which way does the Deputy want it?  He cannot have it both ways.  The practice is well known.  The old established firms who previously imported get the larger licences.  They get licences for quantities in relation to their previous imports as certified by auditors, and new firms coming into the business come in on the basis of the minimum quota for a period.  We think that is <Col N="2000" /> the most equitable way to arrange this matter.  That is what we are doing. May I say that it has won the approval of responsible businessmen that we have come into contact with. It is my experience that it is much easier to operate the control of imports by means of quota orders than by any other method.  It has been my experience that the operation of the control of import orders has secured more general satisfaction amongst the business community than any other method.  I know that the Deputy is not prepared to approve of quota orders at all.  As this factory is in Limerick anything that could be done to improve employment there would be all right.  While the Labour Deputy did not approve of the principle, when it is in Limerick it is all right.  If this factory was in Cork we would have the same speech from a Cork Deputy as Deputy Keyes made.  I can assure Deputy Dillon that we will take all the steps necessary to ensure that the public will not be robbed by persons getting licences to import commodities that are the subject of quota orders. The Deputy should know that we have fairly effective powers.  I must say that our experience has shown that there have been very few attempts at profiteering.  The general conclusion of persons who have been investigating this matter on the Prices Commission is that profiteering practically does not exist.  In one or two cases where excessive charges were being made and we had legal powers we dealt with the matter.  The Deputy need not be so fond of accusing everyone else of that particular form of sin as it does not exist anywhere around Ireland to any extent, any more than it exists in Ballaghaderreen.</P>

      <P>I want to ask a question. Is the Minister aware, when he speaks of world prices for screws of 82? per cent. that since early in the 20th century the price of a variety of standard commodities was fixed in a purely arbitrary method and never <Col N="2001" /> changed.  The practice in this particular trade was to vary the discount. In fact you have archaic prices for screws, and articles like wooden moulds.  The price charged for moulding, such as adorns the Gallery, is the same as when it was made by hand, but discounts are now 70 per cent. and 80 per cent., since they are made by machinery.  The old standard price was not changed.  Moulding can be bought at 7/6 per cwt., less 80 per cent. Screws can be bought at a certain price, less 70 per cent. or 65 per cent. Instead of changing the price of these commodities the discount is moved up and down and prices often bear no relation to the original cost.  It is the same with galvanised netting wire.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Eireann hereby approves of the Sugar (Prohibition of Import) Order, 1939.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, the Sugar (Control of Import) Act of 1936 provides for the making, each year, of an order relating to the importation of sugar&mdash;prohibiting the importation of sugar except where it is subject to the conditions of the order.  In accordance with the arrangement made in 1936 the amount of sugar which is required to be imported has been imported each year by the Irish Sugar Company.  By an arrangement of fees, any profit derived by the Irish Sugar Company on imported sugar is obtained for the Exchequer.  That has been done by an order each year since 1936 and this an order for the same purpose for the year 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would wish to spare the tender feelings of the Minister.  He must excuse me if I again resort to the term <i>suppressio veri.</i>  The Minister, in gentle accents, says that any profits made by the Irish Sugar Company on imported sugar go to the Exchequer, and the innocents abroad, who sit beside him, fold their hands.  Do they realise that the profits referred to by the Minister represent a tax of about 2d. a lb. on sugar?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The total amount last year was £4,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite, but the Minister does not go on to mention the fact that the price of sugar imported by the Irish Sugar Company is 8/- free on quay at Dublin.  Does he deny that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It arrives, free on quay, Dublin, at 8/-.  There is then an excise duty placed upon it of, I think, 11/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, that is true, but it has nothing to do with this order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Wait a moment.  That is only half the story, because we go on to the difference between the price got by the Irish Sugar Company for sugar and the import price of sugar, plus the revenue duty to which I have referred, and that difference, according to the Minister for Finance, on the total sugar consumed in this country, amounts to £1,000,000 sterling per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>But on the imports by the Irish Sugar Company it represents, so far as I am aware, about 10/- a cwt. and is in fact, a further revenue duty levied by the Exchequer on sugar.  It is just another method of introducing a Budget in which you put a shilling on the income-tax and announce that you are not going to put any tax on the breakfast tables of the poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it stop the Deputy if I said that it is estimated that there will be a loss this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You then proceed to enable the Irish Sugar Company to bring in foreign sugar and you collect from them the profit they make upon that sugar, a profit which is measured by the revenue duties which were imposed <Col N="2005" /> on sugar many years ago and which, in fact, correspond to a duty of about 2d. a lb on sugar; and on every pound of sugar that is imported by the Irish Sugar Company, taking into consideration the revenue duty they will pay on it and the profit they will collect from the public, the Treasury will receive, approximately 2d. a lb.&mdash; at least that.  Are Deputies aware of that?  I have not the slightest doubt in my mind that they are not aware of it, and that is why I am trying to inform them of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over and above this, however, I should like to direct their attention to this little wrinkle: Messrs.  Tate &amp; Lyle were one of the principal firms in England that supplied this country with sugar, and they produced what was known as Tate's &ldquo;Brights,&rdquo; which was a coarse sugar that was used extensively in Ireland.  They also produced what was known, I think, as Tate's &ldquo;Crystals,&rdquo; which was 3d. per cwt. cheaper but which is a fine sugar. Our people have always preferred Tate's &ldquo;Brights,&rdquo; however.  It is just a matter of preference.  As between the two, I do not think there is much difference as to the sweetening quality, but our people prefer the coarse sugar. Now, the Irish Sugar Company produce coarse sugar also.  But when you put the Irish sugar beside the Tate's sugar&mdash;that is the Tate's &ldquo;Brights&rdquo;&mdash; the latter looked much whiter than the Irish sugar and the sweetening quality, as we all know from our experience of the Tate Sugar Company, being refined from cane instead of beet and also due to the refining process employed in Great Britain being rather more elaborate than that employed in this country, was very much higher.  The Irish Sugar Company, desirous to avoid a comparison being made between their &ldquo;Brights&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Brights&rdquo; that were imported from England, now refuse to import any of it, and all you can get in this country is the fine sugar because no comparison can be made between that and the sugar offered by the Irish Sugar Company. Incidentally, although this is a minor consideration, the fine sugar is 3d. cheaper and there is 3d. a cwt. more for the Treasury if you bring in <Col N="2006" /> the fine sugar and charge the same price as for Tate's &ldquo;Brights.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This country has become so stupefied by one ruse after another for the plunder of the public for the benefit of the Treasury that they have ceased to be shocked by transactions of that kind.  Nevertheless, lest such transactions should become an every-day custom of this country, it is right, on each occasion when the machinery for carrying these transactions through is brought before Dáil Eireann, that somebody should get up and remind the House that this is all part of a plan to pile up unnecessary expenditure on the backs of our people and deprive our people of many things they might enjoy if their resources were not being squandered in &ldquo;cod&rdquo; schemes such as this resolution is designed to promote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say what is the estimate for the amount of sugar it is proposed to import during the current year?  It is well known to everybody that the acreage under beet is considerably reduced, and would he tell the House what amount of sugar is going to be imported this year under this regulation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the Deputy the information he wants. Deputy Dillon will find it hard to convince the House that he is an expert on everything.  He poses to be an expert on everything, but that pose, of course, destroys his effectiveness.  If he pretended to be an expert on one thing he might get away with it, but when he pretends to be an expert on everything he is just being foolish.  He is not an expert on sugar, at any rate. If he knows anything at all about it, he knows that a lot of what he has just been saying is sheer nonsense.  I do not suppose that the fact that what he says is nonsense worries the Deputy very much.  At least, that is the conclusion I have come to after sitting opposite to him for many years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Until we produce all our sugar we must import some.  We found that it was more convenient for everybody concerned that whatever quantity had to be imported should be imported by the Irish Sugar Company. We were in fact asked by the Irish Sugar Wholesalers to make that arrangement. We made that arrangement and it will continue for this year.  It was recognised that because of the fluctuation in the price of imported sugar, the Irish Sugar Company would occasionally make a profit on imported sugar. In fact last year they made £4,000, a very small profit which has been secured for the Exchequer here. <Col N="2008" /> In this year because the price of foreign sugar is rising, while the price of home manufactured sugar is remaining stationary, we expect that they will make a small loss.  The quantity imported to make good the deficiency in home production may be increased by the fact that some abnormal importation of sugar may be necessary to maintain our stocks of sugar in order to guard against any emergency which may arise.  This order presents a businesslike arrangement. The difference to the Exchequer is negligible and the difference in the price of sugar is also negligible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no point in discussing the whole question of the economics of sugar production.  We know, and everybody knows, that other countries are subsidising the export of sugar for years.  We know that sugar which is sold in Czecho-Slovakia&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking of sugar which we import which is sold at 6d. per lb. in the country of origin and which is sold here at ½d. per lb., it is subsidised to such an extent.  The price which may be paid, irrespective of the customs duty, has nothing to do with the price of sugar.  The Deputy said that we embarked on this scheme for the purpose of putting further burdens on the Irish people.  We introduced this scheme for the purpose of giving the Irish people an additional cash crop, for the purpose of increasing the wealth of the country and to give an outlet for the employment of both men and capital.  We shall continue that programme whether the Deputy likes it or not.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister a straight question and I respectfully ask him for a courteous reply.  Is it correct to say that the difference, from the Exchequer point of view, between <Col N="2009" /> a cwt. of sugar manufactured in Carlow and a cwt. of sugar imported from England is negligible or is it true that on a cwt. of sugar imported the Exchequer gets £1, whereas on a cwt. manufactured in Carlow it gets little or nothing?</P>

      <P>I want to avail of this opportunity, as it will be the only one I shall have, to point out that as a result of this Bill, large tracts of land will be acquired for division in the constituency I represent.  It has been the practice of the Land Commission to give consideration in the division of land to the claims of employees on estates but to my mind a scandalous practice has arisen of late years in that respect.  The landlord or owner of an estate, who may have spite or a feeling of vindictiveness towards an employee, may get word that the estate is going to be acquired and he sacks that man.  The man and, perhaps, his father before him has been working in the place for years but after he is dismissed someone else is put into the job.  I am not going to weary the House with details but in Meath and Westmeath it has happened that men, some of them very old, have been put into positions of that kind six months prior to the division of an estate and have got portions of land and farmhouses when the estate was divided, while men who worked on the estate for years have been thrown out on the roadside.  I want to avail of this opportunity to put it to the Land Commission that there should be a rule that a man should have five years' previous employment on an estate before he gets consideration in its division.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the Committee Stage of this Bill, as well as on the occasion of the Second Reading, various reasons were given for the objections to this measure.  It is a measure which in effect is going to give the Land Commission power to take land anywhere, at any time, for any purpose, and at any price.  We have been concerned for some time past with the general economic conditions which are prevalent in this country.  We will have, later on this evening, a discussion on a report which took something like four years to prepare and submit, a report which covers a wide field in connection with the general economic conditions in this country.  The activities of the Land Commission have been extensive. Something like 40,000 holdings have been created during the last few years. Notwithstanding all that, our net exports&mdash;that is taking our gross exports of agricultural products and deducting from them our imports of agricultural products&mdash;are down £3,000,000, compared with 1931-1932. This particular Department is an expensive Department of State.  If all this did not mean a loss in national <Col N="2013" /> wealth, if we could afford to carry out the proposals which the Land Commission had in view, if, in other words, there were enough land available, then our objections would not have been of the same sort as they are now.</P>
      <P>Where men have bought out their lands, and have been Land Commission annuitants for a long period of years, it being generally conceded by the people of the country and by the Legislature that they had a right to those holdings, we consider it is unjust to take those holdings from them without giving them full and ample market price compensation, or alternatively giving them holdings somewhere else.  The Bill is not perhaps as bad as when it was introduced, but it is bad enough.  The ordinary courts decide the justice of nearly all disputes between persons, and the Government is no greater than any other person, and must obey the laws of justice and of right as well as any other individual in the country.  It has no right to enter into possession of property belonging to other people at a price which is little short of confiscation. If, by reason of their policy, they had conferred immense benefits, if they had increased the productivity and wealth of the country, if they were a national economic proposition, there might be an excuse, possibly even an explanation, for this policy.  The Minister during the course of his speech asked for examples.  I have a particular objection to mentioning names in this House.  I did bring one before the Minister's attention in this House, where there was what he himself subsequently admitted to be a case of injustice. All the people who have to suffer from the works and pomps of the Land Commission do not make their losses public.  Does it follow from that that no cases of injustice have occurred?  Is it likely, having regard to the fact that there have been injustices, that they are not going to continue in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister knows as well as anybody else that no matter how able an institution, no matter how efficient its personnel, or how capable its officials, mistakes occur in administration. There is no provision in this Bill as it stands for dealing with any case of injustice <Col N="2014" /> such as the one I mentioned to the Minister here in the House before. It remains and will remain a case for <i>ex gratia</i> treatment.  Every Department of the State will warn the Minister of the danger of making a precedent of a case of that kind.  They will point out that once you open the door it can never be closed.  They will probably tell him that you cannot make a law for individual cases.  This is not a Bill for individual cases.  This is an all-powerful Bill.  The Minister has no responsibility once it passes; it is handed over to individuals.  Those individuals can justify themselves, in so far as their work under it is concerned, by saying that the law has been passed by us, and that they are merely administering it.  We are opposing this measure.</P>

      <P>Deputy Cosgrave has just stated that this Bill confers power on the Land Commission to take land anywhere, at any time, and at any price.  The 1923 Act did the same thing. Unfortunately, the Acts brought in here up to the moment were not able to deal with cases&mdash;bad cases&mdash;which arose.  That is why this Bill had to be introduced, and Deputy Cosgrave knows that very well.  Nobody knows it better.</P>

      <P>Under £2,000.  Let us take this a step further.  I gave an instance here of the hardships that were endured by the ordinary farmers of the country owing to the manner in which this land was being left lying there&mdash;400,000 acres in my constituency &mdash;with the rates unpaid, as the chairman of the county council can tell us. It was lying there all the time.  There is a sum of £1,700 due on the estate.  We have trick of the loop lawyers coming along and finding loopholes for the purpose of preventing land being acquired.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in possession and I am going to hold it.  This Bill will destroy all that was gained by the sacrifices of our people in the past. What about all the evictions and all the sacrifices made by our people in the past?  Many of them died on the roadside when they were hurled out by the bailiffs, or, if not, they died on hulks between here and New York. Deputy Corry says that this Bill does not mean that there will be confiscation of land.  On the Committee Stage, I endeavoured to have the provisions of this Bill altered, so that when the Lay Commissioners made up a certificate they would at least set forth on the face of the certificate the purpose for which they were taking the land.  The Minister during the Committee Stage resisted that, but when he retired to his office he gave way and afterwards brought in an amendment.  As a matter of fact, the amendment is almost worse than the original provision.  That amendment says:</P>
      <P>It is hereby declared and enacted that the Land Commission have and shall have power to resume, in whole or in part, for any one or more of the following purposes, any holding vested under the Land Purchase Acts in them or in the late Congested Districts Board for Ireland, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(c) for the purpose of increasing the food supply of the country;</P>
      <P>(d) for the purpose of improving or rearranging the holding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At any time the Minister can say that he will take a holding because he wants to increase the food supply of the country.  Deputy Cosgrave has told the House the facts about the actual production.  Even after the Land Commission have increased the number of farms, at a large cost to the taxpayers, the production is going down from day to day both in <Col N="2017" /> quantity and in value.  Does not that negative this provision with regard to food supply?  As a matter of fact I told the Minister already that the food question does not concern the Land Commission at all.  In order to make this Bill plausible and to make it popular an amendment is put in giving the Land Commission power to take land to increase the food supply of the country when everybody knows that the land is producing less than ever it did.  That is due to the Land Act which was enacted in 1933.  The capital and the credit of the farmers are gone as a result of that Act.  I ask every Deputy to vote against this measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy only read a part of the section which was inserted.  It was brought in, as I pointed out at great length, to give the same protection to unvested holdings as vested holdings where they are well worked.  Like some Pressmen, he did not read the full amendment. There was a report which really was not consistent with the facts at all.  I admit that it is hard to blame them, because these things are very involved. But Deputy McMenamin was here when I discussed that.  I was asked by one Deputy on the Committee Stage if I would give legislative effect to an assertion I had made, that any farmer who is working his land properly or, as Deputy Corry stated, putting his labour into it, was not going to be interfered with.  I asserted here definitely that such a person had not been and would not be interfered with.  I admit that it would be wholly undesirable to give the names of people and I did not mean it in that sense. I meant that if any Deputy came to me and let me know of any case I would have it investigated; that is where a person working land properly was interfered with in any way by the Land Commission: and I mean that his land was taken over.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>On account of that amendment which I brought in on the Report Stage, the position is this: <Col N="2018" /> that where a farm is well worked, whether it is vested or unvested, it can only be taken if there is congestion in the immediate neighbourhood.  Of course, it can be taken also for playgrounds and school plots, etc.  In that case, where the Land Commission decide&mdash;I do not know if they ever have decided, but they have the power, and as Deputy Cosgrave said they may do it&mdash;the person whose land is taken is entitled to another holding to the value of £2,000.  If his farm is of greater value he gets bonds for the balance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has no powers.  I did what I was asked to do. I brought in the extra protection that a vested farm would have over an unvested farm.  As to the case Deputy Cosgrave brought up, I do not blame the Deputy or his Government, but I think I am entitled to say that what took place was as a result of legislation passed by his administration.  I refer to the Act of 1931.  Those who passed that Act did not think that what did occur could happen.  I have taken care to amend that section of the Act of 1931, in order to prevent any recurrence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That opens up a very big point.  If Deputy Cosgrave is going to be fair, as I think he means to be, I will be fair.  He will admit that when we brought in the 1933 Act the Opposition insisted that the powers should not be in the individual.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not care to have the power.  I prefer to leave it the way it is.  The Deputy has implied that it might be better the other way. Maybe not.  As to his suggestion that I have the power to deal with it, I <Col N="2019" /> have not.  I was very sorry that anything should turn out as badly as it did under the Act of 1931.  I have made it impossible for a similar thing to occur. We have protected the hard-working farmers whose lands are not vested. That is a big improvement in the position. There is no question of taking land anywhere at any price.  The price is fixed.  There may be difficulties about the price, but that is not a matter for me.</P>

A recurrence of the unfortunate cases is made impossible.  In other ways the position has been improved.  We have dealt with technicalities which held up <Col N="2020" /> the operations of the Land Commission and prevented them doing good work. As to the Banking Commission's Report, whatever land remains to be divided would be for the relief of congestion. That is what we are doing.</P>

      <P>In page 5, to delete Section 9 (2) and substitute a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  At an election of the mayor the following provisions shall apply and have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the proceedings shall begin by the candidate or candidates being proposed and seconded and no person who is not then proposed and seconded shall be eligible as a candidate;</P>
      <P>(b)  where there are more than two candidates duly proposed and seconded, a poll shall be taken;</P>
      <P>(c)  if at such poll a majority of the members of the Council present vote for any particular candidate, such candidate shall be elected to be the mayor;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(d)  If at such poll no candidate receives the votes of a majority of the members of the Council present, <Col N="2023" /> the candidate receiving the least number of votes shall be eliminated and, subject to the provisions of the next following paragraph of this sub-section, a further poll shall be held among the remaining candidates;</P>
    <P>(e)  where there are only two candidates or where, as a result of one or more polls taken under the foregoing paragraphs of this sub-section, all the candidates except two have been eliminated, the question as to which of such two candidates shall be elected to be the mayor shall be put to the Council and whichever of such candidates receives the greater number of votes on such question shall be elected to be the mayor;</P>
    <P>(f)  if from an equality of votes given to two or more candidates any question arises under this sub-section as to which of such candidates is to be eliminated or as to which of such candidates is to be elected, such question shall be decided by lot and accordingly, in respect of every such case, the provisions of Section 83 of the Municipal Corporations (Ireland) Act, 1840, relating to an equality of votes at the election of a mayor shall not apply.</P>
    <P>This amendment is really only a drafting amendment, although it seems rather a long-winded one.

      <P>I am objecting to this Bill because, under the terms of the Bill, and similar City Management Acts, the manager is really the manager of the council, and the council has no control.  We feel that there is certainly room for a manager for purposes of administration, but we are entirely opposed to giving him the executive authority that he has at the moment.  We believe that when you have a manager in a city council or any other administrative council, that manager, first of all, should get the consent of the council for anything that he is going to do.  As things are, we object to being treated merely as rubber stamps and seeing items on the Agenda for two or three weeks, and then being informed that the thing has been done, and that we are to act merely as rubber stamps whether the thing is right or wrong.  We are not opposed to the managerial system, and we are satisfied that, when a manager brings in any concrete or reasonable proposal, no matter what the constitution of the council or corporation concerned may be, the manager can always rely on getting a sufficient majority to back him up in any reasonable proposal, but we think that the Minister should reconsider his attitude in this matter.  At the moment, that control is not in the hands of the administrative council, and it is for that reason we are opposing the Bill.  The manager should be in the same position as, say, the managing director in a big industrial concern, who would consult his directors as to what he proposed to do, and then, having got their consent, would proceed to do it. I think it is quite obvious that in any reasonable body of men you can always rely on them to consent to any reasonable proposal, but we object to a person doing a thing and then <Col N="2025" /> coming along and telling us in the council that he has already done the thing and that, whether we like it or not, it has been done.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to enter into the whole question of the managerial system now.  What is before us at the moment is the question of the Waterford City Management Bill, and I may say that, with regard to the various objections and suggestions that were made to the Minister by the various people with some authority who were representative of the City of Waterford, the Minister has fairly met them, and met them to the satisfaction of those who were instructed from Waterford. In saying that, however, I cannot say that the Waterford City people are enthusiastic about this Bill or that they are enthusiastic about the management system.  Their whole attitude is that they are acquiescing in what they have no power to prevent, and are doing their best to make the City Management Bill, as now proposed to them, as agreeable for themselves and as useful as they can possibly make it in order to carry out, under the managerial system, the work of the City of Waterford.  I am pleased to say that on this matter every reasonable representation has been met by the Minister so far as he could meet them, consistent with the principles for which he stands, and wherever he found that he could meet the wishes of the people there, he has done so.</P>

      <P>There will always be differences upon that question.  You <Col N="2026" /> would never get agreement here in this House or in any municipal council as to how far that matter of control should go.  So far as my knowledge goes, however, the system has worked out satisfactorily in Dublin, in Limerick&mdash;although it is not very long in operation there&mdash;and in Dun Laoghaire. In these three places it has worked out satisfactorily, so far as my knowledge goes, and there has been no trouble.  With regard to Cork, I have had before me for some time amendments suggested by the municipal council, and these are being considered, and a Bill will be brought in at an early date embodying a number of these suggestions.  But I understood that the system was working moderately satisfactorily in Cork City also.  I remember, about three or four years ago, meeting one or two people in Cork who complained that the manager was not consulting the members of the municipal council.  These people were not members of the municipal council, but were evidently in close touch with members of the council. A year or a year and a half later these same people came to me to say that they wanted to withdraw their remarks.  Of course we are all human beings, and human beings differ, and where you may get one manager, perhaps in Cork, Limerick or Dun Laoghaire, who will consult the council on every occasion, and see that he gets the consent of his council to do things &mdash;and things even over which they have practically no control&mdash;other managers might take a different view. As long as we have to deal with human beings we will have these differences in administration.</P>
      <P>My idea would be the same as that of Deputy the Lord Mayor of Cork&mdash;that the Manager should be the chief executive officer of the municipal council in the same way as a managing director might be the chief executive officer of a large industrial concern who would consult his board.  That would be the ideal thing.  It may not be working out 100 per cent. in Cork, but let us hope that, with a little more experience of getting smooth working by proper consultation, the system will move as smoothly in Cork as elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2027" /> I thank Deputy Broderick for his remarks. My only anxiety in this Bill was to meet, as far as possible, the wishes of the people of Waterford who <Col N="2028" /> were interested in the matter and who asked me, as a general feeling, that the system might be applied with advantage to Waterford City, and I brought in a Bill accordingly.</P>

      <P>When the debate adjourned last night, I was endeavouring to set before the Dáil some of the results which had attended, to my mind, ill-judged and ill-advised proposals for solving this major social problem by schemes of monetary expansion and financial manipulation.  I should like to say in regard to that matter that I follow all those attempts with great sympathy, and with the warmest possible desire to see them succeed.  If those who have attempted to better humanity in any country, by no matter what means, were to succeed in that endeavour, undoubtedly they would deserve our gratitude, and I am sure would be remembered through the <Col N="2030" /> ages.  Accordingly, if I endeavour to set before the Dáil what I conceive to have been the results of their endeavours, it is not because I lack sympathy with their objective, but because my judgment&mdash;based upon such information as I have succeeded in obtaining in regard to the results of their measures&mdash;has led me to certain conclusions in regard to the experiments in the particular countries to which I am going to refer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I dealt last night with the position in the United States, and I was dealing with the position as it existed in France during the years 1936 and 1937. I was pointing out that, notwithstanding the recovery measures which had been initiated in France&mdash;measures aiming at the raising of money incomes in order to increase production and employment through increased demands for goods and services&mdash;the measures had failed of their objective in so far as it had not been possible for France to regain even the 1929 level of employment and production.  I pointed out that, notwithstanding those measures, employment and production had continued to decline in France until the autumn of 1936, when the franc was devalued, or, if you like to put it another way, when the currency was inflated.  Since then the position has been both hesitant and uncertain.  The term of office of the expansionist Governments was marked by an enormous increase in the national debt, a persistent rise in all prices, in the cost of living, and in the import surplus. The rise in internal prices undoubtedly was due to a number of factors, but it was largely occasioned by an undue credit expansion arising from increased advances from the Bank of France to cover budgetary deficits, to devaluation, and to the independent rise of external prices.  In France during this brief period the public debt increased, as I have said, very rapidly.  In fact, it increased by as much as 42,000,000,000 francs in the course of the year 1937. In France they did what the movers of the amendment have suggested.  They utilised the credit of the nation with a view to stimulating the development of agriculture and industry, and the absorption of unemployed workers in <Col N="2031" /> productive employment.  It happened, however, that this huge increase in the public debt, this utilisation of the credit of the French nation to the extent of no less than 42,000,000,000 francs in one year, was offset by the increase in money wage rates and by other adverse factors.</P>
    <P>As I have already indicated, in the case of the United States of America, the stimulus to production which devaluation caused is only temporary; it could only be permanent in its effect if the rise in price offered for commodities is not fully offset by increased cost.  That, of course, is the dilemma in which all expansionist countries and all expansionist authorities find themselves.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it might be said that the statement which I have given to the House is the statement of an outsider, a person who is not intimately aware of the conditions which exist in France.  Lest that might be said, I propose to quote for the benefit of the House an authoritative statement by two of the leading French statesmen of the day.  I propose to give some extracts from the report of MM. Daladier and Reynaud which was presented to the President of the French Republic on the 12th November, 1938. It is a very important State document and contains a great deal of information about what has happened as a result of expansionist policies in France, which I do not think the House, and which I certainly do not think the movers of the amendment have been aware of.  This is what those gentlemen have stated in regard to that French experiment:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The financial problem is thus dominated by&mdash;and is in fact the reflection of&mdash;the economic.  All the efforts made to improve the French financial position since the depression have been fruitless in face of the failure to achieve first a solution of the economic problem.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In 1936 the hope was to increase the purchasing power of the masses and to bring about an expansion in the demand for the products of industry, which would itself have brought about a reduction <Col N="2032" /> in unit costs and eventually of the cost of living.  Success would have been obtained if prices had not risen, if the increase in the purchasing power of the masses had been lasting and if production had increased.  The gravest failure, from which the others follow, has been the persistently low level of production.  Contrary to every hope and after many years of depression economic activity has shown no sign of revival and remains stagnant.  Industrial production in 1938 is at a level 25 per cent. below that of 1930. Railway car loadings are 35 per cent. down.  These conditions are all the more disappointing in the face of increased activity abroad.  In England production has risen by 20 per cent...</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Certain special branches of our economic activity which may be considered particularly indicative, betray even more definitely the state of affairs.  The volume of manufactured exports has fallen 46 per cent. compared with 1930, and this figure would be much greater if our relations with foreign countries alone were considered and no account were taken of our empire, which is protected by customs barriers.  Some of our export markets have been almost completely lost.  Exports of motor cars have diminished by 70 per cent., exports of cloth are down by 87 per cent., of cotton piece-goods by 94 per cent.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;At home, the index of building activity has fallen by 40 per cent., while in ...Great Britain it has risen by 100 per cent.  This is particularly alarming.  While France has stopped building, the English countryside is being covered with new houses.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The unemployment statistics are also disappointing.  There are 360,000 registered unemployed.  Including those who are unassisted, there are probably 600,000 without work, or 5½ per cent. of the working population. If account is taken of about 2½ per cent. of partly unemployed, it can be said that 8 per cent. of the available <Col N="2033" /> labour supply is at present unemployed. A particularly sad result, when in the same period an additional 250,000 persons have been taken on permanently in various public services.  Moreover, nearly 20 milliards of francs have been spent in great haste by the State and public authorities on public works, in addition to the great increase in national defence expenditure.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What can one conclude,&rdquo; the report goes on to say, &ldquo;except that the speculative purchases and turnover in stocks induced in 1936 by the fear of a rise of prices have been, taken together, without effect.  Our successive devaluations, greater than those of the dollar and pound, have resulted in pure loss to the national economy.  The home market has not been permanently enlarged.  The disequilibrium between agriculture and industry has been accentuated, and purchasing power, which it was hoped to increase, has once again declined.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For four years the State has absorbed the whole of our national savings, mainly for unproductive purposes. Despite all the artificial measures taken to reduce interest rates, to grant advances to traders and industrialists, the French loan market has become one of the dearest in the world.  Everyone knows that in practice it is impossible to obtain mortgage loans at under 9 or 10 per cent.  Everyone knows that if there is the slightest risk a private borrower cannot obtain capital at less than 10 or 12 per cent. Between 1928 and 1937 private issues of shares fell from 8.3 milliards of francs to 1.2, while private issues of bonds fell from 6.4 to 2.3 milliards. The drop is large enough, but would be even greater if account were taken of the depreciation of the franc.  This collapse of private borrowing is due to the scarcity of available capital, a scarcity due principally to constant appeals from what has become almost the one and only borrower, the State.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The conclusion of this survey is that for several years our substance has been melting away.  Despite <Col N="2034" /> tariff measures, the devaluations have not prevented a constant deficit in our balance of payments.  Taking only one element, the balance of trade, it is to be noted that the deficit has not ceased to increase in real terms, rising from the equivalent of 325 metric tons of gold in 1935 to 460 in 1936, and 580 in 1937, in three years an increase of 83 per cent.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We have entered, in fact, into the vicious cycle of an indefinite rise in all prices.  The fundamental fact which has raised the cost of living, and is raising it further, is the impoverishment of the country.  The losses suffered during the depression weigh heavily on our retail prices, whether it be because, as a protection against international competition, customs duties have been increased to the detriment of the French consumer; or because devaluation has increased the prices of imported goods; or because the State, in the attempt temporarily to protect a large number of individual interests from the consequences of national impoverishment, has increased its expenditure, thereby rendering necessary, sooner or later, a recourse to inflation or to taxes, and consequently a new rise in the cost of living.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Rise of prices, rise of wages, devaluation of the currency&mdash;that is the vicious cycle in which our economy is being carried along.  The problem, then,&rdquo; the report concludes, &ldquo;is not to choose between preserving or repealing the recent social reforms, whose generous inspiration nobody disputes.  The problem is to prevent them from automatically dwindling to nothing, to prevent their benefits from evaporating in the high cost of living, to prevent employers and employed, in a country which is still poor, from having nothing to share but poverty.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the considered judgment of those who have had actual practical experience of the sort of policy which has been advocated in the Labour Party amendment, and I would like those who may think there is something in statements such as those we <Col N="2035" /> have heard from the mover of the amendment to mark the conclusion to which those who have been responsible for the report have been driven:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Rise of prices, rise of wages, devaluation of the currency&mdash;that is the vicious cycle in which our economy is being carried along.  The problem then is, not to choose between preserving or repealing the recent social reforms, whose generous inspiration nobody disputes.

      <P>I am not prepared to keep the House interminably, but I can go to every one of these countries. Notwithstanding what was said about cobwebs being on our eyes, we very carefully scan the course of every one of these experiments that have been made elsewhere, and the only thing about it is that we cannot look at everything through rose-tinted spectacles. I dealt with the United States, and I have just been dealing with France.  Perhaps I should now go to Germany.  It has been sometimes said, even by those who start out as avowed democrats, that after all there must be something in the Totalitarian system, because in Germany it is said that there are no adult males unemployed. I should like to say that, in my view, even Germany, with all the authoritatarian and dictatorial powers which her Government has, and with the full and unchallengeable control which it exercises, not merely over her national resources, but over every individual in the nation, has not solved the problem of creating productive employment for her unemployed.  It is true that by adopting a war economy, by military expansion, in the construction of fortifications, <Col N="2036" /> in the making of munitions, in building munition factories, in large schemes of public works, with military objectives, and the construction of factories designed to replace essential commodities by synthetic products, manufactured at many times the natural cost, the population, which would otherwise remain idle, has been put temporarily, and very temporarily, into employment.</P>
      <P>The mere obliteration of the unemployment register in the manner which I have just indicated is no guarantee of economic well-being.  The financial difficulties of the Third Reich are, in my view, sufficient evidence of that.  The mobilisation of labour for the purpose of intensive rearmament is no more a cure for the social and economic evils of unemployment than the causes which precluded unemployment in any of the great States during any of the war years, 1914-1918.  The increase of employment under the Nazi régime has not ensured a correspondingly increased purchasing power in the community.  Under the present system, there, it is possible, as my Parliamentary Secretary said last night, to conscript labour at a low level of wages.  I do not think the mover of the amendment would for a moment tolerate the conditions in regard to labour which prevail in Germany.</P>
      <P>The gain in employment, in so far as there is a gain in the actual number of people given work, or at work sometimes unwillingly, has resulted in no corresponding increase in purchasing power.  On the contrary, I think it could be contended that the standard of living in Germany has steadily declined.  It can be said, undoubtedly, that by heavy increase in taxation and by short term borrowing Germany has managed, for a time at any rate, to undertake and carry through very huge work schemes; but the future in Germany has been mortgaged by the creation of an enormous floating debt, and there exists there a situation which can easily lead to inflation and which, in fact, as the monetary proposals set before the Reich in February or March last proved undeniably, has already led to inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2037" /> The architect of this huge system of expansionist expenditure in Germany was Dr. Schacht, and I should like the House to bear with me while I give one or two brief extracts from a very important statement which that authority made before the Economic Council of the German Academy in November last.  The statement is a long one, and I am not going to detain the House by reading it in full, but I recommend it to the study of people who believe that the Totalitarian regime in Germany has managed to find a solution of the major economic problem of the age.  I will read one or two extracts from it.  It is clear from the amendment which the Labour Party has moved, that they believe poverty could be cured and employment provided if we could adopt some of these theories which presuppose that by financing consumption we can permanently stimulate the demand for consumption of goods so that all those who otherwise would be unemployed will be absorbed in production.  This is what Dr. Schacht had to say in regard to that matter when he was set the task of trying to restore economic prosperity to the Reich and to enable it to rebuild its strength:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;After examination of the position, the ideals of financing consumption which at first attracted much attention and had in mind the indiscriminate distribution of money by the State, were all swept aside. In this way the mistakes were avoided which we have seen in the present time in the economic policy of the United States of America and France, and which show how closely related are deflation crisis and inflation crisis.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>After proceeding to detail the monetary measures which were adopted, he goes on to say something which should be borne in mind by those who think that after the adoption of such policies as I have referred to, normal trade and business, the relations between individuals as producers and individuals as consumers, between individuals as importers and individuals as exporters, could continue to prevail; who think that we would continue to have the same freedom <Col N="2038" /> within our economy here as at the moment we have, and that the system of rigid State control which is in operation in Germany, which is in operation in Italy, and which is in operation in New Zealand, is a mere accidental development of their principles, and could be dispensed with if only we could get the right machinery to give effect to the theories in regard to credit control and social credit, which are sometimes submitted to us.  This is what Dr. Schacht has to say on that point:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With National Socialism, however, came State-controlled economy in its widest scope and becoming more intensified with time, which made it possible to avoid rises in prices and wages.  Thus one of the chief objections to financing production by credit was overcome.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Perhaps we ought now to see how Germany, by the exercise of State control in its widest sense, was able to avoid rises in prices and wages.  Dr. Schacht gives us the answer to that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Reduced to a simple formula, the problem may be stated as follows: The credit money supplied for the purposes of rearmament, or for any other purpose, produces through payment of wages and salaries a demand for consumers' goods.  Armaments manufactures, however, supply military goods which, though produced, are not consumed.  This has two consequences: In the first place, care must be taken that besides the manufacture of armaments, a quantity of consumers' goods should be produced&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;that is to say, that the workers should be put upon rations&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;that is adequate for the existence of the population.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A person cannot go out and buy as much of one commodity as his desires may dictate, or as much of another commodity as he may like.  He has to take that quantity of consumers' goods that those who are in authority over him consider to be adequate for the existence of the population, including all those occupied in the armaments industry.  What is the corollary of <Col N="2039" /> that?  According to Dr. Schacht it is this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The less that is consumed, the more labour can be used for rearmament; but on the other hand, the higher consumption rises the more labour must be applied to the production of consumers' goods.  The standard of living and the extent of rearmament stand, therefore, in inverse ratio to one another.  The less I consume the more I save, and the more I save the more I can put into defence.  This means that rearmament cannot ultimately be financed by creating money, but only by a policy of saving.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You can paraphrase that and you can say that this means that national development cannot ultimately be financed by creating money but only by a policy of saving.  The only thing is that whether you are going to have a policy of voluntary saving, such as we have, or a policy of compulsory saving, such as they have in Germany. In the latter connection you have to remember that only a sufficiency of consumers' goods, only that quantity of consumers' goods which is adequate to maintain the working population is to be produced, and that the more you can restrict the consumption of consumers' goods by the working population the more you will have for whatever purpose the State may think desirable.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The new plan is the logical realisation that it is not done with money alone, but that it is merely a question of what goods, and how many goods, I can get for my money. Guns cannot be forged nor bread baked from printed bank notes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is what every one of these expansionist policies which have been advocated in this country want us to assume, that you can forge guns or bake bread from printed bank notes.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The one important thing is the ability to obtain sufficient goods, and if you do not produce sufficient quantities of these goods yourself, you must get them elsewhere by exchange.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Dr. Schacht went on to get a system of internal economy.  He built up a <Col N="2040" /> huge system which was for three or four years regarded as almost a miracle by outsiders.  It is well to hear his own view of the system which he had to build up there, in order that some effect might be given to some such principles as are enshrined in the Labour amendment.  He says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I have in my time described my own new plan as horrible, and I still stand by that judgment.  I really do not imagine that the merchant exists mainly in order to comply with the demands of an economic bureaucracy&rdquo;&mdash;</P>
    <P>and undoubtedly such a bureaucracy would have to be set up if we were to try to give practical effect to some of the proposals bruited about the country in recent times&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Rather am I of the opinion that he should conclude as many good business transactions as possible and fill in as few forms as possible.  But so long as our need of foreign exchange still exists the control of foreign trade must remain in force.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Ultimately every one of the proposals which have been advocated from time to time from various quarters must result in the complete control of foreign trade.</P>
    <P>We heard a great deal in this House during the past three or four years of the position in New Zealand and what has been done there.  I do not think that any person who knows, the measures which the Government of that State have taken to ensure that they and they only would control all the instruments of public and private credit in the country, could say that they had left anything undone.  They have amended the whole banking code in such a way as to give them complete and absolute control over the public and private credit of that community, and they have utilised it for the very laudable purposes which they have in view.  They have tried, I should say, by the unlimited utilisation of the power which they took when they got an absolute majority in the country&mdash;a majority which, by reason of its size, could not be gainsaid in anything it may have thought wise to do in the interests of the State.  They have utilised that power in order to give <Col N="2041" /> effect to the social programme which put them into power.  I might question the wisdom of the means, but I am in full accord with the end.  They have tried to improve the position of the primary producers; they have tried to improve the position of the workers; they have endeavoured to get building going again, and they have done everything that they could conceive ought to be done in order to improve the position of those under their rule, and, in some ways, signs seemed to indicate for a time that they were moving upon a good road.</P>
    <P>As we have heard here, there was, simultaneously with the measures which they were introducing, a rise in prices, so that if we proposed to express the total production of that community in money values, undoubtedly, it might be said that the total production had been increased.  There has also been an increase in money wage rates and in earnings.  That is only natural because the marginal productivity of labour and capital is high in a new country, but even into this evidence of increased economic activity and increased incomes, severe qualifications must be introduced.  In terms of the average family budget of 1930, the cost of living has risen very steeply since 1935, and its upward trend is, in fact, steeper than at any time since the war years.</P>

      <P>I have not got the figure available at the moment, but the Deputy can take that as being an authentic fact.  It is so high that the Prime Minister of New Zealand himself, speaking on May 12th, said that &ldquo;by controlling prices the Government is controlling the necessity for increasing wages.&rdquo;  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;We want to see that there are funds provided so that prices are not raised against those whose wages are expected, for the time being, to remain somewhere about where they are.  Generally speaking, (he said) stability is sought both by those controlling prices and those demanding higher wages.  These sentiments have only a temporary application <Col N="2042" /> while we are dealing with a difficult situation, but the situation is inevitable to anyone who does any serious thinking.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, that happens to be true.  If you start on the sort of widespread expansionist policy which has characterised the Government of New Zealand, wages and prices are going to rise to such a height that you are going to be caught in an inflationary spiral; but, as I have said, we have here, in the statement of the Prime Minister of New Zealand himself, a proof of my assertion that prices in New Zealand have been rising very rapidly, and that since 1935 the upward trend has been steeper than at any time since the War.  Manufacturing costs have also risen steeply, because of the effect of the Government policy and because of the increased cost of raw materials which, even between 1936 and 1937, rose by as much as 11 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard that the Government in New Zealand has done a great deal to restore the dairying industry to something like its former prosperity, or, at any rate, to put it on its feet. Now, in spite of the Dairy Produce Act which was passed by the Government in 1936, there has been a decline in the production in the dairying industry, and in the seven months ended February, 1939, butter exports were lower by no less than 9 per cent. than in the corresponding period in 1937-38. Not merely that, but the number of dairy cows has fallen steadily since 1936.  We have heard that we ought to utilise national credit for the purpose of stimulating national production, and it has been so utilised in New Zealand.  A guaranteed price for butter has been given to the dairy farmer. That guarantee has not been made good out of taxation, as we have made it good when we have had to meet the guarantees which we have given to our farmers.  On the contrary, it has been financed by overdrafts on a special account held by the Reserve Bank, and the financing of any deficits that may arise on that, the dairy produce <Col N="2043" /> account, undoubtedly can only be done by an inflation of the currency. What is the position in regard to even this one industry?  It is true that there was a slight deficit in the first year of working, of £290,000, and a surplus of £500,000 odd in the second year of working; but for the present year, as we ourselves heard the other day from a gentleman who had authority to speak on the matter, there was likely to be a deficit on that account of something between £1,500,000 and £2,000,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>He said that the drought was responsible for some of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever was responsible, there was the fact that there was going to be a deficit.  He said that the drought was responsible for the fall in production, but not for the deficit on the account, because the account had only to pay for what it was able to sell&mdash;that is, for what it compelled the producers to sell to it&mdash;because, remember, in New Zealand, under this system, the produce of every creamery must be sold to the Government, and the Government then disposes of that produce as it thinks best and at whatever price it can get.  In the early stages, as in the case of this particular experiment, it guarantees a price, and if what it gets for the product does not fill the guarantee, then it finances it, as I have said, by means of an overdraft upon the reserve account: that is to say, by inflation.  That money must be put into circulation in the country, and, of course, the moment that money is put into circulation and there are not goods against it, the prices must tend to rise, and do rise.</P>
      <P>Now what, in fact, is the position of the dairying industry in New Zealand? I do not intend to weary the House by reading for Deputies the proceedings of the 7th Dominion Dairy Conference which was held in Wellington on April 19th and 20th of this year.  I shall only quote two extracts from it.  There is a number of other blue-pencilled passages here which would be very enlightening to any person who is interested in this matter, but I shall just read what the Minister for Finance and Marketing said to the farmers at that conference.  He said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2044" />&ldquo;There was need inside a country like New Zealand to secure stability if you had provided certain facilities in connection with the betterment of all sections of the community.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, what is that except another way of saying that there is a limit to what you can do by credit expansion. But, if what we have been told by those who advocate these measures is true, there should not be any limit.  Why, if it would be possible by adopting these facile proposals to improve the present status of the whole of the population, why if it would be possible to do that by adopting machinery of this sort must that improvement cease?  Why should it not go on and continue?  Why, if we improve the status of our people to-day so that they enjoy a better status, should not to-morrow a further improvement take place through this operation?</P>
    <P>I believe the status and the economic condition of the people can be improved from day to day.  I do not say it should cease or that there should be any cesser of our efforts to improve it, but there are those who say that it can be done overnight by adopting some of these proposals.  Certain of these proposals have been adopted in New Zealand and then after a short period of time one of the principal sponsors of them&mdash;a man who is undoubtedly very sincere and very honest and, I have no doubt, a very enthusiastic protagonist of these proposals &mdash;addressed the dairy farmers in New Zealand in these words: &ldquo;There is need inside a country like New Zealand to secure stability if you have provided certain facilities in connection with the betterment of all sections of the community.&rdquo;  Then he goes on to say: &ldquo;He saw an imperative need for the restriction of the imported commodities which we normally enjoy.&rdquo;  What does that mean?  It means that in regard to certain aspects of our life, the standard of living must be lowered. If you enjoy certain commodities, then by reason of that enjoyment you have a certain standard of living.</P>

      <P>Here is the answer in Mr. Nash's own words: &ldquo;If they therefore extended purchasing power by paying a higher price to the farmer, and higher wages, there would be greater purchasing power for a smaller quantity of goods and inevitably price rises would take place.  If they did that they would come to a spiral.&rdquo;  A voice here said&mdash;the voice of a very intelligent and wide-awake person&mdash;&ldquo;Are not we in that spiral now?&rdquo;  I have merely quoted these extracts in order to show that what further I am going to say about New Zealand is corroborated by the statements which were made by a responsible New Zealand Minister, speaking to the dairy farmers gathered at the annual conference this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was said here in the Dáil that there had been an increase in the value of exports from New Zealand since 1935.  The value of New Zealand exports over the years since 1935 is as follows: In 1936, 56.8 million pounds; in 1937, 66.7 million pounds, and in 1938, 58' million pounds.  I should like to recall for the House the figures which I gave last night for the expansion in our agricultural exports over the same period, that is, between the years 1935 to 1938.  There has been a marked decline in the value of exports from New Zealand in 1938 as compared with 1937, so that the position now is almost what it was in 1936.  The value of New Zealand exports in 1936 was 56.8 million pounds, and in 1938 they were value for 58 million pounds.  These values are in New Zealand £s.  I have shown that our exports, expressed in <Col N="2046" /> terms of sterling, rose from £13,800,000 in 1935 to £19,657,000 in 1938.  There has been a continual rise in the value of agricultural exports from this country since 1935, and there has been no recession.  In New Zealand, due to various causes&mdash;probably, I should say due to the improvement on the London market more than to anything done in New Zealand&mdash;there was a heavy increase in agricultural exports as between 1935 and 1937, but there was a recession to what was the equivalent of the 1936 standard in 1938.  But the significant thing for us to remember in our case is that our exports have steadily increased until to-day.  The figures show that there has been an increase of almost 50 per cent. as compared with the exports in 1935.</P>
    <P>It has been said also, by Deputy Norton, I think, that there has been an increase in production in New Zealand. I know it is very boring to have to listen to these details, but this is one of the things to which we must listen when we are dealing with a problem such as is before us to-day.  It has been stated that there has been an increase in the volume of production in New Zealand as compared with 1935.  The latest figures I have are for the years 1935, 1936 and 1937.  1935 was undoubtedly a bad year here and elsewhere. But in 1935 the index for the physical volume of exports in New Zealand was 2,783; in 1936 it was 2.925, and in 1937 it was 2.906.  The basic 1900 price has been taken as one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Give us the value.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the value of the New Zealand exports already.  They rose from £56.8 millions in 1936 to only £58 millions in 1938.  The most important feature, however, of the external trade of New Zealand is perhaps not the slight increase which has taken place in the value and volume of their exports, but the abnormal increase in imports which has taken place since 1935.  This increase is due to the natural desire of the New Zealand people to use their apparently increased purchasing power to raise their standard of living.  The visible <Col N="2047" /> excess of exports for 1933 was over £12,000,000 sterling.  It had fallen in 1937 to £8.7 million sterling, and last year was only £3,000,000 in New Zealand currency.  This decline, as well as the abnormal increase in imports, points to the inflationary tendency in New Zealand, and is of particular significance for a debtor country which must rely upon excess exports in order to discharge its current liabilities.</P>
      <P>Concurrently, with this adverse movement in the balance of external trade, there have been heavy losses in the sterling assets of the New Zealand Banks.  In 1936, when the visible trade balance was £12,500,000, the overseas assets fell by £8,000,000. In 1937 when the visible trade balance was £10,600,000, the overseas assets fell by a further £4,500,000.  In the two years which ended April, 1938, they had fallen from £45,000,000 New Zealand to £28,600,000 New Zealand, and by November, 1938 they had fallen as low as £8,000,000 New Zealand.  At present, I think they stand at about £13,000,000, but the increase is largely seasonal The main exports are at their height during this period of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fall in the export surplus which I have described has of course had its very drastic reactions upon the New Zealand economy, and the system of restriction of imports which was introduced by the Government last December indicates the importance that is attached to this matter.  In fact, by imposing those restrictions upon imports in New Zealand the New Zealand Government has been endeavouring to stay the trend towards the deterioration of the national economy which has set in.  Those restrictions are in fact very drastic. Not merely are commodities only allowed in under license in reduced quantities, but the Government has even gone to the extent that not only are they controlling imports in New Zealand but the exports are also subject to licensing control.  What is more, the exporter has not the right <Col N="2048" /> to dispose freely of what he gets for his exports.</P>
    <P>The sterling exchange which is earned by the exporter is not his to dispose of as he wishes.  It is appropriated by the Reserve Bank, which has been relieved of the obligation to give sterling in exchange for New Zealand bank notes.  New Zealand, so far as her internal economy is concerned, has gone off the sterling standard, and she has only gone off it because she has been driven off it internally by the dislocation in her general economy which the operation of the present Government's policy there during the past three years has brought about.</P>
    <P>Such a drastic system of import and export control, of course, has had its reactions on the internal position of the Dominion, and the criticism is now being freely levelled against the Government there that this new system of control will force many traders out of business, and will promote unemployment in the wholesale, distribution and transport industries, while the community naturally will have to pay higher prices for a narrow range of goods, perhaps even of poor quality.  In any event, I think it may be taken that this system has been forced by necessity upon the Labour Government in New Zealand by reason of the policy which has been operating there for the past three years.  In the face of heavy capital exports, and a precipitate fall in the sterling reserves and balances which are vital to the finances of the Dominion, the temporarily inflated standard of living had to be reduced either by the direct reduction of incomes, or by the indirect methods of rationing imports, or by increasing import costs by further depreciation of the New Zealand pound.</P>
    <P>The first and last course, that of reducing incomes by increasing taxation, and that of depreciating the New Zealand pound, were prohibited by the declared policy of the Labour Government. In fact, one of the objectives which the Government set itself when it came into office in 1935 was not merely to retain the then existing parity of the New Zealand pound with sterling at £125 New Zealand to £100 <Col N="2049" /> sterling, but even to improve and restore the original parity when the New Zealand pound would buy as much goods as the sterling pound anywhere. As I said, both the direct reduction of incomes by increasing taxation and the restoration of the economy by the depreciation of the pound were forbidden to the Government by its declared policy, and instead they have adopted this system of import and export control which is already in operation in the Totalitarian States in the world.  The Labour Government in New Zealand&mdash;this is what it comes to &mdash;has been compelled to adopt the Totalitarian mechanism of Germany for the control of the Dominion's export and import trade.</P>
    <P>The effect of the expedients to which the Labour Government has been driven in New Zealand, moreover, is not going to exhaust itself merely in a momentary dislocation of trade conditions within the Dominion.  It is going to have very important reactions upon the financial position of the Government itself.  If the State derives a large part of its revenues from customs duties upon imports, and if you start off by drastically restricting those imports, particularly those which bore heavy rates of taxation because they were classified as luxury imports, then, undoubtedly, those restrictions are going to react adversely upon your receipts from customs duties.  Incomes, of course, also will suffer from the decline in receipts from the external balances.  Yet we have been told that the public works programme which has been financed by borrowing in Australia, cannot be abandoned.  If that is going to be the position, then the service of public debt is going to grow. We have been told, however, that a large part of the difficulties which New Zealand is confronted with arises from the fact that the Government there has to remit to London or elsewhere no less a sum than £10,000,000 per annum to cover the charges on the national debt.</P>

      <P>Are we to take it, from what the Deputy is saying, and from what was said last night, that we or any other Government are going to go to the people and ask them to entrust us with their savings and tell them: &ldquo;Do not forget that there are gentlemen in the Dáil who may be sitting in the Dáil as a Government five or ten years from now and, when faced with the unpleasant task of imposing taxation in order to meet the State's commitments to you, their answer is going to be: `We have no responsibility for it; this money was borrowed by another Government' &rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I never at any period of my life advocated the repudiation of public obligations, because civilisation and the State could not continue if that were to be the avowed policy of any Government, or, if not being the avowed policy of any Government, it were to be, in practice, the policy of any Government in this country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, they were not moneys which other people had lent to the State; they were not the property of private individuals. They were a boon and a grace and a gratuity which the State conferred on private individuals.  It just shows the <Col N="2052" /> sort of ramshackle thinking which the Deputy is capable of that he can equate the one to the other&mdash;repudiation of a public debt and the statement that one would suspend or would terminate pensions payable by the State.  There is a certain analogy, but they are not at all on the same plane, and the Deputy ought to know that as well as I do.</P>
      <P>I have been diverted from the main trend of my argument.  I was pointing out that these restrictions upon imports were going of themselves to create budgetary difficulties for the New Zealand Government.  I was going on to say further, that if the Government has to impose those restrictions and by that means has artificially to reduce the standard of living of the community taken as a whole&mdash;perhaps, indeed, reduce the standard of living most of all of those sections in the community which have never enjoyed the luxury of those imports&mdash;its revenue is undoubtedly going to shrink, and if it cannot get the necessary revenue by taxes upon what are described as luxury imports, it has got to get the revenue by taxes upon commodities which are necessary and essential to life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was making my financial statement here, I tried to indicate to our people what would be the consequence of an outbreak of a European War, if we were compelled to restrict the importation of those commodities which yield us taxation and a large part of our revenue, and I said that if the inflow of these commodities ceased, then inside this island we should have to tax where and what we could.  That is going to be the position here in case of a European war.  That has already become the position in New Zealand. In order to make good the deficit on customs revenue other taxes, direct and indirect, will have to be imposed in New Zealand.  And not merely that, but it has been suggested that New Zealand can go on and develop, even if it has to forego certain things which some people classify as luxuries.  Even if it has to forego these things, it can develop inside its own bounds and, therefore, we are told they are going to go ahead with public works and are prepared to finance them by borrowing. <Col N="2053" /> If that is the case, they will have to remit £10,000,000 per annum to Great Britain; they have undoubtedly to pay over to their own internal lenders almost an equivalent sum&mdash;I do not know what it may be.  I have not taken out the figures but, judging by the distribution of the debt, as between internal and external debts, it must be about six or seven millions.  What is going to be the position then?  The present position is that for every £ collected in taxation by the present New Zealand Government only 13/4 can be devoted to the internal requirements of the Government.  Out of every £ collected only 13/4 can go to maintain public services and to discharge the obligations of the New Zealand Government to its own citizens within its shores, while 6/8 has to be remitted abroad.</P>

I have not seen New Zealand, but certainly it is more than a name to me, because I have come to know a lot about it within the past year or two.  The position of New Zealand is that out of every £ collected in that country only two-thirds are available to meet the ordinary needs of Government, and to discharge the obligations of the State towards its citizens, while 6/8 is sent abroad to pay for past extravagance, if it will please the Labour Deputies for me to stigmatise expenditure which was incurred during part of 1935, in that way.  Here we have the position that a population of a little over 1½ millions is burdened with a debt that amounts in New Zealand currency to something like 330 millions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I will sum up by saying once again that we have got to remember what Dr. Schacht said, that it is not the quantity of money as expressed by bank notes counts; it is not the rate of wages or the amount of income that matters, it is what goods can be got for those bank notes and what goods can be purchased for those wages that count.  It is not the few pounds or shillings that may be in the workers' pay envelope at the end of the week that matter.  They are of no value as long as they are there.  Their real value comes to be measured the moment they are taken out of the envelope by the worker or by his wife, when they try to pay for the necessities of the household for the week. There has been a very heavy increase undoubtedly in the money incomes in New Zealand.  We were told that it had risen from 98 millions to 166 millions between 1935 and 1938.  Accompanied by that depreciation of New Zealand currency, there has been a general increase in the level of prices and costs.  Has that brought happiness and prosperity to New Zealand?  What has been one of the marked characteristics of labour conditions in New Zealand even since the last general election which, I think, took place in August of last year.  What has happened since then?  Would not one think, after all the stories we have been hearing in this House about conditions in New Zealand, that everyone there would be happy and contented, and that there would be a full output from every productive worker?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But that is not the position in New Zealand.  There has been strike after strike in New Zealand.  Strike after strike has been precipitated by the fact that even though wages were rising prices were rising very much faster. New Zealand has not been at all the sort of workers' paradise that members on the Labour Benches would have us believe.  There have been strikes on the waterfront and on the transport <Col N="2057" /> system, a strike by one section of workers after another, and all the time there has been a decline in output, so that the members of the Government have had to go through New Zealand trying to stimulate production and imploring people to produce more.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>No, they have not succeeded, and the fact that they have not is evidenced by the decline in the export surplus from New Zealand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been told that everybody has been getting richer in New Zealand.  What is the position in regard to the deposits in the savings banks?  During the last 12 months there has been a heavy withdrawal from the savings banks.  Trade has been subject to rigid control by an exchange and licensing system.  The burden of the public debt has been overwhelming, and, above everything, the New Zealand dairy industry, about which we have heard so much, has been crippled by rising prices and costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had some experience here of the difficulty of fixing producers' prices, where there has been a monopoly control involved, and we have had disputes in that regard with our sugar beet producers on a number of occasions.  When we could not find agreement at the council table, we have set up a tribunal to try and strike a fair price as between the producer and the factory.  There was a dispute in New Zealand only last year, a dispute regarding the price which the Government should pay to the dairy farmer. And remember, the dairy farmer is the backbone of all the New Zealand economy.  They contended that because of the rise in costs, the price which had been fixed under the Act which governs that industry was not remunerative, and the matter was ultimately solved in this way.  A Dominion conference on February 16th, 1938, gave careful and lengthy consideration to <Col N="2058" /> the fixation of the guaranteed price for dairy produce, which is part of the policy of the present New Zealand Government, as outlined in the Primary Producers' Marketing Act and its amendments.  It finally passed the following resolutions:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This conference is of opinion that during the operation of the guaranteed prices scheme the price should be determined for each season by a tribunal consisting of equal numbers of assessors appointed by the Dairy Board and the Government, and presided over by a Supreme Court judge.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That this conference is of opinion that the tribunal's order of reference shall provide for payment on a basis that will enable the producer to pay competitive rates of wages, allow the producer a reasonable interest on capital invested in his farm and stock, enable the producer to meet any increased costs, and allow the producer a remuneration commensurate with the services he renders to the community and with that obtained by other sections of the community rendering equal service.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>No person would deny or endeavour to assert that these resolutions did not afford a fair basis upon which to fix a price.  Anyhow, as a result of discussions with the New Zealand Government, a board was set up consisting of three nominees of the dairy farmers, of three Government nominees, with a gentleman named Sir Francis Fraser as chairman.  This board met, and, mark you, it consisted of three nominees of the Government, three nominees of the industry and an independent chairman. It fixed a certain price.  The Government were unable to give that price and the matter was referred to this board again.  The board considered the matter for a second time, and it fixed that certain price again.  When we referred a question about sugar beet to a tribunal, the Government, whatever its view may have been about the price awarded, in the light of its obligations to the consumers and the other people interested in the industry saw that the company honoured the award and paid the price.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2059" /> Here was a board set up by this New Zealand Government which is held up, not merely to the admiration of members of this House, but to the representatives of the dairy and agricultural industry here and in the country; here was a board set up by this Government to consider this question and to ascertain what was a fair price to pay the dairy farmer for his produce.  Remember, the New Zealand dairy farmer has only one buyer.  He is not able to sell in the open market. His creameries cannot sell to merchants in New Zealand cities; his creameries cannot sell to any customer outside New Zealand.  The New Zealand farmer has only one buyer, and that buyer is the Government.  And this board met, not once, but twice, and fixed a fair price.  What did the New Zealand Government do?  Did they pay the price?  Not at all, they paid less than that price; they paid approximately only two-thirds of the increase recommended.  And this was done by a Government that had carried through legislation which placed the whole dairying industry, every dairy farmer in New Zealand and every member of every dairy farmer's family, every worker employed by every dairy farmer, under the control of the New Zealand Government; and yet that Government would not honour its bond to those who were working in that industry.</P>
    <P>That is only one instance of what is happening in New Zealand.  In fact, the position had become such that, owing to the enormous expansion in governmental expenditure and to the wasteful way in which the resources of New Zealand were utilised during the first two or three years of the present régime there, the New Zealand Government could not do anything else except to refuse to honour an award of its own tribunal.  That is why you have dairy production declining there.  That is why you have New Zealand Ministers going through the country exhorting all the producers to produce more; that is why you have had strike after strike in New Zealand during the past four, five or six months.  That is the sort of economy that people have been holding up here to the people of Ireland <Col N="2060" /> during the past two or three months as a model for our imitation. I think, Sir, that I have more than exhausted the patience of the House.</P>

      <P>I have a very interesting memorandum here which describes the means to which the Italian Government has had to resort recently in order to balance its Budget and to provide for the sort of expansionist policy that has been running there.  What do I find?  There has been a capital levy upon every section of the population.  Deputy Davin might not object to that if it were confined to bankers, to those brutes in human form to whom he, like the rest of us, entrusts his savings and hopes, as we all do, that, on occasion, they will honour our cheques.  It is not confined, however, merely to bankers or to those who are rich enough to have investments in public or private companies; nor is it confined mainly to the big business men.  There has been, due in principle to the same sort of policy as I have been dealing with here, a capital levy, upon the private property of every individual who has property in Italy, within the past two years.  It started, of course, with the big man, but it has come down now to the small man, and the small farmer on his farm, and the peasant on his piece of land&mdash; they have had to surrender 5, in some cases 10 per cent. of their property to the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not allow myself to be drawn off on a side-track like that.  Now, what does this mean? It means that once a Government resorts to a measure of that sort the taxable capacity of its people is reduced accordingly, and, when next year's Budget has to be balanced, more will have to be taken from the capital resources of the people and there will be a further decline in their taxable capacity.  Of course, I know that it is not quite as simple as that, but ultimately it means that every individual's productive capacity is going to be mortgaged to the Government and in the last resort it will mean that he will be working for the Government and not for himself.  It means that he will be little removed, if the thing is carried through to its logical conclusion, from the position of the serfs under the old Russian Empire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not prepared to dilate on this point at length, but I should like to end up by saying this: the purposes and objects which those who moved the motion and those who put down the amendment have in mind are those which we should all endeavour to aim at.  I am only concerned to preserve the hope that one day, by pursuing a policy, a reasonable policy, the consequences of which we can forsee&mdash;a policy based, if you like, upon the experiences of other countries so far as we may endeavour to avoid the mistakes they have made&mdash;we shall be able to do here what the motion wants us to do, and that is, &ldquo;so to order the administration of public finance and policy as to stimulate profitable production and abolish poverty within this State.&rdquo;  I am not one of those, however, who believe that that means that everybody can be reduced to the one level.  I do not think, in view of the difference in capacity, in industry, in character, that everybody can enjoy the same remuneration and that everybody can attain to the same standard of living.  I am not alone in that view.  We sometimes hear Encyclicals <Col N="2062" /> quoted here, and there is one very important one which does lay down a principle which I, at any rate, endeavour to keep in mind.  Here is a declaration of the Late Holy Father, Pope Leo the XIII:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It must be first of all recognised that the condition of things inherent in human affairs must be borne with, for it is impossible to reduce civil society to one dead level.  Socialists may in that intent do their utmost, but all striving against nature is in vain.  There naturally exist among mankind manifold differences of the most important kind; people differ in capacity, skill, health, strength; and unequal fortune is a necessary result of unequal conditions... let them strive as they may, no strength and no artifice will ever succeed in banishing from human life the ills and troubles which beset it.  If any there are who pretend differently&mdash; who hold out to a hard-pressed people the boon of freedom from pain and trouble, an undisturbed repose, and constant enjoyment&mdash; they delude the people and impose upon them, and their lying promises will only one day bring forth evils worse than the present.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Well, Sir, in the terms in which the amendment was proposed here, I could see nothing but an advocacy of that.</P>

      <P>That if it be possible in this country to allow everybody, in the words of this Encyclical, &ldquo;the boon of freedom from pain and trouble, an undisturbed repose, and constant enjoyment&rdquo;&mdash;I believe that our social measures have brought to many of our people the boon of freedom from pain and trouble; I believe that our housing programme will perhaps bring them the boon of an undisturbed repose; but I do not think, as some of those who supported the amendment seemed to think, in moving the amendment, that we can ever bring to them the boon of constant enjoyment.  Later on, the Holy Father goes on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Here, however, it is expedient to bring under special notice certain matters of moment.  The chief thing <Col N="2063" /> is the duty of safeguarding private property by legal enactment and protection.  Most of all, it is essential, where the passion of greed is so strong, to keep the people within the line of duty; for if all may justly strive to better their condition, neither justice nor the common good allows any individual to seize upon that which belongs to another, or, under the futile and shallow pretext of equality, to lay violent hands on other people's possessions.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, Sir, that brings me to just one other point in conclusion in this debate. Sometimes we talk here in very glib terms of our investments abroad, of our credit, of our deposits in the banks; and we quite forget that these investments abroad, and this credit, which we describe as ours, and these moneys which are in the banks, are not ours at all as individuals: that they belong to other people&mdash;to other people who have acquired them, as this Encyclical points out, as a result of hard work, in most cases, and self-denial; and yet we think that it rests with us simply to confiscate&mdash;for that is what is implied in every one of these speeches&mdash;this property of other people and apply it to the uses that we may think advisable or desirable.</P>

      <P>I could quote all the encyclicals if I had time.  I want to direct the attention of thoughtful members of the House to the fact that we have possessive adjectives abused and misused here&mdash;&ldquo;we have&rdquo;&ldquo;our resources&rdquo;.  Every one of these phrases are inculcating, perhaps unwittingly, in the public mind the idea that we have absolute ownership of these possessions.  As I have said in the beginning, they are not ours.  They belong to hundreds of thousands of private individuals in this State.  The money that lies in the banks belongs to the small farmers, the small shopkeepers and the small traders of the country.  By all means, if we can find a profitable use for it, if we can induce these people to lend us that money for the purpose of building up the nation, let us take advantage of it.  If we can use it in profitable production, if we can induce them to lend us the money for the purpose of providing more houses, for the purpose of settling more people on the land, for the purpose of developing our national resources, by all means let us go out and induce them to lend this money to us but let us never forget that the moneys are not ours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have only been lent to us and it does not matter whether that money was lent to our predecessors, or lent <Col N="2065" /> to us, or to our successors, a solemn obligation rests on this Assembly, so long as it lasts, to see that these moneys are paid back to those who lent them to us originally, to see that moneys entrusted to us are repaid to the people who lent them, together with a fair price for their use.</P>

      <P>They are very grave admonitions to mankind, not separate sections of them, but the whole encyclicals from beginning to end, and they provide themselves no detailed solution for either Governments or States to follow.  They should be read in that kindly, paternal manner in which they were written.  Now, we are here to discuss a motion and an amendment, both <Col N="2066" /> of them arising out of a very long report furnished by the Banking Commission. It is a very valuable report, exhaustive and very full of information, and it gives, to the best of their judgment and ability, the considered opinion of a number of experts.  So far as this country is concerned, it owes a debt of gratitude to the gentlemen who gave so much of their time and industry to it; who made such an exhaustive survey of the whole field of our economy, considered probably every phase of the national life, and gave us their considered opinions.  In nearly all cases in which they gave their opinions, they gave reasons for them. It would be only fair to them if we are criticising what they have said, at least to give them credit for the reasons they have put forward for whatever decisions they have come to.</P>
      <P>Seldom has it been my fortune to read a report with which I was in such general agreement.  There is, at least, one recommendation with which I am not in agreement.  Generally speaking, it is a report which ought to command and receive from the Government of the country very careful consideration. Criticism has been expressed here in this House, and outside it, in connection with one proposal, that is the proposal to continue the link with sterling on a parity.  I wonder if those who criticise that, read on page 4 paragraph 8, the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Firstly, it is important as an aim of monetary policy that the real wages of workers may be kept unimpaired, and that the value of accumulated savings shall be preserved, and that there may be a firm foundation for future contracts in matters of business, life insurance, etc.  On the other hand, the burden of past debts should not be aggravated by an increase in the purchasing power of money.  It is necessary to pursue a credit policy that will be favourable for the progress of agriculture and industry.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take it that it was not merely because sterling was the British unit of value that the Commission decided to recommend the continuance of a link with sterling at a parity.  Occasionally <Col N="2067" /> through the course of the report, in their examination of agriculture and of industry generally, they focus attention upon imports.  In recent months, when there was a danger&mdash;in fact some people even thought a likelihood&mdash;of an outbreak of war, the importance of those imports seemed suddenly to seize the public imagination.  If those who criticise the parity with sterling would consider for a moment what is the unit of value that they would recommend, and put forward what in their view should be the value of the Irish pound, it would be much easier to deal with their side of the case.  Considering the care and attention&mdash;one might almost say the exhaustive care and attention&mdash; with which the commission dealt with this matter, it is only fair to the public that they should know whether the proposal is that our pound should be worth 15/-, and that we would have to pay a corresponding increase for the English pound if we wanted it.  If we depreciate our own pound here, our imports &mdash;the raw materials which are necessary for industries in this country, whether they are new or old&mdash;will increase in cost.  Wages at the present level would not be worth the face value of the payment that would be made for them.  It is quite true that we would get more value for those goods which we would export.</P>
    <P>We are entitled to hear upon what grounds this recommendation is going to be made, if it is going to be made at all.  We are entitled to be able to tell any person who has money in the bank, or in the Post Office, or in Savings Certificates, what amount of discount this new proposal is going to occasion in the savings he has made. Let us once and for all clear our minds of the idea that the money which is at present in bank in this country belongs to the rich.  The average value of a deposit in our banks is little over £200. There are very few large depositors; there are very many small depositors. One of the most disastrous of the consequences that beset at least one country on the Continent which had to depreciate currency during the last 20 years was the baneful effect upon the younger people of that country when <Col N="2068" /> they considered how many years it had taken their parents to put a few pounds in the bank, and how it had all gone in a few days, or a few weeks, or a few months, as the case may be, by reason of the change in the currency.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, there is the danger of what is called a fluctuating currency. That is even worse, because it always hits the poorer section of the community.  During the economic war it so happened that competent farmers with capital might survive, and might even do better during that period, with initiative and industry and business knowledge.  I know one of them who did, but it would not have been possible for every one of them to have done it.  So it would happen in the case of a fluctuating currency.  The disadvantages are always on those least able to bear them, while the advantages are with those who are most competent to deal with a situation of that sort and have capital behind them. If one were to examine this report with a view to finding out what was the main theme running through it, my answer to that would be that it was on the balance of payments.  There are people who affect not to understand what is meant by the balance of payments. In essence it means balancing the accounts of the country.  You put on the one side all the moneys that are received either for goods or in respect of dividends for investments, tourist expenditure, pensions, and various other items.  The receipts are on one side, and on the other the payments out for imports, in respect of tourists from this country who go abroad, dividends to people who have money invested in this country, and so on.</P>
    <P>If my interpretation of the report is correct, the members of the Banking Commission were rather impressed with the dangerous trend that has been evident during some of those past years.  Those who are directing their criticism towards what is called the conservative mind of the Banking Commission should go further and deeper into the question, and see why it was that they committed themselves to what is called a conservative policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2069" /> They would find that the main theme, the main idea at the back of the minds of the vast majority of the members of the Banking Commission was that we should balance our accounts.  They made no objection to an increase in our imports.  They made no objection to an increase in our industrial activity here.  They stressed and emphasised the importance and the necessity&mdash;the absolute necessity&mdash;of increasing our exports.  They took the line that it was upon the agricultural produce of this country that its success, its prosperity, its stability, its future, the happiness of its people and our standing as a State, were going to be determined. Right through the report, from one end to the other, however much they may have departed from it in detail, that was the guiding principle.  It is unfortunate to my mind that there were not at least two farmers on that commission.  There does not appear to me to have been one.  There were two holders of land, very considerable holders of land, but they were on the Banking Commission one as a banker and the other in his capacity as a holder of some office to which he was appointed by the Government.  I say that for this reason, that there does appear through some paragraphs of the report to have been a certain optimism at the back of the minds of the commission generally about the situation of agriculture, which, as far as the information which we could get from the available statistics is concerned, does not appear to have been justified.  But a statement of that sort, coming from what has been described as, an ultra-conservative body, shows that at least they were not in any way pessimistic about the possibilities of the country.</P>
    <P>In paragraph 88 they say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;An important alleviation was moreover given to certain charges to be borne by agriculture by the halving of the land annuities and by State grants towards relief of rates on agricultural land.  On the other hand, the increased burden of State taxes has affected farmers as well as other classes.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The establishment of home industries <Col N="2070" /> under the industrial programme has led to a higher price of many of the goods which the farmers have to buy than would have been the case with free imports; and this is not only felt by them in their capacity of consumer, but to some extent also as an element in their cost of production. Likewise the agricultural policy while conferring direct benefits on some farmers, has, in certain respects, affected the costs of other farmers, for, as mentioned above, the admixture of home-grown oats and barley to replace at least partly imported maize has led to an increase in the price of certain feeding stuffs required for animal production, including the feeding of poultry.  As the export of live-stock products is a most important credit item in the balance of payments of the Free State, the possibility of agricultural production at a cost level which will permit reasonable remuneration to those engaged in agriculture is, of course, of predominant interest. From this point of view it may be emphasised that any serious increase in costs would be particularly harmful in a period when any advance in agricultural production must be expected chiefly from an increase in efficiency, which is only another name for reduction in costs per unit of output.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In the course of their report they give us exact figures regarding the money to the credit of agriculturists in the banks and the money owed by agriculturists. Something like one-half of those who are styled agriculturists in this country are indebted to the banks &mdash;the exact number is 125,000&mdash;and they owe approximately £14,000,000. The period of the economic conflict with Great Britain was a rather difficult time for farmers who were in that position, and the report says, in paragraph 93:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But even apart from these special advantages, the farmers have shown themselves willing to tighten their belts, when their income went down. ... There has undoubtedly in many areas been a deterioration in farming methods, a decline in the use of fertilisers, and a slowing down in <Col N="2071" /> the acquisition and replacement of machinery and other agricultural implements.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;A reduced income earned in agriculture not only affects the farmers, but has wider repercussions.  When the farmers are in reduced circumstances they cannot to the same extent pay for the services of the professional classes or purchase the commodities produced by industry. World trade is in a large measure an exchange of commodities between industry and agriculture, and this is particularly true of Ireland.  Indeed an industrial development programme has hardly a fair chance of succeeding at a time when a large section of the market for industrial goods is severely curtailed.  Fortunately, world economic tendencies seem to be moving in a way more favourable to agriculture, and the Free State, noted for its output of important specialities, should be able to share in a period of renewed agricultural prosperity.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They go on to examine generally the industrial activity which has taken place here in recent years, and they inquired into what used to be described in this House as the change-over in agriculture.  It transpires from their examination and from the facts&mdash;I must distinguish in this case between facts and arguments&mdash;that the change-over was responsible for but a marginal alteration in agricultural economy, and that it could be only that; that the main source of agricultural production in this country was, is, and will be the production of live stock and live-stock products.  That is borne out even more conclusively by the returns furnished to us for the last year or two years.  As to the extension of tillage, nobody is opposed to it so long as it is a policy pursued and operated by the farmers in a manner profitable to them and of benefit to the country.  In 1935 we had 918,000 acres under corn crops; in 1936 it advanced to 946,000 acres; in 1937 it contracted to 926,000 acres; and in 1938 to 920,892 acres.  Roots and green crops showed a reduction in those three or four years of about 30,000 acres. There has been a rise, not a considerable <Col N="2072" /> rise, possibly 10 per cent., during the last few years from the time when this policy was inaugurated.</P>
    <P>The commission stress the fact that live stock and live-stock products are and will continue to be the main source of income for those engaged in agriculture. I have taken out the figures showing the exports of agricultural products, deducting from them the imports of agricultural products, for the last eight years.  In 1931-32 there was a balance of net exports, deducting the net imports, of £13,425,257; in 1932, a balance of £6,062,816; in 1933, a balance of £4,585,311; in 1934, a balance of £3,417,444; in 1935, a balance of £6,401,463; in 1936, a balance of £8,079,290; in 1937, a balance of £6,454,513; and in 1938, a balance of £9,986,915, showing an average over these seven years of £6,426,822 as against £13,455,227 in 1931-32, or a drop of £7,000,000 over seven years.</P>
    <P>It so happens during that period that consumption at home was fairly regular, there being scarcely any change.  It may have varied a few hundred thousand or even as far as a million.  I did not take out the complete figures for the whole period, but any I got showed no comparable alteration in the amount, which came to £49,000,000 less on the average over that period.  Is it not inevitable that an industry having suffered such a loss would not be in a position to stand any extra strain?  It is quite true that during these years, from 1933 up it had to pay half the annuities.  There has been an increase in the rates, amounting in the warrant issued in the present year to something like £825,000, so that if that were to continue it has absorbed almost half of whatever advantage one could claim in respect to the reduction of the annuities.  That is the industry we have to consider.  That industry is now struggling in competition with highly efficient products from all parts of the world.  That is the main reason and purpose for which the motion was put down:</P>
    <P>(1)  to reduce the burden of direct and indirect taxation;</P>
    <P>(2)  restrict the creation of further dead-weight public debt;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2073" /> (3)  and so order the administration of public finance and policy as to stimulate profitable production and abolish poverty within the State.</P>
    <P>Looking over these seven years to see how we stand to-day, we find that we owe more, we can export less, we have fewer people, taxation is at the peak point, and production is far below the point of efficiency.  Is it not only fair and right that the Government of this State should consider how it is possible to reduce overhead charges imposed upon industry and aid it by decreasing the costs that are falling upon it?</P>
    <P>The commission's report is a very instructive one for many reasons.  I think there are three reservations on the part of the signatories of the Majority Report, and that four or five of those who signed it put in addenda.  In one of the minority reports reference is made to &ldquo;turning Pat Murphy into a market.&rdquo;  That is very reminiscent of some political slogans of seven or eight years ago, when efforts were made to turn Pat Murphy to agriculture.  Agriculture has not been made any better off. Dealing with the attitude to the secondary industries in the State the report continues on page 62:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Net output per head fell from £304 in 1929 to £256 in 1936, or by 15.8 per cent.  The figure of <i>net</i> output is not likely to have been affected greatly by changes in wholesale prices, but reflects more directly changes in wages.  This is in accord with the fact that the recent industrial expansion has been most marked in those industries in which the net output per head and as a consequence the ability to pay a high wage is small.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is there not reason in that paragraph, simple as it is, for lessening the costs? Is there any industry that can possibly escape the effects of high taxation?  If it has the good fortune to do so in one form it would meet the impact in some other form.  The Report states on page 94:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Non-agricultural imports are more likely to advance than decline <Col N="2074" /> if the standard of living is maintained or improved, that is, if the real incomes of the workers are preserved or increased.  As indicated elsewhere in this Report, wages in a number of important occupations show an upward trend, but the state of the balance of payments shows that such a trend cannot be continued with safety or prospect of permanence if it is not correlated with favourable conditions for the cheap and efficient production of agricultural commodities for export on an unsubsidised basis.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is there anything very conservative about that?  Throughout the Report it is the desire of the members sitting on it to see wages maintained and to see value got for wages when paid.  I wonder what would happen in the event of this country going off what is called &ldquo;the peg to sterling&rdquo;.  Nobody in this or any other country would support the peg to sterling because it is British.  The British Government has made many efforts during the last 15 or 20 years to arrive at some degree of stability with regard to currency generally, and when the last agreement was come to, `three or four years ago, between the French, British and American Governments, it was with a view to ensuring that stability in their currencies would be maintained.  The remarkable terms of the agreement were that every effort would be made to prevent any one of the three countries depreciating its currency so as to get a trading advantage over the other.  The Report proceeds at page 111, paragraph 181:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the first place, it is almost impossible that the export trade will remain uninfluenced by higher costs and prices on the domestic market. It has been explained in earlier sections of this report that smaller countries especially have found it advantageous to pursue a policy of comparatively low tariffs which has enabled them to build up strong export industries.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The next paragraph states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the second place, a system which involves widespread regulation of costs and prices introduces <Col N="2075" /> an element of rigidity into the country's whole economy.  It tends to reduce the effect of changing prices, and is therefore apt to be less effective in the elimination of uneconomic enterprise, and a less sure guide for the direction of economic activities towards remunerative employment.  Danish agriculture, it may be noted in this connection, has been conspicuous for the rapidity with which it adapted itself to changes in relative prices.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is there not there an indication of the desire of the commission to ensure remunerative employment?  In paragraph 187 the report states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Once a dangerous development of costs and prices has occurred a correction may prove very difficult, and it is therefore of the greatest importance that full consideration should be given to the possible effects of any proposed measures affecting the cost and price structure, and that, moreover, some general views should be taken as to what price movements may be considered justifiable for a country in the position of the Free State.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is impossible not to be struck by the multiplicity of agencies through which prices may at present be fixed.  The price of wheat is fixed by the Minister for Agriculture; the price of sugar is a matter for determination by the directors of the Irish Sugar Company, which has a statutory monopoly of this trade; the price of pigs is fixed by a statutory board, and the price of bacon by another board; the price of butter is also fixed by the Minister for Agriculture, who, in this way and through participation in the dairying industry by means of the Dairy Disposal Company, largely determines also the price which the farmer obtains for milk from a creamery.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It would seem to be in the public interest to establish a greater coordination of so much of the work of the different price-fixing agencies as it may be necessary to retain. More attention ought also to be paid <Col N="2076" /> to the monetary repercussions of all the measures taken affecting the level of costs and prices, a question to which we shall revert in later sections of this Report.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>While it is quite true there was no representative of the farming industry on this commission, they say in paragraph 328:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is another aspect of the subject of bank loans for agriculture to which it is necessary to make reference.  The Banking Commission of 1926, in its Second Interim Report, commented in strong terms on the moral risk of loans for Irish agriculture, and urged the need of a more reasonable and businesslike view of the collection of debts secured on land or incurred by farmers.  It is to be feared that, so far from any improvement having taken place in this matter during the past ten years, there has been a further deterioration of the position.  A contributing factor to this result has been the extension, from time to time, by legislation, of the discretion conferred on the Land Commission to acquire land by compulsion and to re-allot it to new occupiers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later on, on page 315, paragraph 509, it is stated:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Great importance attaches to the question of security of tenure.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They go on, in the course of their observations in connection with the question of the compulsory acquisition of land by the Land Commission, to direct attention to the fact that a man in the occupation of land cannot have the interest or the heart in it that he should have, nor would he be advised to put his capital into lands which were likely to be acquired by the Land Commission; nor, as they say, in another part which I cannot remember just now, is it likely that the farmer as such will be able easily to acquire capital for the working of his lands.</P>
    <P>As I have said in the beginning, right through the whole report there runs the one warning, the balance of payments.  It is almost a direct admonition to the country that they have to improve and extend their agricultural <Col N="2077" /> production and their exports. Bear in mind the very small incomes and the very large inroads that have been the result of the events of the last few years&mdash;the large inroads upon what farmers were able to earn.  This is obviously the time when efforts should be made to assist them.  No greater assistance is asked in this motion than to reduce the burden of direct and indirect taxation and to restrict the creation of further dead-weight public debt.</P>
    <P>The commission points out many ways in which the question of public debt could be dealt with.  I do not propose to go into the matter at this late hour, having regard to the long time this discussion has taken, or rather to the long time that has been occupied by some of the speakers.  I have looked up returns showing the Post Office deposits and Savings Certificates, and I find that in 1931 the sum total of the two amounted to £1,340,000; in 1933, it was £1,000,000; in 1934, £525,000; in 1935, £685,000; in 1936, £975,000; in 1937, £940,000, and in 1938, £574,000.  There is a reduction there; it may be a temporary reduction, and there may be reasons for it.  But the position does not appear on its face to be improving.  The country must advance. The success and prosperity of the more stable countries have depended upon the capacity of the people to save.  According to that figure, we do not seem, in respect of those who use the Post Office Savings Bank and the Savings Certificates, to be able to do it.</P>
    <P>We have been asked, in the course of this discussion, to give some information to the Government as to where they can effect savings.  I gave it here on a former occasion.  I cited something like 24 services in which the expenditure has gone up since 1931-1932. They are not social services.  The first one is the Prime Minister's Department; the second is the Department of the Comptroller and Auditor-General, and the list goes on to the Minister for Finance, the Revenue Commissioners, Commissions and Special Inquiries, the Public Works Office, the State Laboratory, the Civil Service Commission, Rates on Government Property, Secret Service, Miscellaneous Expenses, <Col N="2078" /> Stationery and Printing, Law Charges, the Department of the Minister for Justice, the Gárda, the Supreme Court and High Courts of Justice, the Minister for Education, Science and Art, National Gallery, Industry and Commerce, Marine Services, the Army, External Affairs and the League of Nations, taking out the salaries of Local Government and Public Health, National Health Insurance, Forestry, and the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>I estimate those represent a sum of approximately £3,000,000 over what they were in 1931-32.  Has the country been run so much more efficiently during that period that we can afford to spend that extra money?  Perhaps I should not say &ldquo;afford to spend&rdquo;, because the calculations are from estimates in both cases.  In the Budget discussion I disputed the claim of the Minister for Finance that the social services were responsible for the great increase that has taken place in public expenditure.  Last night the Minister compared the expenditure for 1931-32 with the expenditure for 1938-39.  I must refuse to take part in a discussion of that kind.  If we are dealing with the taxation for this year, we have to talk about the expenditure for this year.  If we are dealing with last year, we can deal with the taxation and expenditure for last year as such. But we ought to be up to date about those matters.</P>
    <P>In the course of the criticism of the Budget I went to the trouble of taking out the figures relating to civil servants, the Guards and others over and above those employed in 1931-32, and I found there were 5,000 extra.  It may be there is one section in this House anxious to see the policy in operation during the last seven years carried out successfully, as distinct from those in another part, on the Government side of the House, those who want to continue with that policy.</P>
    <P>The leaders of the Labour Party, and the Labour Party generally, would seem to be wedded to this policy of high expenditure and, possibly high taxation.  Some speaker here, in the course of this discussion, said that expenditure scarcely mattered if it were well spent.  I should like to know who has discovered <Col N="2079" /> any Government method of spending money well.  It is all extravagant. It must be extravagant. It costs money to collect it and it costs money to spend it.  The more that is taken from the pockets of the people, no matter in what walk of life they may be, the less there is for those people to spend, and they generally manage, in the ordinary course, in most countries, to spend their money better than the Government can afford to spend it.</P>
    <P>The Minister disputed a figure, which I took from the Estimates under his name, of 6,000 Guards.  That is the number that is in this year's Estimate and in last year's Estimate. In 1931-32 the number was 5,443.  The Minister, in the course of his remarks, said that he had phoned up the Guards and discovered that there were not 195 more than in 1931-32.  It does not appear to be easy to see how public business can be conducted if the documents can present one figure and the Minister presents another. Apart from that, however, I take out the sum of money collected in tariffs only in the last year in which the Public Accounts were furnished.  That would be the year 1937-38, since the accounts for last year are not yet published.  I find that the Government collected, approximately, £500,000 in tariffs over and above what was collected in 1931-32.  Then, on looking up the Revenue Commissioners' Estimate, one finds that the extra costs involved amounted to £200,000.  Now, that is very considerable. One page is taken up in the Report of the Public Accounts of 1931-32, and seven pages are taken up in the report for 1937-38 by customs duties.  I am speaking now of Estimate as against Estimate, and yet one Department is up £200,000. That is very expensive and it bears out what we have said: that the more money a Government collects the more extravagantly the money is collected; and the more money it collects to spend-well, the more extravagantly it is spent.</P>
    <P>Looking over what are called social services in this country, one is struck by the very large figure that is down <Col N="2080" /> for unemployment insurance and for unemployment relief.  In a country which had a sound agricultural economy, which had the expansion which we have been told has been marked here during these last six or seven years, it is extraordinary that two such sums of money should be required.  It is no credit to us that we have social services of such a magnitude and that our control of the business of the country and of the national economy is such that the industries we have got, whether the primary industry of agriculture or the secondary industries, are incapable of employing all these people.  Then, when one considers what sum of money each individual gets from that fairly large distribution, one gets rather appalled.  There are something like 46,000 persons who get employment on relief schemes, and dividing that 46,000&mdash;if the number be correct&mdash;into £1,290,000, I think it gives a figure of about £28 a year, or less than 11/- a week.  Of course, there is more than 11/- a week paid, but there would be only 11/- a week for the year, or £28 for the year in any case.  That does not appear to be remunerative employment, and it is a question whether it is good business to employ people and give them such small sums as to give them no great hope of being able to rehabilitate themselves or get into an economic condition.  I do not think there is much hope of a man being able to rehabilitate himself if that is all he can earn.</P>
    <P>However, the sum and substance of the efforts that have been made to industrialise the country and improve its agriculture show a large emigration from the land, large numbers of people in the cities, unbalanced Budgets, and high taxation.  Was it not well, and was it not time, that some such report was made to this House and this country as is there?  Is it not obvious that, if we are going to try to get employment for these 46,000 people, who have to be assisted annually by means of Government grants, some effort must be made to make industry profitable, whether the primary industry of agriculture or the secondary industries?  It is for that purpose we have put down the resolution.  My <Col N="2081" /> opinion, for what it is worth, is that this country is living beyond its means in so far as public and local expenditure is concerned.</P>
    <P>Whatever may be said in condemnation of other countries for pursuing an inflationary policy, the policy that has been pursued here, and that is now continuing, leads only in that direction, and leads in a direction in which the people are denied even whatever satisfaction there might be involved in an inflationary movement, as such.</P>
    <P>The Minister went to great pains to deal with this inflationary policy, or rather the line that is in the amendment proposed by the Labour Party&mdash; to utilise the credit of the nation.  Of course, it may have very many meanings, and I think we ought to have the meaning explained.  The nation as such would not refuse to lend its credit to proper spending.  Nobody has put forward any spending scheme.  We heard many years ago the great schemes that there were for putting thousands of people into employment, but only a few months ago we were told that there were none, and the Labour Party have none.</P>

      <P>Well, I should be very glad to hear them.  We did not hear them the other day.  If, however, the proposal be either to print money or indulge in any of those experiment's which have been dangled before the people's eyes, the results will be disastrous not only for them but for the whole country.  I should not like to discuss the economic conditions or financial affairs of other countries here in this House, and we need not do so.  We need only go back a little bit in history.  From my little historical knowledge, the first instance of this sort of development occurred during the period of the French Revolution, when, in the General Assembly, or the Constituent Assembly, or whatever it <Col N="2082" /> called itself, a proposal was put up for the issue of 400,000 assignats.  The people were assured that, once that was done, everything would be all right.  Well, the assignats were issued but it was not very long afterwards until 400,000 more assignats had to be issued, and so on.</P>
      <P>Who suffered the most?  The people who suffered the most were the unfortunate working people of that country, and some of the richer people made money out of it.  That has happened all over Europe, and the racial disturbances that have occurred in Europe during the last couple of years are traceable to the fact that certain people, during the tribulations of some of these great nations, made money while their people starved.</P>
      <P>If you interrupt for once in this country&mdash;a country, old and all as it is, in its infancy, one might say, in connection with these matters&mdash;the policy of thrift that is characteristic of our people, if you shake their confidence in the banking institutions of the country, and if you keep them from looking to the future when they will have something for themselves, you will be doing them a very grave disservice.  When people are talking about money and credit, I should like to see some of those who believe in Government policy who have £100 to their credit&mdash;they need not part with a penny of it&mdash;and who have a business or employment, so that if anything happens there will not be a dead loss; something will be left, going into a bank and signing a bill whereby the bank will accommodate them with £100 to put into one of these schemes that you talk about.  But do not go on with the business of producing something for which there is no sale.  We have not been able to turn Pat Murphy into a market for the last seven years, and we will not turn him into one for the next seven either unless we increase the production of this country, increase the number of persons in profitable and gainful occupations, and do something towards building up the country instead of talking about that sort of thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2083" /> My attention was drawn to one particular proposal dealt with in this Banking Commission Report about solving the housing question at no cost to the State, and at no cost to the Municipality.  I went into the matter and found that it costs £866 to provide a flat in the City of Dublin.  The Corporation charges a rental of 6/6 for that.  The Government puts up&mdash;I am speaking from recollection but I think that what I am about to say is correct &mdash;about £18 a year.  The Corporation subscribes £28 a year.  According to the Report, or the recommendation, we would be enabled, if we had this magic method of social credit in operation, to let that house at no cost to the State and at no cost to the Municipality. If it has to be paid for in 40 years, a 40th of £866 is £21.  Rates, the cost of repairs, the cost of the collection of rent and insurance will amount to approximately £18.  That gives a total of £39 a year.  Is that man in the City of Dublin, who is now paying 6/6 a week, going to be content to pay 15/- a week under social credit?  Many many years ago it was said that we were to earn our bread in the sweat of our brow and there is no getting away from it.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2084" /> Government, and certainly pay the State, to devise a scheme for assisting the agricultural industry; to assist it, mind you, non-politically, to assist it economically and get more out of it.  One of the first things to be done in that connection would be to carry out what is in this resolution which is put forward with the intention of improving this country and the condition of the people who are in it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, in his lengthy and weary speech, lasting 3½ hours, quoted from statements made by our late Holy Father, but in doing so he did not relate the statements in any way to the majority or to any of the minority reports of the Banking Commission.  I listened very attentively to the whole of the speech made by the Minister. The most regrettable part of that very lengthy speech was the uncalled for condemnation which the Minister poured out upon the New Zealand Government, a Government that he knew&mdash; we know that he knew it&mdash;was at the moment engaged in the most delicate negotiations with the British Government, and with those who control the London Money Market.  It was not necessary for the Minister, in order to make his own case, to condemn, in a speech lasting over an hour, a Government which he admitted to be a friendly Government, whose Minister for Finance was the guest of this Government within the last week.  As a matter of fact, the Minister for Finance himself was responsible for moving a vote of thanks to the New Zealand Minister for Finance for the address which he delivered within the precincts of this House less than three days ago.  I hope, at any rate, that the delicate negotiations which have been going on for some time past, and which are about to conclude in the very near future, as far as I am informed, will be in no way prejudiced by the uncalled for attack made by our Minister for Finance on the policy of the New Zealand Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember the Minister for Finance when he was sitting on the Opposition Benches, and when he was a most eloquent speaker from those benches in <Col N="2085" /> condemnation of the activities of bankers, of landlords&mdash;both ground and land&mdash;and of profiteers of every description.  We have listened to his speech, opened last night and concluded to-day.  I am sure that any person interested in the continuance of the existing banking system would say that he was the most eloquent advocate for the callous, capitalist classes in this country that has been ever heard speaking in this House or outside this House.  The Minister for Finance, if he has ever looked at certain sections of the Constitution of this country, must have forgotten the meaning of what is contained in them.  The Taoiseach, who, I presume, will speak in this debate before it concludes, claims credit and full responsibility for the latest baby Constitution of the world, which has been described inside and outside this House as the greatest Catholic Constitution in the whole world.  Article 45 of that Constitution deals with &ldquo;directive principles of social policy&rdquo;.  Sub-section (2) of it states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The State shall, in particular, direct its policy towards securing</P>
    <P>(i)  that the citizens (all of whom, men and women equally, have the right to an adequate means of livelihood) may through their occupations find the means of making reasonable provision for their domestic needs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Further on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;III. That, especially the operation of free competition shall not be allowed so to develop as to result in the concentration of the ownership or control of essential commodities in a few individuals to the common detriment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>And again, and this has a very direct bearing upon the subject matter of this motion and amendment:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;IV.  That in what pertains to the control of credit the constant and predominant aim shall be the welfare of the people as a whole.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach, or any other member of the Government Front Bench who may speak later on this debate, give us some indication as to how far this Government has, within <Col N="2086" /> the seven years it has been in office, made any attempt to implement those articles in this much boosted Constitution? I suggest that the Minister for Finance throughout his speech forgot, or must never have read, those Articles in the Constitution.  If he ever did read them, he certainly completely ignored them in the lecture which he delivered to this House and, through it, to the people as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, although claiming on behalf of the Government a further period of time in order to enable them to make up their minds as to what was going to be done in connection with the Banking Commission Report, pursued a line of argument which made it quite clear to everyone who was listening to him that he was standing over and defending the so-called Majority Report. There is a very close relationship between the language in the motion moved by Deputy Dillon and in the language used by the Minister for Finance not alone in his speech in this House last night and to-day, but in the language of the speech&mdash;it is on the records&mdash;which he delivered in the Seanad on the 28th June last.  Compare the language in Deputy Dillon's motion with the following statements made by the Minister for Finance. Deputy Dillon in his motion speaks of seeking &ldquo;to reduce the burden of direct and indirect taxation.&rdquo;  Dealing with that matter in the Lower House the Minister for Finance said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Undoubtedly, I make no concealment of the fact that it would be advantageous if a retrenchment in certain non-productive expenditure could be made.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He did not proceed to indicate what he referred to as non-productive expenditure. He is leaving us to guess as to what he meant in that direction, and I hope that, if the Taoiseach agrees with that line of thought, he will indicate what his Minister for Finance meant when he referred to non-productive expenditure and the desire of his Minister to make economies in that direction.</P>
    <P>He made some remarkable statements further on in the same debate. Dealing with the provision of credit <Col N="2087" /> as called for by certain farmer Senators, when he was addressing them in that House he said: &ldquo;My own view in regard to this matter is that by all means we ought to increase production&rdquo;. Every Deputy in this House is in favour of increasing production, but the problem is, how is agricultural production to be increased? What is the means whereby the lands that are in a semi-derelict condition are going to be occupied by stock and machinery obtained in order to increase production?  Much of the land that is derelict to-day is derelict because there is no working capital or credit available for the purpose.</P>
    <P>He goes on: &ldquo;My view is that once prices are right, the production will follow&rdquo;.  That comes from our Minister for Finance, who accepts responsibility for the fixation of the prices of agricultural produce.  The Minister for Finance is responsible for the establishment of the Irish Sugar Manufacturing Company and inferentially responsible for the activities of the beet growers and the fixing of the price to be paid to the farmer for beet.  There is no Deputy sitting for the constituency that I represent in this House who can deny that there has been a considerable reduction in the acreage under beet in the last two years.  I asked for information on that point myself from the Minister for Finance in a question addressed to him a couple of months ago, but he told me it would not be in the public interest to give that information. However, I have information from a reliable source, which is to the effect that the acreage of beet, in the case of the constituency which I have the honour to represent, is about 50 per cent. of the acreage there was when there was only one beet factory in this country, the one in Carlow.</P>
    <P>Is it to be suggested therefore by the Minister for Finance, who is responsible for the price of beet, or by anybody in this House, that farmers are going out of beet cultivation because they are earning too much by growing beet?  I suggest they are not I think the only reason why they are getting out of beet is that they are not getting an economic price for it.  Therefore, if <Col N="2088" /> the Minister has any grounds for saying that production will increase when prices become economic it is his business to increase the price of beet.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just dealing with the Minister's remarks.  He goes on to say: &ldquo;I feel that once prices are right, the credit for which Senator Baxter has been clamouring and for which Senator Counihan has asked, and which Senator Johnston has begged me to extend, will be extended by the normal organs which have been built up over generations for the provision of such credit&mdash;by the banks.&rdquo;  Is not that a clear acceptance of the Majority Report of the Banking Commission, that it must be left to the banks of this country, who place no value whatever on the land as a security, to provide money for the increase of agricultural production?</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach spoke here two weeks ago, and told the House that he accepted the principles enshrined in the Third Minority Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The social principles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the social principles enshrined in the Third Minority Report.  Does the Taoiseach contend that the social principles enshrined in the Third Minority Report can be rightly related to the Majority Report of the Banking Commission?  I am hoping that Deputy O'Loghlen, who signed the Third Minority Report, will honour the House with a speech before this serious and interesting debate concludes.  If the Taoiseach is in any doubt as to the machinery which should be provided for putting that report into operation, Deputy O'Loghlen will, I am sure, oblige the House and the country with the information, and help the Minister for Finance to make up his mind as to what he is going to do inside a period of two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance went on further, and, concluding his speech in reference to the provision of credit, he <Col N="2089" /> said: &ldquo;This cry for credit for this section or that section of the population is fast becoming, in the mouths of Senator Baxter and those others who follow him, a cry for confiscation and expropriation.&rdquo; That is certainly an outlandish statement for the Minister for Finance to make, and is tantamount to saying that those who are pleading for the provision of working capital, for better credit facilities, in order to increase our agricultural production are standing for the policy of Communism and confiscation.  No such thing; and he knows that perfectly well.</P>
    <P>That is the line followed by the Minister for Finance, in the lengthy, weary and depressing speech which he made last night and to-day.  It would be interesting to know whether it is in conformity with the policy and the ideals which are contained in the Third Minority Report, in the opinion of the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach, at any rate, has made up his mind to the extent that he is prepared to subscribe to the social principles in the Third Minority Report, but the Minister for Finance wants two years more to think the whole matter over.  Listening to his speech, and to the way in which he condemned the policies of other Governments&mdash;and the New Zealand Government in particular&mdash;one knows in what direction the Minister's mind will be finally made up.  Everybody in this House, regardless of Party affiliations, believes in increased agricultural and industrial production.  Do the Taoiseach and his Ministers believe, with their experience of seven years, that the existing bank policy will provide the necessary capital and credit for that very desirable purpose?</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon wants the House to accept his motion, and with it the Majority Report of the Banking Commission. What does he propose to do? He proposes to do things other than the matters referred to in the motion. We know he has been advocating&mdash;and I quite agree with him&mdash;the adoption of the social services provided by the New Zealand Government for the aged and infirm and for widows and orphans, and that wages be paid on the scales presently paid by the Governments I have referred to.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2090" /> How in the name of goodness can Deputy Dillon or Deputy Mulcahy reduce indirect taxation or provide social services for the people of this State on a comparative basis with the people of New Zealand within the lines of the Majority Report of the Banking Commission?  If some other Front Bench speaker will give us more particulars as to how that can be done, I would be inclined, with my colleagues, to reconsider the terms of the amendment standing in my name and in the names of other members of this Party.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave kept away from that.  We all know that Deputy Dillon was in New Zealand, and after he returned from his Continental tour he came back here and in the recent bye-election in South Dublin he advocated the extension of our social services in the direction I have referred to.  I suggest that Deputy Dillon's motion is a silly motion, since he is calling for the reduction of direct and indirect taxation, and at the same time allowing such other things to be understood from his speeches.  I say that these things cannot be done within the limits of the Majority Report of the Banking Commission.  However, there seems to be no difference whatever between the line of thought followed by Deputy Dillon and the speech delivered by the Minister for Finance, and there is every indication, from these two speeches, that on questions of financial policy we will have Deputy Dillon and the Minister for Finance in some new Party before the lifetime of this Parliament comes to an end.</P>
    <P>The members of this Party are in agreement with the Second Minority Report, but, personally, I see no fundamental difference between the three Minority Reports, and if the Parties responsible for issuing these reports had been given sufficient time to put their heads together, I am sure they would have blended their thoughts into one report, instead of issuing three.  I hope we shall have the pleasure of listening to Deputy O'Loghlen on that aspect of the work of the commission, and that he will indicate the difference, if any, between the report he signed and the other Minority Reports.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2091" /> There is one thing we must all appreciate, and that is the courageous speech made by Deputy Dowdall. Deputy Dowdall is a comparatively old man, who indicated, by the terms of his speech, that he has a very youthful and modern mind.  He has given good advice to the Minister for Finance, if the Minister has the pluck to adopt it. The main report of the Banking Commission can be summarised very briefly.  The Majority Report recommends quite definitely the abolition of bodies like the Agricultural Credit Corporation and the Industrial Credit Company, and the cessation of borrowing from the Road Fund.</P>
    <P>If that type of recommendation were to be adopted by the Government, I think the number of unemployed would increase instead of decrease, and I cannot see how, under a recommendation of that kind, agricultural or industrial production could be increased. They recommend the reconstruction of State and semi-State undertakings, such as the Sugar Beet Company and the Electricity Supply Board.  I wonder if anybody on the Front Opposition Bench would confirm the statement I heard some time ago, that one of the principal signatories to the Majority Report resigned from the public service some years ago because he opposed the then Government in the promotion of the Shannon Scheme? If that is so, it is an indication of the line of thought which was generally pursued by those responsible for the Majority Report, and explains the position of that individual in associating his name with recommendations of this kind.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, in supporting this motion, said that he could reduce taxation, direct and indirect, and provide all the credit necessary for improving our social services out of the increased revenue which was bound to come from increased production under the terms of the policy indicated in his motion. Deputy Dillon appears to think that everything spent within the year should come out of revenue.  That apparently is the line pursued by the majority of the members of the Banking Commission, but it is certainly not the line <Col N="2092" /> adopted by another, and, in the opinion of Deputy Dillon, a greater country, which is supposed to be the master of mankind in regard to financial equilibrium and sound financial policy.  Is Deputy Dillon aware that £350,000,000 are being spent by the British Government this year in the provision of armaments which is not coming out of revenue, and will he, when replying, tell the House where the British Government are getting that amount of money?  That kind of policy was condemned by the people who signed the Majority Report, but, on the other hand, it is applauded by some of the leading British economists.</P>
    <P>People talk here very often about this being a small country, with limited resources.  So far as I can understand the position of this country, it is high up on the list of creditor nations, unlike some of the other nations whose policy was severely criticised here by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>This country is not in the same position, with regard to international debts, as Britain with America, New Zealand with Britain, or other countries.  She has a clean sheet, so far as that is concerned.  The resources of this country depend, and will depend in future on the ability of the Government elected by the people to make use of them for the best possible purpose, and if our resources are limited, it is because we have not got a financial policy which can develop these resources for the purpose of providing increased production, increased employment and increased spending power for those who are prepared to give service to the country.  The British Budget revenue has been mounting up very considerably for the past few years, in spite of the fact that her principal exports were being gradually wiped out.  Does Deputy Dillon know, for instance, the extent to which British cotton exports to certain colonial countries have been reduced within the last ten years?  I recently read a British official document which set out that the cotton exports of ten years ago to certain colonial countries have been reduced from £200,000,000 to £31,000,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2093" /> Does everybody not know that British coal exports to foreign countries have been considerably reduced, and is it not a well-known fact that British shipping tonnage has been considerably reduced, and that the iron and steel industry, one of the key industries of Britain, has been in a precarious position for a considerable period?  The British Government, however, in spite of decreased exports, so far as their principal exportable commodities are concerned, are able to justify the doubling of their Budget revenue within the period I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, in his reply, and in justification for doing nothing in connection with the Banking Commission Report, claimed a period of two years more in order to consider what was likely to be done, and he endeavoured&mdash;I do not say deliberately&mdash;to mislead the House in connection with the effect of the settlement of the economic war.  He read out the figures indicating what he referred to as the increased value of our exports since the settlement of the economic war.  He quoted a number of figures in regard to the value of live stock and in regard to the value of the exports of butter and eggs to Britain. I suggest that in quoting the increased value of our exports he was endeavouring to mislead the House.  I say that because, as far as I can find out from the information supplied to Deputies in official documents, the volume of these has decreased while the value has been increased.  The Minister should have said that the increase in exports was due mainly to the abolition of the penal tariffs and not to any increase in the quantity of live stock, eggs or butter exported to Great Britain since the settlement of the economic war.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied from any examination that I am capable of giving to the condition of affairs in this country that we are not going to solve the problem of unemployment or to increase production under the present system.  The credit system available during the last five to ten years has been considerably restricted, compared with the system in operation 20, <Col N="2094" /> 30 or 40 years ago.  Every farmer in this country 20, 30 or 40 years ago was well able to carry on between the time he sowed his grain crop or put in his other crops by the facilities provided for him by the shopkeepers in the local town.  The farmer got his tea, his sugar and his tobacco on what some people might call the credit system provided by the local shopkeeper between the time he bought the cattle and sold them, or between the time he put down his crop and the time in which he was able to market it.  That system has been completely wiped out as a result of the refusal of our banks in the last ten years to give any facilities of that kind to the local farmers.  The shopkeeper is unable to give the facilities he used to give in the past.</P>
    <P>It is asserted also, and I do not know if anybody can deny it, that the real reason for the refusal of our banks to advance money for the purpose of agricultural production has been the passing of the Land Acts.  It was stated to myself by bankers, when I was making an appeal for farmers who were threatened with eviction or the sale of their land, that the cause of the refusal to give credit facilities to farmers was the passing of the Land Acts, including the Land Act as far back as 1923.  These Acts, the bankers said, destroyed the security of land in this country so far as the making of loans by bankers is concerned.  Does the Taoiseach subscribe to that particular objection?  If so, either this Government or its predecessors, both of whom were responsible for the passing of these Acts which have destroyed land as a security for advances, are bound in duty to come in and put that matter right.  Bank managers and bank directors will tell you that the reason why land is not good security or why it is useless as security is because there is now no such thing as free sale&mdash;if the banks want to sell a farm.  I do not know very much about that operation so far as the farmers and bankers in my constituency are concerned, but I know of cases where judgments have been marked by the banks on land during the last 10 or 15 years.  It is a fact, at any rate, that the borrowing power, so <Col N="2095" /> far as land is concerned as security for advances, has been destroyed.  Well, then, that being the case, it is the duty of the Government to step in and put things right.</P>
    <P>When talking about increasing production either for home consumption or for export, we have to associate with it the provision of credit.  We must associate that with increased production for export purposes, and we must insist on providing machinery so as to help to put our exports on the foreign markets.  When I speak of foreign markets, we all know that the British market is really our foreign market.  Now we are being gradually driven out of the British market by the highly organised methods of countries like Denmark, and unless we copy the methods adopted by Denmark we are not going to increase our exports to the British market.  We must, in order to do that, have a more efficient marketing machine than we have at the present time.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to admit that Deputy Belton has a keener knowledge of these things than most Deputies.  At any rate, we did not hear anything about the collapse of Denmark from the Minister for Finance when he was talking about a policy that he does not like.  Deputy Belton knows that there has been a reduction in the quantity of butter and eggs exported to the British market.  I have some contact with people engaged in the marketing of produce on the British market.  I have contact with people of that kind by reason of the position I hold in the shipping world. I agree that the Government passed a very useful Act here some time ago for the purpose of increasing egg production. I have heard, however, from people engaged in the egg trade and people who are in touch with that trade why it is that there has been no increase in egg production following the passing of that measure.  The reason is that if we are going to increase our exports in connection with <Col N="2096" /> butter, or eggs, or other agricultural produce to the British market we will have to put these exports on that market in an organised way, in large quantities and at a price that will meet the requirements of the people who are prepared to purchase our produce.</P>

      <P>I am tempted to reply to that interruption in very unparliamentary language.  Now a good deal of misrepresentation has been used here in this House in connection with the present position of New Zealand.  The Minister for Finance, who thought he had his speech and figures at his disposal, expressed a certain point of view but was apparently unable to find his speech or his figures to quote correctly in support of the statement he was making here.  By the way, I was very glad to read in a certain weekly paper here that the Minister for Agriculture is engaged with a very prominent Deputy of this House in devising some new policy.  In an English pictorial called <i>Illustrated</i>, dated the 8th July, 1939, there is a photograph of Doctor Ryan, the Minister for Agriculture, sitting very near Deputy Dan Breen, who is described as &ldquo;The Leader of the Labour Party&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Underneath this photograph of &ldquo;Dr. Ryan, Minister for Agriculture, and Daniel Breen&rdquo; there is this letterpress: &ldquo;Helping to bring economic self-sufficiency, to a country but lately semi-feudal, means deep thinking for Dr. James Ryan, Minister for Agriculture, and Daniel Breen (right), Leader of the Labour Party, when they discuss new policies.&rdquo;  I wonder did the Taoiseach see this photograph or is he prepared to confirm the statement that we have set up a new Labour Party in the country <Col N="2097" /> and that the leader is no less a person than Deputy Dan Breen?  I would be glad if the Minister for Agriculture and Deputy Dan Breen would grace this House by their presence and indicate what is the nature of the proposals which they appear to be considering behind the scenes?  There are other interesting statements in this pictorial, which is printed in England, but these have nothing to do with the present debate.</P>
      <P>Statements of a very funny nature were made, as I have already stated, by the Minister for Finance in connection with the position in New Zealand.  He read out certain figures to justify the point of view which he was expressing, but he did not quote the full figures from official records in regard to total production, farm production, marriage rate, birth rate, etc. The total production in New Zealand in 1935 was £89,000,000.  That has been increased as a result of the policy put into operation by the New Zealand Government to £135,600,000 in 1938, or by 39.8 per cent. in a period of three years.  Farm production in 1935 was £59,200,000, and in 1938 it had increased to £83,100,000, or an increase of over 40 per cent.  This is the Government which, according to Deputy Dillon and our Government, has gone &ldquo;bust&rdquo;. Exports in 1935 totalled £46,538,000, and in 1938 had increased to £58,376,000 or an increase of 25.4 per cent.  Imports, which&mdash;I agree with the Minister for Finance&mdash;were increased, due to certain things which the Minister did not specify, were in 1935 £36,317,000, and in 1938 had increased to £55,422,000, or an increase of 52.6 per cent.  That was due to the importation of certain luxury articles and machinery for secondary industries, and it was brought about by the increased purchasing power of the population in New Zealand.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance correctly stated that last year certain steps were taken by the New Zealand Government to reduce the importation of luxury articles into that country and for reasons which are pretty well understood. Deputy Dillon said that the New Zealand finances had gone &ldquo;bust.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the very word that was used.  Does Deputy Dillon know that at the end of the last financial year there was a surplus of £800,000, so far as New Zealand was concerned, whereas in this country, where everything is done properly by our present Minister for Finance, there was, if there had not been paper juggling with figures, a deficit of £1,000,000?  If the Minister had not made a paper profit on the importation of sugar shortly before the Budget was introduced, he would not have been able to balance the Budget in the way he says he balanced it.  He would not have been able to balance it if he were not able to steal or &ldquo;pinch&rdquo; £150,000 from the Road Fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>If New Zealand has gone &ldquo;bust&rdquo; will Deputy Dillon say why, when an internal loan for £4,500,000 was floated, it was largely over-subscribed?  If Deputy Dillon knows that, he had no justification for ridiculing the New Zealand Government in the way he did when speaking to this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>What were the terms of the loan?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>It was an internal loan of £4,500,000 at 4 per cent.  I suggest that the people of New Zealand must have complete confidence in the Government and the policy of the Government, otherwise the loan would not have been so substantially oversubscribed. A good deal of play has been made also with the object of the visit of Mr. Nash to London.  The Minister for Finance indicated, from official records from which he quoted, that the amount of loans floated in the London market by the New Zealand Government&mdash;I mean the Governments which preceded the present New Zealand Government&mdash;amounted to £156,000,000 or £157,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figure which I had given to me was £200,000,000, but in any case the New Zealand Government, as a result <Col N="2099" /> of their refusal to repudiate the liabilities of their predecessors, are obliged to find an annual interest charge of £14,000,000 on the loans that were floated on the London money market.  The fact that luxury articles and machinery have been imported into New Zealand in such quantities during the last few years, and the fact that the British Government had depreciated the price of agricultural exports from New Zealand, compelled the Minister for Finance of the New Zealand Government to enter into negotiations with the British Government and the leaders of finance in London for the purpose of getting an economic price for the commodities that were being imported into Great Britain from New Zealand, so as to help, by way of money received for these exports, to find the £14,000,000 which they are obliged to raise annually for these loans.  Is that not the position?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position as I understand it.  Certain negotiations have been going on between representatives of the New Zealand Government and the British Government for the purpose of levelling up prices of commodities exported from New Zealand to Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  There is an annual charge of £14,000,000 to be met by the New Zealand Government for the purpose of redeeming the liabilities incurred by the Governments which preceded the present Savage Labour Government.  A large slice of the debts to which I have referred were incurred by previous Governments in New Zealand for the purpose of paying part of the cost of the World War started in 1914.  I dare say Deputy Dillon, if he found himself in the same position as the New Zealand Government finds itself at present, and if he could not increase the prices of New Zealand exports into the British market, would find some other <Col N="2100" /> way of meeting the situation.  I do not know whether or not negotiations have been concluded on the matter but it is known to every member of the House, and to Deputy Dillon more than to anybody else, that when the British Government found themselves in a very peculiar position regarding their liabilities to America, and when they said they could not find the money to repay loans to the American Government, they found an easy way out of it by making a token payment. Of course Deputy Dillon would not call that repudiation.  I know that if I found myself up against the position which the Government of New Zealand found itself up against, I would make no apology to anybody for making a token payment to the British Government for debts incurred if the British Government would not pay an economic price for goods exported into the British market.</P>
      <P>It is bad business?  Mr. Baldwin did not consider it bad business when he was trying to get out of his liabilities to the American Government some years ago.  Nobody could accuse the British Government of standing for a policy of repudiation.</P>

      <P>In the amendment which has been moved by Deputy Norton we are standing for the provision of credit, for increased agricultural production, and for the provision of employment for everybody who is willing to work, under some such system as has been so successfully put into operation in New Zealand.  New Zealand, through an internal money machine&mdash;call it a Central Bank if you wish&mdash;has been providing credit for work of a permanent development character.  The bankers of this country are not prepared, as far as I know, to provide money for that particular purpose.  If the Taoiseach is prepared to confirm that statement, and if that is the reason why the Government is unable to solve unemployment or to increase production, let him indicate any other method he likes whereby he will be able to implement his own policy.</P>

I suggest to the Government that money could be usefully provided &mdash;let them get it in any way they can; if they cannot get it I think they would be well advised to study the New Zealand system&mdash;for the expansion of afforestation, and for the widening and remaking of trunk, tourist and main roads.  I have been informed by a man &mdash;for whose views I have very great respect&mdash;in the administrative service of this country, that if we proceeded with the scheme for the widening of all the trunk and main roads of this country it would give a very large amount of employment in every county in the State, and it is a very valuable and productive form of employment.</P>

      <P>Of course if the Minister for Finance pinches most of the money in the Road Fund for the purpose of balancing his Budget, it will not be there to be used for that purpose. I suggest to the Taoiseach and to the Government that money could be usefully provided for bog reclamation work, and that most of the counties throughout the country would benefit by the carrying out of work of that kind.  I am informed by experts associated with the Land Commission, men of experience in the farming business, that reclaimed bog land can be made very useful and productive.  I suggest that money could also be usefully provided <Col N="2102" /> for drainage, fencing and improvement of land; for the organising of marketing schemes for agricultural produce&mdash;a very essential part of any scheme which will provide money for increased production for export purposes; and for the building of houses, which I understand has been suspended in some of the principal parts of this country through lack of money.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach, when speaking on this matter the other day, said that the trouble was lack of proper organisation for pushing their policy forward in the way in which the Government desire to do it.  If that is a fact, will the Taoiseach state whether the original application of the Dublin Corporation for the sanctioning of a loan not merely to complete schemes that were being carried out, but to carry out further schemes, was turned down by the banks as a result of an application made by the Ministry of Local Government?  Was the original application for a loan of £3,000,000 reduced to £1,500,000?  I do not speak with inside information of this, but I was so informed by a member of the Dublin Corporation, and I should like to hear Deputy Belton, who is Chairman of the Finance Committee, say something on this matter when he comes to speak in this debate.  If the loan which was applied for by the Dublin Corporation for the purpose of carrying out its housing policy was turned down by the banks, what action does the Ministry propose to take, or in what other way do they propose to find money for that very deserving and laudable purpose?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some time ago, I think it was on the 8th of last December, the Government set up a tribunal for the purpose of dealing with certain matters referred to it by the principal railway company of this State.  The principal railway company of this State, which was then and still is, I think, in a bankrupt condition, applied to the Government in June of last year&mdash;over a year ago&mdash; for a further very large sum in money in order to enable it to carry out certain reorganisation work which it felt had been passed on to it as a result of Acts passed by this House.  Will <Col N="2103" /> the Taoiseach admit that the electrification of the railway lines of this country is a desirable work, and should be carried out if the railway system is to be maintained at all in this country? Will he, for instance, agree that it is necessary to renew the permanent way so far as the railway lines are concerned if the railway service is to be maintained?  If the railway service is to be maintained I am sure he will admit that it is absolutely essential that modern rolling stock should be provided for the purpose of carrying on an efficient and modern transport system so far as the railway is concerned? Those are works of a kind which, if the money could be found to carry them out, would provide employment, in the opinion of the members of this Party, for 50,000 out of our present unemployed population.  If the Taoiseach and his Government cannot find the money under the system advocated in this amendment, under the system that has been successfully operated in New Zealand for purposes of the same kind, then let him indicate to this House when he is speaking in this debate any other way in which the money can be found for purposes of this kind.  We think it will be generally agreed that the carrying out of works of the kind that I have mentioned and, perhaps, other works of a useful and productive nature, would provide employment for 100,000 or so of the unemployed that we have in this country at the present time.</P>

      <P>Well, we are challenged to produce proposals, when we advocate a policy such as that put forward in this amendment, and I have indicated to the best of my ability the works which I think could be usefully carried out to the benefit of this nation, works which would give employment to those who are looking for work, and which would put increased money into circulation to the advantage of the farming community.  If Deputy Hughes has any other schemes in his mind, schemes of a kind which would <Col N="2104" /> provide work for our unemployed population on a more profitable basis, then let Deputy Hughes indicate what is the nature of those works.  At any rate, I am taking the risk of submitting those proposals, in the hope that they will receive some consideration from the people who have the responsibility for the good government of this country.  The Government told the people of this country that it had a plan, or would produce a plan at any rate, and put it into operation in such a way that it would provide useful employment for all our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to harp upon or to quote from the promises which have been made by the Taoiseach and by his Minister inside and outside this House prior to and since 1932, but I do suggest that there is something radically wrong&mdash;and it is associated with the money machine of this country&mdash;when the Taoiseach and his Government are unable to carry out the promises they made to the people of this country regarding the provision of work for the unemployed, and the production of better credit facilities for the farming community.  At any rate this amendment requests the Government to submit to the Dáil at once proposals for the better development of agriculture and industry, the utilisation of the credit of the nation to stimulate such development, and the absorption of the unemployed workers in productive employment at adequate rates of wages.  That is the duty of the Government, in accordance with the pledges and promises made by them.  It is their duty particularly in view of the clear majority they got from the people of the country at the last general election.  I hope that when the Taoiseach speaks in this debate he will give us some indication of the extent to which improvement has been effected in the economic life of this country since the economic war was settled, and also, what is far more important, some better indication of the methods which the Government propose to adopt to implement the many promises which they have made to provide useful employment for our able-bodied population and to improve <Col N="2105" /> the general position of the community as a whole.</P>

The Minister for Finance has dealt very exhaustively with the nation's finances.  He has dealt with some of the proposals which have been made and challenged those who are responsible for the motion and the amendment to indicate in what way they expect that what they propose should be done.  Although we are supposed to be discussing this particular motion, we are discussing the whole of the national economy and we are discussing matters with which this volume only partially deals, and this is but one of the three volumes presented to the Government and to the country for examination.</P>
      <P>During the debate we were asked why it was that we set up a commission and why it was that we set up a commission of this particular sort.  We set up that commission because we were anxious to get for the Government and the country as close an examination of the financial and economic position as we could get by people who were not likely to take any particular Party point of view and who could be depended upon to point out any dangers which they saw.  In choosing the personnel of the commission we took good care that nobody at any time could cast a stone at it from the point of view of an objective approach to the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it will be admitted that we were wise in doing that, if we were setting up a commission at all.  If a commission such as some people would have liked to have set up had been selected, if the personnel had been selected as some people here would like, from the first day on which they sat we would have either the findings discredited in advance or, worse still, there would have been people running around the country trying to create panic.  &ldquo;Wolf, wolf,&rdquo; was being cried when there were certain dangers; but the cry of &ldquo;wolf, wolf,&rdquo; would have been repeated ten times as often if it could be suggested for one moment <Col N="2106" /> that we had packed a commission which would bring in a report suggesting devices such as these people we had in mind would wish to suggest.  I think we were wise in our selection of the personnel.</P>
    <P>It is not true to say that it was a bankers' commission in the sense that we packed it with representatives of the banks.  We did nothing of the sort. They were a minority on it, but it was right and proper that those who were acquainted with the banking system of the country or acquainted generally with banking methods should be there, so that they might have their say when any recommendations were being made.  We had people on it, the best we could find in the country, who were acquainted with public finance and who were likely to approach this subject from an impartial point of view, at least so far as any inclination to favour our Party or, if you wish, any Party is concerned.  It may be objected that their training, that the nature of the work in which some of them had been engaged, might make them unduly conservative or unduly biased in a conservative direction.  I think that is the worst that could be said of them.</P>
    <P>We are not bound to accept their report or any of their recommendations. The report is of value only in so far as the facts which it reveals are true with regard to statistics and so forth, and so far as the reasoning on which any of the recommendations are founded is sound.  It is for the Government and for every Deputy, when the question of any of these recommendations comes up, to examine the reasoning and the basis on which the conclusions are founded and to ask themselves are they sound or are they not.  It is something, at any rate, to know that the worst that can be said of our position has been said of it, and that we have no fear in approaching this subject that we have a report presented to us which is intended to give us a rosy picture of our situation or to hide from us dangerous tendencies or dangerous facts.</P>
    <P>It was an examination that I believe should be made, and we had the courage to make it, and to begin it in the middle of an economic war, in <Col N="2107" /> which we were trying to defend the rights of this country, and, at a time, when the people on the opposite benches were trying to get the people to believe that we were ended economically.  We set it up under these conditions.  I think the report was mainly written, and actually presented, before the Economic Agreement was made.  At least, it was written, and it is from the depth of the position we were in, and the depth of the biggest agricultural depression the world has ever known, that these volumes were presented, so that the most pessimistic person in the country can know that nothing worse need be apprehended, and that there is nothing worse in our situation than has been revealed in the report.</P>
    <P>I want to say again about the personnel of the commission that I believe they approached their work, not for the purpose of serving any interest, except to get the truth, and to serve our people, by presenting an examination of the economic situation which we were in. Thanks has been expressed also from other quarters to those people who served on that commission over a long period, and who gave us in this report their views on the facts of our economic situation, and their views as to the steps that should be taken to improve the economic situation of our country.  I think that is due to them. I think it is most unfair to have talk about this being a conservative report. We may say that individuals approach these things with a certain bias, but it is most unfair to say that they had any ulterior motive in mind when making their recommendations.  It is in that spirit the Government and the Department will examine this report. When we come to consider specific recommendations, or other recommendations of our own, to deal with the situation in which we find ourselves, it is in that spirit we will approach it.</P>
    <P>We have been listening to talk about this country's position at the present time.  The Deputy who introduced the principal motion said that the one mistake they made was that they cried <Col N="2108" />&ldquo;Wolf, wolf,&rdquo; too soon.  I suppose they would like now that &ldquo;Wolf, wolf&rdquo; would have a better effect than when they cried it in the middle of the economic war.  There is no need to cry &ldquo;Wolf, wolf.&rdquo;  This nation, compared with other nations in the world, is in a sound condition financially and fundamentally.  We have a number of evils which we ought to devote all our attention to try to remedy but, as far as the fundamental financial situation is concerned, we are in a sound position. If &ldquo;Wolf, wolf&rdquo; was cried too soon, and if it was not justified in 1934, it certainly is not justified to-day. None of the facts of the situation justifies any such impression, that we are worse off to-day than in 1934.  The year 1934 was the worst point in a general world economic depression. During the period of our struggle with Britain to maintain our rights in regard to the land annuities, to retain for ourselves what we believed was our own, it was the custom for those who were trying to break the Government on that issue, to pretend that all the losses on agriculture were due to the economic war, and to nothing else. That was quite untrue.  Already from 1929 and an earlier period there was a fall in agricultural prices.</P>
    <P>Already, long before the Government came into office, it was quite clear that the dairying industry was going to be doomed, unless the State, as a whole, came to its assistance.  The fall in prices was even more steep during some of the years before we came into office than it was actually in the year we came into office.  It was steep, and the index of agricultural prices in Britain showed quite clearly that the bottom of that depression was not reached until 1934.</P>
    <P>It is true that British tariffs were imposed against us with the object of breaking the Government, and thereby compelling the Irish people to pay £5,000,000 a year which were not due. We were certain that at least £3,000,000 were not due, and the other part was open to dispute.  These tariffs did add to the depression here, and did put upon our farmers extra burdens over and above those which they would have to bear owing to the depression, but <Col N="2109" /> it was the depression more than the additional tariffs that caused the trouble, and our agricultural industry would be in a desperate plight in any case.  Deputy Gorey smiles, but it is well known that the failure of the Government of the day to come to its assistance was one of the reasons why that Government was turned out of office.</P>
    <P>The dairying industry was trying to carry on with a price for butter which did not cover cost of production.  It is well known that it did not cover the cost of production, and when people talk of an unlimited market, I should like to remind them that an unlimited market is not much good if you are not able to produce for that market at a profit, and if you do not get back at least the cost of production.  When people talk about unlimited external markets, they should remember that, at the present time, although we have an open market in Britain for butter, that market would not be sufficient if we did not help it from the general State resources.  I think 120/- roughly is what producers get in the open market for butter.  They get 135/- from us. They would only get 120/-, and would have to pay all the cost of transport and marketing in the open market, but they get 135/- in order that it might be profitable for them to produce butter. When talking about these external markets, please remember that, if these are to be of any value, you must arrange to produce so as to get a profit or, at least, to cover costs.  If you are not able to do that, these markets are no good.  It is not the proper thing to arrange our economy so as always to try to keep external markets.  They may fail at any time.  Anything may change the position from a profitable market to an unprofitable one.</P>

      <P>What is the good of subsidised markets?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy wants to say that external markets are not the &ldquo;be-all and end-all&rdquo; of our existence, if that is what he means, then he is coming very much nearer to our point of view than I thought.  We have approached this whole question of <Col N="2110" /> national economy from a very simple standpoint.  We are anxious to produce for our own people the things which are necessary for life here.  That is the primary purpose we have in mind.  In any scheme we have, we must always relate it back to that.  Is it a scheme best fitted to give to our people the material necessities of life, and to provide other amenities which are necessary for decent living?  Do not think of this question as if the &ldquo;be-all and end-all&rdquo; of our existence was to supply goods to foreign markets.  Only in so far as that can be shown to serve the well-being of our people, is it a thing to be aimed at.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Belton has remarked, if you have to go on and subsidise everything the question is, why would you do it?  You would only do it for one reason, and that is to enable you to buy the things which you could not yourself produce and, if you could yourself produce them, then you would not have to resort to expedients, because you would not have to buy them elsewhere&mdash;you would not have to turn to expedients such as that of subsidising. We have to sell if we are going to buy. The more we have to buy, the more we have to sell, even if we subsidise and, therefore, not merely are we in a more independent position if we produce as much as possible of the things that we require&mdash;not merely are we in a more independent position here in that regard, in times of crisis, but we are also saved from any casual changes there may be in external markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot produce reasonably here everything we want, but we can produce a lot that we are not trying to produce or that we have not tried to produce.  Before we came into office we were not producing as much as we are producing now and, so far as I can see, there is not likely to be any change in the fundamental policy of this Government in that regard.  The fundamental policy of the Government is to produce here from our resources, by our own labour, as much of the things we require as possible. We will not be able reasonably, without a great deal of economic loss, to produce some things, but the things <Col N="2111" /> we have tried to produce and are producing, we hold that it is in the national interest that they should be produced.  When I say in the national interest, I mean in the interest of the general welfare and security of our people and their ultimate prosperity.</P>
    <P>During our period of office we have proceeded along these lines.  We have produced things which were not produced before we came into office and, in the production of them, we have directly employed tens of thousands of people who would not otherwise be employed.  That is my view.  So far as I can see, the tendency of the policy which is advocated by the Deputies on the opposite side is to go exclusively into production for an external market, keeping that all the time in mind.</P>
    <P>If we do that we will find ourselves many a time in straits, and I see no chance whatever of building up this nation or changing the situation to which we were reduced by a century or so of that particular practice.  That is what happened this country.  It was turned into an exporting country, exporting agricultural produce, and it was deprived of all its industries. Under that policy our population went down.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We are pursuing the policy of producing the things which we can produce and, with further development, we can produce them as cheaply as they are produced elsewhere. In all probability we should be able to do so.  With proper, efficient management, as I think we are going to get, and with proper workmanship, we are going to produce these things and should produce them, a number of them anyhow, as cheaply as they can be imported from outside, provided they are imported without subsidy from outside and that they are not dumped in here.  There has been an <Col N="2113" /> increase in our industrial output.  As we have pointed out, time after time, there have been 800 factories and workshops established here and the production from these is national wealth.</P>
      <P>The capital that is in these factories and workshops is very much more valuable for the nation than capital abroad, and if there has been any diminution of our external assets to give us that capital equipment and fit us for that production, it is a good change.  I wish we had more of it and I, for one, would face very willingly a reduction of our external assets if I saw them replaced by productive plant here at home.</P>
      <P>To the extent to which that productive plant was increased, to that extent we would be independent of external buying and to that extent we would want neither our exports nor such an amount of external assets. As somebody pointed out, these external assets, once they are external, are no longer completely under our control. Their value can be changed by conditions over which we have no control, by policies over which we have no control, and if people point out to us that there has been a diminution in our external assets, and I can show there is an equivalent increase in our productive plant at home, then I, for one, would not be disappointed with the change, and I do not think that anybody else need be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2114" /> I have seen the Banking Commission Report.  I have gone through most of it and, having gone through it, and seen the things that are in it, and the danger signals that are pointed out, I, for one, would not change a tittle of the fundamental programme which we put before the people as our industrial programme when we got into office.  I believe that that old policy, which we have been fortunate enough to be the people to put into practice, the policy of Sinn Fein, is fundamentally sound and there is nothing in this report that shows anything to the contrary</P>
    <P>Of course, there are no people who are completely satisfied with their condition. There is no country in the world at the present time in which there are not evils.  There is no country in which there will not be evils which it will be desirable to remedy.  No matter how long this world lasts, in my opinion, there will be debates exactly like this debate.  The subject matter may be different, but there will be debates as long as you have parliaments of this sort.  There will be debates as to what is the best way to get rid of these evils and improve the general welfare, because that is what parliaments are for.  I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned accordingly.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 10.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 7th July.</P>
