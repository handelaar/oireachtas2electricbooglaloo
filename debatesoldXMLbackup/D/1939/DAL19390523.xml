      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle (for Mrs. Redmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware of the economic distress among retired nurses caused by the non-existence of a pension scheme; and, if so, if he will consider introducing legislation at the earliest opportunity to provide a scheme for pensions which will be acceptable to the various nursing organisations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the negative.  As regards the second part, the data at present available on which such a scheme could be based is inadequate and there is nothing at present to add to the Minister's statement on this matter contained in the Debates of the 31st March last, columns 586 and 587.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>The nursing organisations primarily interested have already been asked to supply certain detailed information regarding the number of nurses to whom such a scheme might apply, the different circumstances of employment, and so on, in order that material might be made available for an actuarial investigation.  A sum of £100 was placed at their disposal for that purpose.  They have, in fact, failed to get replies from 3,000 odd out of a total of 10,000 nurses so that, in these circumstances, there is not much more the Minister can do.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will state the total quantity and value of sugar imported, and the amount of Customs duty paid thereon, during the 12 months ended (a) the 31st March, 1938, and (b) the 31st March, 1939.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The total quantity of sugar imported in the 12 months ended 31st March, 1938, was 441,654 cwts., c.i.f., value £185,418, and in the 12 months ended 31st March, 1939, was 1,114,313 cwts., c.i.f., value £439,260.  It is not possible to state the total amount of Customs duty paid on sugar imported in a particular financial year, because on part of the sugar which was warehoused, duty may not have been levied in that financial year.  The imported sugar charged with duty during one financial year does not include some sugar warehoused in that year, and includes some sugar warehoused in a previous year.  The net receipts of duty from imported sugar retained for home consumption in the 12 months ended 31st March, 1938, were £300,256 11s. 6d., <Col N="4" /> and in the 12 months ended 31st March, 1939, were £882,786 9s. 10d., the corresponding net quantities being 397,220 cwts. and 1,110,753 cwts. respectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that boot factories are finding it exceedingly difficult to secure regular orders from their customers owing to the belief that quotas and import restrictions will soon be removed as per the London Agreement; also, that travellers representing English houses are suggesting the possibility of more favourable conditions in the near future; and, if so, if he can reassure the trade in this matter by making a general statement on the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle (for Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that national teachers who were pensioned on the 1917 scale are in receipt of pensions of so small an amount that they cannot live thereon; and whether he is prepared to increase the pensions payable to these persons, who do not comprise a large class, and to whom a reasonable increase could be made with a negligible charge on the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Provision has already been made in the Pensions (Increase) Act, 1920, and in Section 6 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1923, as amended by the Superannuation and Pensions (Amendment) Act, 1925, for the increase of pensions granted prior to the 16th August, 1920, provided that the pensioner's total means do not exceed £150 a year if unmarried, and £200 a year, if married. These provisions apply to the national teachers referred to by the Deputy, and I regret that I cannot consider a proposal for any further increase of pensions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Thomas T. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware of the huge number of cattle which have died in County Clare for the past six months as a result of the disease known as fluke; that this disease has caused great economic distress <Col N="7" /> throughout the county; and, if so, whether he will consider giving financial assistance or some other compensation to owners of cattle which died.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan) James Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that losses of cattle from liver fluke in County Clare last season were somewhat greater than in an average season.  The losses were accentuated by the severe weather last autumn and winter.</P>
      <P>In response to requests recently received I am having further inquiries made with a view to ascertaining more precisely the extent of the losses involved.  I must await the result of these inquiries before I will be in a position to make any statement in regard to the second and third parts of the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>In this connection I should perhaps say that in consequence of the heavy rains in the late summer and early autumn of last year the Department's local officers were specially directed in October last to impress upon farmers the need for taking precautionary measures against fluke as recommended in the Department's leaflet on &ldquo;Fluke or Liver Rot,&rdquo; of which large supplies were distributed, but many farmers, I regret, neglected to take these precautions or to avail themselves of the veterinary dispensary scheme in that county for the treatment of their cattle.</P>

      <P>Can I ask the Minister, in connection with sub-section (3) of this section, whether that sub-section is necessary, or whether the Local Appointments Commissioners could not operate in this way on request, if so desired?  Take the case of a local authority which requires certain officials.  It is bound to apply to the Local Appointments Commission for them.  Here is a case in which you set up a board and, presumably, give very considerable fees to the members of that board.  At the same time, we are allowing them a privilege which is not granted to a local authority.  Can the Minister tell the House what is the reason for making an exception in this case as against a local authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Because this is not a local authority.  This is a business undertaking which has got to be run upon the same general lines as any other business undertaking.  Precisely the same consideration has influenced the form of this section as determined the insertion of a similar section in the <Col N="18" /> Act establishing the Electricity Supply Board.  Precisely the same section was inserted in the measure setting up the Electricity Supply Board.  This section gives to the board the same right which the Electricity Supply Board have to fill their posts through the machinery of the Local Appointments Commission if they choose to do so but it does not impose upon them a statutory obligation to do so.  There may be certain types of staff which could be more suitably chosen by the machinery of the Local Appointments Commission, but there are other types of staff in which the judgement of the board as regards individual personality would be of importance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It might have been a good thing if this had been provided for in the early stages of the E.S.B. That was a manufacturing business. This is not.  There is a difference.  This may be a useful institution or it may be one of the Government's mistakes, of which there are many.  In so far as its usefulness is concerned, it is quite possible that, from a Selection Board, you will get as suitable a person as would be chosen by the Minister or by this board.  Presumably, the Minister has in mind the appointment of some member of the board. Is that person, whoever he is, experienced in business?  Does the Minister think that his experience, in whatever business he is engaged in, qualifies him for this particular task?  It appears to me strange that the Government should provide for appointment in this way since the Government itself is limited in the selection of its officials by an Act of Parliament.  It has to get them through a particular channel.  This, I presume, will be an expert institution.  The board will have to do expert work.  It is quite possible that those already engaged in the tourist industry would make as good a selection, as a board, as any other body but the House is concerned with the fact that it is committed to an expenditure of practically £20,000 each year.  It may be less but, presumably, there is nothing to prevent its being more except a Vote.  I should like to know whether, after 12 <Col N="19" /> years, we cannot improve upon the phraseology embodied in a Bill passed in this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of improving the phraseology.  Certain principles must apply in matters of this kind.  When you set up a board to run a business undertaking&mdash; whether it is a manufacturing undertaking or has to do with tourist development matters little&mdash;it seems to me that you must give to that board the same authority over its staff and the same power in relation to its staff that a business concern would have. When it is a matter of appointing subordinate staff, this board of the E.S.B. might find it convenient to avail of the machinery of the Local Appointments Commission.  If they wish to do so, they are empowered to do so but, in relation to the more important members of the staff, I think the experience of the E.S.B. has been that it is in a better position to select these officers than any other authority would be.  It helps the discipline and efficiency of the organisation to have these appointments made by the board and I think the same thing will be found in the case of the Tourist Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a difference between this board and the Electricity Supply Board.  The Electricity Supply Board was set up as a semi-public body and it paid back any money it got from the State.  This body which we propose now to set up is financed under Section 15 and under Section 16 out of funds supplied by the State.  It must be agreed that it would not be desirable to withdraw from the executive officers of this body&mdash;the tourist development board&mdash;the right to dismiss officials who were not equal to the tasks imposed upon them.  But we are quite entitled, without unduly restricting the discretion of the executive, to require them to employ their staff in accordance with certain procedure. There is no use in putting your cap or coat upon it.  The important thing here is that the tourist development board should not be made a refuge of jobbery.  The moment this <Col N="20" /> board is constituted, every camp follower of the Fianna Fáil Party will be clamouring for employment under it. The Minister himself knows that he himself will be besieged by applicants for jobs under this board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be wasting their time.  I shall have nothing to do with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That statement will be taken for what it is worth.  Whether or not the Minister has anything to do with the board, under the law, he knows that he will be approached by thousands of people to use his influence with the board to get them jobs. Every member of the Fianna Fáil Party will be similarly approached to get them jobs under this board.  There is no use in anybody closing his eyes to that fact because it is common knowledge to us all that every public man is besieged by people looking for jobs.  It is natural that the Government Deputies, and Minister particularly, should be more besieged than any other Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same was true of local authorities. When a position fell vacant, hundreds of obviously inelligible persons clamoured for the vacancy and pressed personal considerations why they should get it.  There were widows, indigent persons, persons who had done good service in the past and people with a hundred excellent personal arguments to advance to show why their claims to the position should be preferred to that of anybody else. It was very often necessary, in the best interests of the local authority&mdash;and will often be necessary in the best interests of the tourist development board&mdash;to take somebody who had no claim <i>ad misericordiam</i> at all&mdash;to get a highly efficient person who was possibly in a very good job.  That is the kind of person the board might be under a duty to appoint.  There would be a dozen applicants who would have a strong case in compassion to get the appointment.  The only way in which this board can be protected from irresistible pressure is to take these appointments completely out of their hands and put them in the hands of <Col N="21" /> either the Local Appointments Commission or the Civil Service Commissioners.</P>
    <P>That is common knowledge to us all. Fianna Fáil have their own experience.  When they came into office, six years ago, they said they were going to restore to the local authorities their autonomy by requiring the Appointments Commissioners to send down three names instead of one.  That reform lasted for exactly three months because they discovered that giving back the discretion to the local authorities to choose between three persons for one job gave rise to all the old, poisonous abuses that the Appointments Commissioners abolished. Everybody who has any knowledge of the working of local authorities in rural Ireland at the present time admits that one of the most valuable reforms that was introduced into this State was the institution of the Appointments Commissioners.  Everyone in this House is aware that in certain semi-public institutions that have been established without the intervention of the Appointments Commissioners very grave dissatisfaction has existed as a result of appointments which did not appear to be made exclusively on the merits, appointments which it was felt were affected by political influence.  Here is an opportunity to lift off the shoulders of the members of this board the loathsome task of filling jobs which will have to be filled under the board.</P>
    <P>If the Appointments Commissioners should put forward a person who is wholly unsuitable&mdash;and that is an unlikely contingency&mdash;there is no suggestion that the discretion of the board should be limited in disposing of that individual and dismissing him, for reasons stated, if he was wholly incompetent to do his job.  No such case that I am aware of has arisen in connection with the Local Appointments Commissioners or the Civil Service Commissioners since they were instituted 14 years ago.  Why should we apprehend that such cases will now arise?  If we extend the functions of the Appointments Commissioners <Col N="22" /> to this board, there is not the least use in saying to this board that, where they think it desirable, they may refer the case to the Appointments Commissioners, because that does not protect them in the least degree from external pressure. I know, because if the local authorities have certain minor appointments which they may send to the Appointments Commissioners or which they may fill themselves, canvassing is merely subdivided into two stages.  At first there is a general barrage from all sides not to send the appointment to the Appointments Commissioners.  They all say, &ldquo;Bring it into the arena and then we can all go down into the arena and, in blood and dust, battle for our respective candidates.&rdquo;  Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Republican and everybody else link arms to bring pressure to bear on the local authorities not to send it to the Appointments Commissioners.  Once united, they will achieve that objective and get the appointment restored to the arena of the local authority.  Then they divide up into their various warring factions to bring influence to bear on the individual members of the Body to vote for their own particular candidate and you are back in just as rotten a situation as you were before the Appointments Commissioners were ever appointed.</P>
    <P>Any member of the Fianna Fáil Party who is on a local authority will tell the Minister that you are asking this board to do an impossible thing if you ask them to send these appointments to the Appointments Commissioners if they are not compelled to do so.  I have not the slightest doubt that no matter who the Minister nominates on the board they will be grateful to him if they are placed under statutory obligation to send all the appointments to the Appointments Commissioners. I am convinced that, unless he wants this board to be turned into a sink of patronage, he ought to impose a statutory obligation on the members of the board to refer all the minor appointments to the Local Appointments Commissioners or the Civil Service Commissioners, whichever he likes.  I have not the slightest doubt that, far from <Col N="23" /> resenting this limitation of their discretion, they will be most grateful to this House for protecting them from the usual kind of canvassing which it is the miserable fate of a member of a public body in the country at the present time to suffer whenever small appointments have to be made.  Would the Minister consider an amendment on the Report Stage?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  This is not a local authority.  This is a business concern. There will be no political division on this board.  Anyone who knows the first thing about the functions of the Local Appointments Commissioners or the running of a business concern would never make the suggestion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a non-controversial matter.  Let us assume that all members of the board are supporters of the Labour Party, apart from their membership of the board, and that it is known that Deputy Norton regards them as influential supporters of his, that he is in the habit of befriending them and having constant contact with them.  Deputy Norton's supporters from Skerries will come to Deputy Norton and say, &ldquo;You know the chairman of the board.  He is a member of the Clontarf branch.  Would you be good enough to go to that man and say to him that he ought to appoint John Dolan as medical inspector for Northeast Kerry?&rdquo;  To which Deputy Norton replies, &ldquo;Certainly not.  I will have nothing to do with it.  That appointment will be made on its merits.  I never interfere in public appointments.&rdquo; To which the Secretary of the Labour Party in Skerries will say, &ldquo;Very well; when you want somebody to sit in the polling booth in Skerries at the next general election you can look elsewhere.  I have been labouring for 40 years for the Labour Party in North Dublin and the first favour I ever asked is refused.&rdquo;  That goes on and on and on.  Thousands of similar appeals must have reached the Minister in his day.  If the member of the board happens to be a friend and supporter of the Minister every Deputy of the Minister's Party living in the <Col N="24" /> constituency where an influential person wants influence to be brought will come to the Minister and say, &ldquo;It is all very well for you to be doing the `purist,' but this fellow commands 250 votes.  If I cannot get this fellow's support on general election day I will not be able to get a single personating agent in that area.  They are all Blue Shirts there.  All I want you to do is to write a letter.&rdquo;  The Minister must refuse loftily, stating that he never interferes in public appointments, which his own Deputies know is nonsense.  The Minister has to say, &ldquo;I do not care a fiddle-de-dee what happens to your constituents.  I will not use my influence on behalf of your constituent's application.&rdquo;  The Minister knows he cannot do that, that he will have to write a letter.  If, on the other hand, the Minister can produce the Act of Parliament and say, &ldquo;What can I do, the board has nothing to do with the appointment; it is going to the Appointments Commissioners, the members of which I do not know and will not know because they will not be appointed until the morning the appointment is made.&rdquo; Surely that would be a better position for everyone.  It ought not to be necessary to go into all that.  The Minister makes it necessary by pretending to deny it exists.  There is no suggestion here that once the person is appointed the Tourist Board cannot dismiss him.</P>

      <P>I say that, conceivably, this board, like the Electricity Supply Board, could say: &ldquo;We want a certain grade of clerical officer.  We know we want, on an average, ten or 12 a year&rdquo;&mdash;this board would not be in that position, but the Electricity Supply Board would&mdash;and they can arrange for a competitive examination which would give them a list of applicants from which they could draw.  But, when it comes to appointing persons to carry out responsible duties, neither the Electricity Supply Board nor the Tourist Board would think of filling the vacancies by this machinery.  It would be most unsuitable and much too slow in operation.  Apart from that, it is essential, if you are going to get efficiency, that the authority of the board over the staff should be unquestioned, that they should be able to dismiss a man to-day if he is unsuitable for his work and appoint another man in his place the next day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the work must go on.  If it were given to the Local Appointments Commissioners it might take three or four months to get a substitute. That system would not work. We have heard a lot about Deputies being asked to influence appointments. Of course, they will be asked.  Deputies are asked to influence appointments under the Hospitals Trust, the railways, and in a thousand and one privately owned concerns with which the Government has nothing to do.  I am sure I get at least a dozen letters a day asking me to try to get employment for people in the Hospitals Trust.  You have many more people writing asking you to try and get them employment on the railways and in similar organisations.  Does that influence the efficiency of those concerns? Not in the least.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that nobody must limit the discretion of the board to dismiss their employees and to control their staff.  Nobody wants to.  Let their discretion to control the <Col N="26" /> staff that has been appointed be as absolute as you care to make it in order to get efficiency, but it is idle to pretend that in any business which is efficiently run, the dismissal of one officer, no matter who that officer may be, could or should disrupt the whole working of a business enterprise.  If such a situation ever arose then the business enterprise is not being properly run. If the whole efficiency of the organisation has to depend on the permanency of one individual, then it is clear that the business should not be so organised.</P>
      <P>The objection that the Minister takes to delay is really not one of substance. Anybody who has had experience knows what actually happens.  After all, county administration is just as grave a matter as the administration of the Tourist Development Board.  Suppose a county engineer drops dead, or is dismissed, on a Monday morning, you have the position that the whole of the public services in that county are directed by that one man.  What happens?  You appoint one of the assistant engineers to act as county engineer while the filling of the office is being passed over to the Appointments Commissioners and they appoint a substitute.  The filling of the office may take a month or three months.  It may even take nine months to get the right man.  The first man chosen may, in fact, not take the job at all, so that the work of filling the office has to be gone all over again.  The work of the county goes on under the direction of the temporary officer.  When the permanent officer is appointed he takes over, and the work goes on as before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here, doubtless, a situation might arise in which a member of your staff is dismissed and where it may take a couple of months to replace him.  How does the Minister think you are going to get a suitable candidate for a responsible office without a couple of months' enquiry.  You are not going to pick responsible men off gooseberry bushes.  The whole danger is that someone will be brought along and that pressure will be brought to bear on the board to appoint someone who will be said to have a national record: <Col N="27" /> one who will fit very nicely into a job if there is very little work to be done and a large salary attached thereto. The job will be made for him, and irresistible pressure will be brought to bear on the board to make the appointment.  Suppose a vacancy turns up, and there is no candidate in view, could the Minister himself&mdash;I am sure he looks upon himself as a paragon of efficiency&mdash;undertake to fill any responsible position in his Department without a couple of months' enquiry into a person's credentials and records, a person who very probably, if he is a suitable candidate, will also be in remunerative employment.  If not, it is highly likely that he will not be a suitable candidate.  The best men already have good jobs, and you will have to seek out a good man to fill a good job.  You will not get him in three or four days.</P>
    <P>There is always some measure of delay in getting a really high class man to fill a highly responsible job. My experience of dealing with the Local Appointments Commissioners is that there is never any undue delay. On every occasion on which a very long delay appeared to arise it was due to the fact that a candidate who applied for the job and was recommended for it by the Local Appointments Commissioners refused to take it up, whereupon it had to be referred back a second time to the Appointments Commissioners.  In cases where candidates recommended for appointment by the Appointments Commissioners have taken up the positions, there has never been, in my opinion, any unreasonable delay on the part of the Appointments Commissioners. That system has undoubtedly been an unqualified blessing to those responsible for the appointment of persons in the public or semi-public service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not attempted to show why, because this is not a local authority, which does responsible work, or a central authority like the Civil Service, but is a commercial undertaking, that, therefore, the recruitment of staff ought not to start through the Local <Col N="28" /> Appointments Commissioners.  The Minister says that the system of the Appointments Commissioners is unsuitable. If he will cast his mind back on the grounds he gave for unsuitability, then I suggest they are grounds for the abolition of that method of recruiting staff for anybody.  The Minister says the Appointments Commissioners are not a suitable body to appoint people because the job to be filled is a responsible position.  But, surely, you cannot get more responsible positions than some of the high positions which have to be filled under a county council.  The only other reason the Minister gave, beyond repeating that it was a commercial enterprise and that, therefore, this particular method of recruitment was unsuitable, was the want of control over the staffs.  Has anybody ever suggested that the system of the Civil Service Commissioners and their functions has given the Government less control over the Civil Service, or that the use of the Local Appointments Commissioners has given the local authorities less control over their staffs?  I think the Minister might indicate why it is that he thinks this method is unsuitable.  As to the point dealt with by Deputy Dillon, the Minister relies on the alleged delay. Unless the Minister can show much stronger grounds than the mere repetition of the fact that this is a commercial body: that there is a difference between the character of this body and a county council, then I submit that he has said nothing to justify a different method of recruitment of staff.  That is so, unless he goes on the other line: that for responsible positions the method of recruitment through the Local Appointments Commissioners is unsound, and would interfere with the authority which the board would have over its servants. But with regard to the other position, he has given no ground to show that the difference he alleges exists between the functions of this body and the functions, say, of the local authority justifies a different method of recruitment of staff.</P>

      <P>We may take it <Col N="29" /> that sub-section (3) is just eye-wash. What the Minister thinks about it is shown by what he has said.  What leaves me completely blank with regard to an understanding of the section here is that the Minister tells us he wants £25,000 a year for the administrative expenses of this board; he told us he was going to have a board of five, or that it is not exceeding five; that is all he will tell us about the board.  He asks the House under this section to give power to the board to appoint so many officers and servants as it shall from time to time think proper.  The Minister tells us he wants a board; he wants £25,000 to spend on the administrative expenses of the board and its officers. Surely the House ought to be assisted by the Minister in getting some kind of picture as to what type of staff is required.  He made no attempt to explain the type of headquarter staff that will be required, or the type of staff that will be required on inspectorial of other work.  As far as the Bill is concerned, the £25,000 may be spent on any kind of officer from the secretary in charge of the headquarters institution to a charwoman down in one of the hotels which the new board may or may not build.  I think it is absurd that the Minister should simply say that he wants £25,000, that he wants a board, and that he wants that board to have all the officers it requires.  We ought to have some kind of idea as to the type of organisation that will exist under the board, so that we can have some reasonable chance of seeing what type of organisation is going to cost us £25,000 a year.</P>

      <P>If the board wanted to avail of the Local Appointments Commissioners, there is no reason why they should not.  I was struck by the fact that the Electricity Supply Board, in whose Act a precisely similar section appears, have never availed of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the board itself, as it was a matter for the Electricity Supply Board.  When you set up an organisation of this kind to carry out certain business operations, you put on the board the obligation of getting that done.  You give them power to recruit staff to do it, and you give them full authority over that staff.  They must have in relation to that staff precisely the same powers of control and discipline as the board of a privately-owned business house.  You cannot run an undertaking of this kind on any other basis.  I certainly do not propose to try it.  It would be a completely foolish thing to do, and would make it impossible for this board to function efficiently.  The responsibility is on the members of the board.  If they have not got in relation to the staff the authority which a business man would expect to have over his staff, they cannot carry out that responsibility efficiently.  Therefore, I think we must put them in precisely the same position as the board of a privately-owned company, subject only to the provisions of this Act which make them removable by the Minister if they themselves fail in their duty, and make them liable to submit certain reports, to submit accounts for audit, and so forth.  Within those limitations, I gave them a free hand to do the job.</P>

A reading of the Bill shows that this board may build, equip, establish and operate hotels; it may provide services, sports, amusements, or other facilities; it may improve and maintain amenities; it may engage in any kind of publicity; it may establish tourist agencies; it may provide schemes for training people; it may prepare guide-books, itineraries and other publications; it may take over land, fishery rights, sporting rights, and all other kinds of rights.

      <P>No.  If I were the person chosen to be the executive officer of this board, I have a general idea of the type of organisation which I think would be best.  I am sure, if Deputy Mulcahy would imagine himself in that position, he also could quite easily determine for himself the outlines of the organisation he would require.  But of what value is it to the House that I should give my opinion or that he should give his?  The board may say: &ldquo;We have a different idea altogether.  We have been given the responsibility, and we are going to set up the type of organisation which we think best.&rdquo;  What the type of organisation is going to be I do not know, because the board has not yet been appointed.</P>

It says that the board may exercise any of the powers and perform any of the functions conferred and imposed on the board by this Act through or by any of its officers or servants authorised by the board in that behalf.  I should like to know what the Minister means by that&mdash; that they can delegate any of their duties, if in their opinion it is prudent to do so, to the officers of the board?</P>

We will have later on some discussions upon the question of appeals from decisions <Col N="34" /> of the board.  While I do not see my way at present to accept any of the amendments that have been proposed, I think, having regard to them, we may find it desirable to amend this section so as to make it clear that a decision upon, say, an application for registration, will be a decision of the board and not a decision of an officer of the board; so that there will be, in fact, an appeal from an inspector or whoever has a particular job under the board to the board as a whole.  I am prepared to consider amending that section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>As the section stands, it can.  When I am prepared to take out of that section the power of the board to delegate to its officers the final decision on questions of registration or other similar matters which may arise under the Bill, an appeal would lie to the board also on the questions of grading of hotels and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I ask the Minister to consider this question is that it seems to me that, unless he is prepared to go further in the matter, the tendency will be to let the civil servants of the board&mdash;who are chosen in the competent manner we have heard discussed&mdash;run the whole thing; and the board would fade away, leaving simply the civil servants, not the business men who are on the board, really running the whole thing. I am not putting this in a controversial manner, but I want the Minister to consider the particular danger that unless he goes further than he proposes he will be making the board a mere court of appeal.</P>

      <P>Certainly none of the members of Deputy Cosgrave's Government agreed with Deputy Costello when he was Attorney-General. It has been done in the past, and is done now, that a Minister delegates to particular officers of his Department powers to carry out certain functions which are by statute conferred upon him.  The board can do precisely the same thing, that is to say, authorise the secretary to purchase land or sign a lease or do some other work of that kind for it, with its authority, in a manner which would be binding upon the board.  I am prepared, however, to amend this section to make it clear that those decisions which affect private interests must be decisions of the board and may not be decisions of the officers of the board.  That, I hope, will go some way to meet the representations that have been made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>A lot will depend on the character of the amendment. I can assure the Minister that his predecessors when in office went personally into all these things that they were required by statute to do. I remember myself delegating authority, and yet, as a matter of fact, I had to hear a case and come to a <Col N="36" /> decision formally.  But there may have been changes since then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is quite clear that the Minister has not really considered the scope of this section as it stands at the moment.  The members of the board can irrevocably delegate all their functions to one particular officer and there is no provision by which such power may be&mdash;if I might use the word&mdash;undelegated.</P>

      <P>Before Section 13 to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  The board shall not enter into any contract, provided for under Part II of this Act, with any company or concern in which a member of the board has any interest.</P>

      <P>I have drafted a new section in order absolutely to protect the dealings of this board with any body or any corporation or company that might have an interest in it or be interested through a member of the board.

      <P>I do not know where the power is going to come from for that.  Here was a case where an obvious slip was pointed out to the Minister.  Instead of receiving it in the normal way, he regards it almost as an insult and refuses to consider it. This is very harmful from the Parliamentary point of view.  An amendment has been put down by Deputy McMenamin. He has pointed out the objection to the present section that supposing a man is a member of the board and is engaged in some occupation&mdash;building, painting, or anything of that kind&mdash;and there is a question of a contract to be placed, this member apparently cannot give his advice to the board.  He cannot join in the deliberations even if he has more expert knowledge than other members of the board.  However, so far as the point raised by Deputy Costello is concerned, whether it was or was not in previous Acts, I have still to learn that the absence of sanctions from any previous measure makes a case for the absence of sanctions here.  After all, that is what we are discussing; not any previous Act, but the present Act.  If the Minister produced one Act or ten Acts, the Electricity Supply Act, or any other Act, it is irrelevant so far as interpreting the meaning of this particular section is concerned.  It might be quite good for the kind of controversy the Minister goes on with, but for interpreting or helping legislation it is a waste of time.</P>

My controversial spirit was aroused by Deputy Costello's description of the section as absurd and ridiculous.  I think these are the words he used.  I merely retorted by saying that he himself was responsible for Acts containing a precisely similar section.  He asked me to produce one and I produced the Electricity Supply Act.  Section 10 of the Electricity Supply Act is word for word what is here.</P>

It cannot give that money by way of grant.  It can in effect make a grant only in accordance with the provisions of sub-section (3), which means that it makes an investment; but the collection of interest on the investment may be waived, or the repayment of the amount advanced may be <Col N="44" /> postponed, with the consent of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

If I understood Deputy Benson's intervention, he wants to confine the operations of the board in this particular matter to loans which would be paid back and would pay a reasonable amount of interest. He failed for the moment.  What is the justification in individual cases for the Minister and the board combined giving a grant?  I gathered from the Minister's exposition that the Minister and the board combined can make a grant. It amounts to that.  What is the justification for that as distinct from helping by means of a loan&mdash;giving a grant to a private individual who may be in competition with other private individuals?</P>

In practice we could do it; it would be to say that the board will not do it without getting the prior consent of the Minister.

      <P>Take as an analogy the Trade Loans Guarantee cases where the money guaranteed is put into some privately-owned business concerns. That money is lent upon a certain agreement as to the amount of interest to be paid and the repayment of the loan by instalments.  But, time and again, in relation to individual cases it has been found necessary and desirable to postpone the repayments of the principal and waive the payment of the interest so that difficulties of an abnormal character can be got over.  That is not unusually done.  The power to do that exists.  It is quite possible that the board may make loans of a character similar to Guaranteed Trade Loans to companies operating hotels, and they should have power to do it if circumstances justify it.  We think it would be very undesirable that they should have no power whatever to let instalments of the principal remain outstanding for a period if there was difficulty in repaying it or otherwise dealing with difficulties that might arise.</P>

      <P>Section 16 appears to apply in relation to the Minister and the board.  It applies to loans between the Minister and the board.  What sub-section (3) of 16 provides is that the Minister may release the board from the liability of paying interest on a loan.  But that sub-section does not prevent the board from afterwards doing what the man in the Gospel did going out and throttling the man outside <Col N="47" /> to whom the money was lent.  That seems to me to be possible in the section as it stands.  The second point I want to raise is that in sub-section (2) of Section 16, provision is made that this money that is to be advanced to the board is to be invested only in loans or works of a profit-earning character.  Does that profit-earning character in the case of a loan mean a loan of a profit-earning character to the board or a loan to the hotel-keeper to expend in a work of a profit-earning character?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The board must give the money for works of a profit-earning character.  That is from the point of view of the gentleman who is operating the works.  In other words, if a swimming bath is set up the board are to give financial assistance to the person operating the swimming bath who is to make money by it?  Therefore it is a work of a profit-earning character to that man but not a work of a profit-earning character to the board.  Applying that to the loan, if that construction is correct, the work is the work of a profit-earning character to the owner of the swimming bath but not work of a profit-earning character to the board.</P>

      <P>The Deputy must not think of the board having a large sum of money which they received from the Minister for Finance.  In a proposal of this kind, a normal investment by the board or a loan for the purpose of some works, the board will have to come to the Minister for Finance and get sanction for that amount of money and when sanction is got that amount of money will be advanced to the board, just as the <Col N="48" /> Electricity Supply Board at present get advances from the Minister for Finance.  If the Electricity Supply Board want to carry out new works of any kind, they will come to the Minister for Finance with proposals for that work.  They will specify the amount of capital required.  Before that capital is provided finance will have to be satisfied that it is going to be a profit-earning investment, that it will bring profit which will enable it to meet the repayment of the principal and repayment of the interest on the capital.  Now the money advanced to the Tourist Board will be advanced in the same way.  The board will have to come with a particular proposal and show that the work proposed to be done is of a profit-earning character.  On that basis it will get the advance, but the total advances must not exceed £600,000.</P>

But what power has the board to waive the getting of the interest from the local authority?  It seems to me, as Deputy Costello pointed out, that all you have in Section 16 is power to waive to the advantage of the board.  But surely the board itself has no power to go to a local authority and say, &ldquo;We cannot give you a grant, but, with the consent of the Minister, we can do what is equivalent to giving you a grant, namely, with his consent, seeing the desirable nature of this work, we can waive payment of interest for any number of years, or the payment of the principal for any number of years.&rdquo; They cannot do that, but I gather from the Minister that it is his contention that they could do that.</P>

Those tourist agencies recommend this country to people, whatever town or country they may be in; they urge people to come here.  If the tourist board sets up an agency in competition with existing agencies, one of the obvious effects will be to put all the existing agencies' backs up and they will encourage people to go anywhere but to this country.  What exactly will be the useful purpose in setting up this agency, I do not know.  Most likely it will do very much more harm than good.</P>

      <P>The consideration which the Deputy has referred to will undoubtedly deter the board from exercising the power conferred in this paragraph, unless there was very good reason for it.  I really think we should give the board this power, even though they may not find it necessary to exercise it.  It might happen that the board will become dissatisfied with the existing agencies, the manner in which they are operating, and their general attitude towards this country and the development of its tourist trade.  In these circumstances they may find it necessary to undertake the establishment of a new agency.  I think the board should have the power, though I agree they would be ill-advised to use it unless there was clear need for it.  To delete the paragraph, as the Deputy suggests, would be to deprive them of the power to establish a new agency.  We can conceive circumstances in which it would be necessary for them to have that power.</P>

I think they should have power to undertake the establishment of an agency of that kind anywhere if the need for it was there.  I would not like to see them deprived of that power. Of course, it is desirable that they should work through existing agencies so long as these agencies are prepared to work for them.  I think that is likely to be the case for quite a long time to come, because their interests are the same.</P>

Time and again we examine into certain of their proposals and tell them that they are likely to be at a loss and, therefore, we could not agree to advance any capital.

      <P>In a general sort of way we will have to approve the proposals. Again, I will take the Electricity Supply Board as an analogy.  In the case of a particular proposal of the board you do not go further than to examine the estimates of revenue that are likely to come in, relate them to <Col N="53" /> the capital expenditure on the basis of a rough and ready system of calculation, and then determine whether or not the result will be profitable.  In this particular case the projects that we are likely to get from the board will be more varied in character and they will cover a much wider field than the proposals of the Electricity Supply Board, but at the same time the method of approach to these proposals will be much the same.</P>

      <P>As a member of the old Government, I must say that I have been touched in the last couple of months when I remember how near perfection we seemed to have reached in every walk of political life&mdash;in the protection of the State, in the prevention of treason and in the conduct of ordinary commercial undertakings. One might say the high mark was reached by us, beyond which one could not go further.  I accept all that.  I will now ask the Minister to consider the danger of giving power to a board which may only be exercised in exceptional circumstances.  If you give power to set up an agency, it is an invitation to do so, and I am only asking the Minister to consider the chances there are of difficulties arising, rather than advantages coming from that principle.  Would it not be better, if it was necessary to set up agencies, that the board would go to the Minister and ask him to pass an enabling Bill for that purpose, rather than, practically, inviting them to do so?  If you give power the tendency will be to use the power on the part of the board.  It is a matter of balancing up conveniences, and I suggest that the easier way would be to delete the section and, if it was found that we were not getting sufficient publicity in the United States, to see if an amending Act could be brought in giving that power.</P>

      <P>I am not clear what is meant by &ldquo;agency,&rdquo; and what Deputy O'Sullivan meant when he criticised this proposal.  After all, an agency might consist in having a single representative in, say, New York or San Francisco.  Surely it is not proposed to <Col N="54" /> limit the board's power so that they will not be permitted to send a representative to New York with a view to organising, by means of suitable contacts, interest in tours in Ireland.  Is it proposed to limit the power of such representatives?  Further, I can see that the word &ldquo;agency&rdquo; has so wide a meaning that any proposal to take the clause out of the section would nullify a great deal of the obvious work that will be before the board.</P>

Cook or through a subsidiary of Cook's to advertise Egypt in Great Britain.  We do not propose to do anything like that, and could not afford anything like that, but that type of development might be necessary in certain circumstances in certain countries, and we would like the board to have the power to do that if they felt that it would be an advantage to do so.  As to Deputy O'Sullivan's remarks about complacency on this Bill, I should remind him that the powers he referred to were not provided in the Electricity Supply Act of 1927.</P>

      <P>Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to the clause in the section which gives power to erect hotels.  There are obvious reasons why hotels should not be built generally.  While a strong case could be made that it might be essential to have that power, the danger is that the moment it is given it might be exercised.  For that reason I do not like power being given to erect hotels when people who are running hotels can be assisted under the Bill.  The board is authorised to erect, equip and run hotels, and if they did that they would have it in their power to destroy the vested interests and the livelihood of other people.  All through this Bill there is power of inspection and of grading of any hotel in the State.  The body with that power can define the general status of any hotel.  There is power to erect a hotel anywhere that the board thinks it necessary to do so. My objection to this section is strengthened by the example the Minister gave, as to places where it might be necessary to build hotels.  The example about the aerodrome did not convince me.  I understand the air base in Clare is only 12 miles from Ennis. Surely it is not suggested, in these days of fast transport and motor-cars that a distance of 12 miles from an aerodrome to a town where there is accommodation, and where there are people with vested interests, and with good hotels, is too far.  If the hotels there are not good enough they can be improved by money that is being provided under the Bill.  Surely no one suggests that the board would be justified in erecting new hotels in such places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be a dreadful thing if this House gave power to any board to do such a thing, because the money being <Col N="56" /> provided could be used to destroy the property and the means of livelihood of people who own hotels.  In addition, perhaps hotels would be erected that would only suit a particular class, the wealthy class, and that their tariff would not permit ordinary persons going into them.  The Minister claims that it is necessary for the board to have this power, but there was a sort of half promise that it would not be used.  On principle, I do not think that it should be given.  I do not think any case has been made for it.  This is a small State but we have very big ideas.  I hardly know of any place where such a necessity as regards hotels would arise in this State.  If the necessity exists there is plenty of initiative to provide hotels.  In putting in this section perhaps the Minister thought it wise to have power to ginger up people who would not toe the line.  Is there not sufficient gingering power in the Bill already, by means of grading certificates?  If hotel owners do not bring their hotels up to a fairly reasonable standard they would be graded accordingly and get no assistance.  If a man has valuable property there is the threat that it is in the power of the board to construct a hotel somewhere in the neighbourhood. If I were asked about that power, I would say that they would never do such a thing.  But they can do it, and that is the awkward thing. I do not see that we should hand over that man's money to a board which is given the power to put that man out of business with his own money.  That is what we are doing in law.  Are we right in doing so?  Can we guarantee that the power will never be exercised? The Minister may reply, &ldquo;Before they would do that, I would have them abolished,&rdquo; but the Minister himself might be abolished in the meantime.</P>

      <P>I do not like this provision.  The Minister may be convinced that it is necessary to have it, but, taking the Bill as a whole, I do not see that it is necessary.  All power with regard to the status of hotels is <Col N="57" /> to be in the hands of the board, and I think that is enough, without the threat of putting hoteliers out of business.  In principle, I am opposed to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with most of what Deputy McMenamin has said, though possibly from a slightly different angle.  I do see that there is a certain amount in what the Minister said on Second Reading, that it might be desirable to have a body which would build a hotel, not necessarily for profit, at places like Rhynanna and, particularly, as I understood that most of the flying there will be done by night.  The very close proximity of a hotel in these circumstances is, I think, desirable.  The point of view, however, from which I oppose this power of the board to build is that the one body should not have power to build and operate a hotel and, at the same time, the power given to them by the Bill to control every other hotel in the country.  Every hotel and guest house is to come under the power of the board.  They are to be inspected and graded, and yet that same body, according to the Bill, is to have power to build a hotel, not necessarily, admittedly, in competition with any of these hotels, but, at the same time, I do not think the two functions can go together.  They cannot be an inspectorial body and, at the same time, an operating body, and if the Minister is convinced that the power is necessary, some different body from this should operate any hotel which, in his view, is necessary, and not this board.  This board should confine itself entirely to inspecting and controlling hotels, and they should look at these hotels not as hotel keepers&mdash;and this will make them hotel keepers&mdash;but from the point of view of the tourist coming to the hotel, possibly late at night, and the facilities he will get.  That should be their attitude to every hotel when they come to inspect it and to grade it, but if they are in the business themselves, it is going to be made much more difficult for them to look at these hotels from that point of view.  If the Minister wants this <Col N="58" /> power, he should set up some other body and not give it to this board.</P>

      <P>On the point raised by Deputy McMenamin, I merely want to repeat what I said on the Second Reading stage, that it is not the intention that the board should enter into competition with private concerns, and I think the powers conferred under Section 16 will be sufficient to ensure that control will be exercised over the board in that matter, if it is necessary to do so. The term &ldquo;competition&rdquo; has, of course, different meanings in different circumstances.  A hotel in Donegal might be in competition with a hotel in Kerry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly so, but hotels in widely different parts of the country may be in competition for a particular type of trade, and when I say that it is not the intention of the board to enter into competition with private individuals, what I mean is that the board will, in no circumstances, undertake commercial activities which it can prompt private enterprise to undertake.  It will be the normal function of the board to interest itself in the development and expansion of hotels by means of loans and investments and not by building and operating hotels, but there are circumstances, which we can contemplate, in which the board might find it desirable, and even necessary, to proceed on its own.  I gave the example of Rhynanna.  It is only an example, and, as I made quite clear the other day, my words must not be taken as indicating that there is a definite intention already formed to construct a hotel there.  Such a hotel will not be necessary until passenger traffic by air across the Atlantic is developed, but if it is developed and Rhynanna becomes of the importance which we intend and hope, namely, a junction between various air services, it is there, at the airport, that hotel accommodation will be required.  Passengers waiting for a service, or staying <Col N="59" /> overnight after a journey, will want the accommodation at the airport, and not at Ennis.  They will not go to Ennis, and would prefer to continue their journey by plane to some other point.  That, however, was only an illustration.  Another which could be given would be the possibility of some locality being developed as a special kind of tourist resort.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Any place.  The plan of development might embody hotel accommodation which no private concern was willing to provide, and, in such circumstances, the board might have to do it.  There is another type of case which might arise, and it will probably be the type of case in respect of which the board will most frequently have to exercise the power to operate hotels, if it is to do so at all, that is, where it has advanced money on a debenture to a hotel.  Because of circumstances, it may have to take over the hotel and operate it, until they can dispose of it to somebody else, or decide what they are going to do with it.  It may frequently happen that the board in order to protect its own loans, may have to exercise whatever powers it may get under agreements with borrowers to supervise and actually undertake the management of a concern for a time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then, of course, there is another problem which is really a very big problem and one to which the board will have to give immediate consideration, that is, the provision of accommodation, other than hotel accommodation, for the poorer classes of holiday-makers, those who could not afford to pay the cost of any reasonably-sized hotel.  As Deputies are aware, the development of holiday camps, holiday resorts, for short-term working-class visitors, has proceeded in other countries.  If private enterprise will undertake that development here, well and good.  The board will assist and encourage them, but if there is no indication of a development by private enterprise on these lines, or if it finds <Col N="60" /> that it does not pay, the board will have to assist financially or, in certain circumstances, itself undertake the construction and operation of holiday camps of that kind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They will not, but they will be very close to institutions such as are referred to in this paragraph. I do not want to leave the House under any misapprehension with regard to this particular paragraph.  While I think it is desirable that the board should have the power to build and operate hotels, and while I think the possession of these powers will strengthen its general position in relation to private interests and make it easier for it to get its main job done, I would regard it as definitely contrary to the public interest that the board should unnecessarily engage in any business enterprise of this kind.  Their main function must be to stimulate private enterprise, and, if they do not succeed in stimulating private enterprise to provide better hotel and other holiday facilities which the country requires, then, they will have failed in their main job and we shall have to reconsider the position again, but the affording of that stimulus to private enterprise is their main function.  It will be only when all attempts to secure the development desired through private commercial enterprise fails that they would contemplate exercising the powers conferred by the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one particular type of enterprise to which the Minister did not refer.  I am sure Deputy Moore will agree with me that there are places much more tranquil than the North of Ireland, namely, certain portions of Kerry and Wicklow &mdash;Aughavannagh for instance.  It would be very desirable to attract a certain type of tourist to these places, precisely because of their quietness and isolation.  I do not know how far at the present moment if you rely upon private enterprise alone, there is any hope of development of hotels of that particular type.  You may say: <Col N="61" />&ldquo;If it will not pay commercially, what good is it?&rdquo;  It is good from several points of view, good advertising for the hotel industry as a whole and good for the country.  Tourists would come not only to that hotel but to the country, and they would benefit the country as a whole.  That particular type of a hotel may have to be run for a while at a loss.  That is the kind of enterprise on the part of the board in building hotels that would be desirable, much more so than the case of Rhynana because people have to be carried three or four miles to hotels at most ports.  I do not think the board would enter into any real competition with anybody in cases of that kind.  I wonder if the Minister has in mind the development of that particular type of hotel, whether he has in mind catering for every type of tourist, not merely those who are poor but also those who are rich?  After all, we are looking on this as a business and, therefore, it may be advisable to cater for that particular type of business which, if it be left to private enterprise, may not be catered for.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, let us take the case of a townland in which there are a number of hotels.  Let us say that it is not a port.  Take the case of Woodford.  I believe a predecessor of the Minister in the British Parliament on being asked a question concerning the erection of a pier at Woodford, said that the matter was receiving his full consideration and only then it was disclosed that Woodford was not a seaside place at all.  Let us take a place like that and say that there are no proper hotels there.  Even so, I take it for granted that in that particular case the board will rely on the other powers it has at its disposal to improve the place and, however inefficient these hotels are, I gather it is the purpose of the Minister that the board will not interfere in the way of building hotels, that in order to prevent what might be a public abuse in the way of undue competition with private enterprise, he is prepared to allow the situation to be dealt with by other means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was another point raised by Deputy Benson, namely, the grading of <Col N="62" /> the hotels by the board.  If they build hotels themselves they are bound to grade them in the very highest class, otherwise there would be no justification for their existence.  There is, however, the danger that whereas these hotels may be very good for a period after they are opened, they may deteriorate.  The board would then have an unfair advantage over other hotels and the system would throw doubt on the value of the grading of hotels.  You have the difficulty mentioned by Deputy Benson that in some cases the person summoned to appear before the court may also be a member of the court which is to deliver sentence. I think there is a point there that should deserve further consideration from the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That point will definitely have to be considered if, in the course of time, it is found that the board is going for any reason into the hotel business to any extensive degree. If that should arise, we shall have to consider the matter afresh, but I do not contemplate any development of that kind.  I remember when I was in Canada coming across one of these hotels built, not by the Government, but by a Government-owned railway in an area which they wished to develop. They built a very luxurious hotel and induced a number of millionaires to stay in the locality.  As a result, after some time, these millionaires began to build residences there and the area was very quickly developed.  The hotel never paid and was never intended to pay.  It was erected merely to induce development in that particular district. Of course, we have no such vast tracts in this country, but I mention the matter merely as an illustration of the circumstances which might justify the board in undertaking the building of hotels in certain areas.</P>

      <P>The Minister apparently thinks that it is better to leave the matter as it is until abuses develop.  I think it would be much wiser to remove the possibility of such abuses arising. The Minister mentioned that he anticipated that a number of hotels which would be operated by the board for <Col N="63" /> some time might be sold by the board to try to recoup themselves for money advanced on debentures.  I can see no power here which allows the board to sell them.</P>

The place might be going down through bad management and they might consider that under different management it would be a success.  For a period they would carry on the concern until they got a new purchaser, but that would not be a long period.  They should have power to do that in order to protect their interests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I want to point out that there is a certain danger there, and I think there are cases in which that matter might properly arise.  Roughly speaking, of this £45,000, £20,000 will go for the cost of administration, and therefore, anything that the board does comes before this House for discussion in any detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, take the case of the Turf Development Board.  That is in precisely the same position.  There is a provision in the annual Estimate for advances by that board.  Of course, we could discuss, and in a few cases we have discussed, some of the matters of that kind relating to that board, but, in practice, we have not done so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">

      <P>I think it might be better to have some other method of providing the money here, because once the matter is discussed here in the House a great deal of the utility of the board in such cases will be nullified or, at least, hampered.  If the board feels that anything it may do, as a business concern, or that its conduct generally, is liable, as it may be, to be the subject of detailed discussion, or even general discussion, in this House, the board will tend to behave as a Civil Service department and think less of developing as a business than of just carrying on.

      <P>This section provides for advances to the board out of the Central Fund and for the repayment of such sums, with interest, as provided by later provisions of the Act, by the board to the Minister; but so far as I can see there is nothing in the Bill about the repayment to the board of this £600,000, or whether part of it may be advanced to hotel keepers or whatever other bodies the money may be advanced to, nor, it seems to me, is there any direction as to what the board will do with the money when it is repaid to them.  Will they treat it as a capital fund, or in what way will they treat it?  It seems to me that all these sections need overhauling in order to make these things clear. Surely, if the board receives a maximum of £600,000, and if it makes advances to certain bodies, any of the <Col N="66" /> money that is repaid to the board should be put to capital account and not to revenue account.  So far as I can see, however, there is nothing to prevent the board adding such repayments to their annual revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall look into that matter, but so far as advances made by the board to hotel-keepers and other bodies of that kind are concerned, the provision for the repayment of these advances, and the manner in which they shall be repaid, will be determined by the agreement which the board will make with these people prior to making the advance.  The board will make whatever terms it can or whatever terms it desires, and it will get these terms agreed to before advancing the money.  Sub-section (3) of this section provides that sums advanced to the board shall be repayable with interest, and I should imagine that an arrangement would be made with the board for the establishment of some account which would be periodically cleared for the benefit of the Exchequer or for wiping out the board's liability for these advances.  You have a similar thing in connection with the Electricity Supply Board.  They have not repaid the capital, so far; in theory, it is being used for that purpose, but in practice it is being used for the purpose of financing fresh capital commitments.</P>

      <P>No; not without fresh legislation.  Of course if this thing should be developed, it is quite possible that, in some future years, another Minister may produce a Bill to amend this Bill by increasing that amount of £600,000, just as we have had to do in the case of half-a-dozen other Acts in connection with electricity supply, telephone and telegraph services.  Each of these Acts fixed a maximum limit to the advances that could be made&mdash;whether for electricity, or telephone or telegraph service, or whatever the service might be&mdash;and that limit cannot be changed without fresh legislation; the idea being that the State must determine whether or not it will invest more money in the enterprise concerned.  I do not suppose that we will get to the point of wanting to increase the amount concerned in this Bill for quite a considerable time to come, but the point might arise at some future time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the purpose of the amendments is to remove the words &ldquo;fishing rights&rdquo; and &ldquo;sporting rights&rdquo; from the places or things that the word &ldquo;land&rdquo; may include under this Bill.  As far as sporting rights are concerned I think the same argument would apply as for fishing rights. There is a general feeling of unrest amongst sporting people at the inclusion of sporting rights in this Bill. Sporting rights are generally associated with shooting rights.  They constitute a very technical industry, if I may put it that way, and it is thought that they should not be brought within the ambit of a Bill of this type.  We do not say that the State ought not, at some time, to take control of shooting rights.  What applies to fishing might be done under a properly constituted board or department in the case of shooting and some good might come of it but that is another question.  I believe that is in the offing.  The possibility of doing something in connection with shooting rights has, I understand, been considered by various Ministries but we do not think that shooting rights should be brought within the framework of this Bill because it may lead to abuse. We do not know what the composition of the board will be, nor does the Minister at present know that.  It is obvious that the majority of the board will be chosen because of their capacity to advance the tourist trade&mdash;to entice people from other countries to come here for their holidays and to entice people from one part of the country to go to another part of the country for their holidays.  We do not think that the facilities offered to visitors should include the right of free shooting.  If shooting is to be properly developed it must be properly protected and it would be necessary to put a great deal of effort into it in order to develop it properly.  Something must eventually be done to put our shooting rights on a par with those of other countries but the board which it is proposed to set up under this Bill should not be given power compulsorily to acquire shooting rights.  The Minister may say that <Col N="70" /> there is no intention of doing that.  We are sick of assurances like that from every Minister.  It has been my experience in this House that most of the things which we were assured could not happen under legislation did happen. I do not want to see the board in this case come in and compulsorily acquire shooting rights for the purpose of offering them to tourists from other countries.  Let these people by all means come in and take advantage of what nature supplies in the way of sport.  We are all heartily glad to see them do so but, where private enterprise is attempting to develop shooting, the board should not be at liberty compulsorily to interfere.  The same applies to fishing.  That is, in part, covered by a Bill which is passing through the House but shooting rights are not covered by any such Bill and I do not think that there is any proposal to bring in legislation to cover them. People who approached me objected to the inclusion of sporting rights in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Bennett in opposing the inclusion of fishing rights and sporting rights in Section 19.  I wonder if the Minister considered the general position with regard to these two items.  As Deputy Bennett said, there is a Bill at present going through the House&mdash;we finished the Committee Stage only last week &mdash;dealing with fisheries.  We had an undertaking that a Bill to consolidate the law would come afterwards.  That is as regards fishing.  As regards sporting rights other than fishing, we may take it that they are divided between the Minister for Lands, on the one hand, and private ownership, on the other hand.  Here we are going to insert a power to take these rights compulsorily.  I admit at once that, if you are going to do this at all, it would be useless to attempt it without compulsory powers but, in my opinion, the Bill should not touch this matter.  Anybody who has been reared up with this question knows that, so far as visitors are concerned, no problem arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of partridge and pheasant shooting has, in this connection, <Col N="71" /> no significance at all.  You have grouse, snipe and woodcock to deal with.  These are the three things that come under the heading of &ldquo;sporting rights.&rdquo;  Your sporting rights are, in the main, in the hands of small farmers.  On an average, throughout the entire country, the moorland adjoining the tillage area would be about 50 acres.  If the Government were to put up a capital sum of between £50,000 and £100,000 for the destruction of vermin, I should give the proposal my enthusiastic support. I should be much more impressed by that than by the proposal to give this board these powers.  If these two things are to be put into the definition, the section would require to be redrafted.  If you are to give these rights, it is vital that we should impose duties on the board, because if we do not impose duties on them, the last position will be worse than the first.  They can, for the purpose of some hotel, compulsorily acquire sporting rights in an adjoining district.  They can turn out a number of guns on the 12th August.  A number of young people may come to the country for sport and some of them may never have shot a grouse over dogs.  For the first two days, or, perhaps, for the whole time, they do not catch on to the covering of a bird rising before a dog.  All the birds on the moor are wounded and, in that way, destroyed for breeding purposes although one of them may not be instantly killed.  A number of them may die subsequently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I know more about this than the Minister does.  I have wasted some ammunition myself.  I have seen hundreds of rounds of ammunition wasted in one day and not one bird coming down.  A week afterwards you would get the birds lying dead.  Nobody in this House can give an instance of where any trouble has arisen with regard to these small farmers accommodating the owner of a hotel and affording sporting and shoots <Col N="72" /> facilities to the visitors to the hotel. The owner of the hotel enters into contracts with the small farmers as to what he will pay per head or per brace for the grouse.</P>
      <P>There may be cases where large tracts of country are a sort of common waste and in the winter time it would be useful to have them for rough shooting, such as snipe shooting, but, in the main, my experience of it is that no question arises.  If there is a hotel in the district the owner goes around and says to the farmers in that area that he will take these tracts for snipe shooting in the winter for his visitors.  There is no trouble about that at all.  My experience is that these small farmers get far better terms if they are left in the hands of the hotel proprietor.</P>
      <P>Unless very rigid duties are imposed on the board with regard to the preserving of game they may well destroy these things for the small farmer who is now getting a reasonably good price &mdash;10/- to 14/- a brace.  Fourteen shillings a brace is a very good price. During the winter the farmer would look after the destruction of sparrow-hawks, magpies, scaldcrows and whitebacks. The small farmer would do all that.  It would not cost anybody anything. Unless those duties are imposed there is no use in giving the board this power.  The moors of this country from north to south are infested with scaldcrows and whitebacks.  There is general destruction by sparrow-hawks. It is calculated that a scaldcrow would destroy 300 grouse in one season.  The number of scaldcrows in the country is beyond counting.  Therefore, the destruction done by vermin in this country is enormous.  At the same time, this Bill is introduced under which power is given to the board to take shooting and fishing rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would rather see £100,000 of this money allocated to the destruction of vermin.  That is one of the very first things you must do because there are going to be no visitors if there is no game or fishing.  All our moors and shoots are destroyed with vermin. Nothing is done to put it down.  If the Minister insists upon retaining that <Col N="73" /> power I would suggest that he should impose conditions.  I well appreciate that it would have to be left to the discretion of the board in the matter of sending a man over a particular shoot from the 1st to the 12th August and getting an approximate calculation of the number of birds on it and then to permit only a limited number to be shot off, leaving for the next season sufficient to stock it for the following season.  In that matter you would have to rely on the discretion and judgment of the men or man that the board would send to do that.  Over and above all that, the most important question with regard to sporting rights, as distinct from fishing rights&mdash;which was well looked after&mdash;is to put up a sum of money to destroy vermin throughout the country.  The Land Commission are now taking over, in the main, all the monntains, either for the general purposes of the Land Acts or for afforestation.  Whatever protection the old landlords gave through the gamekeepers is practically all gone.  There is no destruction now of vermin. Neither the Land Commission nor the Forestry Department are destroying vermin.  We have a Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, and they are doing nothing.</P>
    <P>I think the question of fishing rights and sporting rights should be entirely excluded from this section and should be dealt with in some other Bill or in the consolidating Bill referred to by the Minister in the Second Reading of the Fisheries Bill, which has passed through the House.  There is a Department of Agriculture, a Department of Lands, the Tourist Traffic Board and private individuals all interested in this matter.  Between all these stools the sporting rights are going to come to the ground.  There is not a hope on earth for them.</P>
    <P>Under the Ashbourne Act, the Wyndham Act, the Birrell Act, fishing and sporting rights were given to the tenantry.  These were not given to them under the 1923 Act.  In townlands of eight or twelve holdings some of the tenants hold under the Ashbourne Act, some under the Wyndham Act and others under the 1923 Act.  The position <Col N="74" /> in regard to sporting rights of those 12 tenants may be different.  There can be nothing but chaos in such a situation.  This matter should be taken up in some Bill, such as a Consolidating Bill in respect of the game laws and sporting rights, such as the Minister referred to in connection with the fishing rights.  I do not like this section in the present Bill.  I think it will only add further chaos to the present position of sporting rights in this country.  In its present form it will not get us anywhere.  If it is thought wise to insist upon putting it in this Bill I think it should be entirely redrafted.  In that matter, any assistance I can give will be gladly given. I was called in on an occasion when this matter was being discussed by men who should have known this question very well.  I was certainly not impressed by them.  They had ideas about it, but everyone had a sectional idea of it.  There should be a national idea in this matter.  I say&mdash;but I do not mean it in any offensive way&mdash; that the sporting rights of landlords are gone, in the main.  An entirely new condition of affairs has been created.  The State that brought about that position has not done anything to look after the valuable national asset of which they took possession.  Nothing whatever has been done.  The Government has not paid for the destruction of one scaldcrow, one magpie and one whiteback.  They took over this valuable national asset. In the general hurry, and as part of the political hysteria to get land and to get that land divided, this important asset was overlooked.</P>
    <P>That is the position to-day with regard to sporting rights.  You are proposing to confer on a body power to take over those sporting rights.  In the main, they have nothing to take. You have got to start building them up, and that is going to be a bit of a problem.  Irreparable damage has been done by vermin.  That has been intensified by the afforestation scheme in places where forests are being planted in the middle of moors.  These new forests are going to be a regular breeding ground for vermin.  On the estimate of his Department each year. <Col N="75" /> I have asked the Minister for Lands if he was going to have that matter attended to.  I could never get an answer from him.  He simply passed over my question when replying, and has never told me whether his Department was attending to the matter or not.  So far as I know, the Department has not destroyed one head of vermin in these new forests.  In view of that, we are simply wasting our time here arguing about this.  We are wasting the taxpayer's money as well &mdash;the £600,000 and the £45,000 annually. We are voting that money with the object of attracting tourists.  You can attract them all right, but if they come once, will they come again if they find that there is nothing for them to get?</P>
    <P>Visitors are not going to come here simply for the purpose of seeing us. We are not better looking than any other race.  I suppose we are not any worse looking either, but if we want to attract visitors to the country we must give them something more than that. It will not do to give them good hotels or offer them sporting facilities on paper.  You must give them these facilities in fact.  If a man comes here to fish, he is not going to trouble us again if he finds that there are no fish in our rivers.  The same will apply to our shooting rights.  If a man takes a &ldquo;shoot,&rdquo; and puts his dogs over it and finds that there are no game there, he is not going to take that &ldquo;shoot&rdquo; again.  That is the general position. There are, of course, exceptions.  A lot of this trouble was caused by the desperate hurry to acquire and divide land.  There was the cry to acquire land, and then a tug-o'-war followed with regard to the division of it.  In this tug-o'-war the sporting rights were neglected.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to delete these sporting and fishing rights from the section.  Let the care of both be put in the hands of one Minister.  It will be that Minister's duty to come to the House and ask for a substantial sum of money for the destruction of vermin all over this State, because vermin are to be found on land all over the <Col N="76" /> country.  They are to be found on George Bennett's hills in Limerick, as they are on the hills of Donegal.  I have travelled over the moors in the County Limerick until the sweat poured off me.  I have travelled over them with two dogs, and all we saw in two days were six grouse.  What is proposed here is ridiculous.  I think I have said enough to impress the Minister with the importance of what is at stake so far as this section is concerned.</P>

      <P>I want to make it clear that Deputy McMenamin and Deputy Bennett are completely misinformed as to the intentions of the section.  I am sorry I cannot promise them that this board is going to reorganise and develop our sporting facilities.  Naturally, of course, the board will have an interest in their development.  It will assist any organisation that may be concerned in the matter, but it is not going to undertake that work itself. Sub-section (1) of the section says that the word &ldquo;land&rdquo; includes &ldquo;fishing rights, sporting rights and other rights over or in respect of any land or water.&rdquo;  These words are put there to make it clear that if the board acquires land it can also acquire any rights that go with the land&mdash;&ldquo;easements, way-leaves, water-rights, fishing rights&rdquo;&mdash;and so on.  We want to make it clear that the board can do that.  We have the compulsory acquisition clause as well.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying that the board wants rights at all.  What I have said is that if they acquire land they can acquire whatever rights go with the land.  In the ordinary course, the board will acquire any land or rights which they want by negotiation and purchase.  Experience, however, over a number of years has taught us that State organisation of this kind cannot acquire by voluntary agreement, by negotiation and purchase, on fair terms, property of any kind unless they have compulsory powers in the background which they can use.  In practice, <Col N="77" /> these compulsory powers are not availed of except in exceptional circumstances. There may be cases like the Shannon works or some other big undertaking in respect of which the use of compulsory powers would be essential, but, generally speaking, one may say that quite a number of Acts which contain a similar section to this are operated without recourse to the section, because the mere existence of these compulsory powers puts the board or organisation concerned in a position to bargain on fair terms.  In the great majority of cases the bargain is concluded on the basis of a voluntary arrangement without recourse to the elaborate procedure laid down for compulsory acquisition.</P>
      <P>The only point that arises on this section is whether we should give the board power to use these compulsory powers of their own volition.  I have been considering that point since we discussed the Bill on Second Reading, and have come to the conclusion that it is undesirable that the board should have these compulsory powers and should be able to exercise them without reference to anybody.  On the next Stage, I propose to introduce a provision requiring them to get the consent of the Minister for Industry and Commerce before they can use these compulsory powers.  Deputies understand that the board can purchase property by negotiation voluntarily if they wish in connection with any approved project on which they may be engaged, but if they propose to use these compulsory powers I intend proposing that they will have to get the prior consent of the Minister before doing so.  Again, I want to point out that I am doing that not because I think the judgment of the Minister is likely to be better than that of the board, but because he is a public officer and, therefore, must account for his conduct.  In that way, the Dáil can question the giving of his assent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I want to make clear is that the section does not mean that we are going to set out upon a general acquisition of sporting rights all over the country&mdash;that we are going to reserve sporting rights for tourists, or do anything else with those sporting rights. <Col N="78" /> We are not even undertaking to do what Deputy McMenamin wants done, that is to finance the development or improvement of those sporting rights. Another Department of Government may undertake that.  Private associations and organisations already established for that purpose may be assisted by the Tourist Board to that end, but the board itself is not proposing to do so.  If it acquires fishing or sporting rights, it will acquire them merely in connection with land acquired by it for some specific purpose.</P>

      <P>There is one point on which I was not quite clear from listening to the Minister.  Will the board acquire sporting and fishing rights where the land to which those sporting and fishing rights are attached are not taken over?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>It can do something like the following: The board will acquire land, for instance, for the building of a hotel.  It will naturally acquire the fishing rights so far as all the land it gets is concerned, but it can also compulsorily acquire fishing rights in the neighbourhood, even though those rights attach to land which it does not take over?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the intention that they should do so, except to this extent: in regard to fishing rights or other rights which they might desire to purchase, and which they found themselves in a difficulty about obtaining at a reasonable price, it might be necessary to use compulsory powers. Except to the extent that the use of compulsory powers is necessary in order to ensure that there will be a <Col N="79" /> fair deal, I think they should not be used at all to acquire those rights, certainly not where those rights have been developed by their present proprietor. There will be cases, of course, where it might be held by everybody that the sporting rights or fishing rights in a particular area should be acquired by the board or somebody else for the purpose of development, and there will be no real opposition to it except on the part of some crank or other who is himself doing nothing about it, but who might refuse to sell, and against whom compulsory powers might have to be utilised.  But where those rights have been developed by the present proprietor, where they were being looked after and good use made of them, I would be opposed to giving the board powers of compulsory acquisition at all.  Certainly, I would prevent them from using those powers of compulsory acquisition other than in very exceptional circumstances.  In the ordinary course, when they want rights of that kind they should go out and negotiate for them, and buy at fair value.  The only case where compulsory powers might be used would be where fair value could not otherwise be obtained.</P>

      <P>The Minister's last reference to the restrictions he is going to put on compulsory acquisition will apply more to a subsequent amendment than to this particular one.  The Minister has lost the point that perhaps Deputy McMenamin, in his enthusiasm for sporting development, has gone outside what was intended by the amendment.  I do not at all propose that the board should undertake the development of shooting rights in this country.  I say that there is necessity for the preservation of those rights, and their proper development as an asset to this country.  I do not at all say that the present board should do that.  I believe they are the last body to which that should be entrusted.</P>

      <P>The second last, if you like to put it that way.  I do believe that some time soon&mdash;the Minister rather hinted that some Government Department might help&mdash;we must have a development of shooting rights.  Before that happens, I do not want the Tourist Board or any other board to acquire tracts of land that might be made a valuable asset to this country under proper development.  I do not think it is desirable that they should get compulsory powers of acquisition of such land.  It might be necessary that those powers should eventually be given to somebody, but certainly not to this board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am proposing now is that we will ensure that the board cannot use those compulsory powers except in accordance with public policy.  Public policy for the development of fishing, for example, is laid down in the Fishing Bill which was before the Dáil recently.  Similar legislation in regard to other sporting facilities and rights may come at some stage, and this board will not act contrary to whatever may be determined as in the general national interest. In order to ensure that, we will keep <Col N="81" /> Ministerial control over the exercise of those powers.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2), page 8, line 7, after the word &ldquo;Section&rdquo; to add the following words &ldquo;provided always that the board shall not compulsorily acquire any land greater in extent than one rood in any townland.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This, Sir, is a still more important amendment.  It covers the whole question of the acquisition of land. Outside of any argument which we have put forward in regard to shooting rights, we must protest against this particular section as it stands.  The board may acquire practically any land that they desire in the country.  They may interfere with the rights of numerous private citizens.  They may take land contiguous to a town, land of great value for building sites or anything else you like.  In the last amendment I was concerned only with the words &ldquo;sporting rights&rdquo;; this amendment covers the whole question of the acquisition of land.  The board may acquire land from any individual in any place in this State.  There is only one exception.  There was one particular board here which could acquire land, and that was the Land Commission.  It was the only body which could take land compulsorily.</P>

I say &ldquo;perhaps.&rdquo;  The Minister may mark the word.  I do not say it is very probable, but perhaps they can acquire land anywhere, including land belonging to any member of this House.  Practically no rights are given to the individual.  There is no right of appeal if they propose to take such, land.  The board, mind you, having acquired your land, may, if they wish, institute an inquiry.  The people who seized land compulsorily may institute an inquiry, and the composition of the inquiry itself is rather vague.  The Minister should appoint a fit and proper person, and such person is authorised to do various things, and it is not said to whom he is to report, or what the finality of his decision is going to be.</P>

      <P>Tá orm, a Chinn Comhairle a rá nach féidir linn glacadh leis an rún seo.  I regret to have to state that the Government do not see their way to accept this proposal.  I need hardly assure the House that, in coming to this decision, there is no question of my personal hostility&mdash;quite the contrary&mdash;towards Deputy MacEoin.  We all have the highest respect for him, not only because of his work in this House, but because of his national services outside.  I am rather surprised, in fact, that, after their experience on the last occasion, the Opposition should again put us in the position of <Col N="83" /> having to take our stand on what we regard as an important principle in the filling of this office: and that is the question of the ability of the person proposed for it to undertake any duties that may arise in connection with the work through the Irish language.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach explained on the last occasion that, so long as we have in the House experienced members who have a good knowledge of Irish and a certain experience of the work of the House, we feel that we would not be justified in voting for a candidate about whom there may be any doubt; and the position is the same now.  It is not merely a question that has arisen to-day or yesterday.  In 1928, the present Taoiseach explained&mdash;on the occasion of the election of a Leas-Cheann Comhairle&mdash;that the Party of which he was the leader felt bound to insist upon the election to that office of a person who had a knowledge of Irish.  That was our attitude at that time, and lest it might be thought that&mdash;because some of us happen to be specially associated, as I am, with the question of Irish in this country&mdash;it is merely a personal matter in which we have a special interest, that we do not represent the general feeling in this matter, and that our attitude is not in accordance with the attitude that we ourselves have already taken up, but is in accordance with the attitude of other members in the House, I think I cannot do better than read an extract from a speech of Deputy T.J. O'Connell on the occasion of the election of Leas-Cheann Comhairle in 1927.  It is taken from the Official Debates of the 1st July, 1927, cols. 329-330.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;On the main question, I desire to enter a protest against the election of the Deputy named in the main motion as Leas-Cheann Comhairle because in my opinion, to the best of my belief, he does not possess one of the essential qualifications that I think a person elected to that position should possess, namely, a thorough knowledge of the Irish language. The Constitution of this State says that Irish is the official language and in the Standing Orders <Col N="84" /> it is laid down that it is open to Deputies to address the Dáil in either Irish or English.  I hold that a person occupying the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle who does not understand Irish will not be in a position to carry out the duties of that office to the fullest extent to which they should be carried out.  It is further mentioned in Standing Orders that all orders and official documents shall be issued in the Irish and English language, and in the absence of you, sir, it will be the duty of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle to superintend the issue of all such documents, and although he may be assisted by a very competent staff, the responsibility will be his and he will be forced to take the responsibility of authorising the issue of all such documents, the contents of which he does not exactly understand. It is the policy of the Party opposite, the policy of the Executive Council, to encourage in every way the Irish language in this State. They have made it a compulsory subject for all examinations for persons entering the public service.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;They have insisted upon its introduction into the schools, and have urged in some cases very strongly&mdash; amounting almost to coercion&mdash; public servants to take up the study of the Irish language.  Men and women, I believe, have lost their positions through their failure to give the language the place it should hold in the life of the State.  I take the President at his own word.  He stated that this position was the second most important position in the most important institution in the State.  The Dáil is now asked to support for the second most important position in the most important institution in the State a person who has no knowledge of the official language of the State.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Belton: One who helped to make the State.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Mr. Derrig: Irish is the official language of the State.  That is stated in the Constitution.  English may also be regarded as the official language, but it is stated definitely <Col N="85" /> in the Constitution that Irish is the official language.  The proposal is a bad encouragement to those who have taken up the burden placed on them throughout the country of official public service, and who made efforts to study the Irish language, to do their duty and everything possible in order to comply with the spirit of the Constitution to bring the national language back to its rightful place.  The proposal will be pointed to by many of these public servants, on whom pressure was brought during the last three years, and on whom pressure is still being brought, as a bad example on the part of those who are proposing it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These were the views expressed by Deputy O'Connell on that occasion, and, far from those views having undergone any weakening, I think they should be fortified so far as those members of the House&mdash;and, most important, the great majority who are interested in the question of the Irish language&mdash;are concerned.</P>
    <P>I entirely fail to understand, a Chinn Comhairle, how it is that Deputies opposite tell us they are interested in the revival of the Irish language and in securing for it all the strength possible in the way of increased official status, and at the same time tell us&mdash; while Deputies are available for this post who have a knowledge of the Irish language&mdash;that we should elect a Deputy who, so far as we know, is not able to undertake the duties in which a knowledge of Irish is necessary. I claim that to elect such a person would have a very bad effect on the language movement throughout the country.  We have sufficient discouragement and sufficient obstacles to contend with in endeavouring to extend the use of the Irish language for official purposes; but if, at this hour of the day, we are going to elect a person with no knowledge of Irish to this important post, how can we defend that to our people outside who are interested in Irish, to those in the Civil Service whom we are compelling to face examinations and threatening with the loss of their positions if they fail to pass difficult tests in Irish, to the teachers who are threatened with <Col N="86" /> other penalties if they fail to reach a requisite standard in the Irish language? I think the thing is most inconsistent.</P>
    <P>In trying to buttress his case on the last occasion, Deputy Mulcahy referred to the Local Government Department. He started off by telling us that it was nearly time that we faced realities in the matter of Irish, and particularly in the matter of the use of the Irish language in administrative posts, and the whole of his argument seemed to be that because, according to his allegation, the Minister for Local Government did not carry on the policy of enforcing Irish upon the Local authorities to the extent that Deputy Mulcahy would have wished, that was a reason for supporting an English-speaking candidate for this position. If what the Deputy alleges were true &mdash;that the Government, either in that Ministry or in any other Ministry, had not at least been as good as their predecessors&mdash;surely that is no reason for letting down Irish further in the present circumstances.  It ought to be, one would imagine, a reason for holding the position at any rate in regard to the Dáil, which is the most important body, I suppose, in the country, from the State point of view.  But I question if the Deputy's statements are correct.</P>

      <P>The depth of my interest in Irish will not be judged.  I think, by what the Deputy may think of it, or by the amount of preparation that I have given to this particular debate.  The question of the Gaeltacht Orders, which the Deputy introduced when he was Minister, has been under consideration frequently by the Government, and the position, in brief, simply is that the Deputy, by reason of these Orders, when he was Minister allowed a large number of persons to <Col N="87" /> come into the service of public authorities on the condition that they would learn Irish when they came in.  A great many of them have not learned Irish; there is no question about that. The Deputy knew that when he was Minister.  The only question that arose was, when they should be turned out of the positions they held.  We have not turned them out, for various reasons, up to the present.  There is nothing to stop us from turning them out to-morrow or the day after if we wish.  The position has been constantly under consideration.</P>
      <P>I suggest, however, that if the Deputy had been as wise in regard to the Irish language as he was enthusiastic, he would have first endeavoured to ensure that the persons had a competent knowledge of Irish before they took up the positions, and then the legacy which he left to his successor of determining at what exact moment these people should be thrown out of the positions they have occupied for some years would not have arisen. Our policy has been to try to ensure that, so far as the public service is concerned, the advertisements and the other procedure shall set out that the persons to take up these posts shall have a competent knowledge of Irish before they enter the service.</P>

      <P>After they entered the service, then, of course, the matter is settled.  But what the Deputy was responsible for was allowing in a large number of persons, some of them occupying very minor posts under the local authorities, on the condition that they would learn Irish.  They were persons who were sometimes middle-aged or approaching middle-age. They had not a proper knowledge of Irish in the beginning and they will never have a proper knowledge of Irish, no matter how much they may study it.  That position has constantly been under consideration, and so has the position with regard to the correspondence with the Local authorities. The Local Government Department has constantly been in touch with the local authorities to which the Deputy <Col N="88" /> referred, and when the question of technical terms is settled there is nothing whatever to stop the local authorities from determining, if they wish, that all their correspondence with the Local Government Department shall be through Irish.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The sincerity of that statement can be decided in this way: there will always be two heads on the coin with which the Taoiseach tosses. &ldquo;An Fear Mor&rdquo; was turned down for the Chairmanship of the Seanad because he had Irish and did not belong to Fianna Fáil.  Seán MacEoin is to be turned down for the Vice-Chairmanship of the Dáil, moryah, on the ground that he has not Irish and does not belong to Fianna Fáil.  The outstanding living symbol of the Irish language in this country is &ldquo;An Fear Mor.&rdquo;  He did not belong to a political Party; he did not belong to the political Opposition.  But the greatest living disciple and teacher of Irish was voted down by the followers of the Taoiseach for the Chairmanship of <Col N="89" /> the Seanad because he had Irish but he had not the Fianna Fáil label on his coat.  Do you seriously expect anyone beyond the gagged and tied followers to believe that there is any ring of sincerity in the reasons put up for down-voting Dan Morrissey and down-voting Seán MacEoin?  The thing is simply sheer political humbug and nothing else.  If it deludes the followers sitting behind, it will not delude the great masses of the public.</P>
      <P>I want to know, once and for all, who is the judge in Ireland as to who does and who does not know Irish.  Is the Taoiseach, in addition to the other offices he holds, to be a kind of super-judge as to who has Irish and who has not?  What steps were taken to ascertain whether Dan Morrissey had Irish, whether Seán MacEoin had Irish, and whether Seán Gibbons had?  We know that in this country people with a certain amount of Irish, when a census form comes round, fill in &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; after the question, are they Irish speakers, and without question, without test, all these are accepted as Irish speakers and get the State seal of Irish speakers.  It is the general tot of these that goes to make up the Gaeltacht and goes to make up the official returns as to the number of Irish speakers in the country.  What right has any individual political leader to decide who has and who has not Irish in the absence of a test?  I heard it suggested to-day that a test might be by a vocal examination carried on by the Chairman of the Seanad and that that would be a quite satisfactory Parliamentary procedure to ascertain who had and who had not Irish.  It is late in the day for the man who was leader of Sinn Féin to be down-voting a man like Seán MacEoin for any office in an Irish Parliament.  When he was elected President of the Government of the Irish Republic, he was very proud to have Seán MacEoin as one of his proposers.  But at that time Deputy Seán MacEoin did not differ from him politically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now he is to be a pariah in the Parliament which he did more than any other living Irishman to create.  He is now to be a pariah because he does not belong to the proper political Party. <Col N="90" /> Deputy Seán MacEoin's Irish was expressed frequently and loudly from the barrel of a rifle at a time when that was the Irish voice most wanted in Ireland.  At that time he had sufficient Irish to have everybody looking to him and honouring him as the outstanding Irishman of his age.  He had sufficient Irish to stand in the gap of danger in Ballinalee.</P>
    <P>It is rank hypocrisy, humbug and ingratitude for an Irish Assembly to be putting up false and dishonest reasons now to turn down Deputy Seán MacEoin on the ground, not that he has not Irish but on the grounds that the Taoiseach has decided without knowledge and without a test that Deputy Seán MacEoin has not sufficient Irish to occupy the Vice-Chair of this Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support the motion which has been proposed this evening.  I do so because I think the candidate who has been proposed for the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle is not only fully qualified to occupy that office but is an Irishman who holds and is entitled to feel proud of a distinguished national record.  In this House amongst all Parties, no matter how bitter the times may have been, Deputy Seán MacEoin has been held in the very highest esteem.  Those who know him personally say that if he has one fundamental philosophy it is a very high conception of fair play.  I know of no better qualifications or characteristics for the occupancy of the Vice-Chair during your absence than this high conception of fair play.  I listened to the Minister for Education here this evening at considerable length on the necessity of a candidate for the Vice-Chair having a competent knowledge of Irish in order to discharge the duties of the office of Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  But I want to say that in my opinion the Irish plea that is put forward in this matter is the hollowest pretext.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe that the Government themselves believe at all in the plea which is put forward here except-perhaps that in this connection it suits their political point of view.  We are told that it is necessary that the candidate should have a knowledge of <Col N="91" /> Irish.  But we were not told that the Parliamentary Secretaries or Ministers have a knowledge of Irish.  Yet, these Ministers and Secretaries are allowed to come in here and listen to discussions in which members of the House want to make their contributions in Irish.  We elect Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries to discharge the duties of their offices when we know perfectly well that these Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries may not have a competent knowledge of the Irish language to reply to the matters raised in the course of the debate here.</P>
    <P>We do more than that, we appoint Judges.  We can have Acts of Parliament printed in Irish and English and we appoint Judges to interpret these Acts of Parliament.  We are appointing Judges and the Government know perfectly well they have no knowledge whatever of the Irish language. Certain Judges sitting on the Benches to-day interpreting Acts of Parliament printed in Irish and English do not know a single word of Irish.  We all know that perfectly well.  We send Ministers to other countries to represent this Nation and I am quite sure that we do not take the precaution beforehand to ensure that they have a competent knowledge of Irish or an ability to speak it in the countries to which they are sent.  How, then, in the face of these facts, when persons may become Judges without a knowledge of Irish, when persons may become Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries without a knowledge of Irish, can we possibly believe that there is any sincerity in the plea that it is necessary to have a competent knowledge of Irish in order to discharge the duties of Leas-Cheann Comhairle in this House.  I want it to go on record that I do not believe that plea put forward by the Government. If I were to listen to it being urged and argued until 10.30 o'clock to-night, I would not believe in that plea.</P>
    <P>I think the election of Deputy Sean MacEoin would be a popular election as far as this country is concerned. His election would be a credit to this <Col N="92" /> House and to the Parliament itself. I am not at all concerned with Deputy MacEoin's political associations or with his political viewpoint.  They are different from mine in many respects but I recognise at the same time that the House would honour itself by electing a distinguished Irishman like Deputy MacEoin to the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle of this House.</P>

      <P>I thought that there was one subject at least in which the two big Parties in this House saw eye to eye, and that was to use every possible opportunity to try to help to put the Irish language in the position which it should occupy in this country, to try to get people outside to have respect for their own language, and to see it honoured whenever there was an opportunity of doing so&mdash;to see it put in the position of honour and that honour would be done to it.  Now, apparently, we are going to see something quite different.  I have heard in my time of many arguments against the Irish language from all sorts of people, and I do not think I ever heard in such a short time so many of the old arguments which, if they were followed and were attended to, would certainly mean that Irish could never hope to become the spoken language of the country.  We have heard every one of the old arguments.  We are told we cannot make any progress <Col N="93" /> unless we do everything at once.  I say you cannot do everything at once. You have to make progress where you can and when an opportunity of forwarding the Irish language presents itself, then you should take advantage of it.</P>

But I do say that I fail to see that the arguments used by some of them here were sincere.</P>
      <P>I did not think I would hear these arguments used to prevent an effort being made to forward the Irish language. Now, in this debate it has been suggested that our opposition to the present proposal is insincere.  But every occasion on which we had anything to do with the election for the Chair or the Vice-Chair we made it clear that Irish was one of the essential qualifications for the position.  We regard it from the point of view of honouring the language when the honour can be done to it.  There are members from all Parties here who are quite capable of doing the work of the Chair and doing it through the Irish language.  Deputy MacEoin has been brought forward to-day, although it is known that a definite principle is being acted upon, and that the Government were bound to act on that principle. And remember, he was not the first choice.  If Deputy MacEoin is so outstanding as that, and if it was desired to honour him, why was he not the first choice?</P>

I do not think anybody suggests, except for the purpose of debate here, that he has as competent a knowledge of Irish as the Chairman of the Seanad.  If he has learned it recently, I would be very glad to know about it.  We can only know about this matter from our common knowledge.  It is only on our common knowledge that we are acting. It is not claimed by the proposer or seconder, so far as I know, that either of the nominees has such a competent knowledge of the Irish language as would enable him reasonably to discharge his duties in the Chair here.</P>

      <P>The second point, that we are only using this for Party purposes, is disproved by the fact that the previous Leas-Cheann Comhairle was accepted by us and, in fact, he did make an admirable Chairman.  He would also have been opposed at that time if he had not a knowledge of Irish. Eleven years ago, one of the recent nominees was put forward, and he was opposed on that ground too, so that it is not a question of to-day or yesterday. What is more, it is one of the principles which were employed at the very beginning, when the Dáil was first established.  Irish was put into a prominent position by putting a person into the Chair who had a knowledge of the language.  It would be a retrograde step, in my opinion, to go back from that position and appoint, as a Vice-Chairman here, anybody who did not know Irish, when there are available in the House&mdash;I think there are some in every one of the Parties&mdash;men who have experience of the House, who are not new members, who know something about the rules of order and the rules of debate, and how business is conducted here, and who have Irish as well.</P>
      <P>There are difficulties, of course; there are difficulties in regard to Irish. It is one of the most difficult tasks that we could possibly tackle, this task of trying to make Irish the spoken language. You cannot do it without making sacrifices.  It is not alone here that I have spoken of the sacrifices we have had to make in order to get Irish put into a position of prominence.  You have frequently to take the second best.  We have, in regard to certain appointments that have been made, appointments of a technical character, said that where a person has a competent knowledge of Irish, if he is otherwise qualified, he has to take precedence over those who may have even a better technical knowledge.  If you do not do that, you make no progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is suggested that this is commercialising the language.  The same sort of thing could be said about protective tariffs.  We had a movement here for a long time by which it was hoped to get voluntary support for Irish goods. That voluntary support was not forthcoming <Col N="98" /> to such an extent as to enable manufacturers to carry on.  There was a certain amount of prejudice against the home-manufactured article, and in order to make national policy effective in that regard it was necessary to introduce compulsion of the type that was given by putting on certain tariffs, so that a certain amount of preference was given to Irish goods.  Is it suggested that we would have that if we left it to the people, and that those who see how essential Irish is for the ultimate maintenance of our national life and the preservation of the nation, as such would agree that it should be left altogether as a matter to be taken up or not by anybody who wanted to do so?  I have seen previous debates where arguments more or less of a fundamental nature, such as were raised against this election, were brought up in respect to other matters, because you can apply this to practically every appointment that is being made and to every question. You will have men about whom you will be asked: &ldquo;Is this man to be turned down with such-and-such national service?&rdquo; I say, honour the man in other ways if you want to do so, but do not do something which will be a set-back to the language.</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton, on one occasion, in supporting a certain Leas-Cheann. Comhairle, indicated that, in his opinion, a knowledge of Irish was a valid consideration, and that a fluent knowledge of Irish for the person he was supporting was an advantage.  I do not care whether I am believed or not, but I want to say that the opposition in regard to these names has not been on a Party basis.  We said to the Opposition: &ldquo;Put up anyone you please.  You can select anyone; but that is an essential qualification.&rdquo; If we accepted this we would also be guilty of the same retrograde step.  It has been suggested to me: &ldquo;You stand aside.  We, as a Party, take responsibility.  We do take the responsibility by nomination.  Why do you interfere?&rdquo;  I say that is against national policy.  We could not simply allow some Party convention to stand in the way.  We cannot do so, and we cannot shirk our responsibility in the <Col N="99" /> matter.  There are in this House, in all Parties, people who know the language and who are sufficiently experienced to be able to conduct the work of the Chair in Irish.  We are going to oppose any nomination except that of a person who is well known to be able to speak the language, or, at least, to speak it in such a way as would enable him to carry on the work of the Chair.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach suggests that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle who has vacated the Chair was willingly and openly accepted by his Party.  I want to say that at two minutes to 3 o'clock on the day the proposal to elect the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was before the House, the Opposition Party could not be told by anybody representing the Fianna Fáil Party whether their nomination was going to be opposed.</P>

      <P>That was the position the last time there was an election, and that suggests that the Taoiseach attempted to draw that contention across the discussion to-day.  As to the election of Seán MacEoin, he had enough Irish to propose the Taoiseach to be Uachtarán after the election of 1921, The Taoiseach did not want common knowledge of the language on that occasion when Seán MacEoin in addressing the Dáil said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A Chinn Comhairle is a lucht na Dála, is áthas liomsa agus is onóir dom a chuir roimh an Dáil go mbeidh Eamonn de Valéra mar Uachtarán againn.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;Tá fhios againn a bhfuil déanta aige ar son na hEireann.  Tá iontaoibh <Col N="100" /> againn as is cuirfe sé crioch leis an geoga.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputy MacEoin had enough Irish to do that.  He has not enough Irish to-day.  Anybody that the Taoiseach or his Party will put into any Dáil position, or into any Seanad position, is not going to be anything but an excuse for running away from their obligations with regard to the Irish language, if the present position is going to continue.  The Taoiseach tells us that when the opportunity arose of showing honour and respect to Irish as the national language it should be accepted.  There has not been a word of explanation here to-day as to why, when there was a monumental figure in the Irish language movement, and in the educational movement, to be elected to the Seanad, supported by those who were supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party, even to the extent, perhaps, of being members of the Dáil, and invited by some of these to accept the position of Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, supported by every Party you might say, there is no explanation why official Fianna Fáil turned that man down, much less is there any explanation why in that singular matter, it was done without the Taoiseach knowing anything about it.  There is no explanation why that same person afterwards when another Seanad election took place was defeated and put out of the Seanad.  There is no explanation of that when we are talking about the position of Irish in the Oireachtas life.</P>

      <P>I am expressing my opinion, and expressing it as one sincerely interested in the language, and what is happening with regard to <Col N="101" /> the language in the country, when the Taoiseach introduced the talk about respect and honour for the language in the life of the Oireachtas, so that we might have some explanation on that. The Minister for Education had to go back to-day to 1928 to speeches made in this House by Deputies, who are no longer here, to find the principle.  He was almost going to quote Shakespeare on the subject.  Could anything mark the poverty of the grounds upon which the Minister for Education offered to take his stand on this discussion to-day, more than this, that he had to go back and to stand, for the greater part of the time, on speeches and statements quoted by the Leader of the Labour Party in 1928?  The Minister thinks I am unreasonable in introducing into this debate a challenge to the Party opposite, and to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, who has responsibility for dealing with local bodies, for having completely and utterly neglected what I call both his responsibilities and opportunities for the last seven years, in seeing that Irish was used as the medium of communication, at least between County Galway and County Donegal.  It might have been done between Mayo, that the Minister knows something of, and also Kerry.  What I am complaining of is that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health was not travelling as fast as I would like him to travel.  The Galway County Council at that time did not think I was travelling as fast as they wished to travel, and they made a definite offer, which I believe they were quite capable of carrying out, but nothing has been done in one of the areas where the Irish language has to be saved, not only in public life but in the homes of the people, to make use of the opportunities that arose there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister considers that I am unreasonable.  I should like to hear the comment on that situation of Deputy Bartley, who was one of the people who, at that time, thought that I was going too slow.  In the County of Galway, Irish is a neglected language in the County Council administration and, so far as the Department of Local Government and Public Health is concerned, it is equally a <Col N="102" /> neglected language.  We are addressed here on the subject of the danger that our words may do in the mouths of people who do not completely understand us or who want to use our words for their own purposes, and the effect which words spoken in a discussion like this may have on the advancement or otherwise of the language. Every day the person who enters the County Council offices in Galway, the very letter typed by an official of the county council or the board of health to the Local Government Department, and the very letter that goes back is doing more to undermine the position of the Irish language in the minds of the important people, so far as the language is concerned, that is the people who have it, who can save it, and who want to be induced to use it in their administrative work.  The same applies with regard to Donegal. I only discuss Galway because the train was definitely laid there.</P>
    <P>The Minister treats the House to an utter misrepresentation of the position with regard to the Gaeltacht Order. The Minister's line is that, under the Gaeltacht Order, I left the unfortunate Fianna Fáil Government an appalling legacy of non-Irish speakers appointed in Irish-speaking districts, and that there were reasons for their being unable to bring themselves to sack them.  The Gaeltacht Order was introduced as an outlet, so that when a person suitably qualified, and with Irish, was not available, and a person without Irish had to be appointed, that person undertook to qualify in Irish inside three years.  There was nobody left in any such position in an Irish-speaking district to be a worry or a problem to a Fianna Fáil Government where there was a person available with Irish at the time.  There was a systematic plan laid down by which periodical examinations were held.</P>
    <P>People were induced to go for these examinations before the three years period was up, to test how they were getting on, and there was a systematic way of seeing that officials appointed in Irish-speaking districts would be competent in Irish.  We can infer from the Minister what the position is now. <Col N="103" /> He is loaded down with officials in the Irish-speaking districts appointed under the Gaeltacht Order who will not learn Irish.  We have listened to the Minister for Industry and Commerce telling us during the afternoon how business should be done, if it is to be done properly, and how easy it is when a person is not doing his work to push him and take another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Deputy not to infer from my speech that the Government have not been dealing with this matter.  It has been dealt with, as he probably knows, by a process of extending the period during which these people can continue to hold office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's portrayal of the position here was that I was speaking, as it were, with my tongue in my cheek on the subject of Irish here, while I had, in fact, left a legacy under the Gaeltacht Order which the Department of Local Government was utterly unable to deal with.  If the Minister had attempted to go into the position and to see what was the position under the Gaeltacht Order it would be some information for the House, but the Minister for Education, who took it upon himself to shoulder the original statement of the Government's case here to-day, underlines and emphasises the charge that we make in this matter, that their attitude is one of utter insincerity and utter incompetence.  If, as the Taoiseach says, his Party is interested in the dignity and honour of the Irish language in this Assembly, some of their recent actions in connection with the Oireachtas, to put it mildly, give a blank denial to any protestations they might make here.  If the Taoiseach thinks that a few appointments here, even if they do facilitate the use of documents and the use of speech in this House, are going to make up in any way for work which is being left undone in other directions, he is utterly and completely mistaken, and he knows it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to give a flat denial to that, and to say that everything the Government could possibly do has been done.  A committee has been set up in regard to Irish in the Civil Service.  The Deputy is talking about immediate questions which the Minister for Local Government, if he were here, would answer so far as the information which the Minister for Education has given is accurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>So that the situation with regard to the knowledge of the Taoiseach and of the Minister for Education as to the position of Irish in its administrative use throughout the country is that they are unable to tell us anything about it in respect of these local bodies, because the Minister for Local Government is not here.

      <P>My name has been mentioned in the references which Deputy Mulcahy made in connection with the suggestion which he put forward when he was Minister for Local Government with regard to Gaelicising the activities of the Galway County Council.  He says that the Galway County Council would have liked to have gone a little faster than he proposed to go.  I think, as a matter of fact, I was the member of the county council who suggested that the scheme which he proposed should be operated by the Galway County Council and should come into operation, I think, about two years earlier than he suggested.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a definite reason for making such a suggestion, namely, that the local elections were to take place in 1932.  It was a pointer to the candidates likely to stand that this scheme had been put forward, and that regard should be had to it in the selections of candidates by Parties. That was the reason for the suggestion to which Deputy Mulcahy has referred on three separate occasions&mdash;<Col N="106" /> here to-day, last week, and, I think, on an occasion about two years ago. I explained to him the first time he mentioned it that the Galway County Council was willing to go even faster than he suggested.  He seems to think that that was further evidence of insincerity on the part of the Fianna Fáil Party on the county council.  I may say that the council elected subsequently, on which there is as much English as Irish spoken, took a definite step forward as far as the Gaeltacht areas are concerned, and that all rate notices and things of that sort are now issued in the Irish language. I think practically all public notices issued by the Galway County Council are in the Irish language.</P>
      <P>I should like to remind Deputy Mulcahy of one matter, and it was for that purpose I really got on my feet. I would ask him if he remembers an occasion when the question arose of an appointment of a rates inspector for Connemara area, and if he remembers that he refused to sanction a native Irish speaker for that post.  I do not say that he wished to do anything against that particular candidate, but by a series of eliminations, he brought about the appointment of another man whom his Party desired to have appointed.  That man had not a competent knowledge of the Irish language, either written or spoken. He succeeded in getting that man appointed and in getting a native Irish speaker turned down.</P>

One or two matters come immediately to the notice of anybody sitting in the House.  If one looks <Col N="107" /> across to the other side, one need only look at the Government Front Bench and one need not make any comment on it.  One need look only a little more to the right, to the Parliamentary Secretaries' Benches and there is no comment needed there either.  I do not mean the bench occupied by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Taoiseach. I mean the bench usually occupied by other Parliamentary Secretaries in this House.  The other contrast to-day brings us to the seats a little more to the right.  I might also contrast the speech made to-day by the Leader of the Labour Party with the contemptible one which he made on this day week.</P>

If he had gone a little further in his researches for that year he might have quoted a further speech made by another gentleman who was then leader of the Labour Party.  Of course the Minister did not desire to do that.  We have heard here about the necessity of the occupant of the Chair knowing Irish.  The Taoiseach is aware&mdash;none more so&mdash;that I occupied the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle for four years, and that <Col N="109" /> during that four years, notwithstanding the fact that for part of the time there was organised obstruction by the then Opposition, not once did I ever find myself in the slightest difficulty in performing the duties of that office.

      <P>Deputy Donnchadh O Briain has a knowledge of Irish.  It is about the only qualification he has, and, if he had not that, he would die with the hunger.  Those are the facts. Might I put this to the Taoiseach: When he talks about honouring Irish, how many appointments have been made by the present Government of executive heads of Departments of State who had not a competent knowledge of Irish?  Is it not a fact that executive heads of Departments, and of very important Departments, of State&mdash;<Col N="110" /> Departments that come into close touch or contact with the daily lives of the people throughout the whole country&mdash;have been appointed even though they had not a competent knowledge of Irish?  The whole thing, of course, is nonsense.  The whole thing is hypocrisy.  The Taoiseach wants, if he can, to get into that Chair a person who is acceptable to himself and to nobody else.  No other person will have the good will of the Taoiseach in going into that Chair. The Taoiseach talks about honouring the Irish language.  May I point out to him that <i>An Fear Mór</i> was rejected in the Seanad, and the Taoiseach immediately proceeded to wash his hands of that matter?  He did not know anything about it!  Does anybody believe that?  I do not think there is anybody in this House or outside it who believes that.  I could quote innumerable instances where appointments have been made and where people with a knowledge of Irish were available and were not appointed. I think it was Deputy Norton who mentioned the courts.  Would the Taoiseach say that, if there were a vacancy to-morrow for a judge in the High Court, and if a barrister were to be called to the Bar to-morrow who was either a native Irish speaker or a fluent Irish speaker or a competent Irish speaker, he must be appointed before a man with 20 years' experience at the Bar?</P>

      <P>Of course, the Taoiseach will always wriggle.  We all know that.  Honestly, however, I do not believe the Taoiseach will do any good or that he will further the cause of the Irish language by what he is doing and saying now.  Before I sit down, however, in fairness to myself, I want to say that I spent eight months in the Gaeltacht doing my best to learn Irish, and I suggest that there are not very many members of the Taoiseach's own Party or even on the Front Bench of his Party who have done that much.  Every year, since that, every child in my house has <Col N="111" /> spent a month in the Gaeltacht, and despite any action that the Taoiseach may take, they will continue to do so.</P>

I cannot promise, of course, to go on talking until the Taoiseach has got the draft of his speech from the reporters.  We all know that he likes to have the last word, and that he likes to see the draft of the speeches.  This, however, will afford him an opportunity.  The <Col N="112" /> Taoiseach is extremely indignant that a proposal has been made from these benches that Deputy Seán MacEoin should be appointed Leas-Cheann Comhairle, because he does not believe that Deputy MacEoin is a sufficiently good speaker of Irish; and he takes the view that, if there are two persons fit for a public position in this country, and one is a fluent Irish speaker and the other not a fluent Irish speaker, for the sake of the language, and in order to do honour to the language, you should choose the Irish speaker.  Now, Senator Seán Gibbons, who is Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, knows as much Irish as the leg of that chair.</P>

      <P>I am trying to do so, Sir, against the barrage of interruptions to which I have been subjected. However, even if the Taoiseach can succeed in persuading himself on certain matters, and even if he can persuade the members of the Fianna Fáil Party to follow those beliefs, he must remember that the day has not yet dawned when he can persuade everybody to follow his beliefs.  Ten minutes ago I was led to believe that, apparently, the Taoiseach knew nothing about the election of the Chairman of the Seanad.  We all know the canvassing that went on for the election of Senator Gibbons, and we all know how the Fianna Fáil Party members were clamouring for the election of Senator Gibbons as Chairman, and we know the moving appeals that were made on his behalf; but the Taoiseach does not deny that, when it was a question of honouring Ireland, and when it was a <Col N="114" /> question as between <i>An Fear Mór</i>, who is a member of no political Party, who has studiously avoided being associated with any political Party, and who desired to stand for election in the Seanad merely to be able to exercise his supreme interest in the Irish language movement, as opposed to any question of controversial polities in this country&mdash;when, on the one side, you had <i>An Fear Mór</i> and, on the other side, ex-Deputy Gibbons&mdash; who was defeated in an election recently in order to make way for the Minister for Education and then transplanted to the Seanad&mdash;and when you had the Fianna Fáil Party clamouring for the election of Senator Gibbons to office&mdash;was the tender conscience of the Fianna Fáil Party strained, or did the Taoiseach toss on a sleepless bed as a result of the decision that had to be made?  Not a bit of it! It was just: &ldquo;Tell the boys to go in and vote for Gibbons and toss the other fellow out, and if the Gaels do not like it, well they can lump it.&rdquo; Is not that the plain fact?  Do not imagine that all that is going on to-day is the result of disinterested love for the language.  The ablest politician in this country is staging a beautiful scene.  What Gael in this country can ever say again that the Taoiseach did not fight for the Irish language? When the word &ldquo;Gibbons&rdquo; falls from the lips of a Gael, the Taoiseach will stand up and say: &ldquo;Morrissey and MacEoin.  I fought every line against misrepresentations, against every kind of hardship in Dáil Éireann because I loved the language&rdquo;.  And the poor old Gael will lower his head and creep away and the Taoiseach will be left in full possession of the field.</P>

We are told that the Fianna Fáil Party always give Irish the preference.  Is Deputy Kissane incapable of occupying the position of Parliamentary Secretary in this House?  He is a fluent Irish speaker.  I see Parliamentary Secretaries sitting over there and I pay Deputy Kissane no compliment when I say he is as able a man as any of them.  But he is kept up in a back bench and I do not see the Taoiseach tossing in a restless bed because some of his Parliamentary Secretaries cannot speak Irish.  Is Deputy Cormac Breathnach incapable of filling the office of Parliamentary Secretary? I pay him no compliment when I say that I believe him to be as able a man as some of those who decorate the Parliamentary Secretaries' bench. Does the Taoiseach toss upon an uneasy bed because Deputy Cormac Breathnach is sitting on the back benches while some of the Gaill are sitting on the Parliamentary Secretaries' bench?  Am I to go on travelling through the list of Irish speakers we have in this House and comparing them with the treasures we have as Parliamentary Secretaries?</P>

      <P>I am not impugning that. I am saying that the Taoiseach, in joining in that decision, reveals the hypocrisy of the position he now takes up in the House.  Surely, the Taoiseach will not wash his hands of responsibility for the decision which you, very properly, point out he had a part in taking.  If he was so glad to make these proposals to the House, and ask them to share in the decision taken, why is his heart rent to-day when this Party quite simply offers a person whom he himself has not denied would be a highly desirable Leas-Cheann Comhairle for this House to elect? These are reflections upon which, I think, the Taoiseach might profitably dwell.  If he does, he will, I think, come to realise that the anger which swept his usually placid exterior is unjustified. The trouble is that, like many other men who draw themselves into their shell, he seldom meets now anybody who is not a &ldquo;yes-man&rdquo;. That is not good for him.  He seldom participates in debate here, and he seldom meets anybody who does not try to find out what he wants to hear in order that they may tell him that.  Our criticisms are honest, and sincere criticisms, and, because they are criticisms of him is no reason for the Taoiseach to imagine that they are insincere.  They are perfectly sincere and, some day, he will come to realise that this kind of business is a grave disservice to the language, and is creating enemies for the language which it, otherwise, would never have.  I am sorry that the Government Party have taken up this position to-day&mdash;sorry because I think Deputy MacEoin would have filled the position with dignity and efficiency, but even more sorry because I believe it will create, in the minds of the people, as it must, the feeling that here is something which used to be regarded as sacred and precious, something with an inherent dignity&mdash;the language&mdash; being used for very, very base purposes. We have very few things left which have not been tarnished by something which those who professed to serve them did.  The language was almost unique in that.  I am sorry the day has come when it will join the great majority of movements which <Col N="117" /> have been betrayed by those who professed to love and serve them.</P>

      <P>I support the nomination of Deputy MacEoin for the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  No case has been made against Deputy MacEoin of not being fit to fill the position except the allegation that he has not a competent knowledge of Irish.  Are we to understand that Deputies elected to this house by the people can be discriminated against? If so, why is it not a condition precedent to their nomination that they must have certain qualifications?  No Deputy here with any spirit wants to feel himself inferior to any colleague on this or any other bench.  I do not believe that the opposition of the Party on the other side is dictated by the desire to help the Irish language. Even accepting what the Taoiseach says&mdash;that the Government have taken a certain attitude in regard to the Irish language, and that, to be consistent, they must continue to adhere to that attitude&mdash;I challenge the right of the Taoiseach or any Government to throw on the scrap-heap outstanding men who made government possible in this country.  It was not the Irish language which created this State, but it was men like Deputy MacEoin.  His competence for this office is not questioned.  A man can come from anywhere, get naturalised here, and learn the Irish language, and he is fit to occupy the Chair here. But MacEoin, of Ballinalee, is not fit to do so, according to the ruling of the Taoiseach.  That will not be sanctioned outside this House.  Were they all Irish speakers who carried on the fight for freedom for 700 years?  Were Sarsfield, Wolfe Tone, Parnell, John Mitchel and John Martin Irish speakers?  I should like to ask the Taoiseach whether Frank Gallagher was an Irish speaker when he was made deputy broadcaster?  I refer to the ex-editor of the <i>Irish Press.</i></P>

      <P>I agree: You will accept my explanation, A China Chomhairle, I am sure, when I confess that I did not know that in that position he was a civil servant.  As an old civil servant myself, I would be the last to attack people who are not in a position to defend themselves.  In that connection, I do dissociate myself with the criticism of the Chairman of the Seanad.  I do not know whether he has a competent knowledge of Irish or not.  I am not going to say anything more about it.  He is not in this House, and cannot answer criticism from me or anybody else.  He will, I suppose, choose his own time.  We were old friends at one time.  I do not think we are as good friends now, but I am not going to criticise his competency in the position to which he was elected by other people.</P>
      <P>My object in getting up here was to support the candidature of a man who was born and reared in the little isolated village of Ballinalee.  He made his living at a modest if an honourable calling&mdash;ringing the anvil under the shades of Kilshruley Woods. Just on the eve of the call to arms in the fight for freedom in this country I knew, from a census that was taken on the authority of the late Scán MacDermot, that there was only one man in the County Longford in the Republican Brotherhood.  The next man I heard of as being in the Republican Brotherhood was the young blacksmith of Kilshruley Woods.  I heard it from Michael Collins.  That man has written his name broadly and indelibly across the pages of Irish history.  He has advanced himself wonderfully in every direction.  He has filled very important military positions in this country.  I am quite satisfied that he would fill with honour and dignity civil positions if he were elected to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach knows that Deputy Seán MacEoin carries British metal in his lung from a wound he received when some who shouted &ldquo;Up the Republic&rdquo; in Mullingar, after the split in 1922 did not go out to rescue him when the word was sent down to stop <Col N="119" /> the train outside Mullingar and take him off.  The Taoiseach knows all that inner history.  These people who shouted &ldquo;Up The Republic&rdquo; and, perhaps, shouted it in the Irish language, if they were members of Fianna Fáil, might be Deputies here to-day, and if they were competent to speak the Irish language could fill the position we are here now trying to fill.  But Deputy MacEoin is to be excluded from it.  The thing is rank hypocrisy. It would make the Irish patriots who did not know the Irish language, who kept the torch of freedom burning in this country generation after generation for centuries, turn in their graves if they could now witness the hypocrisy and cant that is going on here to-day.</P>
    <P>The name of MacEoin is known, not only in Ireland, but it is known with pride where the Irish foregather the world over.  I am sorry that a Government, elected by the people, now sees it fit to turn down Deputy MacEoin from this position.  Why is he not able to preside here?  If he is not able to do so why is there any chairman of a county council in Ireland allowed to preside at a meeting if he has not a competent knowledge of the Irish language? Why has not the Lord Mayor of Dublin a competent knowledge of the Irish language?</P>

But, this other matter we are discussing, I think, is above Party.  I agree with Deputy Norton when he said that Deputy MacEoin has a high <Col N="120" /> sense of fair play.  I do not think anybody will question that.  That is an essential qualification for the Chair and it is a far better and more important qualification for the Chair than whether he knows Irish or not. How many Irish speeches are made here&mdash;and then they are only a bit of a stunt to show the House and the country that the speaker knows a bit of Irish.  Does the Taoiseach conduct all his business here in Irish?  Of course not.  Even the Minister for Education does not do so.  Neither does any Minister.  It is only make-belief. I do not think it is helping the Irish language.  I have the greatest respect for An Uachtaran, placed at the head of the State.  If we are to measure service in achieving freedom in this country, give me the little finger of the blacksmith of Ballinalee to all the Uachtarans and Governor-Generals we have had in this country or ever will have.</P>

      <P>I will think it over.  I do submit that a man who fought for freedom, who is qualified in every respect for the Chair, except that it is alleged that he does not know Irish, who carries a British bullet in his lung which, I understand, causes an almost perpetual hæmorrhage, should be elected.  His services will not be recognised. He was born and reared in humble circumstances, in a place where no Irish was spoken.  He got no opportunity in his young days to learn Irish.  Still he had an Irish heart, and he heard the appeal and responded to it.  He saved his life&mdash;one chance in a million.  I am sorry if, I have said anything that I should not have said about An Uachtaran, but the man who works and who performs the deed is <Col N="121" /> the man for whom I have respect.  I am making no comparisons.  I would appeal, at the eleventh hour, to the Taoiseach and to the Government to consider this motion.  If they consider that Deputy MacEoin is not competent to conduct the business of the Chair, that is another matter.  If they have only the flimsy excuse that he has not a competent knowledge of Irish, then I think that is only face-saving and hypocrisy.</P>

      <P>I did not know, until the intervention of the last speaker, that this was a free fight which anybody could join.  My joining in it will be of short duration.  It was my fortune in life to listen to three great orations.  The first of these was delivered by Bishop Donnelly, a panegyric to the late Cardinal Moran.  The second was Kuno Meyer's address thanking the Dublin Corporation on the day the freedom of this city was conferred on him.  The third was Patrick Pearse's oration over the open grave of O'Donovan Rossa.  His words ring out still: &ldquo;Ireland not only free but Gaelic.&rdquo;  If the Taoiseach does not bear bullets in his body it is not his fault.  The Taoiseach's name is written broad on this country's history forever, and when he says to us&mdash;at any rate, to his followers&mdash;&ldquo;Ireland not only free, but Gaelic as well,&rdquo; we follow him in submission, and we are proud to vote with him to-night.</P>

      <P>I am surprised at the action of the Taoiseach in opposing the nomination of Deputy Sean MacEoin.  I was born and reared almost beside the place that Deputy Sean MacEoin comes from.  I have known him since I was ten or twelve years of age.  I well remember the years 1918, 1919, 1920 and 1921, when his name was on everybody's lips in the county.  Everyone looked up to him as a hero, and they look up to him still.  I remember those years well when we were all afraid to go anywhere, but Deputy Seán MacEoin was here, there and everywhere.  Everyone was trying to save him.  We never thought the day would come when he would be turned down for a position in <Col N="122" /> an Irish Parliament after all his work for the country in those days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>Speaking from a disinterested and, I might almost say a judicial standpoint as an independent member of this House, I can only say that I deplore the action of the Government Party in opposing this motion.  I think that there never was, at least not in recent years, any time in which the prestige of this House was lower than it is at the present time.  I do not think that there ever was in this country as little faith in Parliamentary action and in Parliamentary institutions generally as at the present day.  I do not think that the discussion which has taken place here this evening, and the action which has been taken by the Government Party on this motion, is going to help in any way to allay that feeling or to give the plain people of this country confidence that those elected here are sincere in their desire to do what is best for the country.</P>
      <P>The fact that we have here to-day such a vehement conflict in regard to a position of this kind&mdash;a salaried position&mdash;will tend to lower still further the prestige of this House in the eyes of the people.  Nothing, I think, will convince the plain people that there is real sincerity behind the plea that Deputy Seán MacEoin's nomination is being opposed simply because he has not a sufficient knowledge of Irish.  It is possible, perhaps, that if the Taoiseach had time to go down through the country and make vehement speeches at every chapelgate and cross-roads, and in every village, he might, by reason of his impressive personality, be able to persuade a considerable number of the people that that was so; but what I am convinced of is this, that the people of this country will feel that this House is being degraded by the conflict which has arisen over this position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think everybody appreciates the attitude of the Government in so far as they agreed to the principle that the main Opposition Party should have the privilege and right of nominating the Deputy Chairman of this House.  In view of the fact that the <Col N="123" /> Government had agreed to that principle, I do not see any reason why they should have departed from it. The Government Party may claim that they are acting in the best interests of the Irish language, but surely nobody will dispute the fact that, whatever faults the Opposition Party may have, they are at least as keen on the promotion of the Irish language as the Government Party are.  If the main Opposition Party have agreed that Deputy Seán MacEoin had a sufficient knowledge of Irish, and that his appointment to this position would not in any way injure the position of the Irish language, then I think that their opinion on this question should have been respected by the Government Party simply as a matter of courtesy. In my opinion it is time that there should be a little courtesy between the main political Parties in this House. For that reason I would appeal to the Government Party, if they cannot see their way to withdraw their opposition to this motion, at least to leave the decision to a free vote so far as their own members are concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBroderick" hpid="Mr. S. Brodrick Mr. S. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the action of the Taoiseach here to-day in opposing the nomination of Deputy Seán MacEoin.  The Deputy, I suppose, is a man of 42 or 43 years of age.  It must be realised that he has given at least 20 years of his life fighting for the freedom of his country. The Taoiseach may say: &ldquo;Well, he could have learned Irish before that.&rdquo; We all know that in remote districts, such as that from which Deputy MacEoin comes, there was very little opportunity of learning the Irish language in those days.  The Taoiseach and his Minister were in an entirely different position.  In their early days most of them were students, and it was their job to learn Irish.  Deputy Seán MacEoin was in a different position. As I have said, he has given at least 20 years of his life fighting for the freedom of this country.  If it were not for the fight made by men like him the sacrifice that he and others made, you would have very few worrying about the position of Irish to-day.  Therefore I think credit <Col N="124" /> should be given to Deputy Seán MacEoin and men like him for the fight they put up and for the freedom we enjoy to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Taoiseach is quite serious in all that he said to-day about the Irish language, let us consider the position of judges.  I am sorry that Deputy Bartley is not here.  He told us that the only thing that the members of the Galway County Council are capable of doing in the Irish language is to send out demand notes to the people of the Gaeltacht for their rates &mdash;to the people who speak Irish but are not able to read Irish.  According to him, that is all the Galway County Council has done.  To come back to the question of the appointment of judges: you may have, some time or other, people from the Gaeltacht charged with some offence and put on trial here in Dublin.  They are tried before a judge appointed by the Taoiseach and his Government.  We find that in all those cases interpreters have to be employed to translate into English the evidence given in Irish, so that the judge and the jury may understand it.  I think that if the Taoiseach is serious about the Irish language he ought, when his Government is appointing judges, to see to it that only men who have a knowledge of the Irish language&mdash;as well as being in other respects able men&mdash;are appointed to the Bench.  Deputy Bartley also mentioned the appointment of rate collectors.  I say that in County Galway at the present time, and in parts of the Gaeltacht, rate collectors who have not a word of Irish are being employed, and sanctioned by the Minister for Local Government. Demand notes in Irish are being sent out from the county council to people who cannot read Irish although they can speak it.  In regard to appointments of county surveyors which are about to be made throughout the Gaeltacht at the present time, I should like to know if those people have a knowledge of Irish?  Have they a word of Irish?  Those are men whose salaries will be about £1,000 a year. Have they a word of Irish with which to carry out their duties in the Gaeltacht? Can they meet one ganger in <Col N="125" /> the Gaeltacht and speak to him in Irish?  I say they cannot, and those appointments are about to be made at the present time.</P>
    <P>I think, if the Government are really serious in the matter of the Irish language, they should start at the top and deal with it in the manner in which it ought to be dealt with.  How many speeches in Irish do we hear in this House?  The Taoiseach said in answer to Deputy Morrissey that things were spoken here in Irish which Deputy Morrissey knew nothing about.  It is very easy for the Taoiseach to say that, but, as far as I can see, during Deputy Morrissey's time the business was carried out here in a very creditable manner, and I believe that under Deputy Seán MacEoin the business of this House will be carried out in the same manner.  I would appeal to the Taoiseach, seeing the nominee who is being put up, to give the members of this House the right to vote as they think fit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>To my mind this whole debate has lowered the prestige of this House.  If the opposition to Deputy Seán MacEoin's election is sincere, it lacks all the elements of commonsense.  It is illogical, and to my mind a slight on the electors who elected the various Deputies to this House.  A great many, if not the majority, of the Deputies of this House unfortunately lack a competent knowledge of the Irish language.  That is perhaps not their fault but their misfortune. Those of us who have a limited knowledge of Irish have a great regard for those who have a more fluent and real knowledge of the language, but all of us were elected by the people of this country, believing that we, in our various ways, would discharge all the duties for the performance of which they elected us.  The electors of the different constituencies elected the various Deputies, believing <Col N="126" /> that they might possibly be called upon to fill any position that this House offers; believing that they might eventually become Parliamentary Secretaries, Ministers, or even the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>It did not enter into the minds of any of the electors&mdash;or at least of very few&mdash;to think that, because of their lack of Irish, Deputies would be debarred from filling any position that this House can offer.  I think that, on the lines indicated by Deputy Seán Brodrick, we ought to be logical.  We ought to make it a necessity for every Deputy, before his election, to have a competent knowledge of Irish; we ought to make it impossible for anybody to be a member of this House unless he possesses a knowledge of Irish.  Then we can, with some degree of common sense, make it a condition that a candidate for any office to be filled in this House must have a knowledge of the Irish language.  Until we arrive at that stage, to my mind it is illogical that any Deputy proposed in this House should be opposed solely for his lack of knowledge of the Irish language.  In this particular case we have a nomination against which we have not had one protest from any side of the House.  On all sides there has been agreement that here we have proposed for the office of Vice-Chair a Deputy who would fill the office with honour to this House, to himself, and to the country, a Deputy who would fill it with particular impartiality.  It has been emphasised over and over again that if there is one Deputy who could fill this position with impartiality, with fairness to everybody in this House, it is the Deputy who has been nominated.  I say that opposition to that nomination, on the part of any Deputy in this House, is opposition to the ordinary elements of common sense.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I have said already most of what I wanted to say on this particular amendment.  Some of us have a particular suspicion of any proposal to acquire land.  Possibly the Minister will assure us that, in this particular instance, there may be no fears about the acquisition of land. Probably not.  In previous legislation in this House in regard to land, we had definite implicit assurances in certain directions that there was no intention to interfere with land.  The assurances were disregarded&mdash;as we argued in the first instance they probably would.  It led to most of us being particularly afraid when there is inserted in any Bill any provision such as there is here giving a board powers such as are given in this Bill.  The Minister proposes, I think, to a certain extent to put a limit to these powers in a further amendment.  I hope the amendment will be sufficiently strong to allay any fears which we have in that regard.</P>

      <P>I do not know if this amendment is being pressed.  We have discussed already the question of compulsory powers of the board in respect to the acquisition of land.  I think if the board finds it necessary to acquire land compulsorily, we cannot limit them in the way suggested in this amendment.  The purposes for which the board might require land are many and varied, but a very large number of them would require much more than this amendment would allow.  If there was a proposal to start a holiday camp, or to provide the usual sporting and other holiday amenities of some resort, land in excess of one rood would be needed. I could not agree to this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 18:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (4) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4) Whenever the board proposes to make an order under this section for the purpose of acquiring any land, and shall have so informed the Irish Land Commission in accordance with the immediately preceding sub-section of this section, it shall be lawful for the board to serve a notice on the owner or occupier or other person having control and management of the land proposed to be acquired informing him of the board's intentions in respect of such land, and thereupon it shall not be lawful for such owner or occupier or other person having control and management of such land to alter the character of such land in any way calculated to lessen its value or suitability for the purposes for which the board proposes to acquire such land without the consent of the <Col N="130" /> board, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, provided that the restriction hereby imposed on such owner, occupier or other person shall not remain in force longer than six months from the date on which the board shall have informed the Irish Land Commission in accordance with the immediately preceding sub-section of this section.</P>
    <P>With the general principle of this section I do not find myself at all in agreement.  It is a departure, I think, from legislative practice to give to a board such as this such wide powers as are proposed here.  Even to allow this to be done with the consent of the Minister does not quite satisfy the objections that can be raised to it. There ought to be in connection with a matter of this kind some association between the Minister and other Ministers connected with lands&mdash;either the Minister for Lands or the Minister for Agriculture.  However, the purpose of this amendment is to ensure that property which is going to be acquired will not be materially altered previous to its acquisition.  It is well known that landmarks and other things of that sort are traditionally sacred, but there might be other amenities in the district, such as trees, etc.  It would be rather a pity if, once it were known that the land was to be acquired, these trees were cut down.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the place will remain as it is on the date on which it is proposed to acquire it until the proceedings for its acquisition are at an end.</P>
    <P>There are various beauty spots and places in the country which are adorned by shrubberies or other things.  It would be rather a pity if, either out of pique, or in order to show that the land was being used for some purpose, such as farming, or something of that sort, there should be a complete change.  For example, in quite a good number of estates throughout the country there are ornamental shrubberies, or belts of trees, which might be an expense rather than an asset.  I do not care what price is paid for the place, but it would be rather a pity, if land were acquired for such purposes as are outlined <Col N="131" /> in other portions of the Bill, that the property which is going to be acquired should undergo a change of character, and it is to preserve that that the amendment is being proposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I can sympathise with the Deputy's intention, but I am not clear that the amendment is, in fact, necessary.  The form of the amendment is rather unusual.  I do not think the power which the amendment proposes to confer has, in fact, been taken in any other statute that I know of.  The logical argument is that any alteration in the character of the land will affect the price of it, and therefore, would not be in the interests of the seller.  Whether that will be so in every case I could not say.  But, as regards the preservation of trees, I should imagine that the powers of the Minister for Agriculture in that regard should be sufficient to prevent the trees being cut.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Not to prevent it, but to impose penalties when they have been cut, which is quite a different thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The law, in fact, prohibits anyone cutting a tree without a permit from the Minister for Agriculture. People do cut trees and incur penalties on that account.  Can we do any more in this Bill than was done under that law?  After all, one would be as effective and as enforceable as the other.  If you put in an amendment saying that people must not cut trees on land about to be sold, they may cut trees and you will get no greater penalties.  I do not see that you will gain much by this.  I am in sympathy with the motive which the Deputy has in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Tourist Board were to step in to purchase some property which was of great scenic value, or had some historic association, which might be destroyed because of certain plans in relation to it, denuded of timber, or otherwise made unsightly, I think we should at least try to ensure that we would get the property in the form that we wanted it.  I do not know that we are, in fact, helping to that end by the <Col N="132" /> amendment.  I think that the biggest inducement to the seller of that land to preserve it, to keep these amenities on it, and to prevent any damage being done, is the fact that it is going to affect the price of it.  If in the end he knows that the land can be acquired compulsorily, that the purchase price will be fixed by an arbitrator in accordance with the provisions of the section, and that arbitrator can take into account loss of timber which had been cut on the land, or any other damage done to it, I think it would not happen.  If the Deputy wants to press the amendment I am prepared to consider it, but I do not think we really gain any substantial value. The only case I can think of is that mentioned by the Deputy, namely, the possibility of land being stripped of timber.  In that case I think that we do not achieve anything by putting in a further prohibition in this Bill when we have the thing prohibited under the existing law, although it may be difficult to enforce.</P>

      <P>When a person is prepared to cut off his nose to spite his face he will not be deterred by the fact that he will incur some extra penalty under the Bill.  If the amendment were inserted we would have to provide for penalties of some kind.  A mere prohibition without penalties would not be effective.  We would have to provide for some punishment to fall on the person concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be possible to do it in a different way.  I do not agree with the section as drawn at all, but let us assume that we are in agreement with it.  The best penalty to impose is, I think, a reduction of a certain percentage in the amount that would be paid.  I do not think that the scheme is a fair or just one.  But assuming it was, the Minister could frame an amendment by which any alteration of an important or fundamental kind would entail a reduction in the price by a certain percentage, according to the alteration which has taken place.  You can simply say that if it is altered the price to be paid will diminish accordingly.  The Minister may not be aware of the fact that shrubberies and trees generally are not an acquisition, ordinarily speaking, to farmers.  They interfere with ploughing, and underneath them there is nearly always drier land and less growth.  When people are criticising farmers sometimes for not paying more attention to trees, they fail to take these things into account.  The board may wish to acquire property that may be wooded or laid out in a manner which would mean expense for the owner rather than being an asset.  I hope the Minister will not come to the conclusion, from what I am saying, that I am trying to depreciate the value of the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My remarks are not to be taken as an indication that he should get less, but he ought to get at least what he paid for it.  It would be a pity in certain cases where there are beautiful <Col N="134" /> amenities or such other dispositions of the land that the owner could come along and quarrel with them.  That interference may in certain cases go so far as to prevent them from acquiring it.  Consequently, the Minister should bear that in mind when he is framing another amendment to deal with it.  If it is thought necessary to have this power then every possible precaution should be taken that what is to be acquired was that which it was the original intention of the board to acquire.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I might say that in nine out of ten cases, or perhaps 99 out of 100 cases, the board when acquiring land or other property will acquire it by agreement.  It is only in the odd case that the power of compulsory acquisition will be availed of. Even in that case, when the board avails of its powers, the price has still to be fixed and, according to the section, that will be fixed by agreement between the board and the owner of the property.  Where no agreement is found possible an arbitrator is appointed to determine what is a fair price for the property.</P>
      <P>In fact, the penalty of a reduction in price would follow automatically from any damage done to the property. From that point of view I do not think it necessary to reply to the points raised.  In the great majority of cases you will have an agreed sale and an agreed price, and in the very small minority of cases a compulsory sale and the arbitrator's price.  The arbitrator can in that case take into account any depreciation.  The board should know that the owners will take great care to point out any deterioration of the property.</P>

In this interview, from every application of Phra's thumbs on the throat of Abraham's son he got a reduction of £5 in the claim against him.

      <P>Are other Government Departments familiar with the provisions of this Bill?  Do they know that this Bill is under consideration by the House?  It is a curious coincidence that at Glendalough at the moment a number of people are vigorously agitated in regard to the decision of the Forestry Department to plant over a right-of-way which has been used by every visitor to Glendalough for years.  I refer to a pathway which everybody who knows Glendalough avails of with a view to seeing the beauties of that locality.  I understand this matter is in a fair way for settlement but it is rather curious that only to-day I had a letter on this subject.  It seems to <Col N="136" /> be an extraordinary decision on the part of the Forestry Department to plant over what I might call a public right-of-way.  It is certainly a pathway which has been used for generations by visitors who frequent the place.</P>

      <P>At the end of the section to add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;The board may accept devises of land or other property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment empowers the board to accept devises of land.  The Minister might say the amendment is not necessary.  My purpose is that it should be known that the board is <Col N="137" /> able, and presumably anxious, to accept devises of land.  I do not know if we have any public-spirited people who would make these devises.  Is it the intention to transfer the Bourn-Vincent Memorial Park to this board?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say that any definite consideration has been given to the future of the Bourn-Vincent Memorial Park.  It is not intended that the board should take over the care of public memorials or national monuments in the same way as the corresponding board in Great Britain does.  This board is mainly for the development of the tourist industry and to help the business.  Quite possibly the functions of the board may be extended to it later, so that the board may discharge the same set of functions as is discharged by a corresponding body in Great Britain in looking after national monuments and acquiring them.  These, however, are matters for the future.  As regards <Col N="138" /> this amendment, it is not necessary. There is nothing in the Bill which prevents the board from acquiring land, and it is not necessary in the section to give them the power to do so.</P>

      <P>The intention is that no place will be allowed to describe itself as a hostel or camp unless it complies with certain conditions.  If it conforms to the conditions it will be on the register. If not, it cannot use that name and will not be registered.  The reason the amendment is necessary is that if it was not inserted, these hostels would be included in another register, the conditions in respect of which prescribe higher standards than those common in hostels.  These youth hostels have adopted Spartan-like standards and it is reasonable that these standards should be less high than those of holiday camps and other hostels.  We propose to establish a separate register, and separate regulations to which they must conform to be registered.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1) (b), line 57, after the word &ldquo;application&rdquo; to add the words &ldquo;or may transfer such application to another register.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The point of this amendment is that it is possible for a premises to apply for registration on the hotel register, the standard of which may not come up to that required by the board for that register, but which may be suitable for registration as a guest house, which is the next lowest category.  At present, the board has only the right either to register, or to refuse to register.

      <P>It is open to an applicant to make a fresh application for the other register.  My objection to the amendment is that an applicant, in certain cases, might resent his application for registration on the hotel register being treated as an application for registration on some other register, say the guest house register, and might find himself registered there, whereas he would prefer to reconsider his position and perhaps make such alterations as would qualify him for registration on the hotel register, or, if he preferred it, to make an application for registration on the other register.  I do not think it makes much practical difference, except that there might be some objection to giving the board power to transfer an application from one register to another.  I think it is better to leave the matter to the applicant. If his application for one register is rejected he can make an application for registration on the other register.</P>

      <P>That is the only difficulty I see, but I think it would be possible to arrange that there will be a certain time within which these things can be done.  The intention is that the register will be published about 1st January, and, as the Bill stands, applications for registration for the ensuing year must be in before the end of October.  We may amend that to give the board power to accept applications a little later, but there will be a period between the date on which the board must have given its decision and the day when the register will actually go to print in which these matters could be dealt with.  If there were any difficulty about that, we could provide for an applicant, whose application for one register had been rejected, being allowed to apply later than the prescribed date for inclusion in the other register.</P>

      <P>The Minister says that if a person applies for a hotel registration and his application is refused, he can then apply for guest house registration, but unless there is some indication given as to the reason for the rejection of the application for hotel registration, it may not be clear that he can do so.  My amendment would overcome that because it gives the board power to transfer an application.  It would get over the other difficulty the Minister mentioned, that the board probably would not begin considering applications until after the closing date, and, if an application for registration is rejected, there is no time to apply for registration on the lower registration.  It seems to me to be reasonable that they should be transferred in this manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider the point of ensuring that there will be no difficulty in a person, whose application for inclusion on the hotel register is rejected, applying in time for inclusion on the other register.  It is not intended that the board should be under a statutory obligation to give reasons for a refusal to register.  In the ordinary course, the board's officers will be able to convey to an applicant the reasons, but to put on the board a statutory obligation might cause difficulty because there may be cases in which it would not be desirable that the board would have to state the reasons for refusal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister suggested that in the case of a person who applied for registration and was refused, there were two ways of mending his hand.  One of these was <Col N="149" /> to mend the hotel, but he will not know how to do it unless he is told what is wrong.  In some cases, it might not be possible because the applicant will not know what is in the mind of the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and the applicant should be told that.  There is another difficulty in my mind. When is the examination of a hotel as to whether it is fit or not to take place?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The board's officers will have the obligation of ensuring not merely that the hotels conform to the standard required for registration, when they apply, but that they maintain that standard throughout the year, and maintain the charges and other conditions which will be set out on their behalf in the published register. A hotel might get a bad reputation for various reasons which would justify its non-inclusion in the register.  It might not be an easy matter to state precisely the grounds on which that conclusion was come to, while, at the same time, it would be quite easy for the management, without any expense or delay, to remedy the situation, or to take such steps in relation to staff or other matters which would be required to remedy the situation to the satisfaction of the board.</P>

      <P>At the same time, I hope the Minister is aware of the difficulty that may be experienced, a difficulty which is parallel with the experience of Land Commission officials, for instance.  It could easily be said by a proprietor of a hotel whose application for registration was rejected: &ldquo;Of course, he stayed in McCarthy's, they gave him a great night and they poisoned his mind against me.&rdquo; That is the case with Land Commission officials and most other <Col N="150" /> officials as we all know.

      <Col N="151" /> I want to get something concrete with regard to the fees to be charged. There is a fee of £2 for the initial registration.

      <P>It is intended that the fee should be only nominal.  My objection to fixing this fee in the Bill is that it will vary according to the nature of the premises registered. Some part of the board's revenue will come from these fees.  We must not lose sight of the fact that it will be one of the sources of revenue, though it will not be very large.  The fees should vary in accordance with the standard of the premises registered. I could not agree to specify the fee in the Bill.</P>

Below them will be guest houses and below the guest houses will be hostels.  It is not proposed to have a flat rate for all but a fee varying according to size, standard and grade of the premises.

      <P>Let us take as an illustration the case of the Aran <Col N="154" /> Islands.  There may be a hotel there of small dimension, perhaps having only ten or 12 rooms, but it may be one of the best hotels in the country. Perhaps it would have to go into the first grade.  Then it would have to pay the same registration fee as a hotel with, say, 200 rooms, which was catering for 100 or 120 visitors.</P>

      <P>Well, I think that this presents many difficulties that will arise in practice.  Let us suppose that the question of the grading of a hotel depends on the number of rooms, plus the condition in which the hotel was kept.  There will be a difficulty there. Take, again, in that connection, the number of small and excellent hotels that we have in this country.  They are first-class hotels, and of a quality that could not be excelled in any country, but it seems to me that because they have not the requisite number of rooms an injustice may be done to such places as I have in mind.  I am sure the Minister himself knows some of the hotels I have in mind.  We all know that there are a number of small, or smallish, hotels that give excellent service. Would there not be a grave injustice done in this case just because they did not have a certain number of rooms?</P>

      <P>I think the Minister should consider the matter of a maximum fee in this connection.  I think that a maximum figure should be fixed.  If, for any reason, you get a board which squanders its money, it is obvious that it is up to the board to recoup its losses by increasing the fee, and it is also obvious that the people concerned must pay the fee if they are to come within the provisions of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) to insert before paragraph (d) two new paragraphs as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(d)  if the board refuses an application for the registration of premises in a register, the proprietor or any person authorised by him in writing, may attend personally before the board and submit evidence in support of his application, and the board may confirm or reverse its original decision, and in case such decision is confirmed, the reason for refusal to register shall be notified to the applicant in writing;</P>
      <P>(e)  there shall be an appeal from any decision of the board made under paragraph (d) hereof to the District Court for the area in which the premises are situate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This section presents a difficulty to me and suggests to me the possibility of grave injustice being done to owners of property.  There is nobody in this world that is not capable of making a <i>bona fide</i> mistake, and, under the Bill, the board will act on the report of the inspector who will have to visit the premises and make an examination. Now, in my opinion, some of these officers may be only part-time members of the board, and they cannot be perambulating around the country, and therefore they will have to go on the reports of the inspectors and, as a result of the report of an inspector, a property may be destroyed.  That inspector may, quite <i>bona fide</i>, come to a wrong conclusion, and I submit that there should be an appeal from a decision of the board, in the case of a refusal of registration, to the District Court for the area concerned.  I do not wish to tie the matter down to the form of appeal, but I think that there should be some machinery of appeal. Take the case of a district justice or a referee.  I think there is an amendment down, in Deputy O'Sullivan's name, with regard to the matter of a referee; but all these amendments are aiming at the same thing, and that is that there should be some appeal court whereby a matter of this kind <Col N="157" /> could be thrashed out before valuable property would be destroyed.  I think, in equity, the Minister should give consideration to this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I knew that this thing would give rise to discussion here, and, at first sight, there appears to be a case for an appeal from the decision of the board.  However, I think that that case disappears when the matter is more closely examined.  May I say that I could not agree to an appeal from the decision of the board to the District Court or to any similar body, because that would mean that there would be no possibility of having uniformity throughout the country.  In such a case, each matter of appeal would depend on the character or the viewpoint of the District Court, or whichever body might be concerned, and if, as I say, we are to get some uniformity of standard, or some common standard, to govern the hotel business throughout this country, I think we must eliminate any appeal to any District Court or any similar local officers of any status.  Another of the suggestion that was made was that there should be an appeal from the decisions of the board to the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  That, I believe, must also be rejected, because it would mean that the Minister would have to duplicate the machinery of the board.  Certainly, he would require some sort of organisation, of a duplicating kind, if he were to fulfil properly the functions of an appeals officer.  A suggestion has also been made for the appointment of an umpire.  That, again, would mean submitting the matter to the opinion of an individual who might not be any wiser than the members of the board.  However, apart from these practical difficulties, I think you would achieve very little, in any case, from an appeal body of that kind.  There are other matters to be considered.  For instance, many of the matters which will determine the fate of the ratification or otherwise of premises will be of a nature that would be very difficult to set out in writing for the purpose of a hearing on appeal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, at any rate, if there is to be an appeal, there must be some marshalling of the evidence submitted to the board, on the second occasion, to whomever constitutes the appeals tribunal.  That may be a matter of form, and there may be the question of cleanliness, general managerial capacity, scale of charges, and so on, to be taken into consideration in connection with what would justify registration. All these things may be of a character which cannot be easily set down, precisely and clearly, so that the board could go to the appeals officer and say: &ldquo;On this ground, that ground and the other ground we reject this appeal.  You must decide whether we have the facts right or not.&rdquo;  I do not think that that can be very well done.  In practice, there will be an appeal.  In practice, there will be an inspectorial staff who will marshal the facts.  They will be responsible for visiting the hotels and investigating complaints about overcharging or complaints of a similar character.  But what we are proposing to provide by amendment of the Bill is that the decision upon the application must be made by the board and not by an officer of the board, so that the board will be, in fact, deciding, in the light of the reports submitted to it by this inspectorial staff and having regard to any representations which the applicant may care to submit.  I think that there are reasonable safeguards against abuse and that nothing we can devise, having regard to the general purpose we have in mind can magnify those safeguards.  Of the various alternative forms of appeal which have been suggested, the only practical one is the setting up of an umpire&mdash;a single individual&mdash;to decide on the grounds set before him and, that being the case, there is likely to be as much dissatisfaction with the decision of that umpire as there would be in the case of a decision by the board as a whole.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not convinced me at all.  The Minister will see the principle involved.  If the section remains in its final form, one of the two parties will be the final arbiter.

Some machinery should be provided for the giving of an appeal.  The provision of machinery presents a difficulty.  I considered all this in the light of experience.  As between the district justice and the Circuit judge, the court of the district justice would, in my opinion, be the more suitable venue for appeals of this kind, because the district justice deals with all licensing applications in his administrative area.  All the district justices in the State have that task and they do it on a common basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>District Justices are dealing annually with licensed property.  That is an important matter, because there is a vested interest in the licence.  The Minister argues as if there were only one means of presenting the facts to the appeal tribunal in these cases.  That is not tenable at all. I ask that the board put in writing the reason why it refused the application. I do not want to treat that as a matter of evidence at all.  The appeal will <Col N="160" /> take place on the question of fact.  The inspector who made the report on which the application for registration was refused will go into the witness box and the applicant can do likewise, so that the District Justice will have all the facts before him.  Assuming that he is not satisfied with the evidence given on any side, I take it that, the hotel being situate in his administrative area, all he would have to do would be to take out his motor car and examine it.  The District Justice would have as much common sense as an inspector of the Tourist Board and he would be able to say whether the bedrooms, laundry, bathrooms, kitchen and so forth were up to such a standard that the hotel should be registered as class 1, 2 or 3.  Surely we could not ask for a more qualified person to deal with these appeals than a District Justice who has to deal with the suitability of dance halls and public houses.  He is an independent man, he is irremovable and he has all the qualifications for the impartial performance of the work.  This matter may require further consideration, but the Bill should not leave the House until some provision of this kind is included in it.  Otherwise, valuable property may be destroyed by the stroke of an inspector's pen.  If the licence be refused, the money which people have invested in the property will be lost and their livelihood will go with it.  That is a serious matter, and I ask the Minister to look into it. It should not be beyond our capacity to provide machinery so that we may obviate even one injustice.  I should rather the Bill would never pass than that an injustice should occur even in a single case.</P>

      <P>I have my name to this amendment and I should like to <Col N="162" /> say a word on the subject.  Under Section 34 of the Bill, it becomes an offence for any hotel-keeper who is not registered to hold himself out as the keeper of a hotel.  Therefore, the question of registration is a very important one.  So far as I can see, if the owner of an existing hotel or a hotel to be built in the future does not obtain registration, or loses registration, he forfeits his property so far as it is of any value.  Apart altogether from the question of the rights the board have as a court of appeal, that is a very drastic thing to happen to any business or concern and I think it is the only case in our series of legislative measures where such drastic action is imposed upon a defaulter without any automatic right to some relief before a court.  I would instance the Housing Acts under which, in a case where a demolition order, a clearance order, is made, there is a right of appeal to the Circuit Court. There are other cases, such as the registration of betting premises and the licensing of public houses.  In any event, I suggest to the Minister that where there is a drastic provision of this kind in a Bill it is desirable that there should be an appeal to some judicial tribunal who can try the matter in the calm atmosphere of a court and hear the evidence both for and against.  The Minister's answer to that is, I gather, that this Bill contemplates a right of appeal to a tribunal, but a non-judicial tribunal, namely, the board itself.  There may be something to be said in favour of that, except that the board itself is an institution which proposes to go into the hotel business.  Consequently, it would be a party to one or other side of the issue which would be involved in such an appeal.  Therefore, first of all, on general grounds, and, secondly because it is contemplated that the board is to have a function which, I submit, should be exercised by the court, I think the Minister should consider the proposition that has been put up in this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to make the position quite clear, it is necessary, I think, to go back to Section 26.  In Section 26 it is proposed that the proprietor of any <Col N="163" /> premises may apply to the board for the registration of those premises.  He is not applying to the inspector.  That is the difference.  Undoubtedly, the board cannot go all over the country and visit every premises.  The inspector is only sent down merely as an officer, an expert witness, or agent of the board, and it is to the board that the application for registration is made. It is the board, and the board alone, who can refuse registration because the Bill does not say that he is to apply to the inspector.  &ldquo;The proprietor of any premises may apply to the board for registration.&rdquo;  That is Section 26.</P>
    <P>Section 27 shows the mode in which the inspection is to be carried out: &ldquo;The board shall cause such premises to be inspected by an officer of the board.&rdquo;  The officer of the board has no right whatsoever to determine whether or not the premises shall be registered.  All the inspector can do is to come back and say, &ldquo;I have inspected these premises.  They are in such a condition.&rdquo;  But the inspector cannot take any decision.  There is only one decision taken in a case of that kind and that is by the board itself, acting on the evidence of its inspector.  There is absolutely no appeal in that case from what has been decided in the first instance.  I strongly press on the Minister to consider the question of an appeal.  It is right, I think, that the hotel-keepers of this country should have that right.  In the constituency which I represent there is a very large number of hotels and a very large number of hotels which will be affected by this particular Bill when it is passed.  It does not seem right that they should be deprived of any part of their right to appeal against what will amount to confiscation of their property.</P>
    <P>We brought forward this amendment having very seriously considered the position and with the knowledge that the people who own these hotels have in the matter.  I would ask the Minister to consider the proposition. It is not brought forward in any sense to interfere with the operation of the <Col N="164" /> Bill or anything like that.  It is purely in order to facilitate it in this respect.</P>

      <P>I would make an earnest appeal to the Minister to give the amendment serious consideration. I take it that the value of many hotel premises throughout Éire would amount to a considerable sum and a faulty inspection or a slight mistake in the inspection might possibly reduce valuable premises to practically nil.  I agree with Deputy McMenamin that we are probably dealing with one of the most serious clauses of the Tourist Bill.  For that reason, I would ask the Minister to consider the question of appointing a court of appeal whether the appeal would be to a District Justice or to a body nominated by the Minister or otherwise.  Certainly, I think provision should be made for appeal from a decision of the board on the question of inspection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see the Minister's difficulty, but I think there is a serious problem involved here. First, I would ask the Minister to let us know how the thing is going to work, as it is in the Bill.  A hotel proprietor applies for registration.  An inspector is sent down.  He reports: &ldquo;Food served in sloppy fashion.  The napery is not clean.  The whole place is dilapidated, ill-kept,&rdquo; and so on. That is the report on which a decision will be taken by the board, is it not? But, in fact, though the inspector does not refuse the licence technically&mdash;it is only the board refuses the licence&mdash;it is really the inspector that refuses the licence because the nature of his report may be such that there is no other option open to the board except to refuse the licence.  I do not see, as the Bill stands at present, how it is going to be remedied.  The board are bound to take the inspector's report.  It is the only evidence they will have before them.  There is an application by an hotel proprietor describing his hotel. There is a report on that, which is quite unfavourable.  That settles the fate of the hotel.  Assuming that there is no influence brought to bear on the board, they must act on that.  As far <Col N="165" /> as I can see, there is no machinery provided in the Bill, even for the board itself to inspect.  In reality, as I said, it will be the inspector who will decide. It cannot be otherwise in the Bill as it stands.  There is no opportunity for representation to be made to the board.  Is not that so?  I see no opportunity in this Bill for the proprietor to make representations to the board against the findings of the inspector. The first thing he knows is the licence is disallowed.  He may not even be given the grounds of the disallowance.</P>
      <P>I see the difficulties.  For instance, on the question of the district justice, I see the difficulties, but for reasons somewhat different from those raised by the Minister.  The district justice may not be an expert in hotels.  I take it for granted that what we really want to do is to see that you have a proper approved list of hotels on the one hand, and on the other that no injustice is done.  How to procure that is the difficulty.  I think this question of the district justice is put forward merely to get the views of the House and of the Minister on the matter.  Any kind of an appeal board that would allow somebody to check the actual finding of facts by the inspector is really what is wanted.  My real objection, if it can be called such, to the district justice would be that he is not a tourist expert.  The Minister says that the five men who are making this decision are experts, and that that is the reason why they are being put on the board. Our contention is that it is not they who really make the decision but the inspector, and, with all respect to the Minister, his decisions can vary as much from district to district, as can the decisions of a district justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder is it uniformity that the Minister is seeking.  If you do want uniformity between different districts I can well imagine that while you may not allow a hotel licence in a certain district, you may allow the same class of establishment to get one in a remote and primitive district.  Hotel requirements in different countries in Europe are very different.  For instance, the requirements of a hotel in certain parts of Paris are very different indeed from <Col N="166" /> the requirements of a hotel in the French Alps, 9,000 feet high.  I do not know that we should seek uniformity. I would press on the Minister the desirability of having some kind of appeal from a man who, after all, is merely an official of the board.  That is the position you have at the moment. While I see the Minister's difficulties, I think that there is a case to be met. The difficulties are on both sides.  There is the desire on the one hand to get a proper register of hotels, and on the other the desire that there should be no justification for the feeling that a man has not been heard.  The Minister objects and asks how there can be an appeal to a district justice since there is nothing down in writing.  Surely, there will be something in writing before the board.  They will decide on something that is before them either from the owner of the hotel or on a report from the inspector.  I presume that he will submit a written report. Therefore, there will be that document to go before the court of appeal.  Personally I would prefer a court of appeal to the district justice because I do not think that district justices, with all their excellent qualities, are&mdash;many of them&mdash;hotel experts necessarily.  I do not know whether Deputy McMenamin thinks that it will be the business of the district justice to go around from &ldquo;pub&rdquo; to &ldquo;pub&rdquo; testing the quality of the stuff sold.  If it were I should say that we would have many vacancies possibly in that very desirable position.</P>
    <P>As regards grading, while it might be possible that you would have very few injustices done in the case of registration, it is a much more delicate thing when you come to deal with the question of grading.  In practice, to allow that to depend, as we are doing, on the report of an official sent down from the board is rather drastic. Again I say that there ought to be some method&mdash;I do not say of upsetting&mdash;but of subjecting to review the decision of the inspector.  It is a good thing that he should know that his judgment will be subject to review by another body.  That, I suggest, will help to make him more careful.  You have, for instance, appeals from the lower courts to the higher courts.  It <Col N="167" /> is not that you get a better decision from the higher court but it is a good thing that the lower court should know that its decision is subject to review by another court.  I think we should act on that principle here.  I should certainly be the last to suggest anything that would prevent the Minister getting a good register of hotels and proper grading, but I think he ought to take care in seeking to achieve his object.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few considerations that Deputies ought to keep in mind.  In the first place, it is not correct to say that there is no precedent for the proposals in the Bill as they stand.  On the contrary, I would say that most of the Acts which have been passed here providing for the registration of premises of one kind or another do not contain appeal provisions.  Probably the reasons which resulted in those Acts being framed without provision for an appeal from the authority which decided on the application for registration were much the same as those which influenced the framers of this particular Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are setting up a board for the purpose of achieving certain changes in relation to the conduct of hotels and similar premises here.  That is the primary function of the board.  It is not being set up for the purpose of irritating hotel-keepers or of depriving them of their livelihood or doing anything of that kind.  Its function is to ensure, in relation to hotels, that the word &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; is used only in connection with premises that conform to certain standards laid down by the board.  I should imagine that the great majority of cases in which applications will be rejected will be in relation to houses which at present apply to themselves the term hotel but which are in no sense hotels&mdash; houses, the proprietors of which would get a fright if they were to be asked to provide accommodation for the night or anything more than to supply a drink or two.  The term &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; is used very frequently in relation to premises of that kind which are not <Col N="168" /> hotels at all, and which should not be classed as hotels: houses which, if they receive guests at all, are only of the guest house standard and, in many cases, are not even up to that standard. In the beginning, I should say that it is only in such cases applications will be rejected.</P>
    <P>The function of the board in relation to hotels is to ensure an improvement in their standards.  The board, in carrying out its functions, will not be looking for an excuse to refuse an application, but rather to ensure, through its officers, such an improvement in the standards and circumstances of individual premises that they will be able to give registration on application. That will be their function. They will not be merely sitting there waiting for an inspector to make a report on the basis of which they could say that the application must be refused.  On the contrary, on the basis of those inspectors' reports they will be endeavouring to secure such an improvement in the standard of accommodation that registration will be possible.  The board will be set up for that purpose.  It will consist of persons who will be chosen because of their suitability to discharge that function.  They will, we hope, be the five most suitable persons in the country for the purposes of that job. They will, in the process of time, acquire experience and knowledge that other persons could not possibly have. We must assume that they will be acting with all fairness, and with due consideration of the interests of all parties likely to be affected by their decision.  In my opinion, the only circumstances under which a case can be made for an appeal from the board is where there is reason to believe or suspect that the board was influenced by considerations other than those which should have been before it; that some undue influence was brought to bear upon it which prompted it to give a decision which was not fair on the facts, a decision which a board seeking to carry out its functions well and truly would not have given.  The possibility that an idea may get abroad that some of its decisions are so influenced <Col N="169" /> is in my opinion the only case for an appeal at all.</P>
    <P>Let us consider what is the case for an appeal and what has been said about it here.  We had Deputy Fred Crowley suggesting the possibility of the board making a decision upon a faulty report from an inspector.  The inspector was misled by surface appearances.  He got the only bad egg in the house, or was bitten by the only flea in the country, or something of that kind, and was so prejudiced against the hotel that he put in an adverse report.  What is the appeal tribunal to do?  Is it to send down another inspector to inspect that hotel?  Is there going to be a complete duplication of the machinery of the board?  Otherwise, what can your appeals officer do?  He will, after all, only get what the board will have, namely whatever information the inspector was able to get, or any other officer of the board dealing with that matter, and whatever representations the applicant desires to submit.  The board will have all that.  Unless you are prepared to advocate duplication of the whole machine, so that the whole process of inspection, examination and decision will be repeated, then there can be no really effective appeal.  What you would be doing is you would be putting over the decision of those five persons, whom you regard as the most effective to deal with the matter, the decisions of other persons who are less competent, a smaller number of persons, perhaps only an individual.  We could perhaps get a person to act on an appeal tribunal in whose judgments we could place confidence, but I think we would have to have one person, and would have to ensure that that one person would himself undertake an inspection of the premises, unless it were generally agreed that an inspection was not necessary.</P>
    <P>We have got to rule out district justices. We have got to rule out people of that kind.  I think we cannot consider them, because they are not suitable for this work.  They neither have the specialised knowledge nor information concerning the policy of the board or the standards of accommodation <Col N="170" /> towards which the board is aiming, and trying to acquire generally throughout the country.  They would be influenced perhaps by other considerations that would not enter into the board's calculations at all.  I have found from experience that, in those matters which are outside the ordinary normal functions of the district courts, district justices do not function well at all; however excellent they may be at the particular jobs to which they are appointed, give them jobs outside that and they do not function well.  In matters of this kind particularly it is only fair to say they would be much too lenient.  They would never refuse an application for registration.  The house would have to be falling down; there should be no roof on it or no bed in it, or some obvious reason of that kind before the district justice would refuse an application.  Every Deputy knows that.  If, however, we are to set up some sort of permanent appeal tribunal, an individual chosen because of his suitability, because of some specialised knowledge or special qualifications he may have, we have got to put that individual in a position in which he can exercise his functions. How can he exercise them?  I do not see how you can make him really effective, a real safeguard to anybody, unless you provide him with a completely independent organisation of his own.  If he does not get that, he is not a safeguard; he is an illusion.  The hotel proprietor who makes an application will be deceived if he thinks there will in fact be any fundamental difference between the decision of the board and the decision of the appeal tribunal.  If the scheme functions rightly the same information should be available to both the board and the tribunal.  The same considerations should influence their decisions, and the same decision would in fact be given.  It would be a waste of time.</P>
    <P>I think also that Deputies have jumped too readily to the conclusion that the board will make its decisions upon a single inspection carried out by one officer.  I should say that would be extremely improper, and if the board were working in that way I should say they were not doing their <Col N="171" /> duty properly.  If they get from an inspector in relation to one hotel a report that they consider justifies the refusal of an application for registration, then I certainly think they should arrange for an independent inspection by another officer, so that they would have a double check on the facts, or perhaps even members of the board themselves would undertake some investigation before arriving at a decision.  I am quite certain that any board which functions properly in this matter will arrange for some system of double check, which will give them some reasonable certainty that their information is right before they make a decision, and I certainly see no reason why they could not entertain any representations that the applicant himself would choose to make.  But if you give them that, if they have their system of check and double check on the facts, and if they consider representations from the applicant, their decision is really the best decision.  The only circumstances under which their decision might have to be revised would be if there was any suspicion that they were being influenced by considerations that should not influence them.  If that suspicion were there, then, in order to remove it, it might be worth while to have some appeal tribunal, but in due course the same suspicion would attach to the appeal tribunal, and the safeguard would be gone.  The only way to get rid of the suspicion is to get rid of the board which allowed that suspicion to grow up around it.  I do not think that will ever happen.  If we have a board which functions properly, a board which is anxious to secure a general improvement of the standard of hotel accommodation, and not to penalise anyone, their decision is likely to be the best decision, and it is an illusion I think that the system will be improved or that any different result will be obtained by setting up an appeal tribunal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not met the point.  What I want is an actual appeal of some kind, or a check, if he likes, of the officer's report. <Col N="172" /> The Minister has not met the point that the fate of the hotel depends on the report of the inspector.  That is all the board has before it.  There is no suggestion in the Bill as it stands that the board themselves will inspect the premises, or that they will send out a senior inspector, if I may so put it. What I want to ensure is that the proper facts come before the board from the inspector.  The Minister assumes that there will be a double check.  That is the first we have heard of it.  It is not provided for.  I prefer something like this if it could be managed: An inspector is sent down, and he sends in his report.  There is a certain number of cases which are marked out for refusal.  Then the board sends a senior inspector around to those particular places.  I think that might meet a certain amount of the objection.  My objection is not at all on the question as to whether the board is or is not influenced.  It is to the fact that in reality the fate of the premises does not depend on the board at all.  It depends on the inspector. Anything that would strengthen the board in getting the full facts is desirable, such as, for instance, in the case of those due for execution that there would be a further inspection before the final decision is taken.  Possibly the Minister might wish to give an assurance in this matter, but I do not know whether that would satisfy those who have moved this amendment or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is really no opportunity for the proprietor to put his case before the board: he cannot meet the charges, because he does not know what the charges are.  It should be possible to arrange to have two reports regarding the premises&mdash;even though it might be inconvenient from certain points of view&mdash;say a report from a junior inspector which would be sent in to the board.  The proprietor would then have a week or a fortnight, during which time he would not know what action would be taken: his fate would still be in the balance.  Then a senior inspector could be sent round, and if there is a real agreement between the two reports there would be a much <Col N="173" /> stronger case on which the board could take action.  I think it is rather hard to leave it to a decision of an ordinary inspector as to whether a man will be allowed to continue his business or, on the other hand, be wiped out of existence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it be a safeguard if we were to provide for some provisional decision of the board, to be intimated to the applicant; and a further inspection of the premises before the provisional decision would be confirmed?  That would be giving the applicant time, and I think we could proceed along those lines.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to draw the Minister's attention to another aspect of this question.  It is presumed that the board will be endeavouring to carry out its functions in the best possible way.  We can take it that the Minister will select the best possible men, and that they will not be expected to achieve standards of uniformity right away.  Probably in the beginning the inspectors will be expected to try to achieve some kind of minimum standard which would be sufficient justification for registration. Even that will take time.  I take it that the inspectors will be friendly enough to help the proprietors to achieve the requisite standard.  But, even when the time is reached when uniformity has been established, it will then be the duty of the inspector to see that the standard is maintained and report back to the board.  I still suggest that it is a very serious position to have any hotel-keeper placed in.  He will have done something to bring his hotel up to a reasonable standard, but he is still open to an adverse report which might be made in the following two years.  In that period there may have been some slight deterioration and&mdash;as the section stands now&mdash;he <Col N="174" /> has no appeal.  In this way, registration is, I think, no less than a misfortune.</P>
      <P>There should be some right of appeal to a court of law.  Notwithstanding what the Minister said about district justices, I think that they would surely have a very good idea of the standards of uniformity which should be attained.  In any case, the hotel-keepers themselves will have to try to maintain a decent standard, because the competition will be keen. Yet, if an inspector comes along and happens to be in a bad mood he may make an adverse report against some individual hotel-keeper and there is no provision for a senior inspector to follow him.  If the board makes adverse decisions, I think the citizen ought to be given a chance to present his case before the local district justice.  Let the inspector come into court and say that certain minimum standards have been established for hotel premises and that this particular man cannot be allowed to continue.  There would then be an opportunity for the proprietor to submit his side of the case and the possibility of an impartial judgment being reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been pointed out, in all the legislation passed in this House the right of appeal has been given to the ordinary citizens where powers have been taken for the demolition of slums and acquiring of ground.  They had the right to go into court and that gave them at least the opportunity to defend themselves; but in this case there is no defence whatever possible. I would suggest further, that a board, no matter how democratic it may be starting off, is later on going to become autocratic and reach the time when they will feel that they are the custodians of the hotel business in this country and they are going to start enforcing their views.  There must be some kind of a brake to that.  Ministers could alleviate a lot of hardship by allowing to the hotel-keeper an appeal on the question of the withdrawal of his registration to the local District Court, where he could present his case and have the satisfaction of knowing that he was not going to conduct his <Col N="175" /> business at the risk of losing it through the action of any individual inspector or of the board.  That would be a protection to the members of the board also, and they would welcome the fact that they could not do autocratic things such as withdrawing a man's registration without justification.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated that a district justice or some other tribunal would have no special qualifications to deal with questions of this kind.  That remark would apply to practically any issue that comes before a court.  There is an appeal under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act against a demolition order.  That appeal is taken direct to the Circuit Court.  The Minister might say that the Circuit Court would have no particular qualifications for dealing with a case of that kind.  Also, in the case of the registration of a club, application has to be submitted to the court, in the first instance, in order to show that the rules are such as to qualify for a licence; and the question of whether a club is fit or not fit to be registered and have a licence is one that the district justice may be called upon to decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the functions of the suggested appellant tribunal, the function would be quite different to the functions of the board.  The first time that the hotel-keeper would have an opportunity of knowing that he has not complied in some respect with some of the regulations which will be formulated under Section 25 of the Bill is when he is told that his premises are not going to be registered.  Until that has happened there is absolutely no issue to be tried.  All that has happened is that, in the opinion of the board of experts&mdash;and I presume they are going to act on the proper basis&mdash; and according to the evidence that has been produced to them by their inspector, in the absence of the hotel-keeper, and acting as assessors of fact, this hotel is not capable of registration. That is the first time the hotel-keeper finds that his property, which was probably worth £2,000 or £3,000 <Col N="176" /> before this action is taken, finds now that its value has gone down to £200 or £300 or whatever the bricks and mortar are worth.  He has got to sit down under that and has no right whatever to appeal against the findings of the board.</P>
    <P>If the Minister accepts our proposal, or a similar proposal, what happens is, that the rules or regulations will be interpreted before a court which is used to trying issues of fact of every character every day.  A court which feels that it is not competent to go into certain technicalities of a particular set of facts must rely on the evidence of expert witnesses.  The issue in this case would be between the decision of the board on the one hand and the plea of the hotel-keeper on the other.  Each side can produce their expert evidence and the simple issue that the court would have to decide would be similar to issues which are being decided every day.  The simple issue would come before the court as to whether or not, on the expert evidence given on both sides, the regulations under Section 25 have been complied with.</P>

      <P>That is where you come up against a difficulty.  It is not always a question of fact.  That is where Deputy Esmonde's trouble is. He sees a certain set of regulations which can be easily interpreted and a question of fact as to whether the hotel fulfils the regulations or not.  It will not be always as simple as that.  The board will be working with a definite policy in view, a policy of raising the standard of hotel accommodation here, and of determining whether certain hotels conform to their standard or not.  The district justice, so far as the law is concerned, will not merely have to decide whether the particular hotel conforms to the standard which the the board are trying to achieve, but he will have to decide whether he approves of the board's standard at all. You cannot set up a standard in a Bill. The board cannot put that in a legal formula.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is something more than that.  The district justice will say to the applicant: &ldquo;You are not doing too well, but we know that you will do better by this time next year and we will give you another chance.&rdquo;  He will always say that, and everybody knows it.  If we are going to have this machinery in the board I think we can eliminate the one real danger which has been adverted to and really that is that the board may make a decision on inadequate or incorrect evidence or evidence which is unfair to the applicant.  We can prevent that I think even by an amendment of the Bill which will ensure, first of all, that there must be a dual consideration of the position by the board, notification to the applicant, and dual inspection. I ask Deputies to keep in mind that <Col N="178" /> the big problem will arise only once, and that is when all these hotels come to apply for registration the first time. After that there will be new applications only from new hotels which will not be very frequent.  It will be a question of re-registration and that will depend, not on a single inspection, but on a whole year's experience, and may be influenced by quite a number of factors apart from the report of the inspector.  In the case of the first applications for registration and the preparation of the first register, it is reasonable to suppose that the standard required for registration will be somewhat lower than will ultimately be aimed at by the board, because their inclination will clearly be to get a register prepared, to get on the register hotels which have undertaken to conform to the regulations, and then to proceed from that basis onwards.  If Deputies think the suggestion will meet their main objections in the matter, I will see what I can produce by way of amendment to the Bill.</P>

I think that inevitably that is the type of organisation will be there and that you will get that double inspection and double check.  I am prepared to put all that in the Bill and make it a statutory obligation on the board.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), line 28, to delete the words &ldquo;or with the consent of the board in the month of November,&rdquo; and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;or at any time, if it can be proved to the satisfaction of the board that death, illness, or other unforeseen circumstances, prevented the application being made within the prescribed time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I put down this amendment because circumstances are likely to arise, such as a death or sickness in a family, in which, through an oversight, application for renewal of registration might not be made in time.  In view of the value of some of the property involved in these cases, it would be a grave injustice if, owing to an oversight, the registration was not renewed.</P>

That is the furthest you can go.  At the end of November you must stop anyhow. It only means that the proprietor of a <Col N="181" /> hotel who has failed to apply for re-registration will have to apply on the basis of a new application after that date.  He cannot be in the published register, because the register must be prepared at some stage, and it must be about that period.  There will be no substantial difference in the fee.  It is not enough to impose a hardship.</P>

      <P>What the section provides for is this: that in the case of an application for re-registration the board may refuse that application if it is clear that the hotel proprietor has failed to adhere to the list of charges which he undertook to make.  What the Deputy wants is to insert the words &ldquo;knowingly and persistently&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;failed.&rdquo;  What the Deputy suggests is that we should be satisfied that the hotel proprietor &ldquo;persistently and knowingly&rdquo; failed; that he never charged what he undertook to charge. I should say that he &ldquo;persistently&rdquo; failed if he habitually charged a higher price than the prices he submitted.  I think the Deputy may take it that the board will not refuse an application because of one isolated instance, one customer charged too much at one time, but if there is evidence that the proprietor has been fleecing the tourists that is another matter.  The board would not refuse the application unless that has been the regular practice on the part of the hotel proprietor.</P>

It is inconceivable that that will happen.  But if there is evidence that in a number of cases the charges which the proprietor undertook to observe and which he set out, are departed from and that a soft looking tourist was fleeced, then for that or for some other reason the board should have this power to refuse re-registration.</P>

    <P>Exporters are definitely instructed that the values in their declarations furnished to customs must represent only the cost, insurance and freight to the sea or land frontier of this country and must not include the value of any bounty or subsidy.  Every effort was made by examination and inquiry to eliminate the effect of such inclusion, which may have been made especially in the earlier of the years referred to, and it is considered that the extent of error in the statistics on the account is negligibly small.</P>
