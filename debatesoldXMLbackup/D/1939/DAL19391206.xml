      <P>A statement which will be circulated gives the estimated number of men employed on rotational schemes for each week from 1st January, 1939, to the latest date for which returns are available, viz., 25th November, 1939; the statement also shows the percentage of such workmen in respect of whom (1) national health insurance cards, and (2) unemployment insurance cards were stamped.  Without an examination of the wages sheets for some 4,000 separate schemes it would not be possible to state the average daily rate of wages paid; but the rates vary from 4/6 to 11/4 per day according to the class of work and the locality in which it is being performed. <Col N="974" /> The following table gives the particulars requested:&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would refer to the reply given on May 9th last to the Deputy's question on the same subject. The invitation, then mentioned, to the local authorities to re-open discussions was duly issued by my Department but <Col N="979" /> no further progress has been made regarding the financing of the scheme. I am accordingly not in a position to indicate if or when the project will be carried out.  As regards the second part of the question, until the conditions on which the project will proceed have been settled and a decision made on the most suitable site, no proposals to acquire land can be made by me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the question refers to the proportions in which industrial alcohol and petrol are blended.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce has power under the Industrial Alcohol Act, 1938, to make regulations in relation to the blending by distributors of industrial alcohol and mineral hydrocarbon light oils for the purpose of producing motor fuel therefrom. No such regulations have so far been made and I am not therefore in a position to say in what proportions the two fuels are in fact blended.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that there is a huge surplus of home grown onions in the Counties of Cork and Kerry; that growers are unable to dispose of their crop even at very low prices; that a big bulk of those onions will be deteriorating very soon; and, if so, if he will take immediate steps to endeavour to find an export market for this surplus still left on the hands of the growers.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Considerable quantities of onions still remain in the Castlegregory area of County Kerry, but practically the entire crop has been absorbed in most other areas including West Cork.</P>
      <P>My information is that, generally speaking, the Castlegregory crop has been safely stored and that the crop has kept remarkably well, the proportion of diseased bulbs being relatively small.  Owing to available local supplies in the neighbourhood of the larger consuming centres, demand in Castlegregory and the more remote growing centres has been slow, but sales are now taking place and it is hoped that the entire crop will be duly disposed of.</P>
      <P>As regards an export trade, I am informed that the price of imported continental onions on the United Kingdom markets is such as having regard to transport and other charges involved, would not represent a price at all attractive to our growers.  I am keeping the position under frequent review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, I am afraid I have to disagree with him with regard to the statement that most of the County Cork onions have been sold.  In the area where I live numbers of cottiers have been unable to find a market for their crop, and the onions are going waste, as those people have no convenient place for storage; they have not the accommodation.  After the encouragement his Department has given to growers.  I think it is a pity&mdash; if my information is correct&mdash;that a big lot of continental onions should have been allowed in just before the period of control.  I am afraid the position is very serious, and that the Minister should take a little more <Col N="987" /> interest in the matter, so that if possible these people who have no storage accommodation would receive a price which would be remunerative.</P>

We would be sitting at 10.30 on Friday morning but for the fact that it is a holyday of obligation, and therefore the House does not sit at all.

Perhaps <Col N="991" /> what the Deputy said is true, that more business might be done in the early afternoon than in the later afternoon or going on towards midnight.  At the same time, I think the proposal made by the Minister ought to be accepted.

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>At the close of yesterday's sitting I admitted that there was room for a reform in local government, but I pointed out that the way to reform it was not along the lines proposed by the Government&mdash;that there was no need to abolish it.  I also pointed out the inconsistency of the Government when, some four or five years ago, they passed legislation extending the franchise in order, as they said, to make local government more democratic.  Now they are proposing to withdraw the powers that <Col N="992" /> the local authorities have.  While they propose those drastic changes, the Minister does not give any reason for so doing.  He expressed some concern for the members of local authorities who have to travel long distances.  If they are prepared to travel long distances, in order to take an interest in local affairs and see how the money that is subscribed by the people is expended, that is their business and it shows a good public spirit.</P>
      <P>There is one thing in this Bill that I agree with, and that is the abolition of the boards of health.  Supporters of this Bill have referred to the long agenda of different boards of health. I have had ten years' experience of board of health work, and I quite agree that there are many items appearing on the board of health agenda which are nothing more than routine office work and should be disposed of by the secretary.  If the Minister has at the back of his mind the inefficiency of local authorities, the corruption of local authorities, I can assure him there is very little room for anything of that sort.  Anything that really matters in the way of local administration has to be sanctioned by the Department, and the tendency in the Local Government Department in recent years has been to exercise very stringent supervision over the matters for which its sanction is required.  In regard to many matters, I might say that it does not display such a complete superiority of intelligence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What case has been made for restricting the powers of local authorities? The Minister knows very well that a budget is prepared annually by the local authority and it gets considerable scrutiny.  The various interests represented on the local authorities examine it from their particular angles; some are anxious for small expenditure and some want large expenditure, and the mean is struck by the representatives of the people.  With regard to the money that is earmarked for various works, in the case of county councils, the county surveyors become the administrative technical officers.  The county medical officers of health have their own duties to perform, but, in <Col N="993" /> the case of various works, the county surveyor will be given control, as he has been in the past, of whatever money is carmarked for those works.</P>
    <P>There are very stringent regulations respecting the expenditure of the money.  The money will have to be used for those works and it cannot go astray.  In order to change expenditure from one work to another, I think it requires the sanction of the Minister for Local Government.  In those circumstances, I do not see that there is much room for corruption.  Then, again, all the expenditure has to be audited. Not only are the accounts audited, but the authority for doing various works is inspected.  In recent years the auditors have been examining into technical matters.  I am not raising any point on that.  The point I want to make is that the work of local authorities is under very efficient supervision, and I cannot see any reason for curtailing their powers.  If they have too much to do, take the relief of unemployment from them.</P>
    <P>The county councils and the boards of health will be combined in the future and I ask you to allow them to carry on the ordinary business of the county.  Where you desire to relieve unemployment by the giving of grants, set up your own machinery from headquarters to do that.  I think if you ask county surveyors&mdash;I believe this was the decision arrived at by county surveyors at one of their meetings; I think the Minister for Local Government is always aware of those meetings; I do not know if he attends the meetings, but he certainly attends the subsequent functions&mdash;whether they would like the unemployment grants not to be given to them for work in their counties, they would reply that the average county surveyor would prefer not to be called upon to dilute his labour and to be allowed to carry out county works in the ordinary way. I believe that it would make for efficiency and economy if the county surveyors and the county councils were left to carry out their work in a business-like way, and any relief schemes that are necessary in connection with unemployment should be carried out <Col N="994" /> by the Department of Industry and Commerce, the Department of Local Government, or some other Department, which would set up its own machinery.</P>
    <P>It is not fair to the local authorities to say that they have too much work when this extra work and work that does not belong to the functions of local government is piled on to them. Then they are accused of having too much to do.  I would like, when the Minister is replying, that he would make a case for the abolition of the councils.  There is one point in this Bill which surprises me and that is that dual authority was ever set up in it.  I have long come to the conclusion that all county services should be run by one authority with certain branches made features of the county services. For instance, now we have in each county a committee for dealing with agriculture.  There is no reason why that should be an independent authority.  What results from it is the duplicating of offices and the duplicating of expenditure over the area.  That expenditure is unwarranted by results.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the question that the Minister should consider is this:&mdash; this is a democratic county and it is very dangerous in a democratic country or otherwise to suppress public opinion.  Many people have grievances, very often more imaginary than real and it would be a very useful matter socially that the public who pay their money to keep the services going should be given a voice in the administration of their own money.  If people are denied that voice they will nurse grievances.  I have not the least doubt that the time will come in the near future when an opportunity must be given to the people who pay, to have representation.  In this Bill all the power that is given to the local representatives is to provide the money. That is all the power of any substance that they get.  The spending of that money will be entirely in the manager's hands.  Reference has been made to existing managers and a tribute paid to them.  It is easier to get one or two or three good managers than to get <Col N="995" /> 30 or 40 managers.  I think the Minister will find a difficulty in getting managers for all the vacancies he is creating.  He will find a difficulty in getting managers of the standard that we have to-day.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the City of Dublin and we were told how efficiently it has been run under managers. There are critics of the managerial system in the Dublin Corporation. There are Deputies of this House who have not criticised this Bill and I am afraid that they will not criticise it here.  But they will criticise it in the Dublin Corporation.

      <P>I voted for it there when it came to a vote and I would vote for it again because you must get into your minds what local government in the City of Dublin is.  We have to assess and collect something like £2,000,000 in rates.  Business people cannot afford the time necessary to administer efficiently a big problem like that.  That is my view.  The attempt that was made by the previous Government to give the business element direct representation on the Dublin City Council was repealed by the present Government.  They had certain opinions four or five years ago but they seem to have changed them now.  As regards the local authorities outside the City of Dublin, I think it is a terrible mistake to divorce administration from the people's representatives. Surely anything that is wrong can be remedied.  Is the franchise too wide or is the ability of those who go up for election and get elected not sufficient for the work they have to do and the responsibility with which they are entrusted?  In that case cannot the Government set up some qualification standard?  Let that standard be educational, property or anything you like, but leave with the local authority the power that it has.  Cannot the <Col N="996" /> Minister face up to that situation?  I would prefer to see an educational test, a property test, an experience test or anything you like.  I would be prepared to have those tests if a case is made that the proper material is not elected to man those local bodies.  If the proper material is not elected, then improve the machinery and get the proper material or otherwise come here and confess that the ordinary people in this country who have to subscribe the money to run the local bodies are not sufficiently trustworthy to elect the proper material to do so.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will admit that in this House when the whip is cracked but he will not outside.  The Bill covers Cork as well as Dublin and I do not think we will have a rebel from rebel Cork in Rebel Corry on this occasion whoever else may rebel.  I merely say that in passing without any offence to Deputy Corry.  I would be glad to hear a case made that, for any of the reasons I have quoted, we on the local authorities are not competent to administer local government. If that is so, then let machinery be set up to secure that competent people be elected.  First of all let us have the common ground that the power must be vested in the local authority to administer our local government business with the best machinery we can get.  If that machinery is not there set up machinery for it.  If we do not do that we have to confess that we are an incompetent lot and everything that the British said for years about our being unfit for self-government and unfit to control our own affairs, will have to be admitted.  Even though the British themselves trusted us with <Col N="997" /> the Local Government Act of 1898 to administer the local government, our own Government, notwithstanding, says: &ldquo;we cannot trust these fellows.&rdquo;  I would like the Minister to make a case on those lines.  It is a great matter nationally to be training people for Government.  Of course some people will say that every man who is elected on the local authority has visions of the Dáil.  Why should he not if he wants it?  I am sure I could get a business man to administer local government in the country and to teach the majority of this House.  Be that as it may.  Is it not a great thing to be training our people for responsibility? I do not understand how anybody who has touched politics or government or administration in this country since the Treaty has a different sense of responsibility to what he had previously.  Before that it was easy to agitate and hound down the other fellow but it takes a different mentality and a different effort to build up.  If you want to steady a man give him responsibility; if you want to unsteady him and make a rebel of him, take the responsibility from him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that any case has been made for this.  I am prepared to admit, after 15 or 20 years in local government administration in Dublin City and County, that it is very easy to make a case for reform; in fact it is sticking out that you want reform.  After all, this local government administration which we have here is 40 years old.  It is taxed beyond capacity, because it is doing a bigger job that it was ever intended to do.  It is time for reform, not by taking away the power from local authorities, but by enabling them with the same power to do the extra work; and if there is too much, take it from them.  The Government should be very careful, when we are only learning to keep the peace after a revolution, not to give any excuse to any revolutionary elements to fan the smouldering embers that we must admit are still there.  There is no way you will keep down revolution and keep down cranks better than to give them an opportunity of a free platform, give them the opportunity of managing their own affairs.  Who has a better right <Col N="998" /> to have a voice in the administration of the money than the man who pays? Four or five years ago the Government gave every adult of 21 years of age and upwards a vote for local authorities.  That was never contemplated in local government in this country.  In order to swell their chests and to be ultra-democratic, they passed this Act giving everybody of 21 and over a vote, but they never put it to the test.  Surely they did not extend the franchise four or five years ago with this in their minds?  I am satisfied they did not.  What has changed their minds?</P>
    <P>I think it is only fair to the House and the country that the Government should make a case for taking this authority away.  If it is too soon to give responsibility to those young voters coming into manhood and womanhood at the age of 21 and coming on the register, and if it is inequitable to give it to them when they are not direct contributors to the local rates, then say so.  If a person who is not contributing much to the local rates should not have a vote, say so. Even if it were necessary to go as far as having some educational standard or some property test of £20 or £30 valuation, make a case for that if you can; but leave the local authorities the power to administer.  I am not advocating that you should go on those lines.  I have to be exploring and groping around in the dark to know what the fault is.  I know there has been corruption in local authorities but one swallow does not make a summer.  If there is corruption, it is not unknown to local authorities.  I know of a classical case of corruption in the County Dublin which the Dublin County Council put up to the Ministry for a sworn inquiry during the last few years and they would not hold it.  Coaches and fours, even omnibuses, were driven through an Act of Parliament and a considerable amount of public money was involved.  That case was put up to the Minister for Local Government, but he would not hold an inquiry.  I am not going to censure him for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>My censure would not be weighty enough; otherwise perhaps I would.  The Local Government Department had no answer to that case.  If the Local Government Department have a case put up to them to hold a sworn inquiry where there has been obviously some degree of corruption, is it not cheek for them to come in here and say that the local authority that put up that case must be abolished?  Why did not the authorities in the Custom House do their job? Where was the corruption then?  By implication it was in the Local Government Department; but I do not suggest that for any consideration they failed in their duty.  But when that case was brought home to them they should have investigated it.  If there is any case to be made with reference to corruption in local authorities why not make it?</P>
      <P>The Minister for Local Government in his quiet, shrewd, unenthusiastic way introduced this Bill.  I do not think he liked the job; I do not think that he is convinced himself that there is a necessity for it beyond a necessity for some reform.  Even though he has been only a short time in the Department of Local Government, his experience in the Government and as a lawyer in the country generally, I am sure, leads him to the conclusion that reform is necessary. The system has outgrown its usefulness after 40 years and wants reform, but it does not want abolition. I think I have put enough queries to the Minister and I hope he will apply himself to answering them.  I appeal to him not to push this Bill through a Second Reading.  We have had enough of commissions in this country and I do not relish having any more, but I shall vote for the Labour Party's amendment. It is not the best amendment possible, but it is the only alternative that I have to fall back upon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister wants information upon the matter, why not ask the local authorities (1) if, in their opinion, there is any need for reform of local government, and, if the answer is &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;; (2) let us have your suggestions as to <Col N="1000" /> how that should be brought about.  The local authorities of which I am a member would, I am sure, say that there is need for reform and would be prepared to give the benefit of their experience to the Minister as to how that should be brought about.  In conclusion, I appeal to the Minister to withdraw the Bill until he gets the opinion of the people who have experience of local government.  When he has got that opinion, I think he will change the Bill. If he sets about reform, the form I suggest would be to devise machinery around this principle; that the power must remain vested in the local authorities, but safeguard the public interest by having the local government system proof against any corruption or abuse so far as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>When one examines this Bill he is reminded to some extent of the conduct of a business concern. Having read the Bill thoroughly, I could not help comparing local government as it exists to-day with the situation which you would have if you can imagine a very large chain store, with branches throughout the country, being conducted, not through the administration of a general manager, but through the same type of machinery as the present type of local government machinery.  To go further into the matter, I have read many hundreds of pages of minutes of county council meetings and board of health meetings and I became more convinced than ever that the complexity of local government, the number of items on the agenda, the number of matters to be dealt with, the huge sums of money involved, make such machinery totally ineffective from a purely businesslike standard, the standard of spending money in a discriminating way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you asked any business executive who was accustomed to deal with large sums of money and who had a number of branches of his organisation to deal with, where there were interests in his organisation each of which was demanding the right to use sums of money from the central fund, and each of which had a vested interest in obtaining as large an amount as possible from the central fund of that <Col N="1001" /> organisation.  I defy him to say he would not require a very drastic overhaul in the present type of machinery. In my opinion, the chief thing local authorities suffer from is a lack of discrimination both in the spending of the money they obtain from the rates and on the striking of the rate.  As I see it, the effect of the County Management Bill will be to pre-digest, for the benefit of county councillors, all the information they require to enable them to discriminate far more successfully and far more efficiently than heretofore as to how they should spend the rate which they will still have the right to strike.</P>
    <P>We have heard remarks in this House which would suggest that county councils were being abolished.  In my opinion, they will, under the County Management Bill, have a far more valuable faculty than they heretofore had. They will have the faculty of being presented with the accounts of their unit in a form which they can understand and in a form in which they will see not only the parts but the whole.  They will have time to consider more carefully than before and to give more thought to the question as to how they are going to spend the ratepayers' money and, when the rate is struck, for the remainder of the year they will be able to exercise their faculty of criticism instead of having each county councillor endeavouring to secure a larger portion of the grants for his own area.</P>
    <P>Having read the minutes of a county council meeting, I cannot conceive any business man refusing to advocate a drastic change in the whole question of county council finance.  With the enormous mass of detailed matter, the enormous number of small sums the spending of which is advocated by this and that county councillor and the piling up of business as the months go by, nobody&mdash;not even a person with the brains of Henry Ford&mdash;could possibly conduct the business properly.  That is not the fault of the county councillors. Many of them have not had the training for such functions.  Very few men in this country could have a training which would enable them to digest so much information and understand it as <Col N="1002" /> a whole.  I think that the change advocated in this County Management Bill is quite essential.  To mention a few of the abuses that have arisen under the present local government system, in spite of the efforts of the Department of Local Government, I would say that there was a considerable amount of unfairness in the allocation of cottages.  I have myself seen very grave evidence of that.  The Department did their best to correct many of the abuses, but owing to the fact that every county councillor is, quite naturally, working for his particular supporters, people get cottages who should not get them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>When we come to the question of the financing of all sorts of local government schemes, I must speak strongly about the infernal delay in making decisions&mdash;which is costing local authorities thousands and thousands of pounds&mdash;and the delay in completing housing contracts undertaken by county councils, solely caused by the influence of individual councillors.  If the losses occasioned by these delays, including the amount of interest involved, were to be spent in one year in subsidising fertilisers for farmers, see what an improvement in farming production would be effected.  The figures I examined for certain counties ran into thousands and thousands of pounds in a period of four or five years.  I do not blame anybody in particular.  I say the system is to blame.  The delay in such matters as housing contracts, in respect of the work of local contractors in completing their contracts, in deciding what sites are available, in purchasing sites and in this correspondence between the Local Government Department and county councils costs money. <Col N="1003" /> Having regard to the enormous burden of central taxation, that is the sort of thing the people of this country ought not to be asked to pay.</P>
      <P>Take the question of road work.  I had occasion to talk to a supporter of the Fianna Fáil Party and he said that sometimes it made him sick to see his son idling by the roadside in front of his own house when he had to pay rates for that idling.  That was, perhaps, rather a cynical thing to say, but the fact remains that, when you have so many county councillors in an area, each one of them has to use his mind in two ways.  He has to consider how much he can extract from the central body for his own purposes, for his own friends and for his own supporters. At the same time, he has to see whether or not the rates can be kept within bounds, having regard to the capacity of the ratepayers to pay.  It is impossible for him to resist the kind of pressure which is put upon him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>
      <P>None of these councillors are in the least corrupt.  They are simply unable, in present circumstances, having regard to the amount of work available and the number of grants available, to exercise discrimination. If we are to conduct our business in this House in the same manner; if you can imagine the central Government operating in the same way; if we had to read the same minutes and if we had the same methods regarding the expenditure of money, we would be in the same position as the councils.  I do not say that we are perfect but our information is pre-digested for us by the Departments and we are enabled to sit around a table and exercise power of correct judgment.  Once again, I am not blaming any county councillor.  I am merely stating the effects of the situation in my capacity not only as a T.D. but as a businessman having experience of large-scale organisation.  In other cases, one finds in certain cases groups of county councillors holding up orders made by the Department of Local <Col N="1004" /> Government and the Department have no choice but to take extreme measures in order to get some simple act carried out.  In one case of which I am aware, it was requested that a certain thing should be done.  I shall not give details because people would know the case and it might lead to controversy.  A certain thing was ordered to be done by the Department. It was not a thing of great importance but it would be of value to the people of a certain locality.  The local authority refused to do that.  The Department has no choice but to dissolve that local authority.  They do not want to do that because the thing in itself is not sufficiently important. If you examine these things, you will see the necessity for greater centralisation of administration.</P>
      <P>Again, on the question of road contracts, I mentioned the distress occasioned to a constituent of mine in seeing men obviously not doing the day's work for which they were paid wages, including a member of his own family.</P>

      <P>The county surveyor is brought under considerable pressure by the local council.  The county surveyor is impressed by this and that county councillor that he must keep in employment this or that man on this or that account, whether the man is efficient or not.  I myself question whether or not the money we spend on the roads&mdash;the same question that affects the central Government&mdash;could not at present be more usefully spent by farmers in giving employment and increasing production.  I see throughout the country local roads being mended alongside farms of quite good valuation at a time when these men should be in the fields.  I say that there again the pressure brought by county councillors to provide work and their natural desire to secure cash for their supporters when all the time they should be considering the total amount of rates, the extent to which that amount of rates bears upon those who have to pay the rates, and the extent <Col N="1005" /> to which those people could give employment if they had that money in their pockets.  If we allow the increase of local expenditure to continue at the present rate of increase, just the same as if we allow such an increase of central expenditure to continue, we shall not be able to carry out what is at present so necessary, and that is an increase in our agricultural production.</P>
      <P>Now, let no one suggest that I have made any unfair, undesirable or unjustifiable reflections on the county councils.  I am merely saying that I would be in the same position if I had to contribute to local administration as it is under the present system.  I fully believe that this Bill will go far towards eliminating these undesirable things if we can only find efficient secretaries, men of integrity, efficiency, and of independent minds, and men who can make decisions of their own, and I cannot believe that in this whole country we cannot find a sufficient number of secretaries of that kind to carry out that work properly.</P>

      <P>In the light of that statement, I have no hesitation in withdrawing it&mdash;none whatever&mdash;and I hope Deputy O'Rourke will repeat his denial and my withdrawal in our native county.  Now, I listened with intense interest to the statement made by Deputy Childers.  Of course, he will be misrepresented.  He will be described as defaming the personal honour of every public representative in this country, but 85 per cent. of what Deputy Childers said is perfectly true.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the other 15 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that part of what he said was a justifiable misrepresentation <Col N="1009" /> arising from inexperience in the matters to which the Deputy referred, but I believe that 85 per cent. of what he said is true.  However, if he imagines that that is going to protect him from vile abuse and unscrupulous misrepresentation, he never made a greater mistake in his life, because it will not protect him.  Of course, a great part of the administrative work of the local authorities is seriously impeded by the intervention of individual councillors in work which really ought to have nothing to do with them. I believe that there is on the Roscommon County Council's minute book an order requiring gangers to consult the local councillor before employing a man, or certainly authorising the local councillor to wrangle with the gangers as to what men they should employ; and you can see all the boys on the Government side of the House chortle with joy, and they think that that is swell.  Why should they not think so? What are they on the county council for?  How would they ever get on it if they did not do that kind of thing?  It simply does not make sense to them to be on the county council merely for the purpose of discharging public business and then going home to attend to their own business.  God be with the glorious days when we were told by the Fianna Fáil organisation that the remedy for any unsatisfactory conditions in the public administration in rural Ireland was to extend the franchise to every man over 21, and the pure influx of enthusiastic young Fianna Fáil would clean up the Augean stable of the Cumann na nGaedheal organisation.  But five years after the pure influx of Fianna Fáil into the local authorities we have a County Management Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Thanks be to God this time you learned sense before the damage was done.  Four years ago if anyone suggested that, after having extended the franchise on a universal basis, you would bring in a Managerial <Col N="1010" /> Bill immediately afterwards, the whole Fianna Fáil Party would have fainted away in sickened horror, but they have now made up their minds that a Managerial Bill is badly wanted, and of course it is.  I was on a board of health in Roscommon, and I got off it. I got off it for the simple reason that I regarded it as a fraud to pretend to the people of Roscommon that I was looking after their interests on the board of health, because I could not do it, and Solomon in all his glory could not do it.  We used to start business at 12 o'clock in the morning; at 8 o'clock at night we were still going strong, and half the agenda had not been dealt with.  The end of the proceedings used to be that the whole business of the board of health was divided up amongst the several councillors, one man doing one bit, and another man doing another bit, and we got out about 9 o'clock at night, until eventually there arose among that body, as among other similar bodies, the feeling that if a councillor from the north of the county interested himself in a public health problem affecting the south of the county there was angry indignation, and the councillor was asked: &ldquo;What business is it of yours?&rdquo; It became the assumed thing that you should sub-divide the board of health up into small sub-committees consisting of local councillors who would deal with the local districts from which they came.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody could do the work of the boards of health now, and the reason is perfectly simple, because since 1899, when local government was first instituted in this country, and even since 1925, when the last Local Government Bill was passed, the complexity of local government has grown out of all bounds.  The additional work of a routine character that is being thrown upon those bodies makes it absolutely impossible for any committee to discharge their duties, unless they are in a position to meet once or twice a week.  You cannot ask men who have got their ordinary business to attend to, to travel 30 or 40 miles to a board of health meeting once or twice a week. As it is, the Roscommon Board of Health meets twice a month, and that <Col N="1011" /> is far beyond what is a reasonable demand upon the average farmer or business man in rural Ireland.  I am amused at the angry wrath of Deputy the Chairman of the Roscommon County Council in this House.  I am also amused at Deputy Childers' optimism that the Department of Local Government and Public Health is going to act as a kind of Augean stable cleaner.  I hope the Parliamentary Secretary has not developed the thin skin which Deputy O'Rourke has got.  I suppose there is no more astute manæuvrer in local government in this country than the Parliamentary Secretary.  I do not think he would get offended if I said there is not a more skilful &ldquo;jobber&rdquo; in Ireland than the Parliamentary Secretary.  His name is notorious from one end of Monaghan to the other.</P>

      <P>Wait a minute. Deputies know perfectly well that the system on which boards of health work frequently makes it impossible for secretaries to do their work efficiently, because everything has to be brought before the board of health and approved by resolution.  You will get sheaves of stuff gathering in baskets waiting for the monthly meeting of the board of health before the secretary can move hand or foot.  I think probably the truth is that if this Bill were discussed calmly we would find there was very little difference between us, except that some Deputies want to go on calling the manager &ldquo;the secretary&rdquo;, and other Deputies want to call the secretary &ldquo;the manager&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>We will take them off. Our attitude is that each Deputy must speak from his own personal local experience, contribute his measure of advice to the House, and then act according to his own views.  I think it is true to say that this is a Bill which the county councillors do not like and the ratepayers do like.  I think it is true that there are Deputies in this House who have given long years of their lives to conscientious public administration, and who are intimately associated with <Col N="1014" /> the works of well-run county councils; they feel there is no necessity for this Bill and that they ought to be allowed to carry on.  I have great sympathy with them.  Just as in the old landlord days there were some excellent landlords, most conscientious men, but the abuses created by the bad landlords were so bad that you had to abolish the system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not.  There were decent landlords, men who went a long way towards ruining themselves in order to assist their tenants.  But the inefficient county councils and the inefficient boards of health can create such abuses in their particular areas that, despite the fact that the well-run county councils and boards of health are valuable bodies, their continued existence in their present form cannot be allowed.  That is not to say that local administration ought to be abolished, or that the county councils are to be done away with.  Not at all; but there will be rightly imposed on all county councils a degree of management analogous to that at present in operation in Cork and Dublin, in the full knowledge that it is supererogation, it is unnecessary, in respect of certain councils, but that it is necessary and good in respect of very many others.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErskineHamiltonChild" hpid="Mr. Childers Mr. Childers">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Childers</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, he has not.  The Deputy is perfectly right.  I saw a bachelor who was given a cottage when there was a man with a wife and five children waiting to get one.  But that is not to say that the majority of cottages were so allocated.  The majority of the cottages were properly allocated.  I am glad to say that in any case where the Department of Local Government could intervence, in respect of the new cottages, they did intervene and they quashed such allocations.  But where you were dealing with the old cottages, where there was no appeal to the Department of Local Government, some of the allocations were a public scandal.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy want Deputy O'Rourke to go out through the roof altogether?  To the credit of certain Fianna Fáil Deputies and <Col N="1016" /> members of boards of health, I have seen them turning in disgust from attempts of that character and saying, &ldquo;I will have nothing to do with them,&rdquo; and walking out of the room. On the whole, the allocations of cottages was pretty fair because the constant supervision of the Department was there <i>in terrorem</i> and the boys knew that they could not get away with murder and that made them try to keep somewhere within the limits of public decency.  There is a reason for that, and the reason is easy to find.</P>
      <P>That improper administration, I do not think, was due to any inferiority in the material we have in this country for local administration.  It was due to one thing, and that was because the Fianna Fáil Party turned the local elections into political elections.  So long as the Fianna Fáil and the Cumann na nGaedheal Parties kept out of political elections, you had on local bodies men who did the work together without regard to their political affiliations.  The moment the local elections were turned into political combats, the most popular lad to get votes was put up as a county councillor, because the political Party's honour was involved, and every supporter of the Party voted for the man who was carrying the Party banner, without any regard to his qualifications as a public representative.  Naturally, the Party put up their best men for the Parliamentary election.  The fellows who were put up for the local elections were those who failed to make the grade in Parliamentary elections, and they all got in.  It was a kind of sop to them. That is partially true also of our own Party.  Some good men got in, but a good many bad men got in, too, and they got in because they were nominees of a political Party.  If they had not been nominees of a Party they would never get elected for their different districts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When you get bodies of that kind, the decent men will not take any interest in local administration because they do not fancy having themselves abused or bally-ragged by the less reputable councillors who had secured election.  In that way the public bodies <Col N="1017" /> gradually fell into the hands of the least reputable elements.  Everybody knows that.  We are all aware that it was the carrying of national politics down into the arena of local affairs that brought about that situation.  It is perfectly true that there are Deputies on the Fianna Fáil benches who could sit with me quite comfortably at a committee meeting without any reference being made to our political affiliations, but, if we met as political antagonists, the business that would fall to be done would be pushed one side and both of us would be advancing the interests of our Parties in the presence of the local Press.</P>
    <P>This is a new departure.  I think one mistake that was made very clearly by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, when they were dealing with local government matters, was that they did try to centralise things too much.  They had the idea that if you brought all the county services together into one place, have the one place of meeting, the one office and the one county home, that everything would be done more efficiently.  I do not think that that has proved to be true.  In the search for that efficiency, I think that certain hardships were done and they were done in this way: They withdrew from the poor and the destitute of every county the intimate contact with the local services that they used to have in the rural district council days.  It meant that a poor person who had to go to the county home was completely cut off from all his friends and neighbours and might practically never hope to have a visit from them again if the county home was remote from his native district.  I am not quite sure that that was a good plan.</P>
    <P>I wonder, if we do get the managerial system established and the routine work of county administration done under that system, would it be possible&mdash;I am now almost thinking aloud, because I have not thought this out at all&mdash;to re-develop something in the nature of the old rural district council and have the county manager advised by bodies analogous to the old rural district councils instead of, or in <Col N="1018" /> addition to, one big county council doing all the work of the board of health and the county council for the whole county?  I can imagine that that might give rise to insuperable administrative difficulties, but I feel if we had that we might get better work done in two ways, (1), we would bring the advisory body and the county manager closer to the people whom they were primarily designed to serve and, (2), a great many men who will not travel 25 or 30 miles to a meeting will readily join a body to attend which they would not have to travel more than eight or ten miles.  It means a whole day has gone if you have to travel 30 miles to a meeting and return home again, whereas, if the county council is meeting only eight or ten miles away, you can drive there in the morning, get the business done, and have the afternoon in which to attend to your own affairs. That matter is worth considering.</P>
    <P>Subject to those observations, I intend to vote against the Labour amendment and for the Second Reading of the Bill.  I think the success of this Bill, as Deputies have said, will largely depend on whether the right men are chosen to be county managers. If the Fianna Fáil Government postpone the general election until they have distributed the jobs under this Bill, then we may get a very bad lot of county managers.  On the other hand, if they go out of office before the managers are appointed we probably will get good county managers.  The middle course would be to allow the Civil Service Commissioners or the Local Appointments Commissioners to fill the position without having any interference by the&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As to this suggestion, or allegation, that I have made now I am puzzled as to whether the Minister is perfectly serious in suggesting that the Government never had any interference with the selections made by the Local Appointments Commissioners since they came into office.  I appreciate the <i>naïveté</i> with which the Minister suggests this.  I am sure he would not pretend so barefaced a denial if he were aware of what has been happening with regard to these appointments since the Fianna Fáil Party came into office.</P>

      <P>Let me say at once that what I have suggested does not in any way touch the Ceann Comhairle in his responsibility as Chairman of the Appointments Commissioners.  I spoke of interference by the Government.  I remember a most eloquent tirade by the Fianna Fáil Party when they were in Opposition about this matter of local appointments.  When they gained office afterwards their own Minister was obliged to say that he had investigated the charges about these appointments, charges which no doubt he was anxious to find proved, and he was obliged after investigating them to say here in the House that he could not find any trace of interference by the Government in these appointments.</P>

      <P>This was in relation to the operations of the Local Appointments Commissioners during the period in office of the Cumann na nGaedheal Government.  Deputy O'Grady will probably remember that his colleagues then alleged every kind of abuse against the Local Appointments <Col N="1020" /> Commissioners.  The Deputy will remember that, subsequently, the Minister, Mr. Seán T. O Ceallaigh, said that he had personally investigated the proceedings of the Local Appointments Commissioners during the Cumann na nGaedheal Administration, no doubt looking for the abuses and in the hope of finding these charges proved, but that after having done so he found there was not a trace of any such abuse.

      <P>Surely it is in order.  If the appointments under this Bill are to be made by the Local Appointments Commissioners it is in order.  This is a matter that has been frequently and acrimoniously debated in this House. Deliberate allegations were made by the very Deputies who are now turning their eyes to Heaven and saying that they are shocked at such suggestions being made about these appointments. I had not bothered about speaking on <Col N="1021" /> this Bill but I am glad now that I have said so many things that required to be said.  I am glad that Fianna Fáil Deputies have this opportunity of examining their consciences and, above all, asking themselves, has the pious indignation, which some of them displayed here to-day, been hypocrisy or was it a genuine reasonable resentment against allegations for which there was no grounds whatever.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Cleary Mr. Cleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a Bill which does require serious consideration in this House.  Probably before the Final Stages it will be possible to submit it to a special committee of the House so that they may go into it in greater detail than is usually done on the Committee Stage of a Bill.  This Bill is a revolution in local government.  Certain allegations and suggestions made as to the past history of local government should have been left outside this Bill if the Bill is going to have a future at all.  There is one thing that should be realised and that is that the county councils in the past have played a big rôle in the social life of this country. There is no doubt about it, the county councils and the other bodies did fill a place in the social order of this country and did work that it would be very hard to improve on.  They were very necessary in certain stages of our history.  There is no Deputy no matter how energetic who has had at any time during his period as Deputy done social work equal to that of many members of the county councils in the past.  On fair days, market days, and county council days it was usual to find the county councillor, who had other work to do, spending a whole ten or 12 hours of his day looking after the work of local government.  I do not know how the work they did in that way can be properly appraised; I do not know how that work will be done under this Bill.  Perhaps the smaller number who will then represent the people will be able to do the work more speedily.  I do believe that those councils have prevented revolutions against the social order in the past, at the same time that they carried out revolutions in social matters.  I do say that appreciation should be given to those who in the past neglected their own business <Col N="1022" /> in doing local government work.  I think something had to be done in the matter of local government.  It is admitted by everybody that too much work had to be done by the county council and boards of health institutions, and it appears that the work could not be done efficiently if we were to continue going on in that way.  I think it is a marvel and a tribute to the members of those boards that they did so much work and did it in such an efficient manner&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCleary" hpid="Mr. Cleary Mr. Cleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and in so clean a manner.  I doubt if a body of civil servants, having the same amount of control and the same amount of latitude would do as clean work for the nation and for local government as did the county councils and board of health institutions in all parts of the country. I have said the same amount of latitude. When we hear it said here that it was a &ldquo;you-scratch-me and-I-will scratch you&rdquo; system that was carried on in county councils, I say that is not so, with the exception possibly of a very few cases here and there.  But I know from county councillors themselves, who are active workers, that they could not carry on with the load that has been put on their shoulders by the Local Government Department.  It would be impossible for them to carry on in future.  These county councillors, who are good, decent, public representatives, have been asking for some measure of this kind.  This may not be exactly the measure that they want, but they have been asking for some measure; and these people have more experience of county council work than I have, as I have never been a member of a public board.  These people, who are good workers, and who work in county councils, not for the gallery, but for the welfare of the people, have been asking for some measure of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that you can have only one of two systems adopted.  One is to go back to the old system of district councils, urban councils, and county councils.  That might not be a bad system to give a trial to under the <Col N="1023" /> modern franchise.  Deputy Dillon wandered for a moment in the wrong direction when he talked about politics being brought into county councils by the introduction of Fianna Fáil into the political life of the State.  We all know the happy reading we got in local papers from the district council meetings of long ago.  What was wrong was not the system they were supposed to work, but the fact that under the old franchise on which these district councils were elected you had all the tongue waggers and those who played to the gallery.  They, undoubtedly, unwittingly brought district council work into disrepute.  If you had the modern franchise applied to the election of district councils and county councils, with a little lightening of the burden of routine work, and a reduction in their membership, and gave them some facilities even for travelling to these meetings, you might be able to devise a very fine system of local government.</P>
    <P>Not having tried that system, this is, I think, the only other system, and the best I can say about it is that it is evidently going to get a trial.  I think it is entitled to a trial.  If, after five years or a shorter period, it is found that there are snags in this, it should be possible to have them remedied.</P>
    <P>I will say that after five or ten years of this system, if there is proper co-operation, local government administration will improve to a great extent. But, heaven save us from managers being selected who are competent only to answer satisfactorily questions put to them by the Appointments Commission or the Civil Service Commission. There is a danger that you will have possibly out of the Civil Service itself &mdash;I am not casting any reflection upon it&mdash;people who are highly qualified technically in the work of the Civil Service, who have reached a certain grade, who never had any knowledge of local administration except in a theoretic way; that they will be able to answer the questions put by the Appointments Commission or the Civil Service Commission, and that they will appear in that way to be the best qualified.  That <Col N="1024" /> type, I think, would be a danger to the system, because you will then have sent down managers who would be qualified in theory; but in practice they would lack what is necessary in local government administration&mdash;a sympathetic ear for the public.  If only to please the public, if you like, they require to have a sympathetic ear.</P>
    <P>As some Deputy stated, it is the public who are paying for the upkeep of local government, and they are entitled to something more than the straight-cut, red-tape director in the county who will not hear them sympathetically, and who will not give way when the red-tape Civil Service rules direct him that he should not.  If we get administrators in our counties who have a knowledge of local government and of the requirements and of the outlook of the people, I believe this measure will be a success.  But, as I said, there is the danger of getting the other type, who will not mean to do the wrong thing but, because of the narrow, one-grooved mind, which undoubtedly exists in the Civil Service as a result of the system, that type of man will bring this Act into disrepute and do grave injury to local government administration.</P>
    <P>In addition to that, there is the other danger of managers becoming subject to influence.  The old system, which has been found fault with a great deal, was not subject to influence.  There were too many different types of representatives on councils to allow one or two men, or even a party majority, to get away with anything worth talking about.  There is a danger that a manager will become subject to influence by a certain body of people, no matter who they may be.  He may be influenced in a certain direction to the detriment of the people as a whole.  He will have to make decisions as to certain works in certain areas, and whom he may have social contact might be able to get him to weigh in their favour in his decisions.  I wonder if that could be avoided by having a system of changing the manager from a county every five years.  There might be a disadvantage in that, because an <Col N="1025" /> administrator in a county would know the county well by that time and know his work.  But, still I think it would be worth while if a provision was put in the Bill that a manager should be changed from county to county after a period of five years.  It would at least release such a manager from awkward influences so far as administration is concerned, and I think it would help to keep local government administration in a cleaner and healthier condition.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that if the Bill is operated properly, with co-operation from the public, and if we get the right type of representatives, it will improve local government administration in the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in making his Second Reading speech on this Bill was obviously uncomfortable.  He certainly did not go very far in explaining the provisions of the Bill.  Of course, one cannot wonder at this when we remember that the members of his Party denounced very strongly the Bills dealing with Cork and Dublin when they were brought in.  I think it will be admitted by the Minister and by various people in this House that the Government Party are not at all happy as far as this Bill is concerned. We have read of members of the Party giving expression to their opinions in various parts of the country at public boards of which they are members, in which they have condemned the whole thing root and branch.  The Council of Municipal Councils and the General Council of County Councils have asked for the withdrawal of the Bill.  These are very representative bodies and they have on them Deputies from each of the Parties represented in this House.  All those Deputies with the exception of one, I think, who are members of these two bodies I have mentioned, have shown themselves strongly in opposition to this Bill.  We heard a lot of sneers against democracy in the course of this debate. Deputy Allen told us that there was no democracy in this country now.  If there is not, I do not know who is to blame except it be the present Government and the Party of which Deputy Allen is a member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1026" /> So far as I know, the people whom I represent are opposed to the passage of this Bill.  I have made every effort since the Bill was introduced to ascertain their views.  The members of almost every public body of which I am a member unanimously denounced the Bill.  I again suggest, even though we be sneered at, that it is the absolute negation of democracy.  The Party to which I belong and I myself are satisfied that there should be some change in local government.  We are satisfied that it is absolutely necessary there should be codification of the laws.  We are satisfied that, on some aspects of local government, too much time is taken up in discussion at particular boards or committees.  But if a county council or corporation is unable to do the work set before it from time to time, I doubt very much whether you will get a man as manager who will be capable of carrying out the work.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal about efficiency and economy in connection with this Bill.  Like Deputy O'Higgins. I am all for economy and efficiency. Economy and efficiency are necessary in local government in the same way as they are necessary in business.  But a little more than economy and efficiency is required so far as a public board is concerned.  We want the human touch.  We want members of councils to be able to get into contact with poor people in their area from time to time and to see that provision is made for supplying them with the necessaries of life.  Is it suggested that a man coming into a county as manager&mdash;we are led to believe that, ultimately, &ldquo;locals&rdquo; will not be appointed&mdash;will know the needs and necessities of the poor people better than those elected as their representatives who have lived amongst them for years?  If this Bill goes through in its present form, the poor are not going to get the attention they have been getting since local government was made operative in 1898 and 1899.</P>
    <P>As I said before in other places, I do not object to a manager as such.  I do not object to the personality of a manager but, so far as this Bill is concerned and so far as the Dublin, Limerick, Cork and Waterford Acts are <Col N="1027" /> concerned, the individual concerned is not a manager for the council but a manager of the council.  Anybody who is a member of any of these bodies will say that that is the exact situation. Reference has been made to reserved functions.  There are very few functions reserved to the council.  They have not even the power to let a house or to adjust the wages of their employees. The council who are finding the money and striking the rate should have that power.  They are the people who should have the power.  If the manager can increase or decrease people's wages without acquainting the council which is, I suggest, the position under this Bill, it is entirely wrong.</P>
    <P>We are told that we have complete control over the finances of the council. I do not think that we are allowed to prepare an estimate.  It is predigested for us, according to Deputy Childers.  We are permitted to meet on one day each year for the purpose of striking a rate.  The moment that meeting is over, we cease to have any direct contact with the finances which are forthcoming as a result of the striking of the rate.  That is not a very popular function for any member of a council.  The attention of the people is focussed on that particular meeting in order to ascertain what the rate position will be during the financial year.  If the rate is increased, the council is blamed.  If it is reduced, the manager gets all the credit.  That is the position so far as that meeting is concerned.</P>
    <P>In the discussion on the Dublin Management Bill, strong comments, as I have said, were made by Deputies who now occupy Ministerial positions. Deputy O Ceallaigh, now Minister for Finance and previously Minister for Local Government, described the Bill as &ldquo;a rotten Bill&rdquo; and thought the President should recognise it as such. He said that power was being taken from the people and that that was against the will of the people.  Deputy Lemass wanted a council which would have effective control over the municipal service and he wanted a manager <Col N="1028" /> who would be subordinate to the council.  He also wanted unified control over the whole city area.  These are some of the things said by Deputies who are now Ministers.  A stronger statement was made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Deputy MacEntee.  He said that the manager would be &ldquo;wearing the jack-boots of the Minister and would be able to walk rough-shod over their desires and opinions.  There is no man in the corporation or outside the corporation, on the streets of the city or in the City Hall, who will be able to say him &lsquo;nay&rsquo;&rdquo;.  I wonder what brought about the change in the opinions of these Deputies.  I heard the Parliamentary Secretary say he voted against the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a distinction without a difference.  One might expect Deputy Good to be in favour of the managerial system.  He said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Since the publication of this Bill I have endeavoured, so far as one could, to get the views of Dublin men upon it.  Nowhere in the city amongst the people whom I have come in contact with, have I found the least enthusiasm for this Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the face of these quotations, one wonders what has changed the opinions of those who have spoken on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I have been a member of an urban authority for 26 years, and I have been a member of a county council for 19 years.  I have not seen any of the corruption that it has been suggested was carried on before.  I suggest that it is far easier to get at one man than to <Col N="1029" /> get at a number of men, and there is no man in such a position in this country to-day as not to be susceptible to influence of some kind or another, no matter how strong that man is.  I suggest that if there is corruption at the present time&mdash;and I emphatically deny that there is&mdash;there is a far greater danger of it if one man is to be in charge of large areas in this country.</P>
    <P>In one particular part of the Bill the county manager is to take over, not alone the affairs of the county council and the county health board, but also the affairs of the urban authority.  I suggest to the Minister that the affairs of urban authorities and the affairs of rural authorities, as a county council is, are two entirely different matters, and that he is not going to get the best results if there is to be a county manager in charge of both county and urban areas.  Take the position of Drogheda, Sligo, Wexford, Kilkenny, Dundalk, and places like that, which have old charters dating from hundreds of years back.  These towns, one might say, are now going to lose their identities under this particular Bill, and if the Bill is going to pass in its present form, I would suggest to the Minister that there should be separate arrangements or regulations made between urban and rural administrations. There are entirely different problems confronting an urban authority from those confronting a county authority, and I hope that the Minister will give due consideration to that aspect of the question.</P>
    <P>Now, Roscommon appears to me to be in a very bad way.  If one were to take any notice of what Deputy Dillon and Deputy Brennan say, none of them appears to be capable of doing the particular work that is required of them on the County Health Board or the County Council of Roscommon. Deputy Dillon said that they start at 12 o'clock at the county health board meeting and that they are still going strong at 8 o'clock.  Well, I do not wonder very much at that, if Deputy Dillon takes as long to explain himself there as he does here in this House, and if he talks around a question so much at the meetings there as he does here.  He says also that we <Col N="1030" /> cannot expect men to travel for miles to county health board and county council meetings.  Nobody is compelling any of these people to travel 20 or 30 miles to these meetings.  They became members of local authorities of their own free will, and it is a matter entirely for themselves whether they stay there or not.</P>
    <P>Deputy Childers, to my mind, displayed a lamentable ignorance in so far as local areas are concerned.  It was pretty evident from the very beginning of his speech that he had not the slightest conception of the work of a local authority, and he may say what he likes or try to cover the matter up as much as he likes, but the allegations that he made in his speech were that members of local authorities were corrupt and that there was some hole-and-corner work or hugger-mugger work in so far as the provision of houses and the getting of jobs were concerned.  I think that is unworthy of Deputy Childers.  Apparently, he was told something by somebody who was not very favourably disposed towards the continuance of local authorities in this country.  At the end of his speech he tried to cover up what he had said, and stated that they were not corrupt&mdash;regardless of what he had said previously&mdash;but that they were incapable of doing the work; in other words, that members of local authorities in the country at the present time are practically imbeciles and not aware at all of what is required of them when they take up a position as members of a local authority.  The Deputy also said that if we had a county manager we would have a pre-digestion of all the figures that would be necessary to enable the county councils to strike their rates in an equitable manner, and that all the figures would be prepared for them.  Well, now, as I said previously, I have been a member of local authorities for a number of years in this country, and I have always found that the county clerks or town clerks were quite capable of doing all that before there was ever any mention at all of a county manager, and they did it very well.  I do not think that the Local Government Department or any of its officials were able to find <Col N="1031" /> any fault with the way in which these accounts and figures were prepared year after year, and, so far as that is concerned, we do not need this superman that is to be imposed on the county councils if this Bill passes into law.  I can assure Deputy Childers also that, so far as members of local authorities in this country are concerned, there is no corruption, and that people go in there in an effort to try to do their best for the public as a whole, and that most of their time is certainly taken up in looking after the best interests of the poor.  As I have said already, I have yet to learn or to know of any one man in a county who would be capable of getting into touch with the poor as closely as he should in the same manner as the members of the county councils have been doing in the past.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil was the last Party in this country that I would expect to introduce such a Bill as this, and I can tell the Minister that I am perfectly satisfied that, if the Whips were taken of and a free vote of the House were allowed, you would have a different situation when this Bill is put for its Second Reading.  Now, nobody has definitely stated in this House what is wrong with local government to the extent that it was necessary that we should have county managers&mdash;not, as I said before, to manage on behalf of the council, but to manage the council, because that is the position that is visualised in this Bill.  I also admitted before that there might be a tightening up in so far as local government is concerned, and we are offering in this amendment a medium which would enable the Local Government Department to have the whole question of local government in this country examined with a view to tightening up where it is necessary, and that if it were necessary, after that, that there should be a manager, he should be under the direct control of the council. Councils, after the passage of this Bill, will be so many puppets and so many rubber stamps.  In a great many cases a matter will have become a <i>fait accompli</i> before the council knows anything at all about it.  In my opinion, <Col N="1032" /> that is very undesirable and I think that it will bring about a spirit of apathy to such an extent that at, say, the election after the next one, very few people, very few intelligent people at any rate, will be found to offer themselves as candidates for local authorities at all.</P>
    <P>I think the Minister would be serving a good purpose if he were to accept this amendment, and perhaps then we would be able to arrive at some decisions in which the House could be unanimous and that a definite effort would be made by every member of every Party in this House to establish a system of local government that would be acceptable to all.  I am of the opinion that this matter is of sufficient importance even to warrant that there should be a referendum of the people to find out what their wishes and desires are in so far as local government is concerned.  I suggest that Fianna Fáil has no mandate, good, bad or indifferent, from the people, to put this revolutionary change into operation.  On the contrary, I think the people had a right to assume that, in accordance with the condemnation by the Fianna Fáil members of the Cork Bill and the Dublin Bill, Fianna Fáil were very definitely against the county managerial system.  For that reason I suggest that the people in the country should be consulted before such a revolutionary change is brought about.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan in the course of his statement said that the Minister had made a bad case, and that Deputy Norton had made a bad case.  I must say that Deputy Brennan certainly made a better case for the Bill than the Minister did, but then of course Deputy Brennan had the feeling that he was always a supporter of the managerial system, while the Minister was not.  There again he based his experience on Roscommon, which seems to be in a very bad state according to Deputy Dillon and Deputy Brennan.  The Mayor of Limerick yesterday made a statement here, in which he said that he had been a member of the Limerick Corporation for a number of years, and that it was only during the last five years that <Col N="1033" /> they had had decent local government. I do not know who is in a position to speak for Limerick, but I distinctly heard two members of the Limerick Corporation, at the Council of Municipal Councils, condemning the County Management Bill in so far as it applied to Limerick.  Those people were members of two different political parties, and they gave us to understand that they had a mandate from the Limerick City Council to speak as they did.</P>
    <P>The Long Title of this Bill says it is going to make further and better provision for local government in this country.  I must confess that I cannot see where the better provision is contained in any section of this Bill.  I am perfectly satisfied that, if there were a little tightening up of the present system of local government, and a little more co-operation between the Minister and the local councils, we could get a system of local government which would be acceptable to everybody.  As I said in another place, some people tell us that a great many of the ratepayers are in favour of this system.  I doubt that very much.  I am of the opinion that the people who are in favour of it will be found amongst those who have from time to time been rejected by the electorate, or people like Deputy Dillon who have run away from the County Board of Health in Roscommon&mdash;who have got tired representing the people.  I would again recommend to the Minister the acceptance of Deputy Norton's amendment.  I think that, if we were to accept that amendment, accommodation could be found whereby all Parties in this House could agree to co-operate with the Department of Local Government with a view to tightening up local government in the country, and devising if possible a better system.  It may be necessary then that managers should be appointed, but, as I said before, as far as I am concerned, the manager I want to see appointed should be subject to the control of the elected representatives of the people.  In any place where the managerial system has been brought into operation, any member of the council there can tell you that they have been deprived of <Col N="1034" /> much of the powers which they had prior to the appointment of that manager; that they cannot move hand or foot; that they cannot do anything effective for the good of the people, and especially the poorer section of the community.  The Labour Party will never subscribe to a system of that kind.  We will do everything we can to prevent this managerial system from coming into operation in this country.</P>

      <P>I intend to support the amendment by the Labour Party.  It was my intention yesterday to support that amendment, and every speech I have listened to since then has only strengthened my belief that before any legislation is introduced to order or amend our system of local government there should be a searching inquiry as to what is the best system to adopt. The proposals contained in this Bill are directed mainly towards curtailing and limiting the powers of the county councils, and in so far as they are intended to curtail those powers they are contrary to democratic government.  They are limiting the powers of the people to look after their own affairs, and are placing the control of our local affairs in the hands of what may be, and what will in all likelihood be, local dictators. We are told that this system will promote economy and efficiency.  I am not quite sure whether or not that is true.  I am not quite sure whether 20 or 30 small dictators operating throughout the country, each with his own peculiar or particular ideas in regard to local administration, each with a strong personality and prepared to carry out his own ideas in his own way, will be any assistance to the Local Government Department in the general work of local government.  I am not sure that those officials will not hamper the Local Government Department in various ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The great objection to this Bill lies in the fact that it deprives the plain people of the right that they should themselves look after their own affairs. For years when the demand in this country was for local administration, the slogan of those who demanded that reform was: &ldquo;No taxation without representation.&rdquo; Now, under this Bill, <Col N="1035" /> we are going to have taxation without representation and&mdash;which is going to make this Bill even more obnoxious&mdash; we have the position in which the elected representatives will have no power whatever to administer the affairs of their counties or urban districts; yet they will have the duty, the very unpleasant task, of levying and collecting the rates.  I think the position will be in the very near future that no self-respecting person will go forward as a local representative.  No self-respecting person will be prepared to sit on a public board and carry out orders dictated to him by a permanent official&mdash;orders over the formulation of which he has no control whatever.</P>
    <P>This is not the time when democratic government should be limited or restricted. At the moment, in every country in the world, an attack is being made upon democratic institutions. Democratic power in most of the Continental countries has been destroyed, and at this time we are proposing to destroy the basis of democratic government in this country.  In this Bill we are setting out to deprive the people of close contact with local administration and, through that close contact with local administration, the contact which they should have with national administration.  That is a step in the wrong direction.  It is a step towards the ultimate destruction of democratic institutions in this country.  Every argument that can be put forward in support of this Bill can be used with equal force in support of a demand for the abolition of this Parliament, and the substitution of a national dictator.  I do not think any member of this House would stand over any such proposal.  Members of local authorities have been sharply criticised, and I think they have been very unjustly criticised.  It is very easy, particularly for people who are not members of local bodies, to cast a slur upon those representatives.  It is equally easy for people who are not members of this Parliament to cast a slur upon this Parliament or upon each individual member of this Parliament, but any member of this House who is in close contact with local administration, <Col N="1036" /> any member of this House who has been either for a long period or a short period a member of a local body, must admit that the local elected representatives have discharged their duties very conscientiously, and with a high sense of honour and rectitude.  As far as I am concerned, I have been a member of public bodies only for a short time.  I have been a member of a county council for only five years, but I must say that when I was elected to that body I found it composed mainly of members who had been in public affairs practically all their lives, and I was very deeply impressed by the high standard of rectitude, honour, honesty, and conscientious attention to the details of their office which those gentlemen displayed.</P>
    <P>I found that although that county council, of which I am a member, was composed mainly of representatives of the ratepayers, representatives of a ratepayers' party, there was very conscientious and very careful attention paid to the interests of the workers and of other sections of the community.  I do not think there is any justification for depriving those locally elected representatives of the powers which they have enjoyed and exercised for so many years.  I am quite prepared to agree that there may be need to reform or reorganise the whole system of local government, but, if you are to proceed to reform and reorganise the local government system, I think, before any step is taken, there should be a careful examination of the whole position.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that the appointment of county managers is a step in the right direction.  I would be inclined, if I were asked for a suggestion, to start at the top of the local government system.  I would be inclined to abolish the Minister for Local Government. I am not referring now to the present Minister, but rather to the office he holds.  I believe that the Department of Local Government has too many functions to perform.  It has to deal with a variety of subjects, from housing to the maintenance of roads and public health.  If a reform was to be considered at all, I think it should <Col N="1037" /> be on the lines of appointing a Minister and setting up a department which would deal exclusively with public health.  I would also be inclined to think that the administration of roads should be under one department and that department should be confined exclusively to the maintenance of roads.  The same might apply to housing.  I feel that combining all those services under one branch of administration is wrong.</P>
    <P>I do not think it will make things better to appoint a manager in each county, or in a group of counties, who will have all these services to look after.  I do not think it is possible to find a manager who will be competent to look after, not only public health services, but road maintenance and the various other services over which he will have control.  For that reason I am against the appointment of those managers.  I believe that road maintenance would be better carried out if, over the heads of county surveyors, there was one general surveyor of roads who would have experience of road work, who would have been a road surveyor in some county and made his job a success and, having done so, would be able to have his progressive ideas carried out in other counties which might not be so progressive.</P>
    <P>That might be a needed reform, but the most important reform which I consider necessary at the moment, is to bring the plain people into closer touch with local government.  This Bill will have the opposite effect.  It will create a situation in which local government will be administered, controlled and directed entirely by permanent officials.  It may be asked, how can the people be brought into closer contact with local administration? There seems to be only one way and that is, so far from depriving local councils of their power, I think their power should be increased to a considerable extent and, if the work which they are called upon to do is regarded as too heavy for a county council, there is no reason why local bodies, such as parish councils, should not be set up in every parish, thus enabling the plain people to take a close and active interest <Col N="1038" /> in the administration of their public affairs.  I believe that would solve the problem which has been referred to, to a great extent, the problem of the enormous amount of work which boards of health and county councils have to perform.  A good deal of detail work could be transferred from the boards of health or the county councils to the parish councils, and I believe it would be carried out very conscientiously and very efficiently.</P>
    <P>There is no use in pretending that permanent, well-paid public officials are the only people who possess intelligence and are the only people competent to administer public affairs.  I believe that in every parish you will find conscientious, efficient men who are prepared to perform the details of local government work efficiently and without any reward.  I think that by availing of the services of such men you will be bringing the people into contact with the administration of public affairs; you will be bringing the government of the country down to the plain people and, to a great extent, you will be narrowing the gulf which appears to be growing up between the central government and the people who elect that government.</P>
    <P>I think that it is along those lines that reform should be made.  Therefore, I am asking the Minister, if he cannot withdraw this Bill, at least to put it on the shelf, together with the Valuation Bill and other objectionable measures, and, in the meantime, have an inquiry into the whole system of local government and find out if it is not possible to get an efficient system which will be thoroughly democratic in its outlook.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielORourke" hpid="Mr. O'Rourke Mr. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Roscommon has been mentioned so often in this debate&mdash;and in some cases not mentioned in a favourable light&mdash;that I think it is necessary I should say something.  I had not intended to say anything on this Bill, but, in the circumstances, I think it is better that I should do so. I may say that with some of the proposals in this Bill I am in wholehearted agreement.  There are, however, some points in the measure with which I am not in such complete agreement. <Col N="1039" /> So far as reorganisation of the work of the boards of health is concerned, from experience of it, and not perhaps a very long experience, I am convinced that some change is necessary. Whether you call him a county manager, an executive officer, or a secretary, a lot of the routine work which has been left over fortnight after fortnight or week after week, in the case of the board of health, should be transacted by some executive officer.  I have said that frequently, and I have heard the same thing from men who have been members for a great many years of boards of health.</P>
      <P>We have in this House at the present moment quite a number of people who have been members of boards of health, and I think they will agree with me that some change is necessary.  I can also see the benefit of unification of control and seeing that the money provided by the county council for the board of health is spent in a proper manner.  It is true there is a certain amount of control at present, but I do not think that the parent body has sufficient insight into the method of spending the money or that they have a sufficient check on the proposals put up.  For these reasons I think a change is necessary.  I am not at all so confident as to other points in the Bill or that they are in the interests of the people or of the county councils concerned. Yesterday, when Deputy Fogarty was so unexpectedly cast from the debate, he made a point with which I agree.  That is that he does not think dictatorial authority should be given to the manager either over the staff or the spending of money generally.  I agree that there should be some limit set to the powers of the county manager.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is any object in my rising here it is to urge on the Minister that between now and the Committee Stage he will consider something that will put a check on the manager and give the county council more control over him. I believe if the Minister considers that matter he will see reason in it.  I do not think at all that it is wise to make the county manager sole dictator, not <Col N="1040" /> only over the work of the staff, but with regard to remuneration, increments and so on.  Neither do I think it right that the county managers should have the fixing of the salaries.  It is years since the Roscommon County Council, with all its faults, urged that the fixing of the scale of salaries should be laid down by the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  I repeat that to-day, so that there will be an efficient way of dealing with the county manager, the county council, or anything else as regards increments and salaries.  I think increments should come automatically.  I understand that the Minister is introducing another Bill.  I suggest there should be a fixed scale of salaries for all officers. That would do away with all that trouble.  I do not think that the county manager should have power to spend money without the consent of the county council.  At the very least, I say that before the county manager makes appointments there should be a finance committee of the county council acting with him and co-operating with him.  I think that is the very least that the county council should expect.  They should have some say in and also some knowledge of the appointments and the remuneration.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that there have been allegations made against both individual county councillors and county councils as a whole.  I do not think these allegations should have been made, especially by men who really do not know that about which they are talking.  When a serious statement like that is made, one would imagine that the person who makes it would know what he is speaking about. A moment ago we had a Deputy making reference to the disposal of cottages, and quoting an individual as an authority condemning the county councillors and local government.  That is most unfair.  There are thousands of individuals in a county, and thousands of others might have as important views as the one mentioned by the Deputy.  Quite probably that man was prejudiced.  I have had experience of many such people.  I have had experience of a great many things, including working on the roads, and I hold definitely that road workers as a body are <Col N="1041" /> just as good workers as can be found anywhere else.  That is my experience of them all.  I must say that I found the road workers as honest as anybody else.  They have their supervisors and gangers.  This work will not be any better carried out under the county manager.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon refers to wrangling and wangling in the matter of using influence with the gangers to secure employment for the supporters of certain county councillors.  I repudiate that in the strongest possible manner. I have never inquired as to anybody's politics, nor as to whether a man was a supporter of mine or not.  I made it a rule at all times not to interfere with gangers in the securing of employment for any supporters of mine.  I challenge Deputy Dillon to produce a ganger who has been asked by me to give work to my supporters.  The same Deputy made a sweeping charge against county councils&mdash;that the work was done inefficiently.  In fact, that Deputy left both the board of health and the county council because he says he thought it was only fooling they were.  The fact is that Deputy Dillon has not attended those meetings at all, and he could have very little knowledge of the working of the county councils.  I do not think it is fair for a man like that to make so sweeping a charge as he has made.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has gone once or twice in the year to these meetings.  I think that would be about all he attended, and I do not think it is fair for him to come along now and to say that county councils are useless bodies.  As far as county councils are concerned there is nothing to stop their functioning. They can do their work efficiently in the time they hold their meetings and I do not think there is much overlooked. In view of the introduction of a new Bill which I understand will deal with limited areas and name the number of members to be elected for those areas, I wish to impress on the Minister the necessity for giving adequate representation to those areas. I agree with all those members who state that it is necessary that there should be councillors in touch with the poor districts.  The rich are able to <Col N="1042" /> look after themselves.  It would be a fatal mistake to limit the county councillors too much.  If the representation is made smaller it should not be made much smaller.  That would be a great mistake and it would bear out what those in opposition to the Bill have been saying, namely, that pretty soon there will be no interest taken by the local people in the affairs of the county councils.  I do not think that there is anything further I need say, or that I should take up any more time in dealing with this Bill.  I appeal to the Minister to seek advice in this matter, and in the first place to give all the power that is possible to the county councils over the managers and not to make the managers dictators, for I think that would be fatal.  Whoever lives will find that I am simply stating the truth.  By all means make the manager the executive officer so as to make for more efficiency, but do not take the final authority from the county council.  As to the method of appointment of managers, I have not much to say.  The probability is that the county council secretaries at the moment are as good as could be got. As to the future I cannot say.  It will certainly require a very capable man and, above all, a man with deep human sympathy to carry on the duties that the manager is supposed to carry on. It would take a great knowledge of human nature, because without that, I do not care what technical qualifications a man may have, he will certainly be a failure as a county manager.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamJosephBroderi" hpid="Mr. W. Broderick Mr. W. Broderick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>Many different points of view have been expressed on this Bill.  I was very much impressed by the points of view expressed by two supporters of the Bill.  Deputy Dillon, in the closing portions of his statement, although supporting the Bill enthusiastically, still thought that an extension at the other end would be helpful. Deputy Cleary, who followed on the same lines, thought an extension and a creation of other boards, so as to divert some of the accumulation of work from boards of health, would be helpful.  I was glad to hear their points of view, because my own runs somewhat in the same way.  I am opposing this Bill and not supporting <Col N="1043" /> it.  This Bill is entitled: &ldquo;An Act to make further and better provision for the local government of counties and certain other areas.&rdquo;  I find that under Section 14 all administrative power is transferred to the manager and nothing remains to the elected representatives but the striking of the rate, on an estimate, of course, prepared by the manager, the appointment of a rate collector to collect it, and a few other functions of no very great importance. All other powers, for which the council had got authority from the people, are placed in the hands of the Government's nominated manager.  I do not think that that is going any way towards better local government.</P>
      <P>There are many points in this Bill that are not understandable to me and can only be made so if, as the Minister has now stated, this Bill is to be followed by subsequent measures.  In order, therefore, to get this Bill in its proper perspective, I think these Bills should have been introduced at the same time.  Then we would know directly where we were.  The Minister says &ldquo;further and better provision for local government.&rdquo;  Possibly there are two conceptions of that.  The Minister's may be, further and better official control, making things easier for the Departments.  Mine is, further and better control so as to make provision that all the legislation and social services passed on behalf of the people would be made available for them.  You can pay too high a price for what I may term official efficiency.  The purpose of all local government and all the social services is to serve the people.  In my opinion concentration of them in one man will not tend that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the necessity for the Bill? Is the Minister aware of the hardships imposed by the amalgamation Act of 1925?  The whole structure of local government at that time was practically swept away and large areas were left without representation.  Is it suggested that by having them still further removed you are going to benefit local government?  I hold that after many years of operation the old Local Government Act would lend itself to <Col N="1044" /> overhaul.  But that is an entirely different matter from its complete elimination. Certainly there was no reason for sweeping away an entire structure and concentrating all the work of the boards of health, boards of assistance, and county councils in the one man. I might point out that in County Cork it means handing over to him ten urban councils, two commissions, and the entire area of Cork county.  I think that is a matter entirely beyond the power of any individual to handle.  By concentrating all these powers in one man under this Bill you are creating what I would call just an official life in the country and the Minister will not succeed in getting better and more efficient local government.  Efficient if you like, but better local government, according to my conception of it, no.</P>
    <P>What is this thing called local government?  I have been listening to speeches in this House on the question of the higher forms of administration, the question of higher officials and the question of the difficulties of the various councillors.  After all local government is the right of the people to administer their affairs in their own areas as they think best, subject, of course, to the overriding power of the Minister who always has the power of veto.  It is their right to administer their own local affairs as they think best in the interests of their own locality.  They are always, of course, under the supervision of the Minister.</P>
    <P>I do not like dealing with this particular point, because I hardly think it is correct.  I do not think that the Minister doubts either the honesty or the integrity of the members who are administering the affairs of the counties at present.  But the whole implication of the Bill certainly is a complete lack of confidence in their ability.  Does the Minister hold the view that they are no longer to be trusted?</P>
    <P>If he thinks that he has ample powers, if undesirable things occur or if he holds that a council would be better under the managerial system, to appoint his own commissioner.  But that is an entirely different matter from tearing up the whole fabric of local government.  These councils at present are responsible for the supervision of the various hospitals, roads, <Col N="1045" /> boards of assistance, etc.  They are all under their control.  Speaking for my own area, I do not think it could be better done.</P>
    <P>Is it necessary to remind the House of what local government means? When the Act of 1898 was passed and became operative in 1899, all the best men in the country came in to make a success of it.  They gave their best efforts to the administration of it. After the grand jury system which we had before, it was hailed as giving liberty and power to the people for the first time.  How well they succeeded is now a matter for history.  From 1899 to 1914 they remedied most of the defects of centuries.  They brought local government and its administration to a point in which we had contentment and happiness, and, if you like, prosperity that I do not think any of us here will live to see repeated in this country again.</P>
    <P>I believe that the success of local government administration at that time aided in the demand for national government and for extended national powers.  That period could be looked upon as the second period in the life of the Irish nation.  So much do I think of effects of local government at that time.  Passing over the intervening years, I believe that the Act of 1925 was the first element of disintegration in the administration of local government.  With the accumulation of services, the administration of the various boards is difficult, but I hold strongly that these boards, which should be contributory to the county councils, do fulfil a fundamental national function.  Men met at these boards and put forward different points of view.  Public men learned restraint, moderation, and respect for one another's point of view.  They learned what is really essential in the building up of a nation&mdash;how to administer their own affairs.  I hold that these powers are necessary, and that many of the extravagances we occasionally hear about here would never have occurred if there were an extension of that principle.</P>
    <P>With the amalgamation, there were whole areas and localities which had not representation.  There was a <Col N="1046" /> demand by the councils for increased representation.  There were localities in which the people had nobody to approach.  They did not know how to avail of the services provided for them by the State.  They knew nobody but an official whom they could approach. This Bill is, unfortunately, making the position worse.  The public health and public assistance authorities which succeeded to the contributory boards created difficulties; but you are adding to the difficulties by handing over these services to one manager.  I am of opinion, apart altogether from the efficacy of contributory local bodies, that these boards are essential to the life of the nation.  I believe that opinion has to be formed at the bottom, and should not be dictated from the top.  I hold that these boards help to form a public opinion, that they train men in administration, give them a grip of the national problems and difficulties, and ultimately fit them to take their place in the county or the national assembly.</P>
    <P>By doing away with all that, you are taking a retrograde step, and the connection between this Dáil and the people will be merely through the ægis of an official.  As time goes on, the quality of the men you will get to act as advisers on these urban and county councils will be questionable.  A system of disintegration will follow and the ultimate result&mdash;psychological if you like&mdash;will be the presence of a few powerless advisers in each locality. The effect will be to turn the whole country into the position of governors and governed with only an official as intermediary.  Efficiency between the local authorities and the Department will be secured, but it will be got at the cost of national disintegration.</P>
    <P>Leaving subsidiary matters aside, the effect of the Act of 1898 was to teach the people to manage their own affairs. This Bill is bound to bring us back to the position in which we were before that Act was passed.  This Government has imposed great limitations on the country.  They have increased national and local taxation from £17,000,000 in 1932 to over £100,000,000.  They have increased taxation to a point that is almost unbearable.  They have raised <Col N="1047" /> the cost of living to a point which has brought privation to the homes of many of our people, but they have left us the institutions that can remedy that position.  It only requires energy and determination on the part of the people to remedy that state of affairs.  By this Bill, the Government is taking away from the people the power to rectify what is wrong in their local affairs.</P>
    <P>There is a personal aspect to this question.  I have been for a number of years associated with local authorities. I challenge any man to put a pin's point on any undesirable action of theirs.  I am aware of one or two members of a county council who can only reach the city for meetings after a two days' journey.  They have to spend the same time on the journey home.  You may say that that is an argument for this Bill&mdash;that no man should be called upon to travel for two days to a meeting.  But two members have done so, and done so with enthusiasm, because they believed in the right of the people to administer their own affairs.  I am not, after these years of close co-operation and understanding, going, by supporting this Bill, to say to these men: &ldquo;You are unworthy of the confidence the people reposed in you.  You are unworthy to administer the affairs you were appointed to administer.&rdquo;  I do not know whether or not I speak for the majority of opinion in this House.  I suppose the Minister will get his majority within the House&mdash;much of it hesitatingly, much of it reluctantly, and much of it without conviction.  He will also get support from this side of the House, but I wonder would the Government be prepared to grant a free vote of the House?  At any rate, although I may not be speaking for the majority vote of this House, I do speak, I believe, for the majority of considered opinion outside.  They believe and know that there are higher things in the national life and higher ideals than mere efficiency and economy, and that there is a higher spirit in this country that has to be adverted to.  There is, and there ought to be, a better association between <Col N="1048" /> us and now, if the local bodies are wiped out, some of them, possibly, we may be going to far.  I believe that the preservation of these public bodies and their powers is essential in the interests of the country and essential for forming and teaching responsibility, forming properly considered opinion, and teaching moderation and a proper national outlook.  If I am not presumptuous in saying so, I look upon them as in somewhat the position of the family life, which is the basis of the spiritual life, and I believe that the opinions formed there are the basis of the national opinion. In my opinion, this House will come ultimately to regret, and regret very sincerely, that it has ever advanced or put forward anything that, in its effects, helps to stifle the formation of the opinion that is so essential in the real interests of the country.</P>
    <P>There is one other small matter to which I should like to refer.  No matter how you deny it, this Bill is striking at democratic right.  It is striking at democratic control.  Now, nothing is more insidious than to do a thing and pretend that you are not doing it, and this is undoubtedly striking at democratic right and democratic control. Is it not an extraordinarily inopportune moment to introduce a Bill of this kind?  Whether it be true or not, the opinion is held by the overwhelming mass of our people that you are striking at democratic right and wiping out the foundations of democratic control.  I know that many members of this House and Ministers have concentrated on trying to prove that that is not so, but when the whole world is in conflict in connection with those ideals, and when the very existence of civilisation is being threatened, is it not a very inopportune moment for our Government to bring in a Bill which has&mdash;or against which it is alleged, at any rate&mdash;principles of the very same kind?</P>
    <P>&mdash;I fear that this will cause reactions, and extremely undesirable reactions, in our country, and from the points of view I have raised, I think the Minister should take the real long view of the matter and that he would be well advised, not alone to bow to the <Col N="1049" /> Labour amendment, or have a referendum or anything else, but to go into the matter and reform local government in any way he likes, so long as he leaves the power in the hands of the people and gives them opportunities of meeting.  Much has been said here about undesirable things.  A few undesirable incidents may have happened in certain places occasionally, but I do not regard that as being very much.  As I say, there may have been a few such happenings, but even in the very worst localities I think it will still be found that the overwhelming mass of opinion is in favour of doing the business entrusted to them. The Minister should take the long view of this matter and endeavour to see what the effects nationally are going to be.  Let the Minister endeavour, if he likes, to see in what way local government can be reformed and in what way expenditure can be curtailed, but let him leave to the people the rights and powers that they had and that they appreciated in former years, from 1898 onwards, when we had stability and prosperity and when we had an enlightened public opinion determined to maintain their rights.  If this Bill is passed, it will have repercussions that, I am afraid, this country will regret, and regret very sincerely, in the future.</P>
    <P>Before I sit down, Sir, I should like to refer to one small incident.  It may not be in order, but there was a certain element of challenge in connection with it.  I have some knowledge of the question of the Appointments Commission. I have opposed the Appointments Commission while I have been in public life, because I claim the right of the local authority to make its own appointments. Even at the moment, I am engaged in connection with that matter and have the honour of having a mandamus issued against me, but that was on a question of principle.  However, although I am opposed to that method, there is no appointment that has been made in my county, of which I am aware, which does not reflect honour on the Appointments Commission and which was not made on merit.  That is all I have to say.  I do not intend to say any more about the Bill, but I <Col N="1050" /> would ask the Minister to reply to my question.</P>

      <P>If we are to believe the statements made by Deputy Dillon in this House this evening the country must be in a very bad way indeed.  All the local bodies are corrupt, the Local Government Department is corrupt, and the Appointments Commissioners are corrupt, according to him. All I wish to say is that anybody who would take Deputy Dillon seriously would have to say to him: &ldquo;If I had the opinion of my fellow-Irishmen that Deputy Dillon holds, I am hanged if I would represent them in this House or anywhere else.&rdquo;  This Bill, in my opinion, is going far beyond what is required.  I have been a member of public boards since about 1924, and in only one case during all that period&mdash; and that was during the first five or six months that I was on the Cork County Council&mdash;did I find any case of the corruption that has been so broadly alleged here to-day.  There was only the one case, and that case was duly reported to the Minister for Local Government, but no inquiry was held. That was in January, 1925, I think.  I admit that there is something to be said in favour of giving more executive authority to the secretaries of county councils and of local bodies.  I do not know from where this manager mad idea came into this country, but it seems to be flooding all portions of the House, and even the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>The position, as far as I see it at any rate, is that there is occasion all right for giving more executive power to the secretaries of county councils and other bodies, but there is no justification whatsoever&mdash; particularly in the present position when our job is to curtail expenditure and to endeavour to see where it can be curtailed&mdash;for imposing on the unfortunate people of this country about 200 more officials and somewhere around a quarter of a million of money. The county secretaries may be all right as county managers.  There is no doubt they will make better county managers than the city managers we have got up to the moment, but where in Heaven's name are we going to get the superman from?  A superman is going to come along and take charge of the County of Cork.  He is going to take charge of the county council, of ten urban councils, of two town commissioners' areas, of three boards of health, of a mental hospital, and of three boards of assistance. Unless they are going to get him out of the mental hospital, I do not know where else they are going to get him.  All those things are to be handed over to a county manager&mdash;a county council, ten urban areas, two town commissioners' areas, three boards of health, three boards of assistance, and a mental hospital.  A superman is going to be found for that.  He is going to have assistant managers.  It is just like the private secretary to the private secretary to the private secretary that we heard about here.  I suppose it will wind up like that.  I remember one occasion long ago in Cork when a case was being made for one county surveyor, and it wound up with the county surveyor having about 40 assistant surveyors under him, so that he could sit down and look at all the rest of the fellows working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To my mind, what is happening here is that the county councils have too little power.  The officials of county councils have for a number of years past considered themselves managers. I remember only about two years ago in Cork when the county surveyor, in the expenditure of a grant of something close on £200,000, ignored the county <Col N="1052" /> council altogether, and the whole matter was fixed up between the county surveyor in Cork, one official, and another official in Dublin.  The money was spent without any reference whatsoever to the elected representatives of the people in the county.  It was only when I had to move that county surveyor's suspension that we brought him to heel and made him have more consideration for the men who were paying him his salary.  Officialdom has gone mad in this country, and that is what is wrong.  Deputy Belton told us here he was in favour of managerial control in Dublin City, and the reason he gave was that the business people have not time to walk or go in their cars from their business places here in the city to Corporation Buildings.  They have not time, but the country farmer would have time enough to get up in the morning and travel 60 miles to a county council meeting.  We had one county councillor at one time who had to come 84 miles.  I wonder if that voice from Heaven which I heard up there a while ago would ask Deputy Belton what side of the fence he is on?</P>

      <P>There is the position as I see it.  The power even in regard to the sinking of an ordinary pump is not in the hands of the board of health, the elected representatives of the people; it is between the county medical officer of health and the Department.  They are the deciding factor as to whether it is wanted or not, not the local bodies, so there is damn little power to be taken from us anyway when you boil it all down.  We heard a lot about county managers and the success of the city manager in Cork.  Where was the success?  I cannot see it.  The city manager in Cork, some time ago, with an official from the Local Government Department, examined a site for a hospital. He bought a large site, something about 26 or 27 acres of land, and he paid £3,360 of the Cork ratepayers' money for it.  When he had bought it, <Col N="1053" /> another official from the Local Government Department came down and condemned it.  The money was paid&mdash;again, I think, again without the knowledge of the representatives of the people of Cork city&mdash;by the city manager acting on the authority that was conferred on him here in the Managerial Bill.  That was bad enough, but for four years after that money had been paid the gentleman who got that £3,360, and had it in his pocket or in the bank, grazed that 26 or 27 acres of land which is the property of the rate payers of Cork, without paying a farthing for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making a comparison between that and the action of the local body, the elected representatives, who, some 12 months ago or thereabouts, bought another site for a hospital, and during the very week in which that money was paid until such time as that site could be used they let the land and are using the income from the land for the benefit of the rate payers.  The superman, the economist, let that go, but the elected representatives of the people immediately let that land and used the money for the benefit of the ratepayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear about the great economy that is going to be effected through the appointment of this superman.  I wonder, and I think I have reason to wonder.  I think it was about 1926 or 1927 that we took over the South Cork Board from the superman who had it before that, and who claimed that he <Col N="1054" /> could not administer the area with the amount of money he had for it.  In 12 months we reduced the rates in that area by £33,000, and none of us claim to be a superman.  Those are the facts. Another genius that we got there was not able to keep out of the bankruptcy courts.  He was not able to manage his own affairs, let alone the affairs of an area or of a county.  I wonder in what position we are going to find ourselves if complete control of the ratepayers' money in this country is going to be juggled between the manager in the county and an official in Dublin, because that is what it amounts to.  The Local Government Department are not competent to manage what they are given to do, apart altogether from swopping managers down through the country.  That has been my experience, at any rate.</P>
    <P>This Bill could be made a pretty good one if, instead of appointing county managers, or calling men county managers, the present secretaries of county councils were given extra power to do the smaller items required to be done, and that, perhaps, a body of men coming a long distance to a meeting may not have time to do. Give more initiative to local bodies so that you will get a better type of man there.  From my knowledge of officials in this country, as compared with the type of men we meet on local bodies, you will be a long time searching through the officials before you will get men who will do the work of the local bodies as well as it has been done.</P>
    <P>There is justification for this Bill, for a portion of it, if it is limited to giving a little more executive authority and a small bit more of administrative authority to the secretaries of county councils, of boards of health or of boards of assistance.  There is no justification for taking complete control of these things out of the hands of the elected representatives of the people.  If that is done, I know what is going to happen.  We have a gentleman named &ldquo;Klondyke&rdquo; in Cork, and I am thinking that you will have a lot of &ldquo;Klondykes&rdquo; on our local boards, because I do not believe that there is a decent man in this country who will be anxious to go into them.</P>

      <P>I do not know if, for a very long time, any Deputy in this House was ever in the predicament that Deputy Corry finds himself in. I presume he intends to vote for the Bill, but his speech was mainly a tirade in opposition to it.  Indeed, that was the sense of the speeches from the Government side during this debate. Although I am free to vote what way I like, I frankly find myself in somewhat of a difficulty.  I freely admit I never have had such difficulty making up my mind as to what action I should take in regard to this Bill, and I have never found the people I have consulted more unable to give me any idea as to what the general opinion in the country is in regard to it.</P>
      <P>In the course of the discussion various arguments have been used for and against the measure.  The arguments for or against it could be equally well refuted.  I could make a good argument for it and I could immediately refute that argument by an equally good and probably a better argument.  It has been stated that the reasons for the introduction of this measure were the inefficiency and the extravagance of local bodies in the country.  If there is any inefficiency or extravagance it is mainly due to the policy of the Government, if not altogether due to that policy.  When this Government deliberately turned the local bodies into political bodies, they succeeded to a great extent in creating highly inefficient bodies.  The local bodies have been largely turned into political bodies.  A political body acts altogether for a Party or, I might say, for a cause, and it generally proves inefficient.</P>
      <P>I remember a period in my own county when, for a few years after we got self-government, there was a council in operation&mdash;I expect it was the same in all counties&mdash;and the members of that council, in the matter of local administration, were highly inefficient.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me develop my argument.  As economists, and in the <Col N="1056" /> careful spending of local moneys they were inefficient, but, as honest, decent men, put into a position for a certain reason, they were good men.  I had at that period the duty of defending those men.  I was a member of the succeeding county council and there was a charge levelled against the men who were elected in a time of trouble in this country when many people were either afraid or ashamed to take up the duties that those men took up. They were elected as councillors, not because of their efficiency for the job, or because of their record as economists, but because they were in the fight for freedom, and they were put in there as the supporters of a cause. I pay all due respect to those men, all the respect that any man in this House can pay to them.  When these men were vilified in my county, and in other counties I expect the same applied, and when they were described as inefficient and corrupt&mdash;the charge of corruption was levelled against them&mdash; I was one of their foremost defenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a charge levelled against them and a demand was made for a sworn inquiry.  The rates were admittedly high, and a charge was made that members of the council were corrupt. I was the leader of the minority that defended these men.  My argument was that they were elected, not as economists, not for the reason that they were efficient administrators of local government, but that they were put in for a specific reason as soldiers, as people elected to further a cause.  It is an illustration of the indefensible policy in normal times of turning anybody into a political body.  It was proved afterwards to the credit of these men that, if they were inefficient in administration, it was because they had other highly-important duties to perform; that they could not have been efficient in the circumstances. But the charge of corruption was withdrawn. There was never a scintilla of evidence in my county or any other county that there was one atom of corruption that could be charged against those men.  In fact, the greatest tribute that could be paid to them was paid, when it was pointed out that, while they had command of <Col N="1057" /> large sums of money, sums that were sometimes not lodged in a bank, but carried about from place to place, there was never an instance&mdash;this came out at the sworn inquiry&mdash;of misplaced trust or any corrupt action.</P>
    <P>I merely state that as a refutation of the charge of corruption in one instance, and I am sure it applies equally to other counties.  Our local bodies, through the action of the Government, have mainly developed into political bodies.  Most of their time in the country is taken up, not with the efficient administration of local affairs, the economical administration of local affairs, but very definitely to further the Party that had a sufficient majority to send them there.  A lot of their actions are confined to that particular performance.  I am not blaming them; I am blaming the Government that allowed this state of things to continue. The difficulty most people see is how we are going to get away from that particular policy.</P>

      <P>I move that the Emergency Powers (No. 12) Order, 1939, be annulled.  This motion stands in my <Col N="1058" /> name and in the name of Deputy Cogan.  Both of us wish it to be understood that the motion was not put down&mdash;I have so informed the Minister privately&mdash;to oppose the Tillage Order, as such, but to get information about it.  This Order proposes to enforce cultivation of 12½ per cent. or one-eighth of the farm.  As I read the Order there are a few exceptions more or less on personal grounds, but I do not think the Order circumscribes the extent to which they can apply.  The Order does not provide for a percentage of tillage of the arable area of the country, and as I read it the owner of a swamp is bound to till his percentage of that swamp.  Obviously that was not the intention, and I would like to hear the Minister on it.  This is a very serious Order.  I have sympathy with the Minister for Agriculture in the task that is before him and in the reasons that prompted him to make this Order. If due preparation were made by the Minister I think the Order would be justified.  There is a war all round this country, naval warfare; we can take it that that war which is only three months old, promises to be a long and bitter struggle, and that as far as sea-warfare is concerned at the moment it is a question of no quarter on either side.  Day by day neutrals are getting more and more involved, so that any prudent Minister for agriculture or any prudent Government would have very small sense of their responsibility if they did not provide at least sufficient food in this country for man and beast &mdash;to use a country phrase.  What did the Minister require?  He required to get as much wheat, beet and vegetables for direct human consumption as would sustain the whole population until the following harvest arrives.  If there is a margin left over, os much the better.  In fact the Minister would want to see the cultivated area that, with a low return, would provide a sufficient quantity of food for man and beast.  In addition he would want to increase the production of barley, turnips and mangolds, and so on, for cattle fodder, and to a small extent, some of the latter for human food.  The Order does not go into this aspect of <Col N="1059" /> the case at all.  The Order says till one-eighth of the land, or, at least, one-eighth must be tilled.  We can see a position in which that would be complied with over the whole country, and we would have a surplus of some commodities whilst we would have a scarcity of others.  I think it is necessary, in order to produce for the nation, to use a bovine expression, a balanced ration for the people, that the Minister should take some steps, difficult I admit they are, to see that a sufficient balanced ration for the nation will be produced during these years while the war is on.  Whilst it is easy for the Minister to sit in his office and make this Order, I am sure the Minister's mind was examining its implications.</P>
      <P>This country this year is probably unfertile or probably less fertile than it has been during the lifetime of the present generation.  It is well known that during the last ten years fertilisers were used sparingly, one might say increasingly sparingly, because of the financial position of the population. I do not want to synchronise that with any Government that was in office.  I am speaking of the facts of the case. There is undoubtedly a shortage of fertilisers this year, though we are asked to till one-eighth or 12½ per cent. more than last year.  I wonder has the Minister in his calculation worked out mathematically that that one-eighth more, added to the production of last year, will give sufficient quantity of food for man and beast in this current year?  If that is the way he has arrived at his one-eighth, I am afraid he miscalculates. We may take it, generally speaking, that the land tilled in response to the ordinary farm economy in times past is more suited for tilling, and that it is the less arable part of a farmer's land will come under this additional tilling.  The land that will produce the best crops is that part of the land that the farmer usually tills. But now, in the less suitable part of his land, which under this order he must till, he must use more manure and more fertilisers than he did in years past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister proposes to have one-eighth more land tilled this year with <Col N="1060" /> 25 per cent. less artificial manures available, and even these not certain. I have this afternoon got in touch with my own manure merchant and others, and from all these I have got the same information&mdash;that there is only 25 per cent. of last year's supply available to them up to the 31st of this month, and that they are sold out of manures. There is not a bag of artificial manure available in Dublin at present.  That is the information I have got from inquiries made this afternoon.  As well as that, they do not know what is to happen in the future.  Not alone have they not any of these manures, but up to the present they have got no promise of having in future any artificial manures, except potassic super, xxx super phosphate and some basic slag.  I asked for muriate of potash, sulphate of ammonia and Semsol, and I was told I could not get them, and that the manure merchants have not been allocated any of them so far. That is a very serious position.</P>
    <P>I am not making a political speech. I am endeavouring to make an agricultural speech.  I hope the Minister will appreciate that, and take it at its true value.  I am not making the point that there is a shortage of all artificial manures, and a dearth of some of the most important ones in order to say that the Government are responsible. I want the Minister to take my points in that spirit.  Every progressive farmer who uses fertiliser wants to have it mixed.  Every progressive farmer knows the particular mixture that suits particular parts of his land.  My information is that we cannot get the component parts of a balanced manure to mix ourselves.  We cannot get muriate of potash, or sulphate of ammonia.  No one would be more glad than I would be if the Minister is able to tell me that I am wrongly informed on that point.</P>
    <P>Assuming that is correct, how does the Minister expect to have an increased return from the land?  I am not finding fault with the Minister for requiring an increased return.  It is absolutely essential, if we are to survive, that we must have an increased supply of food for man and beast.  I am putting it to the Minister that the <Col N="1061" /> breaking-up of grass land without fertilisers is not going to increase the yield.  If you break up an enormous lot of grass land, you will have more land tilled at greater expense, but with a considerably less average yield.  I should like to get an assurance from the Minister on these points as to fertilisers.</P>
    <P>There is another very important matter which has had its manifestations in the last few weeks.  Farmers generally are probably the most conservative element in the community, but they are the least bellicose element.  Whatever the Minister or his colleagues or anybody else may think of the strikes which we have had in the last couple of weeks, they are manifestations of something that is not healthy.  I am sure the Minister will agree with me when I say that it was surprising to find farmers taking that step of striking&mdash;wisely or unwisely, right or wrong.  There is something wrong there.  It is a very dangerous thing for the farming community to go on strike.  After all, as a class they are the people who own most of the fixed property in the country.  They went out on strike and, as follows all strikes, whether those in charge wish it or not, there was a certain amount of violence, and that is associated in the public mind with something that is tried to be put over with violence.  I am not concerned with that portion of it.  The point I want to impress on the Minister is that it was done and that there must be something wrong that prompted its doing.  What is that something?  It is very serious for the Minister, considering it was done subsequent to this Tillage Order being made.  I do not believe that this Order had anything to do with that strike, or that the strike was a reaction to the Tillage Order.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>It did not produce the strike.  It had something to do with the strike, but not in the sense that <Col N="1062" /> the Chair means.  The strike has a bearing on what the Minister requires from the Tillage Order.  The Minister is aware that the financial and credit position of agriculture is not what we would like it to be at present.  He knows that orders by the merchants who are importing, generally speaking, if not without exception, must be accompanied by cheques marked &ldquo;good&rdquo;.  These merchants in turn must get paid by the customers on a cash basis.  Even if the fertilisers were there, is the agricultural community in a position to trade in those circumstances?  I do not think they are.  I concede that this Tillage Order is nothing more than the situation demands, but it should be accompanied by credit facilities for the people who are asked to till, to buy implements if they were not tilling last year, and to buy seeds and fertilisers if they can get them.  That must be done on a cash basis.  The Minister, of course, had to insert a provision for a penalty if the Order is not complied with; but he should give the people a chance.  What has he done to provide credits?  You cannot get blood from a turnip.  If these people are not provided with credits, how can they comply with this Order?  Perhaps the Minister has in his mind some way by which the situation may be met.  That situation is more extensive than I thought it was up to recently.  I had the privilege&mdash; it was a privilege&mdash;to be at a meeting of the Chamber of Commerce recently, when the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who had just taken up office, told us, and from that sounding board told the country, that it would be his policy to endeavour to pay back to agriculture the debt which industry owed it.  I said then, and I repeat, that that was a very good speech only it was some years late.  I wonder has the Minister advised the Minister for Agriculture that he is going to co-operate with him to repay the debt due by industry to agriculture, and, if so, by what means is the payment to be made. I suggest that this is the opportunity and that they should find the means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gave the Minister a pamphlet some years ago containing a speech by Signor Mussolini to the Agricultural Council <Col N="1063" /> of Italy, delivered in Milan about 12 or 13 years ago.  Speaking to the Italian farmers, Signor Mussolini said: &ldquo;You have the maximum percentage of the arable land of Italy that can be allotted to wheat already allotted, but more wheat is required for bread for the Italian nation, and we require of you, by good farming, to increase the yield of wheat by a quintal per hectare. That is what I require of you.  Anything by way of credit accommodation or otherwise you require to produce that for the Italian nation, I guarantee to you.&rdquo;  I put it to the Minister&mdash;I am not saying that he is a Mussolini&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Can the Minister guarantee the farmers that if, this year and the years during which the war lasts, the farmers put up all the food required for human and animal life in this country, he will guarantee them adequate credits and financial security in their present position.  If he can guarantee that to them, the farmers of Ireland will respond as the farmers of Italy responded to Mussolini's appeal.  When the Agricultural Council of Italy met in Milan a year afterwards, Mussolini was there proudly to compliment the farmers on having increased the yield not by one quintal but by two.  The farmers here will double the food supply required if the Government give the assurance to them that Mussolini gave to the Italian farmers 12 or 13 years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On one occasion, in an organised effort, a few friends and I filled College Green with the biggest demonstration that ever assembled there.  I guarantee that I will bring as many farmers to applaud the Minister if he gives them a guarantee similar to what Mussolini gave to Italian farmers.  I am not appealing for special consideration for the agricultural population.  I am appealing because I am satisfied that what we all want and what the nation requires in this emergency cannot be got in any other way.  The farmers are not as great fools as many people think they are.  They have done foolish things but we have all done foolish <Col N="1064" /> things.  You will get a lot of horse sense from the farmer who has been communing with the soil all his life. He is looking at the prices which he has to pay during the present war for the things he requires that are not produced or made at home.  He knows that the cost of these things is soaring to the war level of 1914-1918 and the time-lag following the war period.  He finds that he has to pay high prices and that he is not getting correspondingly high prices for what he is producing. Price is, more or less, a relative matter.  The difference between your income and your outgoings is your profit or loss.  If one is high and the other high, it is much the same as if one is low and the other low.  In present circumstances, the agricultural population find that what they have to sell is low priced and that what they have to buy is high priced.</P>
    <P>They have learned a sad lesson from the last war.  During the last war, prices were high.  That is not so in this war.  The bitter lesson the farmer has learned from the last war has to do with the terrible aftermath that more than swept away his war profits. That aftermath was followed by a lot of other things in this country.  The Minister knows that the farmers, as a community, were always patriotic. When the Black and Tan war broke out, the shelter, the commissariat and, to a great extent, the transport for the flying columns were provided by the farmers.  Their houses were open to feed the columns and I do not think they ever got compensation.</P>
    <P>That internal trouble in the country was very costly to the economic life of the country, and the farmers lost considerably through that, but they did not grumble.  That period was followed by civil war and they then lost again, on the double.  When that was over they found that they were in the depths of financial and economic depression. Various things happened then up to 1932, when the economic war started and the farmer was left with practically nothing but his eyes to weep with.  Just as that was concluded, this war started.  You had debts accumulating all the time on agriculture in this country, and now, in those circumstances <Col N="1065" /> and in that setting, agriculture is asked to-day to obey this Tillage Order.  It is prepared to obey it, but my appeal to the Minister is to give agriculture a chance and a promise of security.</P>
    <P>What is the burden that agriculture has to bear to-day that it had not to bear in the last war?  It has to bear a legacy, variously estimated at from £15,000,000 to £20,000,000, of what is called frozen debt.  The farmer is blamed for having that, but the blame is not his.  The root of the trouble goes back to the Treasury Minute of the 15th December, 1919.  That produced the terrible aftermath of the Great War.  It was then decreed that the £, which was lent to the farmer, was worth about 8/- or 9/-, while it appreciated until it was worth 20/-. During that period of appreciation, prices fell, and the farmers' debt increased. The net result was this: That the farmer who borrowed in that period and before that period,&mdash;the farmer who borrowed 100 paper £'s from a bank, got, in fact, only 45 gold £'s, and in 1925 and subsequently he was asked to pay back 100 gold £'s for the 45 gold £'s that were lent to him.  In other words, he was asked to do the impossible.  That is the origin of the frozen debts.  I do not want to develop that in a debate of this kind, nor do I think I would be in order in doing so, and I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to go as far as I have gone in that matter, but the farmer is aware of that, and if he got the fat periods and the good prices now he could lay up a reserve that would tide him over the lean years that will be inevitable in the aftermath of this war.  The farmer is not getting that. Can the Minister guarantee credits for the farmers now?  I do not mean to say that the Minister should lend him £5 or £10, or anything of that sort, but can the Minister release ordinary bank trading credits to the agricultural community, such as existed in the last war? If not, why not?  If he and his Government are not in a position to do it, why do not they get into a position to do it?  It is not fair to hold the pistol to a man's head and tell him that he must do a certain amount of work, if he has not the wherewithal to live while he is <Col N="1066" /> doing that work, and what guarantee is there that, when agriculture produces all that is asked for in this Order and it is stored in our haggards or stores, and if the submarine war ceases and peace should come, and our ports are open to bring in cheap supplies of surplus agricultural produce from foreign countries, the farmer will get a remunerative price for what he is going to produce?</P>
    <P>There is one thing that the farmer knows, and that is that he will have to pay the costs he will incur in producing this food.  I do not think the Minister has treated the farming position fairly. I am not developing this for the farmers as a class.  I have big farming interests, but I have bigger commercial interests.  I realise, however, that for commerce and industry in this country our best market and our surest market is the purchasing power of agriculture, and now is the time for our Government to secure agriculture, not only during the time of the present war but, above all, in the aftermath of the war.</P>
    <P>I just looked up this afternoon the key to the credit position of this country, as it is now and as it was during the peak inflation during the previous war.  The note circulation in this country during the peak of the Great War was nearly £30,000,000; it is £11,500,000 to-day.  That is the key to the bankers' credit available.  The note issue in Great Britain to-day is slightly over £580,000,000&mdash;higher than ever it was during the previous war. These are all paper-inflated pounds; there is not a pennyworth of gold back of them.  I ask the Minister to weigh this position very carefully.  I have had experience of the Minister as a negotiator, as a receiver of deputations, and as a non-receiver of deputations, but I think it is up to him and his Government, if he wants to put this thing through, to take the farming population more into his confidence. They have grievances, not of their own making; they have grievances brought about by Government default.  It is up to the Government to help the farmers now, when it is expecting of agriculture a supreme effort.  The country is entitled to a supreme effort from agriculture, as it <Col N="1067" /> is from every other industry in the country.  I am sure it will get it from agriculture if agriculture is given a chance&mdash;if the farmers get the raw materials for their industry, and if they get credit facilities.  There is no reason why adequate credit facilities should not be available.  This is a creditor country, and the surplus that we command as a creditor country should be used for the defence of the country at the present time.  That defence must not be expressed in terms of chaser torpedo boats, coastal defence and five bombing planes, but in producing plenty of food to keep human and animal life going in this country.  That is the defence to which the credit of the country should be devoted.  I would ask the Minister to take a firmer stand in demanding a better share of public expenditure for agriculture than that Department has got up to now. Industry and commerce seem to get money any time they want it.  Agriculture requires it now in order to make this supreme effort which is asked of it.  I hope the Minister will succeed in getting those elementary facilities, which are absolutely essential if agriculture is to be able successfully to make the supreme effort which it is called upon to make during this time of emergency.  I formally move the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>In seconding this motion I should like to say that I am not opposed to the idea of increasing the area under tillage, and increasing agricultural production generally, but I think that, before any attempt is made to increase production on the land, a real effort should be made to put the farmers in a position to do so.  There is no use in disputing the fact that the farmer is not in a position to increase production at the present time.  He has not the capital to do so.  In addition to that, there is not a sufficient guarantee in regard to the price to be obtained for a considerable amount of the produce which it is necessary to get from the land.  I may be asked why it is that the farmer is not in a position to go into production more intensively. Some people may be inclined to suggest <Col N="1068" /> that that is due to neglect on the farmer's part, or to want of thrift or want of care in the husbanding of his resources during the past few years, but anybody who has any knowledge of agricultural conditions, anybody who has given the slightest attention to the state of agricultural prices and agricultural costs generally during the last six or seven years, must admit that it is physically impossible for the farmer to have any store of capital to enable him to increase production at the present time.</P>
      <P>The years from 1921 to 1929 were fairly difficult years for agriculture. During those years the farmer had no chance to accumulate savings; it was even difficult for him to make ends meet.  But we have got to realise that in 1929 the value of agricultural output was £20,000,000 higher than it was for five or six years of the present Government's administration.  When we remember that the farmers found it difficult to make ends meet during 1929 we will be forced to admit that, with his income reduced by £20,000,000 for five or six years, there can be no question whatever but that the entire resources of the industry must have been completely swept away.  I think the total value of agricultural output in 1929 was roughly £62,000,000.  In 1934 I think it was £38,000,000, while in 1933 it was slightly less, and in 1935 slightly more, but on an average the value of agricultural output for the five years beginning in 1932 was £20,000,000 down as compared with 1929.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There you had a loss of £100,000,000. Was the agricultural industry in a position to suffer that loss, and still have sufficient capital to carry on?  That is the question which the Minister should ask himself to-day.  I think if we look at the figures of national income also we will find that the income of those engaged in the agricultural industry was less by approximately £20,000,000 a year for five or six years.  It is that accumulated loss over that period which has caused the state of poverty and discontent which exists in rural Ireland to-day.  The farmer finds that it is impossible for him to make ends meet, and, although the prices to-day <Col N="1069" /> may be improving, the farmer is not in a position to take full advantage of that improvement.  Therefore, if the Government is prepared to carry out the suggestion made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce that something should be done to repay the debt due to agriculture, I think the first step that should be taken is to provide credit for the farmer to enable him to increase production.</P>
    <P>It may be said that the farmer has at his disposal ample means of obtaining credit; that he has the banks, the Agricultural Credit Corporation, and various other commercial institutions. But it must be remembered that the only farmer who can obtain credit from the banks or from the Agricultural Credit Corporation is the farmer who is in a thoroughly sound position.  The farmer who is in financial difficulties, the farmer who, as a result of the years through which he has passed, is not in a position punctually to meet the demands for annuities and rates, will obtain no credit whatever either from the banks or from the Agricultural Credit Corporation. As that type of farmer is in the majority at the present time, some reasonable effort should be made to meet his requirements.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say there is no use in attempting to finance the farmer who is insolvent, but I think the Minister should bear in mind that during the last century we had a very conservative British Government ruling in this country and we must remember that when the first Land Purchase Acts were passed the Irish farmers generally were in a very insolvent condition, yet, notwithstanding the fact that they were unable to meet demands for rates or rents, the British Government had sufficient courage and foresight to advance £100,000,000 to enable land purchase to be carried into effect in this country.  If the British Government were prepared to trust the Irish farmers to that extent, surely an Irish Government should be prepared to provide at least sufficient capital to enable the farmers to get back into production. That is the first essential in connection with increased tillage.  Without capital it is absolutely impossible for the farmer to increase production.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1070" /> At the minimum, in order to till 12½ per cent. of 100 acres properly and to carry on the system of mixed farming and stock-raising&mdash;to do so economically and profitably&mdash;it would be necessary for a farmer to keep at least two men, and the wages of the two men &mdash;I assume the wages are now going to be increased&mdash;would be at least £150.  How is a farmer, who has no capital, to meet such a demand?  From what source will he be provided with £3 a week for two men while he is carrying on increased production?  He cannot do anything unless the Government are prepared to do what the British Government did in the last century, provide sufficient capital for the farmer to enable him to expand his industry.  If the Government have not the courage to take that step, courage which a very conservative British Government displayed on another occasion, then they are not fit to be the Government of an agricultural country.</P>
    <P>There is widespread discontent amongst the farming community.  That discontent was apparent last week when there was a spontaneous nationwide demonstration of protest.  That demonstration would never have taken place over such a wide area unless the feeling of discontent was there, unless the farmers felt they were being ill-treated and they were not getting justice under the present Government. Farmers, just as any other body of citizens, are prepared to meet the Government fairly if the Government meet them in the same spirit.  The representatives of the organised farmers met the Government at the outbreak of the European War and offered their fullest co-operation in any measures that might be taken to develop the agricultural industry, but it was stipulated that co-operation would be conditional upon the Government making a reasonable attempt to meet the farmers, to meet the minimum demands of the farming community.  What were the minimum demands?  The farmers demanded, first of all, that they should have security of tenure, a definite assurance that they would not be disturbed in the possession of their holdings.</P>
    <P>The Government may say it is necessary <Col N="1071" /> to have power to acquire agricultural land in the national interest and to ensure that the land will be used to the best national advantage.  That argument has been to a great extent swept aside by the introduction of compulsory tillage.  To-day the Government wield two weapons over the head of the farmer.  They have not only the power to compel him to till a certain portion of his land, but they also have the power to acquire his holding.  There is no reason why the State should hold these two menaces over the head of any of its citizens.  If the Government feel it necessary to have power to compel a farmer to till a certain proportion of his holding, they should in all justice relieve him of the menace of having his holding compulsorily acquired.  If the Government have the power to see that a farmer carries on a certain amount of production, then there is no reason why they should have the power to take over the holding.</P>
    <P>Having introduced compulsory tillage, the Government should accompany it with a guarantee that the farmer will be left in undisputed possession.  That is one of the demands which the farming community put up to the Government, and it is a demand which the Government should have fairly met. You may have noticed that the farmers did not demand the withdrawal of the Compulsory Tillage Order.  They were prepared to submit to that Order, provided they had security of tenure and that their other demands were met. Increased production can never be brought about unless there is close co-operation between the farmer and the Government, and that close co-operation cannot be achieved unless there is a feeling of confidence amongst the farming community that they are going to be fairly treated.  The Government should meet the representatives of the organised farmers and secure from them a promise of active co-operation. They can secure that promise if they are prepared to meet just and reasonable demands.</P>
    <P>The farmers also demand that something should be done in regard to the arrears of land annuities which accrued during the years when agricultural produce <Col N="1072" /> was unsaleable, when the farming community were selling their produce for £20,000,000 less than in 1929.  I hold strongly that it is time the question of land annuities should be removed from the arena of political dispute.  It was not the farmers who introduced this question into the arena of political contention; it was the present Government Party and it should be the duty of that Party before they go out of office&mdash;and they go out very soon&mdash;to put this matter right and to secure now and for all time that there will never again be any dispute in regard to the payment of land annuities.  They can do that by meeting the farmers' request to fund all the arrears that accrued during the depressed years, over a certain period, so that the farmer will be in a position to meet his payments regularly in the future.  It would be a very good bargain for the Government if they met the farmers in this respect and said to them: &ldquo;If you give a pledge that your organisation will do everything possible to ensure punctual payments of annuities, we will meet the demand for the funding of the arrears and we will all start afresh and the whole question of annuities will be buried for all time.&rdquo;  That would be a reasonable attitude for the Government to adopt, one that will probably secure greater revenue in respect of the land annuities than at the present time, because once the farmer is put in a secure position, once he has security that his stock may not be seized on the following month, he will be in a better position to go into production.  He will do so more enthusiastically and in better spirits, and in this way he will be able to meet the current instalments of the land annuities that may become due.  That would be better for the farmer, for the Land Commission, and for the country generally, and this question which has been brought into the arena of political disputes by the present Government, will, for all time, be laid to rest.</P>
    <P>Again, farmers have suggested to the Government and appealed to the Government that the financing of local government be put upon an equitable basis.  Everybody has agreed that agriculture is bearing more than its just <Col N="1073" /> share of the cost of local administration. Therefore, it is the duty of the Government to meet the farmers' demands in that respect, and to abolish rates upon agricultural land.  The farmer is prepared to pay rates upon his other property, upon his buildings, just as townspeople are paying.  He is not prepared to have his sole source of income excessively taxed as it is at present.  We have been told that it was only the big farmers who would derive benefit from derating.  I know of my own personal knowledge that the small farmers throughout the length and breadth of the country are more enthusiastic about this demand for complete derating than even the big farmers. For that reason I suggest, in order to secure the active co-operation of the farming community, that the Government should meet these demands fairly and honestly.  By so doing, they will secure the active co-operation of the farming community, which they require in order to make agriculture a success.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt whatever that agriculture in this country for the past 50 years has been a failure.  But it has been a particularly disastrous failure for the past five or six years.  Nobody can deny that every branch of agricultural production has gone down.  The area under tillage at the present time is less than one-third of what it was in 1851.  The entire agricultural production has declined.  Nothing has been done by the present Government to improve the position.  The prices which farmers have been obtaining for their live stock and tillage products are £20,000,000 less than in 1929.  We know that in 1929 it was barely possible for the farmer to exist.  Having regard to that fact, one would expect that all the energies of the present Government should be directed to securing the active support and co-operation of the farming community in increasing production.  I do not think that anybody will contend that the present Government has made any reasonable attempt to secure the co-operation of the farming community in their policy of increasing production. We do know that the representatives of the organised farmers met the <Col N="1074" /> Government at the outbreak of the present war.  They offered the Government their support and their help in promoting increased production.  To what extent has the Government met their demands?  As I have said, their demands have been turned down completely. We were offered an agricultural consultative council.  That council was thrown to the farmers as a sort of sop.  But on this council, the Irish Farmers' Federation, which is representative of the entire farming community&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is an organisation which, no matter what the Minister may think, will continue to represent agriculture.  At present, as I have said, the agricultural community feel that they have been cheated and betrayed by the present Government. The sacrifices which they made during the economic war have been completely ignored.  No recompense whatever has been given to the farmers for those sacrifices.  No recompense has been given to them for the sacrifices which they had to bear to finance the establishment of new industries, many of which are unproductive and unprofitable. The Minister claims a considerable amount of credit for the fact that agricultural prices have increased slightly since last year.  But agricultural prices are still comparatively low.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact has to be faced that the farmers have suffered through a period of five or six years when agricultural prices were little more than half the cost of production.  The accumulated losses of those years are pressing heavily on the agricultural community and preventing them from playing the part which they would like to play in increasing production.  There is no doubt that production can be increased. We have a position at present in which there is an increasing demand for such products as pigs and poultry.  There is an export market for those products, and there is no reason why production on those lines could not be expanded, provided the farmers had sufficient capital to go into production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A farmer cannot hope for increased production in any line at the present time, without growing the greater part of the food-stuffs required on his own holding.  Therefore, in order to increase production in pigs and poultry, it will be necessary to increase the acreage under potatoes, oats, barley, and other feeding-stuffs.  What chance has the unfortunate farmer with inferior land, who perhaps had his last <Col N="1077" /> crop seized, and who has very little stock, to increase his acreage under oats, potatoes, and the other crops required?  He has not the capital to do it.  He has not got the stock to enable him to carry on increased production. No attempt is being made by the Government to meet that farmer fairly and honestly.  It is no use for the Minister to go down to Rathdrum and tell an audience of rate collectors and sheep-scab inspectors and people of that kind&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not think there is any citizen who is as anxious to meet his demands and pay his way and be independent as the farmer.  It is the policy of the present Government, the policy of destroying the agricultural industry, of destroying the basic stock of the farmer, the policy of requiring the calves to be slaughtered, the policy of compelling a farmer to sacrifice his stock at less than one-quarter of their value, which has put the farmer in a position that he is not able to pay his way.  The farmer would like nothing better at present than to get back to a position in which he would be able to meet the demands for land annuities, and the fair and just demands of the State in regard to taxation.  He would like to be able to meet the business people who provide him with credit. At present he is not able to do that, and because he is not able to do it, you have widespread discontent.  As I said, the Minister went down to Rathdrum and tried to make this a sectarian matter.

There is a natural tendency for them to join these organisations, and they should not be discouraged from doing so, and I think the Minister is not serving a useful national purpose in discouraging them from doing so.</P>

      <P>This policy of increased tillage depends entirely for its success on the amount of co-operation which the Minister will secure from the farming community.  The Minister will not secure that active co-operation unless he is prepared to meet the farmers fairly and decently, to meet the reasonable requests of the farmer, and to respect and treat fairly any organisation of farmers.  If he provides the necessary capital for increased tillage and guarantees that the price of agricultural produce as a result of this increased tillage will be fair and just there will be a market for this increased production.

We know that certain vegetables were produced during the present year, and that it was found there was no market for them.  That may arise in connection with other tillage products.  It would be well if somebody would advise the Minister and ensure that he would meet the farmers fairly and provide an adequate market for any increased production.  These are, briefly, the requests these farmers have made to the Government: They want the Government to provide sufficient capital to enable the farmer to increase production. The British Government was willing to provide £100,000,000 for agriculture during the last century.  The farmers want a fair system of taxation by abolishing the rates on agricultural land, as the Government Party promised to do when seeking office.  They want a fair settlement of the land annuity question.  When the Minister does that, I am sure he will have the active co-operation of the farming community in promoting increased agricultural production.</P>

      <P>One could discuss Deputy Belton's motion with, perhaps, a good deal of assistance and information to the agricultural community, but it is my candid opinion that those who talk as Deputy Cogan talked here <Col N="1080" /> to-night are doing a great disservice to the farming community&mdash;one of the greatest that could be done at present. I do not think I ever listened to anything more demoralising than the Deputy's statement.  He knows as well as I know that if it were possible to operate these fantastic credit schemes the Government would do so at once. Is it not an overdose of credit and falling markets that the farmers are suffering from?  They are suffering in Denmark, too.  If credit is the golden key, I am afraid it is one of the most dangerous things anyone could preach to the farmers.  Deputies talked about credit to farmers when even the late Government had to subsidise agricultural products in the years 1929, 1930 and 1931.  The reason we got into power so rapidly was because the farmers were up against an impossible situation.  Their prices were rapidly falling.  That was quite natural.  There was no way out of that difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Reilly</NameTxt>
      <P>This nonsense, in which the people who preach it do not believe themselves, is causing unnecessary unrest amongst farmers.  Credit depends entirely on the price one can get for one's produce.  If prices improve during this war, I have no doubt there will be plenty of credit for farmers who are credit-worthy.  Unfortunately, we have to abide by these rules and regulations&mdash;which is most objectionable at times.  At other times, it is a good thing they are in existence.  If, during the late war, these rules and regulations were more strictly observed, I do not think we would have the many difficulties we have to-day amongst the farming community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cogan would like the public to believe that all the difficulties arose because we got into power or because the late Government did not do something in their last three or four years in office.  It is entirely wrong to ask farmers to believe that.  Farmers know <Col N="1081" /> perfectly well that the price of the products they sell on the British market depends entirely on the price British manufacturers can get for their products. Agricultural produce from here, Denmark, South America or any other country is nothing more than raw material.  Its price regulates the wages and the wages regulate the price at which the British manufacturer can sell his products all over the world. We may have here, if it is allowed to take place, a profusion of credit at a later stage.  The more the submarines are active, the more likely we are to have a monopoly of the British market for the time being.  It is very unfortunate that the financial system is as it is and that it has collapsed in that way, but there is not a bit of use in holding out hopes to the farmers that they will get credit <i>ad lib</i> and that it is going to put them in a paradise. The majority of farmers know that that is not the case.  They know that if they could use their credits economically and profitably, they might be of benefit to them.  If farmers get credit this time, many of them will watch the last day and they will see that whatever money they have will be in the bank and not in stock.  When such gambles as this go on, it is entirely wrong to raise an agitation for something that cannot be got.  Is there any member on the opposite side who believes that credits for farmers would be a good thing at present?</P>

      <P>I do not think that anybody will disagree that, in the conditions under which we may have to live, there should be production enough here to feed our people and to feed our animals and have some surplus to export, if necessary.  If there was not compulsion, I do not believe that we <Col N="1083" /> would have sufficient food produced here in this country, and I believe that, if there were a run on live stock, it would be extremely difficult here to get sufficient produced.  Consequently, compulsion was not introduced without due consideration, and I am quite sure that many members of the Government were not satisfied that that should have been done.  I was one of those who did not believe that we should have compulsory tillage, but as time went on, and as I saw the war situation developing, as it did develop and as it is likely to develop, then I believed that it was the right thing to do, and I am quite sure that anybody who realises what the position may be here in a month's or two months' time would agree that there should be a definite amount of agricultural produce here.  We hold an enormous amount of live stock&mdash;pigs, fowl, horses, cattle, and so on&mdash;and it would not be possible under present production to feed all those, and, in all probability, if prices for live stock suddenly improved, we would not have sufficient the following year to feed the young live stock in this country.  It is essential, therefore, that a certain amount of compulsory tillage should take place here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, in order to do that, I admit that capital is necessary, and I am not going to agree with anybody here who says that farmers do not want capital. It is quite obvious that farmers want capital.  It is quite obvious to every one of us that the bulk of the farmers of this country are not sufficiently capitalised to meet any extra production or to be able even to feed the present population of this country.  There are certain difficulties there, however.  We have a section of the community here, quite a number of whom were rather vocal a week or two ago about having guaranteed prices for certain of their products, and who were joining with another section of the community on all these fantastic things about de-rating, credits, and so on.  The point is this: What type of credit would Deputy Cogan, if he were a member of a Government, be prepared to stand over?  What type of credit would he be prepared to give, or what type of <Col N="1084" /> assistance could he give, and where is the money to come from?</P>

Deputy Cogan and other Deputies know that just as well as I do, and they know that there must be security before credit can be given. I said already that I know that the bulk of the farmers here are short of credit and short of capital, and that they have not the security with which <Col N="1085" /> to get capital.  The main part of the security is entirely a question of better prices and a market for their produce. Let us hope that they will have that market.  That might not be a good thing for some other countries, but let us hope that our farmers will get that market, and if there is that market you will find that the credit problem will solve itself and that there will be sufficient credit for those who are in any way credit-worthy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in agreement with the necessity of increasing land under cultivation in this country during the emergency, but I am not in agreement with the methods adopted by the Minister for increasing profitably the land under cultivation in this country.  There is a big percentage of land in this country that undoubtedly will produce more food in cultivation than out of it, but I am convinced&mdash;and I think that anybody who knows anything about the country, and particularly certain districts of the country, must admit&mdash; that there is a considerable amount of rich grass land that would not be profitable under cultivation, and that, in fact, would show a dead loss the moment it was put in cultivation.  I suggest that it is in the national interests that land should be kept in such a state that it will show the greatest profit to the nation.</P>
      <P>If the Minister was looking for increased production for human food and for animal food, I think he should have looked to the tillage areas for that increase.  I, personally, come from a tillage area and I am a tillage farmer, and I believe that it is only in the tillage districts and only on tillage farms, where you have a tradition of tillage, that you are going to get really good and profitable results.  On the tillage farm you have the farmer who knows his job and who is skilled in the work of cultivation, and the agricultural worker there knows how to produce the best results.  You have all the equipment that is necessary for tillage in those areas, and it is not going to cost very much extra to increase production in those areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, what is the position in the non-tillage areas?  First of all, you have a <Col N="1086" /> complete lack of equipment.  You have a complete lack of the knowledge required to handle the land properly and to till the land properly so as to give the best results, and I do not think you have the will to do that either. That is completely lacking, and the will to cultivate is very essential if you are going to produce good results. There is no doubt about the fact that there is a big percentage of the land in this country on which, if it is put into cultivation, since it is so rich and rank, the cereal crops are going to fall and rot.  There is a good deal of old grass land which, when the cereal is sown, will undoubtedly suffer from very severe attacks of wireworm.  I do not think there is sufficient knowledge amongst the people to deal with that sort of pest.  As I said before, I do not think you are going to have the will to deal with that sort of pest.  For that reason I am impressed by the methods adopted by the British Government in dealing with their Compulsory Tillage Order.  They obviously learned something from their experience during the Great War.  Evidently we did not profit by the experience of the Great War.  The British are setting up committees to decide whether or not it is in the national interests to put the land into cultivation in certain districts.  If there is rich, rank grass land, which is more profitable under grass, it is the policy of the British Government at the present time to leave that land in its present state.  I think that policy is certainly a very wise one, and it would show wisdom if the same policy were applied to our problem here.</P>
    <P>I admit that there is a necessity to increase the production of animal food here.  I agree that it will probably be exceedingly difficult to import animal foods, like maize and so on, and that we must provide for that difficulty.  As I said, in the tillage districts you have practically all the equipment that is required.  In those big tillage districts most of the ploughing and cultivation of land is done by mechanised methods, and the equipment is all there.  In the non-tillage districts at the present time you have people buying tractors and trying to get the equipment that is <Col N="1087" /> necessary.  I am aware that there has been a big number of tractors sold to those people, and that the necessary equipment is not there, and cannot be got.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware that it is impossible to get tractor ploughs at the present time. People who have bought new tractors have been waiting two or three months to secure ploughs, and they have not yet got them.  The time is getting on; it is necessary to have the land turned up, so that the weather would react on the soil and make it mellow; so that the soil would become compact during the winter period, and settle down of its own accord.  If the necessary implements are not made available immediately, the valuable effects of weather conditions on the soil are going to be lost.  Has the Minister made any attempt to secure those very essential implements&mdash;tractor ploughs, harrows, disc harrows, rollers, and all the up-to-date implements that are necessary if the farmers are to be properly equipped for the cultivation of their land?</P>
    <P>Another thing which strikes me about this Compulsory Tillage Order is that in districts where you have not even the ordinary equipment&mdash;outside of tractor equipment altogether&mdash;sufficient horses may not be available. Remember, the number of working horses in the country has fallen off enormously.  They have been replaced by tractors in the tillage districts.  I believe it will be very difficult to secure enough horses.  Those are problems to which I do not know whether or not the Minister or his Department has paid any attention.  I suggest, first of all, that, in order to get the best results, you must have the people willing to co-operate.  You will only get that co-operation in the tillage areas where you have all the necessary equipment, all the necessary knowledge, and a tradition of tillage.  Where that does not exist, I do not think it is going to be in the national interests to use any compulsion.  If the will is not there you are not going to get results.  A man will go half-heartedly about the job; in fact, he will have no heart at all in the job, and will simply <Col N="1088" /> comply with the Order to the very minimum.  He will be careless about the attention that a crop may require at a particular stage, especially in old grass land.</P>
    <P>Any man who has experience of tillage knows that it requires a good deal of rolling, especially at certain periods.  Under very dry weather conditions, when you have east winds and when there is a great possibility of wire worm attack, you can practically lose a crop in a week.  With the necessary attention that crop can be saved.  If you have the necessary equipment, the right type of roller, and if continuous attention is given to it, you can hold the crop in the land.  That is the type of technical knowledge which is necessary for proper tillage. I believe that in the dairying districts and in the grass districts that type of essential expert knowledge is completely lacking.  In the long run it would be more profitable for this country to have that land under grass, producing something for which we are bound to have a good market during the emergency period, a market with a progressive price.  I am not worried about the attempt that is being made by the British Government to control prices.  We were told by Deputy O'Reilly that what really fixes the price in the British market is what the industrialist gets for his output.  We all know that, if the present situation continues, supply and demand will fix the price.  If there is a real scarcity of the necessary commodities, then they will have to pay.</P>

I suggest to the Minister that the land in this country which is more suitable for the production of that type of article is going to be more profitable in the long run if it is allowed to produce that type of article.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think I made it fairly clear what my views are.  The Minister knows my opinion as to how the matter stands.  As regards this question of artificial manures, which was raised by Deputy Belton, they constitute a raw material that is absolutely essential, probably more essential in the areas where you have old tillage land, worn land, where you will not get a decent crop without a very liberal dressing of artificial manures.  My information is different from Deputy Belton's.  I understand there is a possibility of getting potash salts, and that is the particular constituent that we were worrying about a month or so ago.  We were more or less agreed that there was a reasonable quantity of superphosphate and possibly nitrate, but the supply of potash was doubtful.  I understand now that it is possible to get potash salts through Belgium and we are actually getting some in at the moment.  We are all glad to hear that, because we cannot carry on tillage without artificial manure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to seed barley, oats and wheat, I referred to this matter yesterday and the Minister told me he thought there would be sufficient seed barley available.  I called the attention of the Minister to the fact that there has been an enormous fall since last year in the acreage of land under barley.  The area was 117,000 acres in 1938 and it has gone down to 71,000 acres this year.  When you take into account the amount of barley Messrs. Guinness want out of that production, it leaves a very narrow margin for seed barley.  There must be a fairly big percentage of that barley not suitable for seeding purposes.  We know that Messrs. Guinness get the best barley offered and the percentage that is suitable <Col N="1090" /> for seed must, in the circumstances, be small.  I think the quantity would be narrowed down very considerably. If we want a reasonable amount of land put under barley, I think it is a matter that should be immediately inquired into.  I suggest the Department should ascertain what barley is available for seed.</P>
    <P>In the matter of oats, my experience is that in my part of the country there is little or no oats available for seed purposes.  It would be an extraordinary situation if we had our people starting to plough the land, getting it ready for sowing in the Spring, and then find that there is a scarcity of seed and that some of the farmers might not be able to secure seed.</P>
    <P>I come again to the question of credit.  I understand that there is available, through the Minister's Department, a certain amount of credit for purchasing equipment under this Tillage Order.  The maximum is £100. That is no good; it is very little good, anyway, for a man who wants to buy modern equipment, such as a tractor and implements.  It is less than one-third of what would be required to buy equipment.  It would be very little use at the present moment, even for the purpose of buying a pair of horses, a plough and other equipment.  Anyway, you will not get the money for the purpose of purchasing horses; you will get it for implements only.  The amount is not sufficient.  If you want people to till one-eighth of their land, you must provide them with credit facilities.  There are a good many farmers who have not the necessary capital, and tillage requires capital. It means investing a certain amount of money in implements, working and seeding the land, and all the other operations that are normally required in order to produce a crop.  There is no return for the farmer until he sells his crop.</P>
    <P>What is the farmer to do who has not the capital to buy the necessary equipment and seeds?  There is very little use in passing compulsory orders if you do not provide the necessary finance.  Farmers who have not capital cannot carry out this order.  That <Col N="1091" /> aspect of the case ought to get the Minister's closest attention.  The work cannot be done without some assistance, the provision of capital, and some serious attempt ought to be made to provide that capital.  I think the Minister will agree that £100 would be very little use to the people on the larger farms if they have to cultivate one-eighth of their land.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that the Compulsory Tillage Order is not contested, and the points raised by Deputy Belton and others are points of detail. Some Deputies may hold that there are certain provisions that are not as they should be.  Others hold that the Government should make it possible for farmers to till.  There is no necessity to go into the order, but I would like to tell Deputy Belton that the order does not compel any farmer to till land that is not arable.  If the Deputy looks at the definition of a holding he will see that.  A holding is defined as the land which can be cultivated.  Any land on the holding that is not fit for cultivation is not taken into account in making up the one-eighth.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They know what good land is like, anyway.  I agree with Deputy Belton that we should have an increase of wheat, beet, oats and barley.  There are certain other crops that Deputy Belton thought we should specify a little more, but there does not seem to be any great anxiety over <Col N="1092" /> an increase in mangolds and turnips, because I do not anticipate that there will be any more animals in the country in the next couple of years than in the last few years.  So it is to replace maize and imports of wheat that we grow our crops.  Therefore, we should aim particularly at cereal crops like wheat to replace imported wheat and barley and oats to replace maize. Deputy Belton asked if one-eighth additional was enough increase.  One-eighth would not be enough to feed the amount of live stock Deputy Belton spoke about.  But we visualise that there will not be a complete blockade. If there is a complete blockade we will have plenty of meat.  We will have more meat than we can dispose of.  We can eat meat three or four times a day if we like.  But I do think it would be difficult to bring in a tillage Order that would make us absolutely safe, even if there were a complete blockade of such produce as wheat, sugar and so on. Barley is to replace maize coming in, and the amount of additional tillage necessary to replace the wheat, sugar and maize that would ordinarily be coming in would be about 1,000,000 acres.  It would be impossible in one year to get that much of an increase, but we may aim at it in two or three years.</P>
      <P>With regard to manures, the position is, if you like, somewhat improved since I spoke on this matter the last time in this House.  I think we will have sufficient nitrogenous manures.  I do not think there will be any difficulty about that.  We will have a fair quantity of potash in some form or another, but it looks as if there will be a scarcity of potash.  It will not be coming in and so there will be less potash than last year.  With regard to phosphates, which are less important, the position is that if shipping facilities can be got, we will have phosphates.  But so far phosphates are not coming in very rapidly because it is difficult to get the shipping.  If they are brought in at the present cost of shipping the increased charges would make the prices very much higher than last year.  On the whole, I would say that the position looks better than it looked some time ago.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We may reach somewhere between 60 per cent. and 80 per cent. of last year's supply.  I would not say that was too bad for potash if we have a sufficiency of nitrogenous manures and phosphates.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It may come in as muriate of potash.  At the moment potash is going into compound manures because it looked at the beginning as if the quantity would be so small that we could not divide it amongst the farmers and it was thought better to use it up in compound manures.  If we could let the farmer make his own compounds it would be much better.  I agree with Deputy Belton in that, but when the quantity was so small we thought it better to use it in compound manures. Deputy Belton has spoken of the financial position of agriculture.  He says the position is not as we would all like it to be.  I agree with that. We would all like to see the position greatly improved.  Deputy Belton says there is a stringency along the lines that the importer has to pay cash down and he demands cash down from the wholesaler who demands cash down from the retailer, who in turn demands cash down from the farmer.  I do not know if that is altogether true, but I think Deputy Belton is right to some extent, that there is more stringency with regard to finances in the last five or six years.  That is a matter about which we must see that something is done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards seeds and manures, the best system is that system of the merchant giving credit because the merchant knows his man.  I do not think any honest Deputy&mdash;and all Deputies are honest&mdash;would seriously propose that every farmer should get money handed out to him to buy seeds and manures.  We all know that great numbers of them do not require it.  It is hard enough to get money, and we should be as careful as possible with the money we get.  Therefore, if we <Col N="1094" /> could get the old system working, get the merchant to give credit to the farmer for his seeds and manures, that would be the ideal system.  Deputy Belton says that if I can guarantee the credit and return to the farmer for his crop, that he will put up a statue to me in College Green.  That part of it is all right, but there is no use in putting up a statue to me when I am dead. We will manage this matter as best we can.  As regards prices, I think the farmer need have no worry about prices.  Very good prices are fixed for the crops used for human food&mdash;wheat and beet.  As far as food-stuffs for animals are concerned, I think the farmer can reasonably look forward to fair prices for our live stock and livestock products.  If he feeds his corn and other crops to his cattle and poultry, he is certain of getting good prices, and, so far as I can see, he is not probably worrying about prices.  I did not follow Deputy Belton fully in his discourse on currency, credit, and so on.  It appeared to me that his argument led to this conclusion: that it is not good to give credit, because we would be giving credit to an expanding market and that there would probably be a tightening of credit, so that if the farmer borrows now he will, after the war, pay more than he borrowed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, so that it should not happen this time as it did the last time.  Very well, if that can be done. Before he finished, Deputy Belton said that agriculture should get its fair share of Government expenditure.  I never said in this House that farmers have been too well treated in any way. In fact, the farmers deserve a good time, if they can get it within the next few years, and I do hope that they will get it.  If we had speeches like those of Deputy Belton's speeches which are reasonable and show evidence of trying to get at the real position, we could achieve something.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But when one comes to Deputy Cogan's speech we can get nothing that will achieve anything for the farmers. It must be remembered that a good deal of money has been handed out for <Col N="1095" /> agriculture.  The farmers may not have got enough, but halving the annuities was a benefit.  Money was paid out on export bounties even since the ending of the economic war.  Money was paid out in the present financial year and in the last financial year; after the economic war was settled we were paying £750,000 a year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is right, less than half.  As to what it costs to grow wheat, a farmer may hold that he was not <Col N="1096" /> getting a profit out of wheat-growing, but the consumer, on the other hand, can claim that he paid a very big subsidy to the farmer for growing wheat, and the same applies to beet. These are very big items of finance. Even though Deputies opposite may say that we did not do enough for the farmers, at least let them not say that we are doing nothing, because the taxpayers and the consumers are doing a great deal for agriculture.  It may not be enough, but they are doing a great deal.  Let us at least deal with the facts as they are, and not make rambling speeches with no point in them, like the speech Deputy Cogan made; because there is no point that Deputy Cogan made that you could not drive a coach and four through about 17 times.  Deputy Cogan, of course, I admit when making his speech had one eye on the polling booth at the next election.  It is a pity he did not keep the other eye on the clock, because, if he did, the rest of us would have more time to talk.</P>
      <P>There is no use in the &lsquo;Farmers&rsquo; Federation saying that they represent the farmers.  They may represent 4 per cent or 5 per cent. of them, and the other 95 per cent. are going to cooperate in this tillage policy, because they are reasonable.  First of all, if they think they are doing a good thing from a national point of view, they will do it; and, secondly, if they think they are doing a good thing for themselves by getting a reasonable price, they will do this tillage.  When you listen to a speech like that of Deputy Cogan's, naturally you must have compulsion for the 4 per cent. or 5 per cent. who are represented by the Farmers' Federation.</P>

    <P>The Deputy accused me of making a sectarian speech in Rathdrum.  I talked about the ascendancy.  The ascendancy are not all Protestants. There are some Catholics in the ascendancy.

I am not interested in that sort of sectarianism; Deputy Cogan may be, but I am not.  I do not go to Rathdrum or anywhere else to <Col N="1097" /> talk about Catholics or Protestants. I never did it.  I talked about people being anti-Irish and pro-Irish, or pro-English and anti-English.

As to County Meath, there is some grass land in Meath which would not be as profitable under crops as in grass, but here is the point.  I asked for technical and expert assistance on that point before we brought in this Tillage Order.  I was told that that question was carefully considered in 1917.  It was again considered very carefully this time, and it was considered by people who are not swayed by anything except just the point put before them, that is, whether it was reasonable to ask the people to till.  They said that there is not a farmer in Meath one-eighth of whose land could not be ploughed profitably.  That is the answer I got.</P>

On the other hand, there was a fair amount of oats damaged.  Deputies, especially in the eastern countries, will remember that there was a very bad week at the end of August which damaged a good deal of oats.

      <P>The biggest trouble we have is with regard to spring wheat seed.  We have not enough spring wheat seed, probably, if there is a very big drive for the sowing of spring wheat. We are trying to get some in.  I cannot say for certain yet that we will succeed <Col N="1099" /> in getting a big quantity.  That is why we are appealing to the farmers to sow winter wheat, because there may be a scarcity of seed for spring wheat.  I do not think there need be any fear about the others.  As to the £100 limit for machinery, the Department of Agriculture will give up to £40 on the old conditions; that is, that a person writes in, giving two solvent securities, an inquiry is put through, and if the man is a decent man and his securities are all right, the loan is granted.</P>

      <P>There must be something against them.  I got a table as to the time taken to grant these loans and I found that some loans are actually settled up within a week, so that it does not take very much time.  Then from £40 to £100 will be given by the Agricultural Credit Corporation in the same way.  The application comes in to the Department, the applicant is asked for two securities, an inquiry is made, and if the report is all right, the Agricultural Credit Corporation is asked to issue the loan, and they do so. There is no delay.  We have not any loan scheme for sums over £100, because I considered that any farmer who wanted to spend more than £100 on implements was a big farmer.  He was probably going to buy tractor machinery or to buy a reaper and binder.  It would be very hard to make up £100 in machinery, apart from tractor machinery.  The cost of the whole outfit would scarcely come to £100.  It was, therefore, a case of tractor machinery, and I considered that it was really a matter for the Agricultural Credit Corporation in the ordinary way, or for a joint stock bank.  I think a farmer who is in the position that he would want tractor machinery must have a big farm; that he has probably a fair reputation with his bank, and should be able to go to them and get what he wants.</P>

      <P>I am glad that this motion was put down.  We have had <Col N="1100" /> the position fairly well clarified, but I should still like if the Minister would endeavour to provide the credits necessary. I do not want &ldquo;credits&rdquo; used in this sense to be confused with loans. It is far more beneficial to this country for the farmers to be able to go into the banks and get loans.  Why does not the Government, and particularly the Minister for Finance, meet the bankers and ask them what they want in order to restore banking confidence in the agricultural industry?  The greatest curse to farmers would be to give them too much money in the shape of loans.  I never mentioned the word &ldquo;loans&rdquo; or &ldquo;subsidies&rdquo; in my speech proposing this motion.  I did refer to the expansion of credit.  We should have the same expansion of credit here that they have in Britain.  Why does not the Government look after our credit?  Why does it not utilise to the full, for the benefit of this country, our creditor position?  I do not want to go into this matter in the few minutes left, but the Minister should concentrate on it.  Has the Minister considered protection or compensation for the agricultural community who invest money in increased tillage if peace breaks out? Suppose peace broke out in Europe in the morning and we have all this winter wheat in, does the price of 35/- per barrel stand good?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>How will the Minister be able to pay 35/- a barrel with 125,000 persons out of work?  The Government whirls round.  If the farmer gets that 35/-, he has to keep the 120,000.  What I visualised in an expansion of banking credit was to put at work not only in agriculture, but in industry, these 120,000, and take them off our backs. It is no use giving us big prices for our products if we have to keep those people idle.  I have often said to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he is more concerned with agricultural production than the Minister for Agriculture, and I say now that it is the concern of the Minister for Agriculture to get these residents of the towns working, and not have agriculture carrying them on its back.  I should like the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="1101" /> to consider that, and to tell his colleague, the Minister for Finance, that it is of some concern to him to have the bank rate either raised or lowered. As a matter of fact, it should not be raised or lowered without his authority. That is what produced frozen debts, and that is what will bring us another crop of frozen debts if we do not take control of our own housekeeping.  I do not want loans to help farmers.  When the seed oats loan and the heifer scheme loans came before the committee of agriculture of which I was chairman a few years ago, I could nearly tell who the applicants would be.  They got the loans and they did not pay when the gale was due.  You have these hardy annuals coming along. What we should do is extend the nation's credit through the ordinary banking channels.  We should create conditions of confidence in which that would be done.  The first thing the Government should do is sit down and talk to the bankers, and ascertain why agriculture does not command credit. They will tell the Government very quickly.  That is the responsibility of the Government&mdash;to put agriculture in such a position that it will be credit-worthy and enjoy the confidence of the banking institutions.  At present, that is not so.</P>
      <P>Is it not a terrible commentary and judgment&mdash;I am not speaking politically&mdash;on the present Government that after almost eight years of office, agriculture is not credit-worthy and will not command ordinary banking facilities? Is not that a terrible indictment of the Government?  It is up to the Government to rectify that position, and not be handing out doles at 6 per cent.  When the searching inquiries are completed, the horse will have left the stable.  Spring will be reached before the Agricultural Credit Corporation will have dealt with all the applications, whereas, if you restored confidence in agriculture, the bankers would be only too glad to accommodate their customers, because that is what they are there for.  I should like the Minister to consider that aspect of the matter. If he does so, and does it quickly, then this motion will have served a useful purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1102" /> As I said when I rose to propose the motion, I did not get up to oppose tillage or compulsory tillage.  I always stood for tillage.  My view of agriculture is that, if tillage is not a paying proposition, we should not abandon it, but should investigate and ascertain why it is not a paying proposition; then, do whatever is necessary to make it a paying proposition.  If we do not work the land, how can we carry a rural population?  As proof that I am not opposed to this Tillage Order, and that it will not affect me personally, I may say that I have over 60 per cent. of my land&mdash;about 300 acres&mdash;under the plough.  I am not opposed to tillage, and the Minister knows that.  I put down this motion and Deputy Cogan seconded it for the purpose of getting information on the Tillage Order.  I hope the Minister will look after the sinews of war and see that the industry is restored to its rightful, premier place as the most credit-worthy industry of this country.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;Being of opinion that workers employed on minor relief schemes should be paid a rate of wages not less than the rate payable in the district by the county council, and that they should be guaranteed six days' continuous employment in each week during which they are so employed, the Dáil requests the responsible Minister to make regulations for the purpose of carrying these intentions into effect.&rdquo;&mdash;(Deputies Norton, Keyes and Davin.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate was adjourned, I was referring to the fact that the Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Flinn, had said that the rotational employment provided by the Board of Works was so attractive that men were leaving agricultural employment in order to take it up.  The Parliamentary Secretary ought to know that that would be impossible, because the men who are engaged on rotational schemes of employment are taken from the Labour Exchange.  It is laid down very definitely that the man who is drawing the greatest amount of unemployment assistance each week is the man who is taken first.  In that connection I should like to draw the Government's attention to the situation which is created in various parts of the country.  There are certain men in various areas, where the rotational scheme of employment is in operation, who have not yet been called upon to do any work under that scheme.  The Minister may ask, of course, why should they be looking for work when there is such a condemnation of this scheme?  Well, there are different ways of looking at that.  In some places, as I have said, some men have not been called upon at all to do work under that scheme.  The <Col N="1104" /> men at the top, and who are drawing the greatest amount of benefit, are taken first, and if it were a case of work being done over a short period, that means that when that job is finished and another job starts the men for the work are again drawn from the top of the list&mdash;the same men time after time&mdash;while there are some men, who may be in as great degree of need as those who have been taken on but who, in consequence of some flaw, have not been able to get as much money in the week as those at the top of the list, who have not been called upon.</P>
      <P>In the early part of the year, when we were discussing the Estimate for unemployment assistance, the Parliamentary Secretary promised to have that matter looked into.  I do not know whether he has done so or not, but he agreed at that time that there was undoubtedly a grievance there so far as these men are concerned.  I would like the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Industry and Commerce to ask now that that matter be investigated, because it is a source of complaint throughout the country that some men are being given employment practitically all the time, while others are not called upon.  I suggest that it is necessary that this matter should be looked into.  These were the two greatest grievances to which I wanted to refer.  The first is the question of men who are getting only three days' work, as is the case in some places.  I think that the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Industry and Commerce questioned that on the last day I was speaking&mdash;that there were in the rural areas men who are mostly working on a four-day period.  I have been told since then that in some areas men are still working only three days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to support this motion and to appeal to the Minister, in view of the very difficult times through which we are passing, to reconsider the whole policy of the allocation of relief grants and the conditions under which they should be made available.  I think there is nothing unreasonable, and certainly nothing unChristian, in appealing to a Christian-minded Minister for Finance or Minister for Industry and Commerce for men, who have the right to work under the Constitution and the right to a livelihood, to get a full week's work under decent conditions from the point of view of hours and wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I just heard the Minister query certain information that was being given by Deputy Corish in the concluding portion of his speech regarding the conditions under which these grants were being made available for work in his area.  Now, it was only on last Sunday, and quite accidentally also, that I was approached by a number of persons who were ordered recently to take up work on a relief scheme in my area.  I understand that, in this particular case, the instructions were sent by telephone from the office of the Department of Public Works, and I am not sure whether, up to the moment, the conditions under which this grant was allocated, have been given in writing. In any case, 20 men were ordered to go to work on a relief scheme some distance from their place of residence, and on the first day they were informed by an official of the local authority that they were going to get four days' work at the usual rate of wages prevailing for work of that kind.  On the following day a minor official of the same local authority came along and informed the same men that they would only get three days' work.  In this case, it would appear that some confusion exists between the local authorities in the area on the question of whether <Col N="1106" /> they were entitled, not to six days' work, but to three days or four days. The Minister for Industry and Commerce appears to be dealing with this particular motion, and I should like to hear from him whether there has been any change in the conditions under which these grants are made available this year as compared with last year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been asked, and strongly pressed, to represent to the Government Department concerned that men who are ordered out to work by the labour exchange on jobs of this kind are entitled to, and should be given, the right to a full week's work and that, when this work is work similar to that carried out by the local authorities at the ratepayers' expense, the rate of wages should be the same as the prevailing rate paid in the district by the local authority.  I dare say that we are entitled to learn from the Minister what is the total amount made available for grants for carrying out ordinary relief schemes this year and what sum, out of the total amount allocated, will be available for the carrying out of minor relief schemes before Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was also informed by men who approached me last Sunday concerning the carrying out of this particular scheme that they were told by an official of the local authority concerned &mdash;that is, the Leix County Council in this case&mdash;that for the two days' work they got last week, and the two or three days' work they are likely to get this week, they will not be paid until after Christmas.  As a matter of fact, it is quite a coincidence that I have addressed an urgent letter to the Department concerned, asking if this is a fact.  I was assured by one married man that he would get far more by way of unemployment assistance if he were allowed to remain on the labour exchange and would receive it weekly, than he is likely to get by working part-time employment for the next couple of weeks.  I dare say that is not an exceptional case.  If that is part and parcel of the so-called Christian social policy <Col N="1107" /> of our present Government, then it is about time, especially coming up to the Christmas period, that they should examine their consciences as to the meaning of a Christian social policy. If those are the conditions under which men can be ordered out by the labour exchange to take up part-time work, there is something there to be investigated. The whole policy surrounding this kind of activity should be carefully reviewed.  I dare say that, no matter what may be said from these benches, the hard headed men who sit on the front bench and who are responsible for the administration of this so-called Christian policy of the Government are not likely to be changed. They have their machined majority sitting behind them, and, when speaking on matters of this kind, one feels that not the slightest impression will be made upon the outlook of the members of the Government and those who sit behind them.  On many occasions the majority of the members of the Government Party marched in here and voted for or against certain motions, as they were ordered, without having listened to the discussions which took place.</P>

However, I have some hope that the feeling of the people in the country at the present time on matters of this kind, and on other matters affecting Government policy, will bring the members of the Fianna Fáil Party and the members of the Executive Council to realise the seriousness of the position in the country, and the effects of their inactivity in matters of this kind.  We have been told that the Constitution is a sacred charter of liberty.  It has been pointed out, for what it is worth, that under that Constitution every citizen has the right to work and obtain a decent livelihood, in the same way as people who have been arrested are entitled to be tried by a jury or a court constituted of their fellow countrymen. I have some hope, however, that the supporters of the Fianna Fáil Party will force them to realise the seriousness of the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been a member of this House since it was established, and I quite candidly and sincerely say to the Government&mdash;the Government of the people, because it is a Government elected by the majority of the people&mdash; that I know of no time when the conditions in my constituency, from the point of view of the unemployed and the badly-paid wage-earners, was as serious as it is at the present time. Money can be found in hundreds of thousands to prop up schemes like air raid precaution schemes.  Money can be found for the purpose of calling up thousands of men to add to the strength of our Army, waiting to fight an unknown enemy who is apparently likely to come from some unknown source.  If the Fianna Fáil Government can persuade people who have money at their disposal to provide money to the tune of hundreds of thousands of pounds for air raid precaution schemes, for the costly mobilisation of an army, and the more costly demobilisation of portion of that Army when it was found to be unnecessary, surely they can provide the necessary hundreds of thousands of pounds for the provision of useful work, and the provision of a full week's employment for every person who is willing to work <Col N="1109" /> in the carrying out of useful national schemes such as minor relief schemes.</P>
    <P>I have brought to the notice of the appropriate Government Department&mdash; I am sure other Deputies in this House have also done so&mdash;the fact that it takes two or three years, or, in one case in my constituency, four years, to complete a minor relief scheme.  A grant of £70 is given in the first year to carry out the scheme, where the estimated cost is £400.  The sum of £100 is given in the next year, and it takes four years, by the granting of small sums annually, to carry out a bog road repair scheme.  In the localities concerned large numbers of men, including married men, are looking for employment on those schemes, but the work cannot be found simply because the powers that be say there is only a limited amount available for purposes of that kind.  I would ask the Fianna Fáil Deputies to total up the amount of money which has been spent in this country under the heading of army expenditure since this House was established.</P>

I invite him to join in this debate and say what he thinks of the situation in the constituency of Leix-Offaly, and say also whether he supports the reasonable and just demand for work made by those who are waiting for it and who are willing to work for six days each week.</P>

      <Col N="1111" /> The conditions under which moneys for the carrying out of relief schemes are allocated and administered are a disgrace to any so-called Christian Government in a country like ours.  I can never understand the attitude of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance when he writes to Deputies, and repeats his statements here, to the effect that there is not sufficient money available to enable those works to be carried out and not sufficient even to enable schemes of this kind, wherever they are carried out, to give a full week's work to those willing to undertake it. Who is preventing the Government from getting the money necessary to provide all the work available in this country and that can be done if the money is advanced?  Are we to understand it is the Minister for Finance, or is it the bankers who are responsible for withholding the money that could be more usefully employed in schemes of this kind than by getting men to march into the Army and form fours on the many barrack squares situated in the constituency so ably represented by my friend, Deputy T. Kelly?  It is far better to have men employed on minor relief schemes than to be forming fours on the square in Griffith Barracks.</P>
    <P>I join in this debate in order to appeal quite sincerely to the Minister to allocate more money for minor relief schemes, to provide the money necessary to carry out all the schemes that lie in the pigeon-holes of the Department of Public Works and other Government Departments, such as the Land Commission and the Department of Local Government.  Wherever money is allocated for such works, six days' work each week should be given to anybody who is willing to do it or anyone who, under the existing regulations, can be ordered to take up work under these schemes.  The rate that should be paid to these workers should be the rate prevailing in the area, the rate that is paid by local authorities for schemes of a similar nature.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCoburn" hpid="Mr. Coburn Mr. Coburn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coburn</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion, proposed by members of the Labour Party, is <Col N="1112" /> one that should command the support of all Parties in this House.  It simply asks the Government to give six days, continuous employment at a wage equal to that obtaining in the district in which these schemes are being carried out.  I am well aware of the fact that the Government are in a rather difficult position to provide employment for everybody.  In connection with these relief schemes, it is my opinion that it would have been much better if, instead of giving three days a week, the Government gave six days. So far as I understand, when these moneys are being distributed to the various public bodies there are certain conditions attached.  That was the case, and I believe those conditions still exist.  Whatever reason there was for those conditions existing a year or two years ago, I think it will be agreed that under existing circumstances it is almost impossible for a man to exist on what he receives as a result of working three days a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It boils down to this, that the Government take the view, rightly or wrongly, that it is better that men should be working for three days than that they should go around drawing unemployment assistance and doing no work.  On the face of it there is a fairly good argument for that, but there is another aspect.  Where you have a scheme that will give a week's work over a certain number of weeks to 40 men, instead of confining that work to the 40 men the Government gives employment to 80 men, working three days in the week.  In my view that means that whereas you would have 40 men satisfied working six days a week, you have 80 men dissatisfied because they are working only three days a week.  In the same manner it could be argued that men engaged in constant employment, say, on the railways, in Jacob's or Guinness', in order to relieve those who are unemployed, say, in the City of Dublin, should go out after working three days in the week, and allow the unemployed people to come in for the remaining three days.  If that policy were pursued it would mean that where, at the moment, you have 3,000 men content in constant employment, you would have, <Col N="1113" /> as a result of the Government policy in dividing the work into two parts, 6,000 discontented people.  It would be better, in my opinion, to give a man a full week's work.</P>
    <P>Whatever excuse there was for the Government's scheme in the past, there is none to-day in view of the high cost of living.  I happen to have personal experience of the position of a number of men who until recently were engaged on relief works out on a mountainside where, as a result of a cloudburst that took place a few months ago, great damage was done.  There was a grant of something like £1,500, and a certain number of men were sent out to work on the scheme.  From what was told to me, it seems that those men had a full week's work each week, but last Monday they received word from the ganger that they were to proceed on the basis of three days a week.  The amount that they would receive for the three days would be somewhere in the region of 13/6.  I think nobody in this House or outside it can seriously argue that a man can support a wife and family on 13/6 a week.  Why a single man could not support himself on that much.  I want to emphasise this, that that work was of such a heavy nature that a man would want to be well fed in order to tackle it at all.  In fact the weather that appertained during the last week or two was such that it was only a man of a very hardy nature could stand it.  Surely to goodness 13/6 could not buy the necessary food and nourishment that would enable those men to withstand the severity of the climate during those days along that mountainside.  On last Monday, when those men came in it was a cold morning, and they were cold and shivering. I say here seriously that any man who had any sense of feeling would feel for their position, some of them married and some of them single.  They were all fine men for their position in life, and they told me that they were working there and that all they would receive would be 13/6.  I said that if anybody, the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary or any board or civil servant who had anything to do with the Board of Works was there and saw them, he would at once agree that <Col N="1114" /> they had a very just cause in asking the Government to give them a week's work.  I think, in view of the near approach of Christmas, that it would be only right and proper, come what may, that the Parliamentary Secretary should forthwith issue orders and have these men placed on a full week's work at the rate of pay obtaining in the district, a rate that is not very big.  Let me mention again that these men refused to work under the conditions that were imposed on them last Monday. As a result they are idle.  They called on me and asked me to make a special plea here to the powers that be, asking that they be given at least a full week's work in the few weeks before Christmas.  It is not asking too much.  These men are engaged on work that requires a certain amount of skill. The work needs men who are very strong and of a robust nature.  The work on which they are engaged is the result of a cloudburst; it is very heavy and laborious work.  The nature of the work consists partly of removing boulders, some of them weighing from five to ten cwt.  Mind you, a man on 13/6 a week and depending on the food that that will buy will not have the necessary virility to undertake a job of that nature.</P>
    <P>I do seriously exhort those in charge of these schemes to see that these men be placed on a full week's work, getting the rate of pay that obtains in the district. In asking that, I do not think it can be argued that I am asking too much.  For that reason I approve of the motion here on the Order Paper asking the Government to take steps that those men be given a full week's work at the rate of wages that exists in the various districts throughout the different counties of this State.</P>

      <P>I am tempted to make certain replies, but I recollect where I am, maybe fortunately, because I do not want to be ordered out of the House.  I would advise the Deputy to keep his mouth shut when I am speaking. As I say, the population of Dublin has increased by over 100,000 since 1914.  Just imagine such an immense growth of the population in a poor city.  I believe one of the reasons for that was the stopping of emigration to America.  A lot of young people who were not able to get to America came to Dublin, and the result is that we have a population that we are not able to keep because, after all, the vast majority of the people of Dublin are poor.  Just imagine what that means.  When people complain of high rates and all the rest they should remember that that is because we have to try and find work for the immense population that we have now to deal with.  To come back to the other matter.  It would be better to <Col N="1120" /> give these men six days' work in the week if it was possible to do it.  But even that would be only temporary relief.  Is there any cure for unemployment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party have been here for years.  Will they undertake the job of devising a plan to cure unemployment?  It is all very well to talk about spending millions on sewerage, afforestation, and other schemes.  When schemes are brought forward which mean an increase in the rates or taxes we are told that people cannot afford that.  If I belonged to the Labour Party, even with my small ability I think I would apply pen to paper and try to draft out some ideas that would help to cure unemployment, because all these schemes are giving just a little help and no more.  For 65 years, or as long as I can remember, unemployment has been rife in Dublin.  On the eve of this Government coming into power, there was exhibited in every provision shop in Dublin, at least in the poorer districts, a notice stating: &ldquo;Relief tickets taken here.&rdquo;  Even before that we had distress committees. I remember when we had distress committees during the Boer War.  Unemployment has been there all the time. Who is going to develop a scheme that will cure unemployment?  I am told it has been done in Russia.  I do not know anything about Russian methods. Probably somebody who is acquainted with the Russian methods might let us know how they have done it.  Perhaps the Russian method is giving 9/- per week while we have to give them £3 9s. per week.</P>

      <P>The Government with their resources are doing everything possible.  They have raised the standard of living in this country to a fairly decent level with the means at their disposal.  As soon as any increase of taxation is proposed for anything we want there is grousing, and we have arguments from the benches opposite as to why the money should not be raised.  Look at the recent discussion on the Budget.  Did not everyone in the Opposition oppose it and say that the money should not be raised, that we should not increase taxation?  If you want to remove such a tremendous evil as unemployment you will have to increase taxation very much indeed. Put it down on paper, anyway, and let us see if you have some constructive policy.  You were depending on this Party to help you at one time, and now you are depending on the others and you have not got anything for it.  They have only brought you into the Division Lobby after them.  You disassociated yourself from us and went away. Think of the parable of the Prodigal Son.  We will welcome you back; we will put the ring on your finger; we will try to do the things you want to have done.  That might be more helpful than walking at the tail of the Fine Gael Party.  I wonder if you feel very comfortable in that position.  Remember all the efforts at social reform which we made for you.  I have alluded to three or four.  At least do not be abusing us here; be a little grateful for what we have done for you.</P>

      <P>I do not want to follow Deputy Kelly into the theatrical display to which he treated the House this evening, but some statements he made should not be allowed to go unchallenged. Deputy Kelly can be induced to welcome anything, even a Bill to provide for city or county managers, by fallacious reading.  He was induced to vote against a motion of this kind, he said, because the small farmers were getting three or four days' work a week on relief schemes while looking after their own farms on the remaining days of the week.</P>

      <P>If the Minister said that he was just as inaccurate as Deputy Kelly was when he relayed that incorrect speech.  Everybody knows that it is impossible for a small farmer, if his land is capable of giving him any sustenance, to obtain unemployment assistance under the rigorous means test which is at present in operation.  The fact that a small farmer can get work on a relief scheme means that he is living on land which is absolutely incapable of sustaining him and which would not occupy his efforts for two or three days per week for the whole year round.  After discoursing on the advantages of the Unemployment Assistance Act to the small farmers, Deputy Kelly told us <Col N="1123" /> of the immense population of Dublin and the difficulty of providing employment for them and for the unemployed people in the country.  What about the famous plan that was worked on the electors of the City of Dublin by the former Minister for Industry and Commerce?</P>

      <P>The Deputy has not heard of the famous plan?  Somebody in the Party ought to tell him of the famous plan of the Minister for Industry and Commerce under which he was going to put every unemployed man into employment.  He had such a grave doubt that there would be sufficient workers available that he announced he would probably have to rake the cities of the United States and bring home the emigrants.  Did Deputy Kelly ever hear the speech made by the Minister for Co-ordination of Defensive Measures in Dundalk when somebody referred to 80,000 unemployed?  He said: &ldquo;Ah, well, ought we not to be glad to have them to do all the work Fianna Fáil is going to make available for them?&rdquo; Did Deputy Kelly look up the speech of the Taoiseach when he said that unemployment need not exist here, that Fianna Fáil had a remedy? We all remember the green posters for green people in the 1932-33 election in which it was announced, &ldquo;Fianna Fáil will cure unemployment.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>These posters and statements are available.  The speeches of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, of the Minister for Co-ordination of Defensive Measures and of the Taoiseach are on record either in the reports of this House or in the newspapers, <Col N="1124" /> including the Government newspaper, so that there was no shortage of plans at one time, no difficulty in providing for the immense population of Dublin, and not merely of Dublin but of the whole country. We were going to bring back and plant here the &ldquo;Greater Ireland beyond the Seas.&rdquo;  After seven years, we find 120,000 persons registered at the employment exchanges and in another month, that figure will be up to 130,000 The only thing that is preventing it from reaching that figure is the fact that returning emigrants cannot register at the employment exchanges because they can get no qualification certificates until they are back here for 12 months.  After seven years of the famous plan, which was going to put everybody in employment, 120,000 persons are satisfying the rigorous test of unemployment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kelly talks of the wonderful things the Government did.  Some very useful things were done by the Government. Only a fool would deny that. But the efforts were in no way commensurate with the needs of the situation.  What is being done here is very much behind what has been done by most conservative Governments in Europe faced with a problem of lesser dimensions than the problem we have to face here.  Deputy Kelly told us about the high standard of living the Government had provided.  For whom? For the unemployed?  In every town where the population is less than 7,000 and in every rural area the maximum rate of unemployment assistance for a man with a wife and six children is only 14/-.  We have eight persons living on 14/&mdash;that is 1/9 per week, per person, and that is &ldquo;high living.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is 25/- or 30/- in the city.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am telling the Deputy that in every rural area and in every town with a population of less than 7,000 the maximum rate of unemployment assistance for a man with a wife and six children is 14/-.  If the Deputy looks up the Unemployment Assistance Act he will see that that is correct.  If that man had ten children, he would <Col N="1125" /> get no more than 14/-.  That is the &ldquo;high living&rdquo; that Deputy Kelly speaks of.  A man with his wife and six children gets 1/9 for each and on that he has to provide three meals a day for seven days a week.  That is the &ldquo;high living&rdquo; you are giving the unemployed under the Unemployment Assistance Act.  That takes no cognisance of the rent that that man must pay, of the clothes he must buy or of the school books which must be provided, nor does it take account of other necessaries which must be provided by the working-class family.  When we talk about &ldquo;high living&rdquo;, let us remember what we are doing for the unemployed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wrote down the words when the Deputy was speaking and, if he looks up the report of his own speech, he will find that he used them. Let us get this thing in perspective and realise that there is a problem to be dealt with, that there is widespread destitution, that things are not as rosy as Deputy Kelly would have us believe. To come to the terms of the motion proper, it expresses the view that the present rotational scheme of employment should be replaced by a scheme under which men would get six days' work each week while employed and that they should be paid the local rate. What we are doing under the present scheme is offering employment to people for three, four or five days per week not so much because we are concerned with the unemployed or the standard of living which they will get from part-time work of that kind but to cut down expenditure on unemployment assistance.  Men working on these rotational schemes are getting little more than they would get under the Unemployment Assistance Act if they did not work.  I am not making a case that men should be allowed to draw benefit in preference to earning money by work.  I would prefer to see them work and every decent, honest man would prefer to work at a decent rate of wages to putting up with the <Col N="1126" /> degrading conditions attached to unemployment assistance, with the inquisitions held by the courts of referees, with the long distances to be travelled and the irksome conditions which have to be complied with in order to obtain the miserable pittance which they obtain in the form of unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>It is true that a fairly substantial number of people get employment on these relief schemes, but we know perfectly well, and every Deputy who represents a rural area knows particularly well, that these relief schemes are being used to force men to accept employment under almost any conditions; and that is being done in order to deprive them of unemployment assistance benefit if they refuse to accept that work.</P>
      <P>Men are being compelled to walk long distances to and from their employment&mdash;three, four, five and six miles there and back&mdash;in all kinds of weather, and the threat is held over them that, if they do not take work under these conditions, they need not sign at the labour exchange for further unemployment assistance benefit.  Many of them are being compelled to take work with which they are not familiar and which they never followed as a normal occupation.  Now, what do they get, even when they are employed on these schemes?  The Parliamentary Secretary said that it varied from 4/6 to 11/4 per day but, of course, the wage of 11/4 per day was the wage paid to a tradesman who was engaged on a relief scheme.  He would be a tradesman and he would have to be paid his trade union rate of wages because there would be no work done if he were not paid the trade union rate.  The ordinary worker in the country, however, the ordinary worker who is 12 miles from Dublin, is being paid at present 4/6 per day for three or four days' work in a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, let us be generous and say that such a man will manage to get four days' work in a week.  If so, his total wage is 18/- per week, and out of that 18/- he has got to pay 1/6 per week <Col N="1127" /> insurance&mdash;1/5 is probably the exact figure&mdash;so that, after four days' work &mdash;and that is a generous computation of the amount of work he can get&mdash;he goes home, and for that week he can get no unemployment assistance, no home assistance, and has got to exist on 16/6 after four days' work that week.  That is the high standard of living that we are told is being provided for unemployed people in the country&mdash;16/6 of a net weekly wage to enable a man to maintain himself, his wife, and any number of children, for an entire week.  He is expected to maintain himself and his family on that miserable pittance, and to do that to-day, in face of the present high cost of living, is a feat of economic gymnastics that not even regularly employed men could hope to perform, used as they are to having to balance their budgets on very slender incomes.</P>
    <P>We are told by the Parliamentary Secretary that these relief schemes&mdash; these hunger schemes, because that is what they are more than relief schemes &mdash;are so attractive that agricultural workers leave their ordinary employment to work on them.  Deputy Corish has pointed out, in correction of a statement made by Deputy Kelly, that it is quite impossible for an agricultural worker to leave his employment to take work on a rotational scheme because, before he can get work on such a scheme, he must be listed as unemployed at the labour exchange and must be in receipt of the higher amounts of unemployment assistance benefit.  If there are people registered at the exchange, who have 10/-, 12/-, 13/- or 14/- per week in unemployment assistance benefit, while he has only 9/- per week, he has no chance of getting on one of these schemes so long as these other people are there and are capable of staffing the job.  Accordingly, it is sheer nonsense to suggest that an agricultural worker can leave his employment and work on such a scheme since, not being registered at the exchange, he can never be placed on a relief scheme, and even if he does leave his employment as an agricultural worker he is disqualified from obtaining unemployment assistance <Col N="1128" /> benefit for a period of three months, if he ever has to seek such benefit.</P>
    <P>Another iniquitous aspect of this whole rotational scheme is the fact that, if there is a good piece of work to be done, constituting, let us say, six days' work in the week, it is being divided between two men, one doing three days' work and the other doing three days' work.  A normal six days' work is covered by one national health insurance stamp and one unemployment insurance stamp, but the rotational scheme has the effect that, for the six days' work under such scheme, you have got to put on four stamps, one man putting on two stamps and the other man putting on two stamps. Normally, these six days ought to be covered by two stamps for an entire week, and the fact that these unemployed people are being used as a source of tax by compelling them to put additional unemployment insurance stamps and national health insurance stamps is being used, in another sense, as an argument that employment conditions are good.  When there is talk about unemployment, we are told to look at the number of stamps sold and the number of books exchanged.  Is it any wonder that that should be so when so many thousands of people are being compelled to stamp their cards with four stamps where, normally, two stamps are sufficient in ordinary employment to cover six days' work?</P>
    <P>The only justification&mdash;if one could call it a justification&mdash;for a continuance of these relief schemes is the fact that there is such a wide stratum of poverty in the country; such a large number of unemployed people that the weapon of economic necessity is being used for the purpose of forcing them into accepting employment on these notorious rotational schemes.  If they do not take that employment, there is no unemployment assistance benefit for them at the labour exchange and no home assistance for them either. After reading the speech of the Parliamentary Secretary on this subject, it looks to me as if the Government has made up its mind that the only thing it can do in respect of the provision of employment is to offer the <Col N="1129" /> unemployed workers three or four days' work at rates of wages which are a disgrace to any Government and which do not provide anything more than a pauperised standard of existence.  We have come down now, from the balmy days when the emigrants were to have been recalled, when the famous plan was going to put every unemployed man into work and the Government was going to cure unemployment, to a condition of affairs where men can get only three or four days' work in the week at a wage ranging from 12/- to 16/6 a week.  That is the sum total of it.  These rotational schemes have been marked by wretchedly low wages, bad conditions of work, and irregular part-time employment, and it is quite clear that a resort to schemes of this kind indicates the complete bankruptcy of the Government in the matter of providing employment at reasonable rates of wages for the unemployed. Instead of having a plan, we now see that there is no plan. Instead of offering to give work, we now see that there is no work and that the only things offered to the unemployed are miserable rates of wages on these relief schemes, part-time employment, and the use of the weapon of hunger to compel them to accept these degrading conditions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1130" /> This motion asks that the present rotational schemes be abolished, that workers on such schemes should get not less than six days' work at a time, so that they could get a full week's work in any particular week, and that they should be paid the wage appropriate to that of county council workers. In other words, if they are engaged on carrying out these schemes, they ought to get a full week's work and the full rate of pay, and not be compelled to accept the rotational scheme of employment for three or four days at rates of wages that are even less than those paid to county council workmen, and, heaven knows, in some cases that is an intolerably low rate of wages at the present time.  We, therefore, ask the House to support this motion, and to say to the Government that, having had experience of the rotational schemes, we are not satisfied to continue schemes of that kind which are pauperising tens of thousands of decent, honest, unemployed people; that the Government should introduce new schemes whereby a full week's work will be provided for all the unemployed, and that they should get decent rates of wages while so employed under those relief schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is a proposal to amend Section 147 of the Road Traffic Act, 1933.  That particular section gives power to the Commissioner of the Gárdaí to make certain regulations, and the proposal in this Bill is that the objects for which he may make such regulations should be added to by giving him power to prohibit the sounding of horns in specified areas during a specified time.  The idea behind the Bill is that the powers granted under it could be used in the populated areas for the purpose of prohibiting the sounding of horns during the later hours of the evening.  This is a thing which has been done in many of the larger cities of Europe and I think in every case where it has been done it has met with the approval of the residents on account of the diminution of the noise.  In addition to that, my own view is that it adds considerably to the safety of night driving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present position, particularly in this city, is very largely that when a man driving a car approaches a road junction he puts his finger on the horn and says to himself: &ldquo;Now, the road is mine&rdquo; and over he goes, regardless of what may be coming in other directions. If this Bill were adopted, and the commissioner made the necessary regulations under it, the effect would be that a driver approaching a corner would know that he could not sound his horn.  The man approaching from another section of the junction would not sound his horn either and the general tendency would be that drivers would approach the junction more slowly and they would make sure that there would be no other traffic in the way.  I may say that for about three <Col N="1133" /> years I have made hardly any use of my horn, day or night, and the tendency undoubtedly is to take a road junction in a more careful manner and there is a greater margin of safety for pedestrians and for other traffic on the roads.</P>
    <P>This regulation is in operation in London from 11 o'clock or 11.30 o'clock, and it is also in operation in Paris and Rome during the whole 24 hours. Paris, I think, is a particularly good example, because the conditions on the roads there were at one time very bad. The taxis were inclined to drive about at great speed, and the drivers had little pip-squeak horns which they used to sound vigorously everywhere.  The effect of a similar order there has been that the sounding of horns has been greatly reduced or abolished, and the general effect upon the traffic has been a considerable improvement from the point of view of safety.  I hope the Minister will change his mind and accept this Bill.  Alternatively, if he cannot do that, if he is prepared to say that the Road Traffic Act requires amendment and that an amending Bill will shortly be introduced, and that he will give consideration to the inclusion of this item in such amending legislation, that will satisfy me, at all events, for the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJosephRuttled" hpid="Mr. Ruttledge Mr. Ruttledge">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ruttledge</NameTxt>
      <P>The section referred to by Deputy Benson contemplated regulations being made by the commissioner. These regulations have not been made.  If the Deputy wants to secure what he has in mind, he would require to amend Section 15 as well. Sub-section (3) of Section 15, which seems to be mandatory, provides that the Minister must make regulations providing that each vehicle should carry some sort of warning instrument. That is not a point I want to emphasise because, if we were to accept Deputy Benson's present proposal, then we could meet him in that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quite aware that what the Deputy says is correct as to the position in London, in other parts of England, in Rome and in Paris.  But we <Col N="1134" /> have not reached that position here yet.  In London and in other parts of England the density of traffic is ten times greater per mile than it is in Dublin or in other parts of this country.  That, as Deputies will appreciate, has a great slowing-down effect on traffic.  Where horns are usually sounded is at the point of intersection of streets or roads, passing slow-moving vehicles and careless pedestrians.  In the City of Dublin a good deal of progress has been made in the erection of automatic signals at crossings.  We have not yet reached the position where the work of dealing with traffic difficulties in the city has been completed or is even in a good way towards being completed.  If these automatic signals were erected at the crossings, I think you would have very little of the sounding of horns.</P>
    <P>I am informed that if I accepted the Deputy's proposal the Commissioner would not feel satisfied at present to make a regulation under it.  I am acting on that advice.  He would not consider it safe in the present state of traffic, and for these reasons I must oppose the Deputy's proposal at this stage.  Certain amendments are, no doubt, necessary to the Road Traffic Act, but they are not of a very urgent or important character.  They may be introduced, perhaps in the next session, and when introducing them I will take the opinion of the Commissioner of Police again.  As the Deputy will appreciate, I will have to be guided largely by the opinion expressed by the police.  At the present stage I could not accept the proposal.</P>
