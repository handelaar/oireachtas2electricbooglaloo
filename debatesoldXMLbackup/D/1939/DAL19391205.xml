      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he will state (a) the total amount of the capital liabilities of the State, and (b) the liability of the State in respect of the outstanding indebtedness of local authorities for moneys raised under the Housing Acts, (1) as on 31st March, 1932, and (2) as on 31st March, 1939.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a variety of bases for computing the direct capital liabilities of the State, but, taking them as shown in the finance accounts, they amounted to £31,848,824 as on the 31st March, 1932, and to £61,438,378 as on the 31st March, 1939.  Neither of the figures takes account of contingent liabilities.  I would remind the Deputy, however, that the figure quoted for capital liabilities at the 31st March, 1932, does not include the capital amount, approximately £100,000,000, of the annual payments previously made to the United Kingdom and subsequently disputed; whereas the figure quoted for 31st March, 1939, includes the outstanding balance of the Financial Agreement Loan of £10,000,000 raised to meet the payment of a similar sum under the Agreement with United Kingdom (Capital Sum) Act, 1938.  I presume the reference to the Housing Acts is to the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts, 1932-1939.  The liability of the State under such Acts was <Col N="814" /> nil on the 31st March, 1932, and £7,320,000 on the 31st March, 1939.</P>

      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.  As the Deputy has doubtless already observed the monthly trade statistics relating to the period since the outbreak of the war have been issued only in abbreviated form, the particulars given being confined to the imports and exports in the four main classes into which the statistics fall.  For reasons of public policy it is considered inadvisable for the present to publish any details additional to those given in the summary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he is aware that a substantial <Col N="815" /> sum of money out of the Employment Schemes Vote was allocated to the carrying out of certain work at Cromane, County Kerry, which work is now being carried out by a contractor who has not rotated the men employed on the work; and if he will have instructions issued to the contractor so that all men engaged in such work will be recruited through the labour exchange and that the workmen will be employed under the rotation system heretofore in operation where any such moneys have been granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy has in mind the scheme for the provision of a purification plant for mussels at Cromane, Castlemaine Harbour, County Kerry, for which moneys have been provided from the Employment Schemes Vote.  The standing instructions relative to the recruitment of labour for schemes financed in whole or in part from the Employment Schemes Vote require all unskilled labour to be recruited through the employment office and this has been done in this case.  It was found necessary for technical reasons to have the work carried out by a contractor and it was not considered expedient to make the grant conditional on the adoption of the rotational system. Experimental works on rotation under contract are being undertaken with a view to the extension of that system to contract work carried out with moneys provided by the Employment Schemes Vote.</P>

In March last the Minister approved the purchase of a site, and requested the board to have a schedule of accommodation prepared in connection with the proposed general hospital.  An outline schedule of accommodation for the new fever hospital was prepared by the Department <Col N="817" /> and sent in July last to the board for consideration.  The board have not notified my Department of their views on it.  In the meantime the board are being advised to proceed with the sanitary and other improvements recommended by their officers in October, 1938.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that numbers of single men, and widowers without dependents, residing in Horgan's Buildings, Gurranebraher, and Spangle Hill, Cork, have been disallowed unemployment assistance benefit during the currency of employment period orders on the grounds that they reside in rural areas notwithstanding that they are living in corporation houses; whether he is aware that the majority of the men concerned were obliged to apply for home assistance; and whether in view of the fact that such important centres in Cork City are regarded under the unemployment assistance as being rural areas he will take steps to secure such amendment of the law as will permit of the removal of these anomalies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The employment period orders made during 1939 under sub-section <Col N="819" /> (3) of Section 4 of the Unemployment Assistance Act, 1933, include in their scope certain classes of persons resident in the County of Cork with the exception of those resident within the boundaries of the county borough, the urban districts and the towns having commissioners under the Towns Improvement Act, 1854.  The areas affected by the orders include unincorporated towns and other types of districts.</P>
      <P>The persons to whom the Deputy refers in his question do not reside within the boundaries of the County Borough of Cork.  They reside outside the borough boundaries and in consequence are by reason of their places of residence covered by the employment period orders.  In fixing the area of application prescribed in the orders, the fullest consideration was given to all the relevant facts.  The problem was to apply the employment period orders to rural areas and not to urban areas.  This involved the adoption of the recognised boundaries.  It is clear that wherever the line of demarcation was drawn numbers of persons resident just outside it must be affected by these orders.  The orders have now ceased to operate.  The matter is not one for legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, this question deals with a problem which has arisen since the Unemployment Assistance Act was passed by the Dáil. If what is suggested in the question were adopted, it does not mean that other people could also be included, because what is raised here only applies to people who have been transferred from the City of Cork to this housing area: people who ordinarily should be regarded as city workers.  I think that a case can be made for them.  If a case is put up to the Department, I would like to know from the Parliamentary Secretary if he is prepared to consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that great hardship is caused to a large number of heads of families in Cork by reason of the fact that their rates of benefit under the Unemployment Assistance Act are reduced from 23/- to 14/- per week consequent on their removal under the Cork City slum clearance order from Cork Borough to the corporation housing scheme outside, but adjacent to, the borough boundary; that the men concerned, although city workers, are regarded for the purpose of the Unemployment Assistance Act as being rural workers; and whether he intends to introduce legislation amending these Acts with a view to the removal of hardships of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>The rates of unemployment assistance are referable not, as the Deputy seems to think, to classes of workers but to places of residence. The highest rates of unemployment assistance are payable to persons resident in any county borough or the borough of Dun Laoghaire.  A person who is not resident within the boundaries of these areas cannot be paid these rates.  In reference to the suggestion regarding the amendment of these statutory provisions to meet the exceptional case of persons affected by slum clearances in Cork, I would refer the Deputy to the reply given to a previous question asked by him on the 13th January, 1938.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising out of the Parliamentary Secretary's reply, as I said a moment ago this is a problem which has arisen in the City of Cork since the passing of the Unemployment Assistance Act.  As the Parliamentary Secretary has stated, I asked a question on this on the 13th January 1938. <Col N="821" /> I again ask that consideration of the amendment of the Act be taken up in view of the fact that these are city workers who have been compelled under a Slum Clearance Order to go outside the city and reside in the new houses provided for them there.  They surely cannot be regarded as rural workers within the meaning of the Act, as originally passed.  I would appeal to the Parliamentary Secretary to consider this particular case.  So far as I know, this is a matter that does not arise in any other district in as acute a form as it does in Cork City where there is no land available to enable provision to be made for those workers within the city.  The result of that has been that the houses provided for have been erected outside the city boundary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The national defence requires the establishment of a marine service consisting of trawlers and motor torpedo boats.  (a) It is not possible to give an exact estimate of the initial cost. When our estimated full requirements for the defence of our territorial waters are met, the total capital expenditure will probably be £250,000.  (b) The personnel required consists of navigation officers, engineer officers, engine room artificers, telegraphists, signalmen, seamen and engine room hands.  (c) Applications for the additional personnel required have been invited by means of a Press advertisement and they will be recruited from amongst the applicants by means of selection boards set up by <Col N="824" /> me.  The rates of pay and conditions of employment of such additional personnel are as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Lieutenant (officer in charge of boat), 10/- rank pay plus 3/6 additional pay; 2nd/lieutenant (engineer officer), 8/- rank pay plus 3/6 additional pay; company sergeant (boatswain), 6/- rank pay plus 3/6 additional pay; corporal (engine room artificer), 4/- rank pay plus 2/6 additional pay; corporal (torpedo-man), 4/- rank pay plus 1/9 additional pay; private (A.B. seaman), 2/6 rank pay plus 1/6 additional pay.</P>
      <P>Ration allowance and uniform allowance will be issued to the officers, and rations and clothing will be provided for the men.  Medical and hospital treatment will be available free of charge subject to the limitations which apply to soldiers of the forces.  Personnel required for the marine service will be commissioned or enlisted in the forces and will be subject generally to the regulations which apply to the forces.  (d) The estimated annual cost of the marine service is roughly £150,000.  This is a tentative figure.  It will be realised that the service is as yet only in the process of formation and that a final costing cannot be given until a more advanced stage of development is reached.</P>

      <P>2c.  In page 6, at the end of Section 7 to add the following sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  Each ordinary member shall be paid by the commission such remuneration (if any) and such allowances for expenses as the Minister, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, may from time to time appoint.</P>
      <P>6a.  In page 6, line 35, Section 9, to delete the words &ldquo;seconded for service with &rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;appointed (either in a whole-time or part-time capacity) a member or officer of&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>A discussion arose here as to whether the Minister for Finance should not have some say in the fixing of the salaries.  The Minister for Finance said he was only concerned with any civil servant that might be employed. These four amendments settle that point, seeing that civil servants will be taken as ordinary members.  The Minister for Agriculture before sanctioning any remuneration or allowance for these particular members will consult the Minister for Finance.  The four amendments cover that point.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>We had a fairly long discussion of this particular section, from the point of view of giving the Dáil an opportunity of discussing the proceedings of the board.  After our discussion it was agreed generally that, if I could arrange to have all the accounts, balance sheet, stock-in-trade, and so on, of the board put before the Dáil, together with such tables of statistics as may be useful to get a proper understanding of the proceedings of the board, that would cover all the points. I think the two amendments as proposed here will make that all right.  It is ensured now that all those things <Col N="831" /> will be laid before the Dáil.  The only point left is this: I found it impossible to have any satisfactory amendment drafted to ensure that the Dáil would get an opportunity of discussing the matter.  I think I can only do what the Minister did at the time of the bringing in of the Electricity Supply Bill, that is to give an undertaking to the Dáil that, as long as the present Government is in office, public time will be given if requested for a full discussion when those matters are laid before the Dáil.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 30:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 21, before Section 53, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  In making any appointed price order or appointed price amending order on or after the transfer date the commission shall&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  make an order scheduling the constituents of a standard ration for pigs for the purpose of this Act;</P>
      <P>(b)  declare for the purpose of this Act the cost of the scheduled ration;</P>
      <P>(c)  appoint a price based on the declared cost of the scheduled ration as ascertained from time to time over a period of four months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  The price order fixed under sub-section (1) of this section shall be a price order fixing the price to be paid for pigs delivered to licensees at <Col N="839" /> the factory four months from the date at which the price is fixed.</P>
    <P>(3)  If the scheduled price of feeding stuffs provided for in sub-section (1) shall vary during the four months period, then the fixed price payable shall vary proportionately with the scheduled price of feeding stuffs and shall be payable at this varied rate on the delivery of the pigs.</P>
    <P>This is an amendment of substance. The others, as the Minister pointed out, were largely put down to meet amendments withdrawn on the Committee Stage.  This, however, is an amendment which it will be necessary to explain at some length.  It lays down an entirely new basis for fixing the price to be paid for pigs in this country.  The whole purpose of this legislation was to remove, in so far as possible, the uncertainties from the pig-rearing business.  A great many people forget that the profitable character of rearing pigs depends, not upon one factor, but upon two.  You may fix to-day a remunerative price for pigs; you may fix to-day a price for grade A pigs which is sufficient to yield a reasonable profit to anybody producing them; but, if tempted by that price, a farmer instals a breeding sow, or buys bonhams or suckers, and proceeds to rear them, he may find in four months' or six months' time, when he is ready to sell his pigs as bacon pigs, that, though the fixed price which he gets for the pigs is the same over the period during which he was rearing the pigs, the cost of feeding stuffs has gone up so substantially that the price, which was a profitable price when he started rearing the animals, is no longer a profitable price and that his costs of production have involved him in heavier charges than the fixed price gives him when he comes to sell the pigs.</P>
    <P>In the past, the farmer had to contend with two things, one, that the price of pigs might collapse while he was rearing the pigs, and, two, that the price of feeding stuffs might go against him.  With the introduction of the fixed price, one of those risks disappeared, <Col N="840" /> or at least seemed to disappear. But it is right to remember this, that in the old, unregulated days, before any Pigs and Bacon Act was introduced, the price of pigs moved substantially with the price of feeding stuffs.  When corn was cheap in America, the price of pigs went down. Because people fed corn to pigs in America, that increased the world supply of bacon and the price of bacon tended to decline on the home market. When corn was getting dear, however, and scarce, in America, fewer hogs were fed there with corn, there was a scarcity of bacon on the world market and bacon tended to rise.</P>
    <P>We proceeded to fix the price under the Pigs and Bacon Act and, though at first it seemed that we had relieved the farmers of one of the uncertainties with which they usually have to contend, it emerged in practice that what we actually did was, we had stabilised one factor of the equation, but we had left the other factor varying; and so, if the price of feeding stuffs declined over the production period, it was true the farmer made a more handsome profit, because the fixed price remained the same, but if the price of feeding stuffs steeply rose, then the farmer might find himself facing a very substantial loss when he came to sell his pigs.</P>
    <P>Under the old system, suppose a farmer has his pig raised to the point where it was suitable for the Irish bacon factories, and on that day discovered that the price available was unfavourable, he could drive his pig home and feed it for another month or six weeks and sell it on the Birmingham market as a Birmingham cutter, or sell it to the Scotch curers who wanted a very heavy pig.  He might, by that expedient, succeed in getting a good price for it.  But, under our plan of guaranteeing supplies of pigs for the home manufacturer and supplies of pigs of the type that the home manufacturer wanted, when we fix the minimum price we put a very heavy penalty on the farmer who drove his pig home and made it develop into a fat pig, because when it was fat it was put down in the lowest grade and it was <Col N="841" /> cut down as much as 10/- a cwt. in the price.</P>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to render the second factor in the price equation as stable as we have already made the price factor.  That operation is not as simple as it at first looks, because to make the second factor stable you have to do two things.  You have got to tell the farmer on the 1st December, not only what the fixed price is on the 1st December, but what the fixed price is going to be on the 1st March.  You can do that pretty easily, but what you cannot know on the 1st December is the price of feeding stuffs between the 1st December and the 1st March.</P>
    <P>In a plan of this kind, where you are trying to give everybody a square deal, you cannot afford to let the lucky man make a great profit, which he would do if the cost of feeding stuffs declined very rapidly between 1st December and 1st March, and let the other man who happened to be unlucky suffer a heavy loss when the price of feeding stuffs rose steeply between the day on which the price was fixed and the day on which the price fell to be paid.  Therefore, if you want true equity to prevail, you have got to say: &ldquo;If the price of feeding stuffs on the 1st December is 10/- and the fixed price on the 1st December for pork is 80/-, we now declare that the fixed price on the 1st March will be 90/-, subject to this proviso, that between the 1st December and the 1st March the average price of feeding stuffs will be ascertained, and if there is an increase in the average price of feeding stuffs over that period then the fixed price on the 1st March will be 90/- varied in proportion as the cost of feeding stuffs varied.&rdquo;  That may be up or down.  If the price of feeding stuffs declines materially during that period then the price of pork on the 1st March can be no more than 80/-, but you have the guarantee that if the price should rise steeply the price on the 1st March may be 100/- but, whatever it is, you have this certainty that you may safely proceed to rear the pigs in the knowledge that, whatever event develops, when you come to sell your pigs you will have a satisfactory profit on the transaction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="842" /> To do that you have got to provide for one somewhat artificial expedient because you have got to declare a standard ration.  You have got simply to say that that ration consists of, say, six parts of Indian meal, six parts of barley meal, two parts of pollard, one part of bran and one part of meat meal and, on that basis, declare the value of the standard ration and let the standard price fluctuate with the fluctuations of the constituent parts of that standard ration.  All of us know that a very considerable number&mdash;in fact the vast majority&mdash;of farmers in this country will never use precisely that standard ration because they use cabbage, potatoes and a variety of products of their own holding&mdash;as they ought to&mdash;which it would be impossible to incorporate in any standard ration for the purpose of the calculation. But, that presents no real objection to the plan.  It does leave some slight element of inequality in the arrangement. I will submit to the House that it is an element of inequality which will be salutary because it will encourage the small, enterprising farmer to experiment with his live stock with a view to sorting out on his own holding the diet that he can most economically produce there for the production and finishing of live stock. The more animal foodstuffs we can get grown on the holdings of this country and converted, on the holding, into a finished product the better it will be for the country as a whole and the better it will be for the individual small holder.  In fact, that is the philosophy that lay behind the late Deputy Hogan's agricultural policy&mdash; one more cow, one more sow and a few more acres under the plough.  The more we can use live stock for the purpose of manufacturing on the homestead the products of the soil the greater will be the ultimate prosperity of the small farmer and the community to which he belongs.</P>
    <P>A last word, Sir.  I am not going to press this amendment if the Minister is not disposed to accept it now&mdash; for this reason: We are passing through a period of emergency and difficulty.  We are passing through a period in which day to day arrangements <Col N="843" /> have to be made with the British Ministry of Food to accommodate our supplies to their requirements and so forth.  The introduction of a scheme of a comprehensive kind, based on the plan of amendment No. 30, might encumber the Minister's activities in the day to day negotiations he may have to conduct in regard to this matter for the time being.  But, if the Minister is prepared to say that he accepts the principle of this amendment and would bear it in mind in the permanent arrangement which I hope he will find himself in a position to make with the British Government during or at the end of this crisis for permanent supplies of pigs and pork for the British market, that will be quite acceptable to me.  I believe that if we got a scheme, based on amendment No. 30, in operation in this country we could rationally go to the British Government and say that whereas heretofore it was unthinkable that the Irish and British farmers combined could ever supply the British market with all the bacon it could consume that in the future, with the guarantee of profit which a scheme such as that outlined in amendment No. 30 would give to our farmers, it would be a reasonable objective to place before us to supply the entire Irish and British markets with all the bacon and ham they may require from the smallholders in this country, the large feeders in the Counties Cork, Monaghan and Antrim, who each feed 2,000 to 3,000 pigs a year, together with the smallholdings and the larger establishments which are being developed at the present time in Great Britain.  I believe that would be of immense benefit to both countries, and I believe it could ultimately be worked and developed without any serious or unhealthy interference with the normal trade of either country.  That, I think, is an objective towards which it is well worth working and one which I can assure the Minister he would have full co-operation from all sides in promoting if and when he puts his hand to the task.</P>

      <P>I would like to say that <Col N="844" /> I hope the Minister will accept Deputy Dillon's amendment or that he himself will put in an amendment that will have somewhat the same effect as Deputy Dillon's amendment would have.  The main objection of those who criticised the last Bill so severely was that there was not in it a protection for the producer on somewhat similar lines as there was protection for other interests.  In the debate on the original Bill an amendment was moved to ensure production costs for the farmer, but, unfortunately, it was not accepted with the result that the Bill became very unpopular.  It was proved in practice that the criticisms of the people who supported the original amendment were well-founded. The Minister himself admitted here when we were discussing the late Bill that the fault was not altogether with the commission.  I am saying that it was not, that it was in the Bill.  The fault was certainly in the Bill.  We heard a great deal of argument about certain people getting too much benefit.  They would have been angels if they did not.  I am not blaming them.  They would have been supernatural beings if they did not take benefits that were cast into their hands like manna from Heaven.  Having the ordinary failings of human beings, they took benefits that were put into their hands by the late Bill.  Nothing analogous to those benefits was offered to the producer.  There was practically no assurance whatever given to him that he would even get the cost of production.  In this amendment Deputy Dillon has attempted to ensure for the producer in this Bill what was not secured for him in the late Bill.  I am sorry that Deputy Dillon has indicated that if the Minister sees objection to the amendment he will withdraw it.  I, for one, would not like to see it withdrawn.  If it is withdrawn, I would like the Minister to put in something that would have the same effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill, like the previous Act, will be largely useless for the development of the pig industry in this country if such a section as this is not embodied <Col N="845" /> in it.  I admit that for whatever time this unfortunate war goes on it will probably be easier for farmers to sell pigs and that a profitable price will be got for them.  But we are not legislating now for a war&mdash;at least, I hope we are not.  This Bill is not presumed altogether to be a war measure.  It is to remedy the defects in an Act passed by this House for the benefit of the pig industry.  If the war collapsed at any time this Bill would come into effect and it is for this House to see that it is an effective measure.  I, for one, will be very sorry if the Minister rejects the amendment or if he will not promise to introduce, either in this House or in the Seanad, a section having a somewhat similar effect to that which Deputy Dillon desires.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the principle of the amendment. Deputy Dillon, I am sure, realises that this question of a balanced ration for pigs is not a universal arrangement in rural districts.  However, that should not debar the Minister from finding some machinery or some arrangement to meet the principle of the amendment. Our experience in Kerry, in any case, for years has been that when the farmers obtained a remunerative price for pigs the millers immediately put up the cost of feeding stuffs.  In fact, whatever little profit was obtained was more than counteracted by the cost of feeding stuffs.  This certainly would have the way to a new development and be an encouragement to the producers.  I think that the difficulties which have been referred to could be got over.  I strongly urge the Minister to accept that amendment, or if he cannot see his way to accept it in its entirely, to agree to the principle of it and to establish some machinery which will have an effect similar to that contained in the amendment.</P>

I wonder if Deputy Dillon has given any consideration to the fact that such an amendment if inserted in the Bill would have the effect of making the millers turn out standard rations.  The millers and the people who handle the bran and pollard will turn out nothing but standard rations.  They will all make their own standard rations and the farmer will not have any opportunity of getting offals such as bran, pollard, and Indian meal at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the amendment.  As Deputy Dillon pointed out, it may not be so necessary during the emergency period, because the price of pigs will appreciate and that will continue.  I think the price of pigs is bound to appreciate during this period.  But we are legislating in this Bill for normal times.  The trouble in the pig industry is that if the feeder does not get a profit on his pigs he tends to go out of production.  The intention behind this amendment is to stabilise the position and ensure that the price of pigs will go up if the cost of production goes up.  That is very important.  It is all right to announce the price of pigs at the present time, but if a man has a batch of pigs ready for the market he must sell them no matter what the price is.  What really matters, if you want to increase production, is to be in a position to announce the price which will be paid four months ahead when the pigs will have to be sold, so that such a man can see clearly that there is a possibility of making a profit during that period. For that reason I think that this amendment ought to be very attractive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the point raised by Deputy Allen, there may be something in it, that there might be some encouragement to the millers to force up the price of offals.  But then, you have the Prices Commission to appeal to.  If on that point you are going to throw out an amendment of this sort, that really ought to be an attractive amendment, <Col N="848" /> and that is going to be so helpful to the industry, I think the small point raised by Deputy Allen could be got over with very little difficulty.  You have the protection of the Prices Commission there.  If they do their job, there cannot be overcharging for millers' offals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say with regard to the point raised by Deputy Allen that I do not think there is any danger because (1) you have got the Prices Commission; and (2) you have the remedy of taking the tariff and restrictions off all imports of feeding-stuffs, which I think ought to be done. I am not going to open that question now, as it is a very long and tedious one, which Deputy Allen and I can discuss on another occasion. Deputy Bennett says there should be no question about receiving the amendment now.  I do not know what is in the Minister's mind, but I know what would be in my mind if I were in his position.  If I were negotiating with another Government about getting the best price for my own people, I would not be quoting statutory prices too much from my own legislation.  That objection may not have presented itself to the Minister.  It may, however, be in his mind, but if I were going to get from the British Government the best price for pigs produced here, I would not put it in their mouth to say: &ldquo;On your own figures pigs are only worth so much to-day and that is all we will give.&rdquo;  That means that when you start to bargain with them, instead of being able to ask 5/- or 6/- more for pigs than you expect to get, you meet the British half-way.  They are very reasonable people, and they know as well as you do and, in fact, better, that a hard bargain is never a good bargain.  They are reasonable and decent people to do business with, but if you hand them your case on a platter by fixing, <i>coram populo</i>, what you believe is a true figure for pigs, you cannot expect them to close their eyes to that and give you 5/- a cwt. more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that during the duration of the crisis we ought to get a little more than the strict economic worth of pigs. <Col N="849" /> Once we get back to normal, then I think for the protection of our people it would be well to put this scheme into operation here and to adhere to it by taking the necessary steps.  I do not know if that is the Minister's view. That is my view, and that is the feeling I have for requesting the Minister to accept the amendment at this stage. There may be several reasons present to the Minister why he may not deem it expedient to have it in the Bill, and I would not press the matter if he were prepared to say that in normal times it would be acceptable, and that he would put it into a Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly agree with the principle of the amendment and, as a matter of fact, before war commenced, during the Summer Recess of July and August, we were engaged in trying to put up what we regarded as a permanent measure to deal with pigs and bacon.  That was one thing we had in mind, to try to get the price of pigs fixed in relation to the price of feeding stuffs.  There were certain difficulties mentioned by Deputy Allen and others which I will try to keep in mind and perhaps we could get them by other machinery.  If any Deputy goes into the matter deeply he will find that this particular principle cannot be adopted, unless you have the State guarantee behind it.  That is the position as long as we are an exporting country.  We may say four months ahead that, if feeding stuffs are £8 a ton, then the dead-weight price would be such a price, but we might find, when we reach that period, that the export value of bacon was very much lower.  If anything goes wrong the State must take the risk and must come in to make things right.  There is State guarantee of assistance of that kind.  I think we could hardly justify at the moment a State guarantee for our bacon.  For other reasons, some of which were touched upon by Deputy Dillon, it is not advisable to have a scheme of that kind now.  Deputy Bennett and Deputy Hughes, when speaking, were more or less under the impression that this commission that we are setting up will be there for a long time.  I do not look upon it like that.  I look upon it <Col N="850" /> as a purely temporary scheme to carry on things during the war.</P>
      <P>I am not hoping that the war will last long, but my view is that we should, if possible, have a permanent scheme before the Dáil to deal with matters when the war is over.  That is going to be the critical time, and if we could successfully work out a scheme of this kind, to come into operation when the war is over, we would be doing a great deal for pig rearing in the future.  I do not agree with what Deputy Bennett said, but I do not want now to go into controversial matters.  I do not agree with him that the prices paid for pigs during the last three or four years did not leave a certain profit after paying for feeding stuffs.  Any farmers that keep accounts and whom I have been in touch with told me that there was a certain profit.  We may have our own views as to what that profit should be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy said that pigs did not provide a profit.  I do not want to give that impression in the country.  As we know the majority of farmers do not keep accounts, and if they got the impression that there was money to be made from pigs some of them might go into the industry.  On the other hand, if they got the impression that they were losing they would not do so.  That is why I do not want the other impression to go out.  Deputy Dillon pointed out that it might be difficult and, in fact, awkward to adopt a principle like this.  It is, because for one thing we are discussing prices with the British Government and they are changing constantly.  In fact the present price of bacon for the exporter is only provisional.  In all probability there will be a change about 5th January when control comes in.  The British Government contemplate&mdash;I do <Col N="851" /> not know whether they will go on with it or not&mdash;removing the present control they have with regard to feeding stuffs, which is keeping the price of feeding stuffs down in England.  If they remove that control and let feeding stuffs take their course, undoubtedly there will be an increase in the price of bacon in England, and that price will be reflected here.  We will again put the price to them.  Although the price of feeding stuffs remains the same here, we would be unable to get that price fixed at that stage.</P>
      <P>I press Deputy Dillon and other Deputies who agree with the principle, not to put it into the Act, because I think it would make it almost impossible for the commission to carry on under the changing conditions.  I have no hesitation at all in saying that if we could get that principle adopted it would be a good thing.  In drawing up what we regarded as permanent legislation during the summer I spent a good deal of time personally, apart from whatever time the officials gave to it, in working out such a scheme, and it was my intention, if it was possible, to put a scheme of that kind into operation in our permanent legislation. I hope this commission will be able to help us in the course of 12 months or so to frame that permanent legislation which will be there when the war is over and, if possible&mdash;and I think it is possible&mdash;to put some principle of this kind into what might be regarded as the permanent Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the error the New Zealand Government fell into. The New Zealand Government started a plan of this kind of price fixation.  In fact their whole economic structure is founded upon it.  They employed State aid by financing a scheme from authorised credits from the National Bank of New Zealand.  What happened was that, so long as the Government were paying more than the world price of produce, the scheme was grand, and everyone praised it and rejoiced, but the plan was that, having paid out to the farmers more than the world price for their produce, when the world price rose above the standard price fixed in that country, the Government would take the surplus and pay it back to the National Bank as against the credits created under the subsidised plan.  I hope Deputy Norton is listening to that. On arrival at the quay in Auckland, the ascertained price for exported New Zealand merchandise&mdash;it was butter-fat, as a matter of fact&mdash;was ascertained to be about 2d. per lb. above the fixed price in New Zealand. I stood by while a very distinguished economist in New Zealand who bought a paper said: &ldquo;Pray God the Government have stood firm and refused to pass over this extra money to the farmers because, if they do not stand firm, we are ruined&rdquo;.  I said to him: &ldquo;My dear fellow, there is going to be a general election in New Zealand in the course of the next three months. What democratic Government on God's earth could refuse to pass over that 2d. to the farmers?&rdquo; He opened the paper and he said: &ldquo;We are done, for they have got it&rdquo;.  The farmers started to howl and they got the 2d. which should have gone to the reduction of the credits in the National Bank in New Zealand.  The Government started to go down the slippery slope towards bankruptey and that resulted in the Minister for Finance having to come to London in connection with the finances of New Zealand. That resulted from the Government <Col N="853" /> giving an unqualified guarantee to the scheme through the creation of credits in the National Bank.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister, and I think the suggestion is worthy of consideration, that it should be possible to work out an insurance system, like the unemployment insurance scheme, in which we would all pay into the fund so much per pig and the fund would be available for withdrawals in the event of the world price falling substantially below the fixed price as ascertained in connection with this formula.  A situation might arise in which, when you had ascertained the price of the standard ration, the statutory price founded on that would be 84/- whereas the world price would be only 82/-, in which event you would pay 2/- per cwt. out of the insurance fund.  Here arises a delicate difference. Suppose the world price was 90/- &mdash; this is where New Zealand went wrong&mdash;and the statutory price 84/-, the New Zealand Government wanted to have the whole 6/- of the difference put by.  What I should like to do would be to take 2/- per pig all the time. Once you have taken the 2/- you should make it quite clear that the farmer had no further claim, that the rest was surrendered to the insurance fund and kept for contingencies.  It would be the same as in the case of the man who pays 1/7 to the National Health Insurance Fund or who contributed to the Unemployment Insurance Fund. He has no lien on that money and, unless he falls ill or falls out of employment, he may never benefit by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mistake is to create in the farmer's mind the idea that he never lets go of whatever deductions are made from the price he receives.  He should recognise that the insurance fund is established for his own protection, that he makes payments into it and that, so far as he is concerned, that is the end of it.  All he is guaranteed is that the provisions of amendment No. 30 are always available and that he will always get an economic price. I do not want to elaborate the matter too much, but when the commission is dealing with this question, I ask the Minister to instruct them to look into <Col N="854" /> that aspect of it&mdash;as to how to provide a guarantee fund which would establish the principle of amendment No. 30 on a secure foundation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to refer to a matter relating to this industry which is of very great urgency.  We have a strong advertising campaign going on in connection with wheat growing.  We have a strong advertising campaign going on in connection with beet growing and the fancy price of 60/- per ton is being paid for beet.  Quite apart from the merits of these schemes, which I do not now propose to discuss&mdash;my views regarding them are pretty well known and I do not desire to retreat a fraction of an inch from the position I took up on previous occasions&mdash;may I put it to the Minister that the one crop which is of vital and urgent necessity to us is barley&mdash;feeding barley.  No crop except, perhaps oats, can be used more profitably at present for the community as a whole or from the point of view of the national income than barley, converted into feeding stuffs for pigs.  No emphasis is being laid on the necessity for growing barley or oats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Heretofore, barley in this country has been primarily grown by people aiming at the maltster.  They hoped to get their barley taken by the maltster and to get the maltster's price.  But they were prepared, if they did not make the grade for malting, to use it for feeding stuffs.  If you are aiming at malting barley one of the brands which can be used is Archer Spratt, which, I understand, will produce one of the finest samples available.  There are other varieties of barley which, I understand, are very much hardier and very much less prone to being &ldquo;lodged&rdquo; in our western districts, where we have very high moisture, a very high rainfall and very often an unsettled autumn.  I urge very strongly that the Minister should call up his agricultural instructors&mdash;he will find amongst them some of the ablest practicable men in the country&mdash;and get a cross section of their view as to what is the most suitable form of barley to be grown primarily for feeding stuffs, and then to address some kind of allocution to those parts of the country, <Col N="856" /> which normally will not grow barley for malting purposes, to get supplies of these hardy types of barley and grow them for the purpose of providing feeding stuffs for pigs.</P>
    <P>There is another point that I should like to put to the Minister.  Heretofore, the growing of oats and barley has become associated in the minds of the people with very violent fluctuations and often it is only with extreme difficulty that they can be converted into cash crops in the Autumn.  Now, I do not believe in the cash crop system in our agricultural economy at all.  I think it has been the curse of our Irish agricultural economy in the way in which it has been operated.  However, I am not going to enter into that now, but we have to face the fact that our people have been taught for the last seven years to relish cash crops and to seek for them, and having been induced to go into the production of wheat and beet, both of which are cash crops, you have now got to persuade our people more or less to go away from these crops and to go in, for the common good, for the production of an adequate supply of live stock.  I submit to the Minister that, if he apprehends a shortage of maize next Autumn, he may say with perfect safety that he will guarantee to anybody who wants to sell feeding barley the price that he would pay for maize, whatever it is.  Now, that will not sound a very attractive price to the man who has spent his life in selling barley to the maltsters, but this is feeding barley&mdash;barley that would be unsuitable for the maltsters&mdash;and if the grower of that barley has the certainty that the Minister will take it off his hands next Autumn at, say, 10/- or 12/- a cwt., I believe that a penny would not be lost thereby because he would be buying it as cheaply as maize, and there will not be a sufficiency of maize in any case.  I am prepared to state, as an experienced shop-keeper dealing with country people, that we will be able to sell at least one-third of the total requirements of feeding stuffs in straight barley meal, with no mixture, and I would say that we would be prepared to accept with readiness an <Col N="857" /> arrangement similar to the sugar rationing scheme that existed during the last war, where we were required to take 1 cwt. of brown sugar to five cwt. of white sugar, and I am sure that I would be able to dispose of one cwt. of barley meal for, say, every three cwts. of Indian meal, and could do it without any subsidy or without loss.</P>
    <P>There is no risk whatever in giving that guarantee.  I doubt if even 1 per cent. of the people who ordinarily grow barley would avail of it, but it would remove that apprehension in the minds of people, who have not been in the habit of growing barley, which might deter them from planting barley this season fearing that it would be left on their hands.  Therefore, if we are to get back into the production of pigs with the rapidity which is so desirable under existing circumstances, I urge the Minister to take effective measures now to secure the production of adequate quantities of barley as pig feeding next autumn and in the time hereafter.</P>

      <P>I confess that my first intention, when this Bill was introtroduced, was to vote against it, but I have been more or less influenced by two points during the various stages of the Bill.  I may say, frankly, that I have been impressed by the sympathetic manner with which the Minister has tried to meet the wishes of all Parties in the House and to make the Bill the best Bill that could be made. I think we all appreciate that.  I have been influenced further by the statement the Minister has just made, that this is not intended to be a permanent measure and that he hopes to introduce permanent legislation, at any rate, at no far distant date.  I hope that the Minister can promise us now that permanent legislation will be brought in as soon as this unfortunate war is over, if not before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I regret that it was not possible for the Minister to accept Deputy Dillon's amendment, or that he did not see his way to introduce some similar amendment of his own.  To my mind, it would not have created the difficulties that <Col N="858" /> some people seem to apprehend.  However, that is done with now.  I do not anticipate any difficulty whatsoever, during the war, in getting rid of our pig population, either in the form of live pigs or in the form of bacon.  Our only problem will be how to make the best of the best market and how to get all that possibly can be got out of it. If the Bill helps the Minister in that direction, then I wish him every joy of it, but as a permanent measure I still &ldquo;hae my doots&rdquo;, and I hope he will give an indication that he intends to bring in a permanent measure at least as soon as the unfortunate crisis, under which everybody is labouring now, will have passed away.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the Bill will be helpful to the pig industry in so far as you have removed in a large measure the interferences of the last two boards, but there is one thing about which I am somewhat apprehensive, and that is the question of the allocation of export licences.  I should like the Minister to tell us how these export licences are going to be allocated. I understand at the present time that only 25 per cent. of bacon production in England is controlled, that the controlled price in England at the present time is 15/- a score, and that the other 75 per cent. is sold in a free market at from 18/- to 20/- a score, which is a difference of from about 17/- or 18/- to £1 a cwt.  What I want to get information on is this: I believe that, if we continue to export large quantities of bacon, we will have to sell that bacon to the food controller at the controlled price, and at the present time it is only making 15/- a score, whereas live pigs are sold in a free market at a much better price.  Our pigs would command from 18/- to 19/- or £1 a score, and so they would be worth 17/- or 18/- in the free market more than the bacon sold under the controlled price to the food controller. That is my information, at any rate, and if I am correct I say to the Minister that we should export all the live pigs we possibly can at the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may say that he expects there will be some alterations <Col N="859" /> made shortly with regard to control by the food controller&mdash;possibly in the New Year&mdash;but if we could establish a higher price for our pigs, even for the next month or two, it would be very useful to us in connection with any negotiations we might have with the food controller in the future, and for that reason we ought to avail of every opportunity to export as many live pigs as possible and get the better price for them.  I think it is bad policy to be selling bacon at the lower price, when we could get a much better price for live pigs.  I would like some information about that.</P>
    <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Dillon about barley, I have some experience of growing barley and of feeding it to pigs, and I believe that there will be&mdash;and that you can have &mdash;growing in the country next year a lot of barley, except on light, poor land, and more especially if there is any danger of a shortage of artificial manures.  On a lot of land one can grow barley without the aid of artificial manures.  Taking the point mentioned by Deputy Dillon with regard to variety, I think we are growing a variety of barley here that is a heavy yielder.  I might point out that practically all the barley is used for the manufacture of stout and the colour does not matter so much; that is the reason why we grow a variety that is a heavy yielder.  In some parts of England they grow barley for light ales, and in this case it is very essential to have a bright barley for the purpose of a bright ale, like Goldthorpe. That is a bright barley but a poor yielder; yet it commands a much higher price.  The type which we grow here is practically 100 per cent. for the manufacture of stout.  For that purpose one does not need that bright appearance on the barley at all.  For some years we have grown Archer Spratt and Danish Archer, which are the best yielders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The yield will be sacrificed <Col N="860" /> if we give way to the other. There may be an advantage, but there will not be the yield.  One will be sacrificed to the other, so I think we may take it that the right type is the type that is being grown at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that Deputy Dillon has been altogether fair in saying that we have over-stressed the growing of wheat and beet.  At any time when I took the opportunity&mdash; whether over the radio or elsewhere&mdash; of speaking on this question, I tried to impress on the farmers that they should grow foodstuffs, in their own interests, for their own animals, and I pointed out that we had no idea as to what the future would be like and especially that we had no idea whether there would be sufficient foodstuffs imported during the year commencing 1940.  For that reason, if the farmers want to be secure, they should grow their own foodstuffs as far as possible. It is true that we did stress the growing of wheat: that was because the last few months were in the beet-growing season and, naturally, the Government must have consideration for the human food supply, if there is any danger of shipping being deficient and so on.</P>
      <P>I think that Deputy Hughes has dealt with the point raised by Deputy Dillon; and from his own practical experience, I am quite sure that he could deal with it much better than I could.  I believe the native barley is somewhat better for feeding, as it contains more nitrogen; it is that very fact which makes it unsuitable for malting.  Though it may not be very much, there is a little more nitrogen in it than there is in Archer Spratt and for that reason it may be more suitable.  From what I have heard, and from what I learned in a barley-growing area when I was young, there is hardly sufficient to make it worth while to depart from the Archer Spratt as a general barley for the whole country, whether it is used for malting or anything else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="861" /> I hope the fear that Deputy Hughes has expressed will not be realised and that we may have no shortage of manures.  Our manufacturers appear to have been able to purchase the raw materials and they have every hope that they will be able to get them in. As I say, however, we do not know what the position may be in regard to shipping as time goes on.  We can only hope that we may be able to get them in.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon may be right&mdash;I think he is&mdash;that if we get every farmer to grow the grain and the potatoes that he wants for himself and not bother about selling barley and oats, it will be a good thing.  We have, however, to note the psychological fact that if there is a good price the farmers will grow for sale.  The amount of oats grown is fairly considerable, but only a very small proportion of it is sold.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is dropping in area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason given for that drop in area was the price of oats, but there is only something like 10 per cent. or 15 per cent. sold of all the oats grown.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister says oats sold, does he include in those sales the oats sold between farmer and farmer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think so.  As far as we can find out regarding what is known as the cash crop&mdash;grain sold off the farm&mdash;taking one year with another it amounted only to about 15 per cent. of the oats grown.  If oats is obtaining a bad price in a particular year, it will be found that there is a decline in the acreage next year.  If the price improves, the acreage goes up correspondingly. The price has what appears to be a psychological effect on the acreage. There is a different position now, it is admitted, and the farmer who considers his position and looks to the future may be very much more inclined now to grow oats, barley or potatoes for his own animals than he would have been before the war.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the seed barley position is all right.  As regards the seed oats position, we have endeavoured to get a considerable quantity of oats put aside for seed.  We find it very hard to get seed oats for the market because a lot of farmers are holding on to their oats.  They may sell it in the springtime for seed.</P>
      <P>I do not think it would be advisable to give any undertaking with regard to the price of barley.  On considering this matter, I can only see one way of dealing with barley and that is to go back to some scheme like the maize mixing scheme.  After all, it does not matter what price I say the farmer should get for his harvest, if I give any guarantee and the farmer comes with the crop next harvest, I do not see what any Minister for Agriculture could do except put it through the ordinary channels of trade and let it go to the maize miller for disposal in some way or other.  It may not be necessary actually to mix it, but to arrange that for every five tons of maize meal one must buy a ton of barley.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>After sitting here for a while one believes nothing.  Another point I would like to deal with is that of the county instructors.  They have been carrying on good work for years, not only under this Government, but under the last Government.  I remember <Col N="863" /> reading of some interesting experiments which were made in 1927 and 1928 in various counties.  In addition to carrying out these experiments they also gave lectures on the value of home-grown grain for feeding.  There was a very fine summary of these experiments carried out by the Department published in the Department of Agriculture Journal as far back as 1927.  These county instructors are still carrying out experiments and advising farmers and county committees of agriculture to grow their own foodstuffs.  Perhaps we should do more in that line, but certainly this matter is not being neglected.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bennett says that he thinks, when it is all over and done with, the Bill is not so bad.  If anything goes wrong with this Bill&mdash;I hope Deputy Cosgrave is taking a note of this&mdash;we will all accept joint responsibility.</P>

      <P>With regard to export licences, I dealt with that matter on the last day when we were discussing this Bill, and I suppose I need not go fully into the whole matter again.  We agreed to send a certain amount of bacon and live pigs to Great Britain and the proportion of live pigs to go to Great Britain remains fairly constant the whole year through.  The proportion was raised considerably last month, and we propose to raise it still more this month.  It was only to-day that I got word back from the British Government that they had agreed to accept more live pigs this month.</P>

While that is a fact, there is no doubt that several traders and several Deputies were writing to the Department, to the board dealing with this matter and to me, urging that many more licences should be sent out.  I have also seen resolutions passed by public boards asking for more licences, but some of those issued last month came back unused.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="The Tánaiste Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  As the long title indicates, this Bill is directed to the establishment of a Department of Supplies and to effecting certain amendments in the Ministers and Secretaries Acts, 1924 and 1928.  The 8th September, 1939, is the date upon which the appointment of a Minister for Supplies was made by the Government. <Col N="865" /> While the establishment of a new Department has been due to conditions created by the present emergency, the Government have been advised that from the legal standpoint it would be desirable, if not necessary, that the Minister for Supplies should be formally incorporated with a seal and with the capacity to sue and be sued in the like manner as the Ministers under the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924.  The Government have been advised also that it is doubtful if this could be carried out by an Emergency Order.  It is possible that later the Minister may find it necessary to enter into contracts and to appear as plaintiff and defendant in the courts. In the absence of incorporation there would be some obscurity as to the Minister's capacity in legal proceedings. He would not be a competent plaintiff and probably would only be liable as a defendant in his personal capacity, and the Government are satisfied that it would be invidious to allow such a state of affairs to arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be noted that the Bill does not suggest that the new Department will be of a temporary nature.  It is understood that the establishment as a corporation sole of a purely temporary body would be open to objection on legal grounds, and it is contemplated accordingly that the Department would be wound up when necessary by specific amending legislation. The Bill indicates in a general way what the function of the Department of Supplies will be, and provides for the transfer to it of functions in relation to essential supplies and services previously exercised by other Departments as and when found necessary. It will be appreciated that in existing circumstances and in the circumstances which are likely to obtain it would be difficult to state in any more precise form the functions which it may be found to be expedient to allocate to the new Department, and that the maximum degree of elasticity as between Departments concerned in one way or another in the provision and maintenance of essential supplies and services should be provided for. Advantage has been taken of the <Col N="866" /> necessity for introducing this Bill to propose certain other amendments of the earlier Ministers and Secretaries Acts which experience has shown to be desirable.  The Bill creates formally the office of Minister without portfolio, and empowers the Government to assign to such Minister a specific style or title which shall be judicially and officially noticed.</P>
    <P>It may perhaps be mentioned that the considerations already referred to as indicating the desirability on legal grounds of providing for the incorporation of the Minister for Supplies would not, it is thought, apply to every Minisster without portfolio unless his functions were of such a kind that their effective discharge would be facilitated by incorporation.  The Bill accordingly does not include a general provision for the incorporation of such Ministers.</P>
    <P>Clause 5 of the Bill makes provision for the transfer of Departments of State to and from Ministers.  It has been deemed desirable to make specific statutory provision for transfers of the kind and to vest the power of reassignment in the Taoiseach, in whom the power of original allocation of Departments is vested by Section 3 of the principal Act, as adapted by the Constitution (Consequential Provisions) Act, 1937.  As the reallocation of certain Departments carried out on the 8th September last was effected by Government Order and not by the Taoiseach it has been necessary to insert a sub-section bringing the action taken into conformity with the general legislative intention.</P>
    <P>It is proposed to repeal Section 12 of the 1924 Act and Section 4 of the 1928 Act, which deal with various powers of the Government in relation to Departments of State and to provide afresh for these in a more comprehensive and precise form.  For example, it has hitherto been possible to alter the titles of Ministers or Departments of State only where a redistribution of public services amongst Ministers or Departments has taken place, but it is considered desirable that the power to alter titles should not be so restricted.  The other provisions of Clause 6 of the Bill represent, as indicated, a more precise <Col N="867" /> provision for the powers and duties mentioned in the clause than the corresponding provision in the earlier Acts.</P>
    <P>Clause 7 of the Bill, which covers the temporary inability of Ministers, deals much more precisely with the arrangements to be made for the discharge of their duties than Section 11 of the principal Act which the Bill proposes to repeal.  In particular, the new clause provides that the acting Minister shall be for all purposes the Minister having charge of the Department of which he is in temporary control. Hitherto, the acting Minister has been merely an agent and final responsibility has rested with the permanent Minister. Clause 8 of the Bill proposes to confer upon Parliamentary Secretaries the right to attend and be heard in either House of the Oireachtas.  An arrangement of this kind is clearly desirable, as, for example, in the event of sudden illness of a Minister, or where matters arising out of the discharge by a Parliamentary Secretary of duties delegated to him, fall to be discussed in the House of which he is not a member.</P>
    <P>The Bill contemplates that the power of delegation of duties to Parliamentary Secretaries provided for in Section 7(7) of the Act of 1924 shall be extended to include statutory powers and duties.  It has been found, in practice, that in order to comply with the requirements of a particular statute, a Minister is from time to time required to discharge in person duties which, in fact, are largely of a formal or routine nature and, in some cases, the discharge of such duties occupies an altogether undue proportion of his time.  The Government are satisfied that there is a reasonable case for taking power to delegate statutory powers and duties of the kind, where considered desirable in the interests of administration, to Parliamentary Secretaries. It will be seen that the conditions under which it is proposed that delegation should be effected are circumscribed, and that, in particular, delegation would not operate to relieve a Minister, whose power or powers <Col N="868" /> have been delegated, of his responsibility for their due exercise or performance.</P>
    <P>The power of delegation to a Parliamentary Secretary of Ministerial powers and duties of a statutory kind is, of course, provided for in the recent Emergency Powers Act, but that Act has been framed to meet circumstances of an exceptional kind and is purely temporary, and the power of delegation conferred by it is not subject to all the express conditions proposed in the present Bill.  Clause 10 of the Bill is directed merely to giving covering statutory authority to the changes in the Irish names of certain Ministers and Departments which were adopted following on the coming into operation of the Constitution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has as its ostensible reason the necessity for legalising, or putting upon a statutory basis, the new Department of Supplies, but the Bill does something, I think, far more radical than giving legal effect to what might possibly be a situation of some juristic ambiguity because the Bill introduces some new principles into our existing Governmental machinery.  We have introduced into this Bill provisions for Ministers without portfolio.  We have extensive powers of delegation by Ministers of their functions to Parliamentary Secretaries. We have, as a third principle, the right of Parliamentary Secretaries to be heard in the Dáil, if they happen to be Senators, and to be heard in the Seanad, if they happen to be members of the Dáil.  It will, therefore, be obvious that this Bill is wider in its scope than was originally anticipated when the Bill was introduced as a Bill merely to give legal effect to the position of the Department of Supplies. I think that probably the Minister was wise in bringing in a Bill to make the position of the Department of Supplies legally sound.  That is an aspect of the matter on which I do not intend to pass any observations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly interested, however, in this new proposal to create Ministers without portfolio.  That is, I think, a rather radical proposal.  It <Col N="869" /> is a proposal which emerges for the first time in the history of this State. The position of a Minister without portfolio under the Bill, as I understand it, is that he is a member of the Government but is not in charge of any Department of State.  I was reminded of the position of a Minister without portfolio recently when I attended a play at the Abbey Theatre, produced for the first time during the past few weeks, one of George Shiel's comedies.  &ldquo;Give Him a House&rdquo; was the title of it.  One of the principal characters was a lorry driver who was out of a job and somebody asked him what he was.  He said: &ldquo;At the moment I am a lorry driver without portfolio.&rdquo; It appeared to me as if the author of that play had envisaged the situation created under this Bill for a Minister without portfolio because, in fact, the position created under the Bill for a Minister without portfolio is that of a Minister without a job.  In the case of the lorry driver in the play, however, he would not have been paid while he was without a job but in this particular instance the Minister without portfolio is being paid at the expense of the taxpayer for doing no job.</P>
    <P>The Minister touched very lightly on the introduction of this radical new principle in the Bill.  In his introductory remarks, he actually did not give any indication to the House as to what was the necessity for the introduction of this new principle, or why it was necessary to provide for the establishment of Ministers without portfolio.  It is a new constitutional principle in our governmental machinery, as I have said already, and I think that the House would have expected that this principle would be dealt with more adequately by the Minister in his introductory speech.  His speech really was anything but a Second Reading speech on a Bill of this importance, introducing, at least, two or three new principles.  It was more in the nature of a Committee speech.  It dealt very lightly, indeed, with the underlying principles of the Bill.  The really important principle in the Bill, in my view, is not the establishment of the Department of Supplies but this <Col N="870" /> creation of new Ministers without portfolio. I have said that I can see no reason in existing circumstances why there should be any Ministers without portfolio.  At least one of the Ministers, at the moment, has three portfolios. I think the Taoiseach himself is carrying three portfolios and why it should be necessary in that state of facts, where the head of the Government has charge of at least three Departments, to create Ministers who have no Department to administer, is not quite apparent.</P>
    <P>There is a further very important point to which I should like to direct the Minister's specific attention.  That is the rather serious problem as to whether the establishment of Ministers without portfolio is really not unconstitutional. I am not raising that point for the purpose of creating difficulties in the Minister's way, if he can make a case for the establishment of such functions as Ministers without portfolio.  It would appear to me that the provisions of the Constitution dealing with the Government envisaged that each member of the Government should be in charge of a Department of State.  They certainly do not envisage specifically that there should be members of the Government who have no Departments of State to administer. Looking at Clause 4 and Clause 12 of Article 28 of the Constitution, there would appear to me to be abundant arguments on which to ground the contention that the establishment of Ministers without portfolio is unconstitutional. I presume that the Minister has considered this aspect of the matter.  It is one on which I certainly should like to have the benefit of his reasons as to why he considers this particular type of governmental machinery is within the provisions of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Article 28, paragraph 4(2), of the Constitution provides that</P>
    <P>the Government shall meet and act as a collective authority and shall be collectively responsible for the Departments of State administered by the members of the Government.</P>
    <P>It would appear to me to be the reasonable, natural, and ordinary interpretation <Col N="871" /> of that clause of Article 28 of the Constitution that the Government, which is to act as a collective authority with collective responsibility, should have as its members only such people as are, in fact, in charge of Departments of State, because the Government, under that particular clause, is responsible for the Departments of State administered by the members of the Government.  If there are members of the Government who are not administering any Department of State, then it would appear as if the Government's collective responsibility would not cover such members which, of course, would be a ridiculous constitutional situation.  Clause 12 of the Article provides for a number of matters which are to be regulated by ordinary law.  Amongst the matters which the clause says shall be regulated by ordinary law are: The organisation of, and distribution of business amongst Departments of State, the designation of members of the Government to be the Ministers in charge of the said Departments, the discharge of the functions of the office of a member of the Government during his temporary absence or incapacity, and the remuneration of the members of the Government.</P>
    <P>Now if you find in an Article of the Constitution a specific enumeration of a number of topics which are to be regulated by ordinary legislation, the ordinary presumption, in accordance with a well-known canon of construction, is that nothing except what is specifically enumerated is within the scope of the Article.  There is a Latin tag which summarises that rule of construction as <i>expressio unius est exclusio alterius.</i> Those matters that I have referred to give sufficient force, at all events, to the contention that there is a good deal to be said for the argument that the establishment of Ministers without portfolio is not within the scope or contemplation of the Governmental machinery set up by the Constitution, and may, indeed, be regarded as unconstitutional. The Minister, I think, should direct his attention, in his concluding speech, not merely to justifying from a practical point of view the necessity for the setting up of <Col N="872" /> Ministers without fortfolio who will have nothing apparently to do except to be members of the Government, but he should also justify the bringing within the ambit of the constitutional provisions to which I have adverted very briefly these proposals for the establishment of Ministers without portfolio.</P>
    <P>The second principle that is embodied in this Bill is the right of audience to Parliamentary Secretaries in the Dáil and Seanad.  That is a matter upon which people may legitimately have different views.  Personally, I agree with the provisions in the Bill giving the right of audience to Parliamentary Secretaries, provided it is not overdone.  I do think that the Minister, in introducing this Bill, dealt very cursorily with a rather vital principle contained in Section 8, dealing with the right of audience of Parliamentary Secretaries, and that he ought to have gone into that matter in a little greater detail, giving more justification than he has done for the introduction of that proposal into this Bill.</P>
    <P>The next matter that I would like to draw attention to is this right of delegation which is contained in Section 9 of the Bill.  That section, as it stands at the moment, contains a very wide list of powers of delegation, and I would like to know whether the Minister has considered the impact of the proposals in this Bill on the existing provisions in sub-section (7) of Section 7 of the Ministers and Secretaries Act of 1924.  Now it must be remembered in that connection that sub-section (7) of Section 7 of the 1924 Act is not repealed in this Bill.  That sub-section, if I may recall the Minister's recollection to its provisions, provided for what was then known as the Executive Council, the distributing or allocating of particular branches of the public service, or of branches of Departments of Ministers to Parliamentary Secretaries.  It would appear to do in short what is being done in very much greater detail in Section 9 of this Bill, and while, apparently, it is not intended to repeal sub-section (7) of Section 7 of the Ministers and Secretaries Act of 1924, I think the Minister <Col N="873" /> should give some consideration as to whether or not considerable legal difficulty may ensue from the two sections being allowed to stand with apparently concurrent legal effect.</P>
    <P>There are some matters of detail on this power of delegation that I would like some guidance upon from the Minister when replying.  The power of delegation is very wide.  The Minister can, apparently, strip himself of all power and vest it in his Parliamentary Secretary.  I doubt if that is constitutional, and I doubt if it is proper even if it were constitutional; but then the section proceeds to enact that, even though the Minister does delegate all or some of his powers, he still retains, concurrently with his agent, the same power as the agent has.  I do not know how that is going to operate as a practical or legal possibility. If the Minister is delegating certain powers, who is to be sued by a person who wishes to sue?  Is it the Minister, or is it the Parliamentary Secretary to whom the powers are being delegated?  A well-known example of the powers that may be delegated under this power, when it is passed into law, is the statutory power vested in Ministers to do certain things.  If the Minister delegates the right and authority given him by statute to his Parliamentary Secretary, and if something done under that power is the subject matter, or is intended to be the subject matter, of court proceedings, who is to be sued?</P>
    <P>In that connection perhaps I may return for a moment to a matter more or less akin arising out of the question of Ministers without portfolio.  One of the peculiarities of this proposal to set up Ministers without portfolio that struck a reader of this Bill immediately was the contrast between a Minister without portfolio and the ordinary Minister, a member of the Government. The Minister, in his introductory remarks, referred to the fact that a Minister without portfolio was not being incorporated.  I was anxious to know why the provisions which are contained in this Bill and in the Ministers and Secretaries Act of 1924, providing for the incorporation of a Minister, and <Col N="874" /> for his suing and being sued as such, were omitted in the case of Ministers without portfolio.  The Minister, when introducing this Bill, went very lightly over the reasons why Ministers without portfolio were not intended to be incorporated. I understand the reasons the Minister gave, of course, but they do not satisfy me.  In any event, I think the Minister ought to deal with that in a much more elaborate way in his concluding speech.</P>
    <P>There are some smaller matters of detail which might be more appropriately dealt with on the Committee Stage, and which I intend to refer to only in passing.  For example, the provisions in Section 6 of the Bill provide that the Government may do a vast variety of rather vital matters by order.  They may alter the name of any Department of State in Irish or in English.  Arising out of that particular power, the provisions of the Schedule immediately come to one's attention. We find in the Schedule elaborate provisions for the changing of the Irish titles.  I can only assume that the provisions in the Schedule represent some sort of change in ministerial policy on the question of the simplified spelling of Irish.</P>
    <P>I confess I have a little more sympathy with the unsimplified spelling of Irish than with the simplified spelling. In that I confess I am out of date with the Ministers and with those scholars who think that the simplified spelling of Irish would lead to greater simplicity and greater success in the learning of Irish.  The sole purpose of this Schedule would appear to be to put back on its pedestal the old method of spelling and to bring back those letters which are regarded by the advocates of simplified spelling, as being entirely redundant.  I do not know whether this does show a change in Ministerial policy on that important problem.  At all events the Minister does provide power for his successor &mdash;if he differs from the present apparent view of the Government that simplified spelling is a really important method of advancing the Irish language&mdash;to introduce a new Schedule, doing away with the <Col N="875" /> present Schedule and other sections provided here for altering the title of Ministers either in Irish or in English. The powers in the existing Ministers and Secretaries Acts were simple in that regard.  I think the power to change the title of Departments and Ministers should be very sparingly exercised.  It leads to difficulties with the Departments concerned in matters of legal proceedings.  Because if in legal proceedings Ministerial titles are changed, the record has to be changed and amended in order to fit the particular title at the time when judgment is given.  One absurd example of that recently occurred in a case in which I was involved.  The defendant was the Minister for Finance.  The action was started before the present Constitution came into force and the title of the proceedings had to be altered.  It was a case of A. B. against the Minister for Finance.  The amendments that are to be put in would appear to the ordinary person somewhat absurd.  If a Government indulges in that sort of easy change of nomenclature of Ministers and their Departments some ridiculous consequences may be produced.</P>
    <P>There is one small matter of detail also in Section 7, to which I would like to call the attention of the Minister. I would like the Minister's views on this particular matter, that is the securing of power that an Acting-Minister will carry on the functions of a Minister who is ill or unable to discharge the functions of his office. There is provision in this section for such person to be called Acting-Minister. I do not know what the impact of that provision is to be on this Bill.  If a person wants to sue the Minister while there is an Acting-Minister there, the position is, that he sues the Minister because the statutory obligation never changes though a particular Minister may change. Here you have a provision providing that somebody may call himself Acting-Minister. That introduces a confusion that is wholly unnecessary and leads to some doubt as to what the position is. These are matters of detail which the Minister may possibly clarify.  I think <Col N="876" /> the Minister has the duty of justifying such a very vital change in our constitutional position, namely, the introduction of a Minister without portfolio. That change ought to be dealt with by the Minister from two aspects: first, the practical aspect as to what is the necessity for such a Ministerial office under existing circumstances; and second, what is the position under the Constitution?</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Costello I thought it was strange that the Minister did not, instead of confining himself to what I might call the explanation of each section, give us some justification for the Bill especially in what we consider its most startling provision.  I am also struck with the fact that though there is a provision and though there is a reference in the Title of the Bill to the Department of Supplies, the Minister is not sure of the necessity for having any provisions for it here at all.  It does appear that there should be formal power to set up this Ministry but from the Minister's reference it is not clear that it is necessary. There is no reference to the creation of the title of Minister without portfolio.  There are three things with which this Bill deals: (1) Minister for Supplies; (2) the Minister without portfolio; and (3), roughly speaking, an elaboration of the position of Parliamentary Secretaries.  What I should have liked from the Minister was that in his Second Reading speech where he was dealing with the justification for bringing in the Bill, he would have shown us the necessity for the setting up of a separate Department of Supplies.  That Department has been set up but has there been any real necessity for doing so?  Has our experience of the operations of that particular Department in the last three months been such an experience as to induce us to sanction any longer the continuance of that particular Department? We have had opportunities here during the course of the last few months to deal with the complete failure of that Department as a separate Department to deal with the situation that confronts the country. We are now asked to give formal sanction <Col N="877" /> to that.  And not merely that, but retrospectively, to give legal approval to the actions of that particular Department though we were convinced that on every ground we should like to reverse many of its actions.  Has that Department of Supplies, as a separate Department, functioned any better&mdash;it might be difficult to function any worse &mdash;than did the same Department when it was portion of the Department of Industry and Commerce?  Has the present crisis involved such new duties on the Minister for Industry and Commerce that he must needs shuffle off the responsibility for supplies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, what I find about the Minister's statement is that though it explains some of the legal difficulties which the Bill seemed to convey to the ordinary man, it skipped the really important points.  There is, as Deputy Costello has pointed out, provision in Section 2 (3) for the incorporation of the Ministry.  Might I ask the Minister what is the position, not now with reference to the precise point raised by Deputy Costello?  I understand from the provisions of the Bill that the Minister without portfolio may be entrusted with certain administrative functions.  He may take over, at the request of the Taoiseach or the Executive Council, certain portions of a Department of State.  Is that not so? That, I think, is the intention.  The Minister shakes his head.  Therefore, the Minister without portfolio cannot be entrusted with the administration of any Department of State or any portion of a Department of State? Perhaps the Minister will clear up that particular point.  I understand that the Executive Council could redistribute at its will&mdash;the Taoiseach and the Executive Council between them, because sometimes it is the Government does it and sometimes it is the Taoiseach; at any rate, one or other of them, or both combined&mdash;could redistribute the work of the Departments of State between the Ministers. I understood that the man who was Minister without portfolio might occasionally be asked to do some work.  I gathered, with his eye on the future, that the Tánaiste is anxious to shuffle off all such responsibility.  He shakes <Col N="878" /> his head.  He is shocked at the idea that the Minister without portfolio should be asked to do some work.  It seems to me that under the Bill he may be asked to face that terrible castastrophe.  If so, can he be sued? Deliberately, no provision was made for that.  I must say I did not understand the defence put forward by the Minister for that particular omission.</P>
    <P>We come now to what I might call&mdash; again with all deference to the Minister&mdash;the royal lounger.  I see he likes the title.  The royalty appeals to him, I have no doubt.  The royal lounger is to get £1,700 a year for the benefit that the wisdom of his grey hairs can bring to the Executive Council.  It is not for doing work, not for looking after a Department, not for accepting any responsibility, but for sitting in the Executive Council occasionally and saying: &ldquo;Look here, are you wise in doing this?  I have spent a lot of time in public life, local public life and central public life, and, with my great record of various kinds in the past, I advise you not to do this, or at least to think over it until to-morrow.&rdquo; For that, we are to give him £1,700 a year. There was one very interesting phrase that the Minister used in reference to this royal lounger.  He said: &ldquo;Section 4 formally creates a Minister without portfolio.&rdquo;  Formally creates? I gather, therefore&mdash;here is a Cabinet secret revealed&mdash;that there are members of the Cabinet who, for practical purposes at the moment, are without portfolio, though they may seem to be responsible for Departments.  Now we are formally creating the office of Minister without portfolio.  I suggested on one occasion to the Minister himself that he partly occupied that office in his capacity of Minister for Finance, and the intrusion of the Taoiseach in the debate the last day rather bears that out.  We are asked to agree to the creation of that office at a moment when there seems to be no justification for extra expenditure, whatever may be the abstract advantage of having a man of great European and corporation experience.  I forgot that point; I hope that will be forgiven; perhaps that is the reason it is in at the present moment, to get <Col N="879" /> a man of great, widespread, European experience, a man who has lived in different capitals in Europe, and to relieve him of the necessity for responsibility.</P>
    <P>We are asked to do that at a time when even the Government occasionally professes a desire for economy. The Minister for Finance has appointed a committee to inquire into the possibility of decreasing expenditure; yet the same Minister for Finance, who appoints that committee and asks it in all seriousness to see where savings can be made in the Civil Service, brings in or takes responsibility for a Bill which creates a Minister for the purpose, as I say, of giving the Executive Council the benefit of his wide experience and wisdom, and receiving £1,700 a year.  I put it to the members of the Fianna Fáil Party, is the wisdom&mdash;the general wisdom, apart from their great administrative ability, of course&mdash;of any member of that body worth the salary of a Minister?  That is what you are going to vote for.  If another Minister should feel rather tired, and say he had done enough in the way of administration, apparently he also can be appointed Minister without portfolio.  There is no difficulty, because we have a man in the Cabinet who is apparently willing to take on any number of Ministries, a kind of unconscionable pooh-bah or pluralist. The number of Ministries he can absorb is without limit, and the better apparently to allow that process to continue&mdash;the suppression of one real Ministry after another and the creation of Ministries that mean nothing&mdash; we have elaborate provisions made for the Parliamentary Secretary.  I do not think it is desirable that any man should concentrate a number of Ministries in himself, and that a lot of work should be passed over to Parliamentary Secretaries.  For instance, who is responsible to this House?  Let us say that a Parliamentary Secretary is appointed for education: we have a Minister for Education.  Let us say that a Parliamentary Secretary is appointed for external affairs: we have a Minister for External Affairs. Who is responsible to this House?  The Minister?  But it is becoming the custom, <Col N="880" /> for instance in the case of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Works, that is, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister himself, to take all the responsibility and to answer for it.  Is that the situation towards which we are developing&mdash;a number of men in the Executive Council who have no real administrative work, the absorption of Ministry after Ministry and Department after Department by one individual, and the shuffling off of the actual work to Parliamentary Secretaries?  Technically, the Minister may still be responsible to the House, but when we look at the somewhat elaborate provisions&mdash; elaborate in comparison to the old provisions&mdash;it is difficult to know whether it is really the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary who is fully responsible, or whether both are responsible. It is not clear.</P>
    <P>At a time, as I say, when people are crying out for economy, on bringing in a Bill of this kind&mdash;calling it a Bill for the creation of a Minister for Supplies, when it really means the creation of a Minister without portfolio&mdash;I should like if the Minister had thought it necessary to justify that, but he approached this House apparently without thinking or without seeing that there was any necessity to give a justification for it.  We were not told why this provision was introduced.  To be told that it merely formally creates a Minister without portfolio is simply refusing to give any explanation of one of the principal features&mdash;we believe the principal feature&mdash;of the Bill.  It may be that the Head of the Government requires a Minister without portfolio in a different sense, to see that the other Ministers are doing some work, to watch them.  Beyond that, and the occasional advice to the Executive Council when important topics turned up, and giving them the benefit of his wide experience, what else is he there for?</P>
    <P>That is the portion of the Bill that we find it most difficult to support.  No justification has been put forward for it.  I invite the Minister to give us the justification.  Why is it necessary at the present moment to make this provision?  What use is intended to <Col N="881" /> be made of it, if any?  If there is no reason for it, why then bring it in, when it must have the effect of creating in the minds of the people of the country the idea that the Government are determined to spend £1,700 a year on some member of the Government and that he is undertaking none of the onerous work of looking after a Department?</P>
    <P>There are other provisions in the Bill to which one might like to refer.  I wish, instead of telling us what is in the Bill&mdash;that, to a large extent, we know, and, therefore, the recital of it is quite useless&mdash;that the Minister would go into an explanation of some of the legal points.  For such an explanation we would be very grateful to the Minister.  He ought to explain to us the necessity that exists for many of these steps that are proposed.  I am never quite clear, and have not been since the Constitution was passed &mdash;and this Bill does not help to clear it up&mdash;as to the relative positions of the Taoiseach and the Government.  I wonder very often whether the Minister is clear&mdash;I gather he is not&mdash;as to what the relative position is arising out of the Government's joint responsibility and the Taoiseach.  This Bill certainly does develop what the Minister might say was foreshadowed in the Constitution&mdash;the replacing of Governmental responsibility by the responsibility of the Taoiseach.  I think a development of that kind ought to be thought out before it is encouraged.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether the purpose was to throw&mdash;I cannot believe it, in the case of such a language authority as the Minister&mdash;a certain amount of ridicule on the Irish language?  It is very hard to believe that that will not be the effect.  If, with every wind that blows as to Irish spelling, there is to be a change, you are turning, not merely the Ministers into objects of ridicule, but you are giving a certain official <i>cachet</i> to the ridicule that is sometimes cast on the language itself. I doubt if what you are gaining is worth that particular risk.  You can organise any number of Departments and SubDepartments of the State, and every one of them, whether they are separate <Col N="882" /> Ministries or not, must involve additional expense.  You are encouraged by this Bill to do it.</P>
    <P>The only other point that I have to deal with already has been adequately dealt with by Deputy Costello.  It concerns the position of Section 9 with sub-section (7) of the original Act.  The Minister said something about circumscribing the functions of the Parliamentary Secretary, but the general powers still remain under sub-section (7) of the Act of 1924.  If the general clause still remains, I do not see that your circumscribing does any good. There is one thing I would like to refer to in connection with Section 8.  The Minister, in making a plea for this particular clause, did give a reason&mdash;an unusual thing for him, I will admit, to give a reason for any of the sections of this Bill, but he did give it in this case&mdash;and it was that the Minister in charge of the Department may be ill and, therefore, it is desirable that his Parliamentary Secretary should come into this House, if he is a member of the Seanad, or should have the right to go into the Seanad if he is a member of this House.</P>
    <P>That raises two difficulties in my mind.  Generally speaking, the Parliamentary Secretary is responsible for only a small portion of the work of the Department that comes under the control of the Minister.  Certain functions are delegated to him, but not the whole business.  Therefore, if the Minister in charge of any Department is ill, I do not see what the great advantage is in giving certain powers to the Parliamentary Secretary.  That is the one justification given by the Minister.  I have no objection to the clause itself, but if the Minister is ill I do not see how the Parliamentary Secretary can deputise for him in so far as his main work is concerned.  Am I to understand that that is the only case in which the Parliamentary Secretary will deputise?  At present, when the affairs of the Board of Works are being discussed, the Minister for Finance is generally not here, and the whole thing falls on the shoulders of the Parliamentary Secretary.  Is the same thing to happen with one Department <Col N="883" /> of State after another, so that the man who is nominally Minister is, so far as this House is concerned, unclothed of all his responsibility? That is very much like what we are facing.</P>
    <P>I must say that the main difficulty we have on this side of the House as regards this Bill is the creation, without any reasons being given, of this Minister without portfolio.  I leave aside the constitutional question, whether it is or is not in accordance with the Constitution.  I certainly could not give any opinion on that point.  But, in relation to the man who really sits there in state, it is rather high that this State should be asked to pay £1,700 a year, so that the Executive Council should have the benefit of his majestic presence.  It is rather a lot to ask the House to consent to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two matters that I would like to mention in connection with this Bill.  As the Minister mentioned in his opening statement, the Government have been advised that it was necessary to introduce a Bill of this character in order to legalise the new Department and the activities of the new Department. Section 12 deems this Bill to have come into force on the 8th September. If we are asked to pass this Bill in its present form, and for the reasons stated, it is perfectly obvious we are inferentially accepting the position that there is very grave doubt as to whether the Department of Supplies is acting in accordance with law at the present moment, and whether certain of its activities would not be subject to impeachment in a court of law.  Has the Minister considered the advisability of putting in, in addition to Section 12, a section indemnifying the Minister and his officials for anything he or they may have done during the period from the 8th September until this Bill becomes law, and in any event in respect of any act done during that period which may be held not to be covered by the retrospective character of the section?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second matter to which I would like to refer concerns the position of the Parliamentary Secretary.  I quite <Col N="884" /> agree it is very advisable that the Parliamentary Secretary should have a right of audience in either House, but the difficulty is, have the Government considered whether there is any power in this Assembly to delegate to the Parliamentary Secretary the right to appear in a House of which he is not a member?  Have they, in that connection, taken advice on the position under the Constitution?  So far as I can see, it is open to argument, if it is not an absolute certainty, that the Parliamentary Secretary is, under the Constitution, deprived of any such right of audience.</P>
    <P>The Constitution saw fit to deal with the question of the right of audience of members of the Government before either House, and I think it follows as a matter of course from that, that if that were so, and if the Constitution lays down the right of a member of the Government as such to an audience in a House of which he is not a member that that must, as a matter of course, exclude anyone else who is not mentioned in the particular section of the Article in question.  I refer the Minister on that point to Article 28 of the Constitution, sub-paragraph 8:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Every member of the Government shall have the right to attend and be heard in each House of the Oireachtas.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That would seem to me to contemplate that the people when they were enacting this Constitution had the right to state what persons outside an elected member of a particular Assembly ought to appear before it, and having given that right to certain individuals it is not within the power of this House to enlarge that right so as to include any other party, meaning the Parliamentary Secretary.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FionanLynch" hpid="Mr. F. Lynch Mr. F. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say first of all that in regard to the Schedule I think the suggested change of names is a retrograde step.  I think that the changes are, on the whole, for the worse.  I cannot see any point at all in changing from the ordinary simple common expression &ldquo;Aire Airgid&rdquo; to &ldquo;Aire Airgeadais&rdquo;.  There is no point in it.  The word &ldquo;airgead&rdquo; and its <Col N="885" /> genitive case &ldquo;airgid&rdquo; is the ordinary word in common general use amongst Irish-speaking people, and I cannot understand why the coined word &ldquo;airgeadas&rdquo; is brought in here.  Then as to the spelling in the case of &ldquo;dlí&rdquo; I do not know why a whole lot of letters are being added there to make the word &ldquo;dlighidh&rdquo;.  They make absolutely no change in the sound.  There is only one change with which I would agree and in which I think there is an improvement.  I think the existing spelling of &ldquo;Talmhaiochta&rdquo; is awful. There is a combination of three vowels there&mdash;&ldquo;aio&rdquo;&mdash;that creates an absurdity. There is an improvement in that case and in that one only.  I prefer the suggested spelling &ldquo;Talmhaidheachta&rdquo;. There is a change from &ldquo;Gnóthaí Coigríche&rdquo; to Gnóthaí Eachtracha&rdquo; which is not quite clear.  &ldquo;Coigríche&rdquo; is the ordinary well-known and well-used word for &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; or &ldquo;external&rdquo; amongst Irish-speakers.  It is a nicer sounding word, at any rate in my ear, than the word &ldquo;Eachtracha&rdquo;, and I do not know what is the reason for the suggested change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from that, one thing strikes me about the Bill: there is no reference whatever to one Minister whom we have had since September&mdash;the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures.  There is provision for the Minister for Supplies and regularising his position.  Why is there no reference whatever to regularising the position of the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures or is it, by any chance, that he is the person in contemplation when provision is made for the Minister without portfolio?  If that is the case, I think it is wrong to do it in that way.  Instead of creating or establishing the principle of having Ministers without portfolio, in order to cover the case of the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, I think it would be much better to regularise the position as it stands. Apart from anything else, I am perfectly certain that every Deputy in the House would be glad to know what the functions of that Minister are.  By adopting this ruse or this method of covering him up by a provision for <Col N="886" /> Ministers without portfolio, the House is deprived of hearing what exactly are the functions that the Minister is at present fulfilling.</P>
    <P>The Minister may have a Department. I do not know.  As far as I know, he has not, and I take it that it must be to cover his position that this principle is introduced of having Ministers without portfolio.  Deputy Costello has pointed out and, I think, with considerable substance, that the creation of Ministers without portfolio may be in contravention of Article 28 of the Constitution.  There can be no danger of that if the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures is dealt with as the Minister for Supplies is dealt with in this Bill, by name, and with his functions set out before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few aspects of this Bill which strike me as peculiar and to which I wish to draw the attention of the House.  Deputy Costello made a very able speech in which he has pointed out certain legal difficulties.  It would not surprise me one bit to find this Government running a coach and four through the Constitution, seeing that it is sacred only in so far as it serves their particular purpose. We have had evidence that they are quite prepared to smash this Constitution in various other ways as well as in this particular way.  The only thing I would like to know from them is, when they are doing it do they know what they are doing and are they doing it deliberately, or is it that they have no ability whatever and that they run blindly into situations such as this? They have had some lessons in the past week of which they should take advantage and they should be careful in the future.  Personally I do not expect them to be ever very careful in any of these matters at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point that strikes me most of all is that a Party, elected by the people, to have reduced salaries, cheaper administration, administration that was not to cost the people more than the people could bear, has decided to inflate the cost of government in the country at this particular time, when <Col N="887" /> they are reducing expenditure upon unemployment assistance and when they propose to reduce other estimates for social services or essential services. I think that particular aspect of the matter should be brought home to the people.  We know perfectly well that the Executive Council that was in existence prior to the 1st September, 1939, were not unduly hard-worked, and, if they were hard-worked, there was fairly substantial remuneration for that work.  To add to that remuneration at this particular time shows a lack of regard for the financial position of the country.  I appeal positively to the Fianna Fáil back benchers that they should not impose this additional expenditure upon the country at this particular time.  The country Deputies in particular know very well the difficulties with which the people in rural areas have to contend.  When they see the Government, not only increasing the salaries of themselves and the Deputies of the House, but increasing the cost of government at this particular time, it is going to reflect very gravely upon the institutions of State established here.</P>
    <P>It will give a reason or be a cause for people to agitate and say that there is nothing to be expected from this Parliament or from this Government or from this State, and that efforts should be made to alter them. I want to warn the Government that there is a responsibility upon them to set a headline in maintaining the institutions of State established here after such sacrifices and not to do anything that would jeopardise or damage them in any way.</P>
    <P>It is a rather peculiar thing that the Department upon which so much money is being spent, namely, the Department for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, is not mentioned at all in this Bill.  There has been no mention of the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures.  Are we to take it, as Deputy Lynch suggested, that he is to be the new Minister without portfolio?  These are questions to which the Minister must give a very <Col N="888" /> positive answer.  The Government have asked for the co-operation of all Parties in this House, and of this Party in particular, but they have not made any effort to place us in a position to give that co-operation.  They simply propose something, make no attempt to explain it, to give reasons for it, or to make a case as to why it should be so, and expect that we ought to do what the back benchers of Fianna Fáil will do&mdash;troop into the Division Lobby after them.  That is a thing we will not do.  It is not in the interests of the country to do so, and as long as we think it is not, we will not do it. The Constitution and the existing Ministers and Secretaries Act have made ample provision, in my opinion, for all the governmental control that is required and the duties of Government could be fully carried out under them.  We know that in the past one Minister has often deputised for another for considerable periods. Therefore, it must not be a whole-time job for any Minister.  While I agree that a Minister should get ample time for recreation and should get reasonable holidays from his work, at the same time it is unfair that Ministers should leave their jobs or have so little work to do that they can spend a considerable amount of their time at what you might call social gatherings.  I do not want to touch on that very much, because I do not want to adopt any of the tactics adopted by Fianna Fáil against the last Administration when they talked of tall hats, black coats, etc. I just want to pass this comment upon it, that the present Administration have followed the others pretty closely in that respect.  There is only one thing, I suppose, that stops them, and that is that they have not the courage of their convictions.  But while they can attend these social gatherings, and while there is ample time for them to do the work of Government, I feel that this added expenditure should not be placed on the country at this particular time, and that the Executive provided for in the Ministers and Secretaries Act is ample to carry out the duties of government.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately I missed the Minister's introductory remarks, <Col N="889" /> but I gathered from subsequent speeches that as usual he was not over-informative. I am anxious to know if he has made or if he can make any case for the establishment of this particular Ministry, as this Bill is ostensibly a Bill to establish a Ministry of Supplies. I should like to know whether he can make any case for that.  Since that Ministry has been in existence has it done anything, has it secured any supplies or done anything which could not equally have been done through the ordinary channels of the Department of Industry and Commerce, of which it was originally a section?  Has the establishment of that Ministry justified itself in any way?  Deputy Lynch and Deputy MacEoin also referred to the Ministry for the Co-ordination of Defensive Services or, if one takes its initials, the Ministry of &ldquo;Cods&rdquo;, which many will think a more suitable title.  It certainly is surprising that no reference was made to it, because whatever case may be made for the Ministry of Supplies, I think none can be made for that Ministry. I hope the Minister will be able to reassure the House that in fact these two Ministries have done something worth while, because I think very few people are inclined to believe that.</P>

      <P>We did not hear from the Minister any particular reason for this measure in respect of either of these two Ministers, the Minister for Supplies, or the Minister without Portfolio.  Presumably the Ministry of Supplies will be for the duration of the war.  I do not know whether it is intended to continue it after the war has concluded.  We got no information regarding the size of that Department, what it is doing, what it has succeeded in doing, what it hopes to do, or even what it has failed to do, or whether the staff assigned to it has been recruited from other Departments of State, which in consequence of that recruitment will not cost as much as formerly.  Generally, we got no information whatever except a sort of Committee Stage explanation of the various sections of the Bill.  It was rather shocking to hear the Minister say that advantage was taken of the <Col N="890" /> occasion of providing for a Ministry of Supplies to take power to appoint a Minister without portfolio.  There are at present, as far as I can make out, 11 Ministers and five Parliamentary Secretaries.  That is a number in excess of the Ministry.  No case was put to the House for this particular extension. Each Minister sought to be appointed here in excess of that number and, in fact, the Ministry of Supplies as well, will cost, presumably, about £3,000.  There is the Minister's salary and perhaps travelling facilities.  He will have a private secretary, probably a typist, and an office, costing about £3,000.  The Ministry of Supplies will, I am sure, cost much more than that. Let us take it that this has been managed most efficiently and most economically, and that it will only cost £3,000.  A Minister without portfolio will also cost £3,000.  I wonder if it has occurred to the Minister for Finance, in connection with this particular proposal, how many poorer citizens having say, six in family and taxed an extra ¾d. per lb. on sugar, it will take to make up a sum which will, probably, run to about £10,000.  I have not made it up, but offhand I would say that would be the amount.  Are we to go to 10,000 poor citizens, having six in family and say to them: &ldquo;We are to have two new Ministries, one without portfolio, and you will make up the cost by the ¾d. per lb. extra on sugar.&rdquo; It may be that by reason of the detachment of the Ministers from the people of the country they do not know how they are feeling.  I have here a letter that I received from one of these citizens who is a taxpayer, a ratepayer and an industrialist as well.  He says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;My shattered financial condition is due to national laws, State laws, county laws, city laws, corporation laws, liquor laws, mother-in-laws, brother-in-laws, sister-in-laws, and outlaws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Through these laws I am compelled to pay a business tax, amusement tax, head tax, school tax, petrol tax, light tax and excise tax. I am required to get a business licence, car licence, truck licence, not <Col N="891" /> to mention marriage licence and dog licence.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am also required to contribute to every society and organisation which the genius of man is capable of bringing to life; women's relief, unemployment relief and the gold-diggers relief.  Also to every hospital and charitable institution in the city.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He mentions a number of organisations which, I am sure, it would shock the Minister to hear.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;For my own safety I am required to carry health insurance, life insurance, fire insurance, property insurance, liability insurance, burglar insurance, accident insurance, earthquake insurance, storm insurance, unemployment insurance and old age insurance.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;My business is so governed that it is no easy matter to find out who owns it.  I am inspected, expected, suspected, disrespected, rejected, dejected, examined, re-examined, informed, required, summoned, fined, commanded and compelled until I provide an inexhaustible supply of money for every known need, desire and hope of the human race.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Simply because I refuse to donate something or other, I am boycotted, talked about, lied about, held up and robbed until I am almost ruined.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I can tell you honestly that but for a miracle that happened I could not enclose this cheque.  The wolf that comes to many doors has just had pups in my kitchen; I sold them, and here is the money.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Section 17 of the Act of 1924 contains a clause providing for publication:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Prima facie</i> evidence of any order, regulation or other official instrument made or issued by the Executive Council or by any Minister who is the head of a Department of State established by this Act may be given&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) by the production of a copy of the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> purporting to contain such order, regulation or instrument; or</P>
      <P>I am not sure that provision has been made in this Bill for the publication in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> of these new regulations, alterations and matters of this sort which are prescribed in the Act.  Formerly, when there was a change of Ministry, the House got some information about it.  I do not know whether it is intended to give the House any information, other than to say that there has been a disturbance in the Executive Council and, so as to make peace, certain changes have been made of persons occupying certain Departments of State.  No information is given as to whether or not it is intended to submit to the House the name of the person to be appointed Minister without portfolio.  Is it quite clear from this Bill as drawn whether or not it is a Senator who is to be appointed?  Section 2 (2) appears to suffer, from the layman's point of view, from a slight ambiguity.  It states that without prejudice to the power conferred on the Government by a former section, this particular matter is to be determined by the Taoiseach.  It is obvious that the Minister who is head of the Government has power over and above that of all his Ministers, but this is a new alteration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder if it is intended, in connection with any differences that might arise in this case, that the Government would validate or implement any such decision.  This is, I think, the fourth Act dealing with Ministers and Secretaries&mdash;it is certainly the third. It may have been thought well, in connection with matters of this kind, unless this is meant only to be temporary, to codify the law, and if the <Col N="893" /> time of the Executive Council had been taken up to see how they stand with regard to it.  As to this measure, while we would have been disposed to agree to a Minister for Supplies, in view of the other matters embodied in the Bill, unless I get a much more satisfactory explanation from the Minister than that given on the Second Reading, I propose to divide the House on it.</P>

So the Deputy need not worry about that.  Another thing that I am sure the Deputy will be delighted to hear is that there has not been any disturbance in the Executive&mdash;no such thing.</P>

      <P>That I cannot say but I think every Minister would have <Col N="896" /> a private secretary.  Deputy Costello asked if we had considered our powers in regard to the appointment of a Minister without portfolio.  We did make inquiries and we were informed that we might effectively redistribute the Departments amongst members of the Government in such a way that one or two Ministers would be Ministers without portfolio, if we so desired. Deputy Costello was worried about this question of the appointment of a Minister without portfolio.  I should say, from my knowledge of the working of a Ministry, that there would be uses for a member of the Government who would not be tied down to administrative duties.  Some Ministers have heavier administration to do than others.  I thought I had heavy duties of an administrative kind in the Local Government Department but I find that in the Department of Finance the duties are fairly heavy, too.  I am satisfied that a Minister without portfolio could do a variety of things from time to time which other Ministers have to undertake in present circumstances in addition to their ordinary duties and that the appointment could well be justified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the constitutional question, the appointment of such a Minister would be <i>intra vires</i> the Constitution.  The Taoiseach could have nominated one of the Ministers to be Minister without portfolio under the present Constitution. It is necessary to get proper legal sanction in the case of the Minister for Supplies because, as I explained fully in my introductory statement, it may be necessary to incorporate the Minister for Supplies so that he may be able to sue and be sued in the courts as a corporation solely.  That was found to be likely, having regard to the functions which the Minister would be called upon to discharge.  If the Minister were sued at present, he would have to be sued in his personal capacity and that would not be proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the right of delegation, I can give an instance from my experience as Minister for Local <Col N="897" /> Government.  As a result of a decision in the courts, it became necessary that the Minister should see every file relating to every reference to the Appointments Commission for the filling of positions such as that of nurse, or similar small office, under any local authority.  According to the law, I would have to see every file relating to nurses, store-keepers, foremen, and minor officials of local authorities.  It was necessary that I should initial the file so that officials could prove in the courts that I had personally given authority for the appointment to be made.  There was hardly a day I was in the office on which I had not to go through a number of these files.  That involved a great waste of time and it would be of service to the Minister if he could delegate that work.  That work is, perhaps, important but not as important as other matters calling for the Minister's attention.  A power of delegation in that case would be very useful.</P>
    <P>Deputy Costello referred to the right of audience in the case of Parliamentary Secretaries.  Parliamentary Secretaries are members of this House and no question would arise in that connection.  A question might arise if a Parliamentary Secretary attended in the Seanad.  If asked at present, the Seanad would, by courtesy, probably, hear the Parliamentary Secretary.  It was, however, in order to give him a status, in case of necessity, to be heard there, and likewise to give him status, in case of necessity, if it arose that a Parliamentary Secretary happened to be a Senator, to be heard in this House, that we put that section into the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the Irish language, Deputy Costello raised a point as to simplified spelling.  I am by no means an authority on Irish, but I am not a lover of simplified spelling. I am old-fashioned, and I do not like many changes, but with regard to the changes suggested here, I do not know <Col N="898" /> if the House is aware that the Taoiseach got together, from North, South, East and West the best authorities that could be got on the Irish language when the Constitution was being drafted.  He had the professors of Irish of all the colleges&mdash;I think, without exception&mdash;and others who were not professors but who were acknowledged scholars in Irish; men from University College, Dublin; Trinity College; University College, Galway, and the Cork College, and also from outside these colleges. They were got together and they met frequently.  This has the authority of the best men that could be got.  I do not know how many there were, but it would probably be about a dozen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I would be in order in asking a question.  Was it for the purpose of agreeing or disagreeing that they were got together?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I am not able to answer that.  I know that it is very difficult to get them to agree, but I understand and I am informed that a reasonable amount of agreement was got with regard to the language so far as the Constitution and the titles of Ministers were concerned.  There was as high a measure of agreement got amongst them as is ever likely to be got in a body of men of the kind. That is what I am told, at any rate, and it is in accordance with their decisions that the language in the Constitution is what it is, and also the titles of Ministers.  Personally, I am inclined to agree with Deputy Fionán Lynch in what he says, but I bow to superior authority and superior knowledge.  With regard to the point raised by Deputy Esmonde, about an indemnifying section, I shall have it examined and see that, if necessary, something is done on the Committee Stage.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. Ruttledge)</NameTxt>
      <P>The object of this Bill&mdash;as the long title sets out&mdash;is to make further and better provision for local government in the counties.  It is proposed to achieve this by bringing certain services, at present administered by subsidiary bodies under the immediate direction of the county councils and by introducing the county manager plan of local government which is already in operation in the <Col N="901" /> county boroughs.  There are many reasons for this.  The increasing extent to which the condition of the people is affected by the expansion of social services has increased in recent years the administration in local government. Apart from the greater time and attention that the administration demands of elected representatives, there is a good deal of opinion that the expenditure involved has given rise to problems of management and of the administration generally of these public bodies. That view received expression so far back as 1926, when the Poor Law Commission held its sittings and reported. The Poor Law Commission sat in 1926, got together a considerable amount of evidence and, in its report, recommended that boards of health should be abolished, that the county councils should take over control of poor relief, and that they should work through paid officials who would have control over its administration in a somewhat similar way as the county manager is proposed to operate under this Bill.  In the light of the experience gained since, the view is taken that the findings of that commission have been strengthened. Forms of local government organisation which at one time were quite adequate may become unsuitable when a considerable enlargement of functions takes place.  The tendency towards combining in single bodies powers and duties which may have been dispersed among several authorities and the increasing extent to which State funds are applied to financing local services are features which may indicate the development along those lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The picture of local government, as we look back, shows us that up to the end of the last century there were the old grand juries.  About the end of the century, in 1898, the grand juries and the presentment sessions were replaced by these popularly elected councils, district councils and county councils.  Deputies who are conversant with the development since then are aware that the duties and functions of these councils were very much narrower and more limited than they are to-day. They were, too, fiscal units, if I might so describe them.  They collected rates, maintained roads and, I think, dealt with mental hospitals, and that was <Col N="902" /> about the extent of their operations. In 1920 and 1921, when the Dáil assumed control of local government, very important changes took place which aimed at unification and the present Bill is a step in the same direction&mdash;to try to bring under a single county authority the functions of many of these important subsidiary bodies, such as boards of health and so on.</P>
    <P>The council-manager plan of administration has been criticised as being undemocratic.  Many of us may have been critical about it at one time or another, but, in the light of its operation and of the experience gained, that view certainly cannot hold.  It should be remembered that the county manager is an official of the council, and that he can be removed by the council in the same manner as any other officer.  The council-manager plan set out in the Bill will release county councils from much of the detail of administration, and also from the sometimes very onerous task of managing officials and staffs, but it does not do this by the creation of any independent authority.  The powers of the councils and elective bodies under them are still extensive.  The rating bodies alone can determine to what extent money can be provided.  In addition to reserved functions, under Section 21 of the Bill, county councils and elective bodies will have important powers.  That is the section under which a council can initiate certain proposals, and, within certain limits, will have the power to get them carried out.  The county council will be charged with the administration of roads, county district and fever hospitals, county homes, home assistance, mental hospitals, health services and other county services with two exceptions. These exceptions are vocational education and agricultural services which will continue to be administered as provided for in the Vocational Education Act, 1930, and the Agriculture Act, 1931.</P>
    <P>The council-manager system was first tried in Cork Borough.  It was followed by Dublin City and Dun Laoghaire, and, later, by Limerick, and, as recently as last August, it was adopted for the City of Waterford.  It is proposed to appoint a county manager for <Col N="903" /> each county, but 12 counties are to be grouped for the purposes of the Bill, and the same manager will act for each of two counties.  This does not mean that there is to be an amalgamation of these two counties; it merely means that there will be a common manager for these counties.  The grouping of these counties is based on population, the number of towns, the subsidiary elective bodies in the county, on institutions and on geographical position. The county managers will be appointed by the Local Appointments Commission, but special provision is included in the Bill to give a preference to existing county secretaries and existing secretaries of boards of health.  As well as being manager for the county council and subsidiary bodies, a manager will also be associated with every elective body as set out in the first section.  Elective bodies include the corporation of a borough, an urban district council, the commissioners of a town, the Rathdown and Balrothery Boards of Assistance, and any joint body.  The principal joint bodies are the Dublin Board of Assistance, Waterford and South Cork Boards of Public Assistance, the eleven joint committees of management of district mental hospitals, four port sanitary authorities, and seven joint burial boards.  A county manager will, therefore, act in conjunction with these several bodies.</P>
    <P>He will be available to assist and advise these bodies and will have the same control of staff as he has in relation to county council subsidiary bodies. It might be pointed out that that may be an advantage to the urban councils and other bodies who, by reason of their size and rateable valuations, could not bear the expense of a manager for their own particular body.  They will have the assistance of the manager on the basis of a contribution to the county council in respect of his salary or expenses.</P>
    <P>In the case of large counties, or perhaps where two counties are grouped, if it is found that the county manager is not able effectively and efficiently to deal with the work, provision is made to appoint assistant managers.  Provision <Col N="904" /> is also made in certain eventualities for the appointment of a deputy manager. I may state that the Bill does not contain any provisions as to the number of members that will constitute county councils and boards in future, but a Bill will be introduced early in the next Session which will revise electoral areas and the number of members of county councils and other similar bodies.  In the distribution of functions between the manager and the council, the precedents that have been established by the City Management Acts already passed have been closely followed.  The reserved functions, that is, the functions reserved to councils, will include the making of the rate, the borrowing of money, the demanding of expenses, from other local authorities, the adoption and bringing into force of enactments, promoting or opposing legislation, the making of regulations in respect to the admission to or discharge of patients from mental hospitals, the adoption of resolutions and the making of applications under the Town and Regional Planning Act, 1934, the application for public inquiries in connection with boundary alterations, parliamentary and local elections, the appointment of persons to be members of public bodies, and the disposition of property under the Municipal Corporations Acts.  All powers other than those reserved will be exercised by the manager.  The county council will, however, retain the appointment of rate collectors.</P>

      <P>They do not.  The Minister may add other functions to these reserved functions, that is, functions which may not be specifically reserved to the managers.  As I pointed out already, the councils have certain powers under Section 21 of the Bill.  As a matter of fact, this section has been included in all these other Acts which have been passed here, but apparently the necessity has not arisen at any time for the councils to exercise the powers they had under that section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="905" /> As regards mental hospitals, where the whole of a mental hospital district is in one county, the committee in charge of it will disappear and a committee, called a visiting committee, will be appointed by the county council. Their functions will be to visit the hospital, to hear complaints and to report on conditions in the mental hospital to the county council.  Where there is a joint committee of management, that is, where there is more than one county in a mental hospital area, the joint committee will continue to function with the aid of the county manager as executive officer.  In addition, they will also have the powers of a visiting committee, that is, to refer complaints to the county council.  The functions of boards of health will be transferred to the county councils, and the provisions consequential will be found in the Third Schedule.</P>
    <P>The main portion of the provisions of the Bill have been already approved by this House on more than one occasion. They follow the precedents laid down in the City Management Acts passed by the House, and at this stage I do not think it is necessary, as the principle has been discussed so often here, to say more than that we hope, from the experience that has been gained by the Department from the operation of the City Management Acts, that this Bill will be a contribution to the local government administration of counties in the State.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of his speech this evening, did not appear, by his delivery at all events, to be terribly enthusiastic about this measure.  I could not blame the Minister for his lack of enthusiasm for a <Col N="906" /> measure of this kind, because it is rather ironic that the Minister, who voted against the Cork City Management Bill, should have heaped upon him the ridicule of coming into the House and asking us at this stage to apply the principle underlying the Cork City Management Bill to every county council and every local authority in Ireland.  Of course, on that occasion the Minister was not alone.  Every one of his colleagues sitting on the Front Bench went into the Lobby against the Cork City Management Bill.  The Minister has only got to look at the Official Reports of the discussion on that Bill, and also the Official Reports of the discussion on the Dublin City Management Bill, to see how his Party fulminated and ranted against the dictatorship which, they said, was provided for in the Cork City Management Bill and the Dublin City Management Bill.  When the Cork City Management Bill was going through the House, the present Minister for Finance, the former Minister for Local Government, said, as reported in Column 1155, Volume 27 of the Official Debates&mdash;and the same can be said of this Bill:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;On the whole, we think that this Bill is not in accordance with our ideas of the management of public affairs.  It does not give the amount of control to the people who pay that they ought to have.  It is not in accordance with our ideas of the freedom of choice that ought to be given to the people who are running their own municipal or local affairs. We think that the policy of distrust, evidence of which is in almost every section of this Bill, is not one that ought to commend itself to this House.  We are out for giving the fullest possible freedom to the people, thereby inculcating the teachings of citizenship to the people.  We want them to realise that they have serious responsibilities placed upon them.  We want citizens who vote for the election of members to a municipal council to be taught to realise that they have serious duties imposed upon them, and that it is up to them to see to it that their elected representatives, being given <Col N="907" /> full authority, must do their work properly.  We think anything that cribs or confines the authority of these local people unnecessarily will eventually do more harm than good to the local people, to the local authority concerned and to the management of its affairs, and that the national effects on the citizens, as a whole, will not be for the good of this State.  On these grounds we oppose the passing of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the basis of that, every member of the present Government went into the Division Lobby and voted against the Cork City Management Bill.  Is there a word that was said at that time by the present Minister for Finance that could not be said with equal force against this Bill, which is just a second edition of the Cork City Management Act?  The people who denounced that measure and advised the people to vote against it: who said that it was not in conformity with their conceptions of freedom and liberty, now have the hardihood to come to this House, the wheel having gone its full circle, and say: &ldquo;Here, lads, pass this Bill, notwithstanding our denunciations of it some years ago.&rdquo;  The Minister this evening did not try to make a case for the Bill.  He has not told us who wants it, apart perhaps from a few Departments and the Executive, who want to take all kinds of power out of the hands of the popularly elected bodies.</P>
    <P>The Minister quoted for us the report of a poor law commission which was appointed in March, 1925&mdash;14 years ago.  The function of that commission was not to inquire into local government as conceived in this Bill.  The commission was described, in the official document relating to it, as a commission on the relief of the sick and destitute poor.  Its main function was to look into the condition of the sick and destitute poor.  If one looks at its terms of reference under five heads, one will find that one of its functions was to inquire as to whether adequate and suitable schemes had been formulated under certain Temporary Provisions Acts; another was to avoid wasteful expenditure as regards <Col N="908" />&ldquo;healthy people who are incorrigibly idle&rdquo;; another was to examine the law and administration in respect of widows and children without parents, of unmarried mothers and deserted children; another was to inquire into the position of mentally defective children, and, lastly, the chargeability on the rates for certain purposes.  Quite obviously, on its face the task of the commission was merely to deal with minor matters in respect of local government, all of which could be classed under the heading of the sick and destitute poor.  Nowhere in its report can be found the slightest justification for the Minister's statement this evening, that the commission recommended an entire alteration of local government on lines to conform to a Bill of this kind.</P>
    <P>In so far as the report of that commission deals with local authorities, its recommendations would fit on a postcard, and they are not in the slightest degree either illuminative or informative. The commission does not deal at all with the functions of local authorities in the sense in which we are dealing with them in this Bill.  It only dealt with the functions of boards of health in relation to the administration of relief for the sick and destitute poor. Its recommendations, in so far as they suggest an amendment to the existing control or the creation of lines of demarcation in the functions of managers and local authorities, confined themselves entirely to the boards of health, and on this matter the commission's approach to the problem of an alteration in the method of the control of a board of health was one by which it suggested that the board of health might be embodied again for relief purposes in the county council: that the secretary of the board of health would then be relieved of his existing duties, and might become a sort of superintending assistance officer.  In paragraph 4 the commission suggested that the most radical and revolutionary thing that could occur in that event was, that it would be possible to dispense with the post of superintending assistance officer.  That was the one radical thing the commission recommended: the amalgamation of the board of health with the county council, <Col N="909" /> the sacking of the superintending assistance officer, and the making of the secretary of the board of health a sort of glorified superintending assistance officer.</P>
    <P>It is that trivial report that is now being used by the Minister as one of the reasons why the House should be asked to pass a Bill of this kind.  Again, this Bill cannot be said to be the result of any adequate inquiry into the system of local government, or into the principles and practices of local government. When considered in relation to municipal government, the report of that commission only dealt with very minor matters, such as unmarried mothers and maternity homes, affiliation orders, children, home assistance, dispensary services, institutional relief and so on.  That was the whole ambit of the commission's work.  Its recommendations and report show quite clearly that the commission never dealt with the bigger and wider problems: the control of local authorities, and the fixation of lines of demarcation between the manager's functions on the one hand and the functions of the popularly elected representatives on the other.  So that not only do we not get a case made by the Minister for this Bill, but there is no evidence whatever to show that such commendation of the Bill as he gave us is based on any examination of the higher principles underlying that problem.  Neither the Bill itself, nor the Minister's speech this evening, is fortified in the slightest by the recommendations of any authoritative body in this country on the question of local government.</P>
    <P>If we did not get a case made for the Bill by the Minister here this evening, and clearly we did not, and if we cannot get a case from the Report of the Commission of Inquiry which dealt with the matter, what then have we to assume? What has brought about this Bill?  We cannot imagine that it represents the Government's views on this subject, because no less a person than the Taoiseach spoke on the Cork City Management Bill of 1928.  His views on the matter are very illuminating now, in the light of the provisions of this Bill.  He said then:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="910" />&ldquo;The first thing that strikes me is the grudging way in which local government is going to be given back. If we are going to have the deliberative and the executive functions separated, as I have indicated already, I favour that to the greatest extent that it is possible to have it provided that the ultimate control does really lie in the hands of the people's representatives.  When I examined the details that have occurred to me from a casual reading of the Bill, the first thing that strikes me is the grudging way it is proposed to give back to the people of Cork the right of governing themselves locally in their local affairs.  I think it is a wrong spirit and that it indicates the same idea that is obvious from all the acts of the Executive from the day they got power.  Their whole idea is to concentrate as far as possible in themselves and now they want to concentrate in a very small body of people over whom ultimately the Minister here is going to have a great deal of control.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach was then speaking on the Second Reading of the Cork City Management Bill, and the quotation is: Dáil Debates, Vol. 24, column 1860. That was his view then as to what was happening under a Bill identical in its provisions, outlook and purpose, with this particular Bill.  Speaking later in the same debate the Taoiseach said&mdash;column 1864:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I, for one, believe in giving the Executive the greatest possible latitude for carrying out schemes, and in giving it all the latitude required in carrying out its executive work properly, but I hold that in every single case the ultimate authority must lie with the people's representatives, if they care to exercise it, and must lie continuously with them&mdash; that is, that it must not be a question of suspending it for a certain period: there must be continuous power in the hands of the people's representatives over the Executive.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach came to deal with the question of a determination by the manager of certain functions relating <Col N="911" /> to staff, these were his views in 1928&mdash; the reference is column 1865:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The question of leaving to the manager the right to fix salaries, superannuation and allowances is, I think, too great a power.  After all, the power of the purse ought to be ultimately in the deliberative assembly, and the power of the purse ought to be definitely retained by the people's representatives.  To give that away would be a mistake and I will be in favour of having that power retained by the people's representatives.  I hope that no representatives of the people here will stand for any principle which would be contrary to that.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We have the position now that the Taoiseach spoke about in 1928 when he gave expression to the viewpoint that no representative in this House should stand for a principle of that kind.  Ironically enough he now sends into the House a Minister for Local Government and Public Health to incorporate in a Bill the very provisions for which in 1928 he said he hoped no member of this House would stand.  That is the position in which the members of the Government responsible for this Bill find themselves to-day.  I think this is a very drastic Bill.  It is going down to the roots of the question as to whether we are to have local authorities through-cut the country with executive and administrative functions, or whether we are going to have merely a county manager with a local authority with power to do little more than advise the city or county manager as the case may be.  Under the Bill a manager would be appointed for each county, but in some cases he might manage two counties.  But his authority will not end there; he may be not merely manager of one or two counties, but he will also manage every elected assembly within the county or counties.  What is contemplated under this Bill is that one person will manage the entire County of Kildare and the entire County of Carlow; in addition he will also manage the Naas Urban District Council, the Athy Urban District Council, the Carlow Urban <Col N="912" /> District Council, the Newbridge Town Commissioners and the Muinebeg Town Commissioners.  These are the functions of the manager under this Bill introduced by a Government, one member of which said in 1928 that a similar Bill of this kind did not accord with his conception of freedom.  Anyone having read this Bill will ask is there any wonder he said that.  But under this Bill we are doing precisely what he condemned in 1928.</P>
    <P>What is the extent of the power conferred upon the City Manager?  In Section 14 (1) it is provided</P>
    <P>Every power, function or duty of a council of a county or of an elected body which is not a reserved function shall, for the purposes of this Act, be an executive function of such council or body, and the expression &ldquo;executive function&rdquo; shall in this Act (including this section) be construed and have effect accordingly.</P>
    <P>Then if you turn to the second Schedule of the Bill you find you are reserving functions and a whole lot of activities that any old maid of either sex could indulge in.  Outside these relatively harmless wintry evening activities the manager exercises all the functions which are not catalogued in the Second Schedule.  But he does more than that.  Anything that you do not put into the Second Schedule becomes the manager's functions.  But the manager's functions do not end there. In Section 14 (2) we have it:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Every county manager shall exercise and perform for the council of his county all the executive functions of such council and, in particular, all powers (other than a power which is vested by law (including this Act) in such council and is by this Act expressly made exercisable by resolution of such council), functions, and duties of such council in relation to the officers and servants of such council and the control supervision, service, remuneration, privileges, superannuation, and compensation, of such officers and servants.</P>
    <P>So that notwithstanding the Taoiseach's denunciation on the Cork City <Col N="913" /> Managers Act of provisions of the same kind as we have here, and his expression of hope that no representative of the people would stand for a principle contrary to that to which he gave expression, we have in Section 14 (2) set out provisions which one would think were specially written there for the purpose of making the Taoiseach swallow his own words of 1928.  One could not help thinking that the vinegar like provisions in this Bill were written for that very purpose.</P>
    <P>The persons appointed to exercise the functions under this Bill are the managers who will be appointed under Section 4.  When a manager is appointed he cannot be removed except with the permission of the Minister. But a Minister responsible for a Bill of this kind would be very slow to remove a manager no matter what his action might be, lest he should be giving back to the local authorities the powers taken from them.  In this Bill there is no retiring age for the manager.  The manager may function until he is 100 years old though the Department of Local Government and Public Health sends out circulars from day to day to the local authorities asking that medical officers should retire at the age of 65.  This Bill follows closely on the provisions of the Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford City Acts.  We have no experience as yet of the operations of the Acts in Limerick and Waterford.  But in Dublin and Cork we have had experience of their workings.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department must know that members of his own Party and other Parties have constantly called attention to the fact that under these Acts in operation to-day the local authorities are merely rubber stamps for the managers.  I am sorry that Deputy Tom Kelly is not here. Perhaps the Minister is glad he is not. I hope he will be present before the debate is over.  If Deputy Kelly tells of his experience of the working of the Act in Dublin and if other Deputies throughout the country tell of their experiences, the Minister will realise that the whole history of the City Managers Acts has been one concentrating wide powers in the hands of <Col N="914" /> the managers and depriving the popularly elected representatives of all power to decide what the municipal policy of a city is to be.  It is nonsense to imagine that any city or county can have a municipal policy in any place where these Acts are in operation.  Not long ago the Fianna Fáil Party issued a declaration that the City Managers Act was in their way and that they could not implement their policy in the way in which they wanted to implement it because of their very limited authority.  Their chief function is to write a cheque for the city manager, to collect all rates and when the rates are collected the city manager is empowered to spend them any way he likes in the fulfilment of the wide powers provided for them in Bills of this kind.  I think the Government Party were right in what they said in 1928.  I think they showed an appreciation of the deadening effect on the electors of legislation which took a large part of the municipal control out of the hands of the local representatives and put all the power into the hands of the managers.  If we pass this Bill we are weakening still further the genuine interest of electors in local authorities.  This Bill is creating the impression that the whole aim in respect of local government is to move more and more towards rigid centralisation. I can see nothing following from a Bill of this kind except lesser interest in local authority, a disinclination on the part of public-spirited people to serve on local elected bodies and to leave in the hands of the city managers still more powers of the kind conferred by this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is rather paradoxical, at a time when we are taking power out of the hands of popularly elected authorities, fortified by the votes of the people, that some members of the Government should be talking about the creation of parish councils.  We are going to have parish councils on the one hand, a fusing of authority on the one hand, and on the other hand we are going to have rigid centralisation in a Bill of this kind.  The people are now going to have their interests dealt with by parish councils, who can debate whether a pump is wet or dry, whether it wants a coat of paint now or can wait until <Col N="915" /> next year, whether laneways or pathways want to be cleaned or repaired, but they are going to be deprived of all the powers that they have under the present system of local government, which I think is one calculated to create interest in local problems. Many of the things the local authorities have done in this country are a credit to the unrewarded civic pride of the local people in trying to improve the amenities of life in the areas in which their jurisdiction was cast.  The Minister in the course of his speech this evening did not tell us that there had been any impartial examination of the Dublin and Cork position which induced him to introduce a Bill of this kind.  There has been no examination of the Dublin and Cork position by any democratically minded people, and as a result we have the production of a Bill of this kind.  Everybody knows that in Dublin and Cork the entire power is in the hands of the City Manager, and the Minister could not get an independent democratic body of people, hearing evidence of the real position and anxious to retain democratic local control, to recommend a Bill of the kind to which we are being asked to give a second reading to-day.</P>
    <P>I am willing to be convinced that our present municipal government is not absolutely perfect.  I am willing to be convinced that any change, based on sound reason and good judgment, is a change which ought to be made, but there is no evidence here of the necessity for a change.  No evidence has been produced by the Minister, nor by this commission, the report of which he quoted for us, to show that it is desirable to make a change on the lines suggested in this Bill.  As my motion suggests, therefore, we ought not to proceed further with this Bill until there has been an examination of the principles and practices of local government. That ought to be divorced from the similar matters which occupied the attention of the previous commission.  Instead of having that examination, instead of setting up a committee or commission of people of normal judgment&mdash;not fanatics one way or the other&mdash;to examine the whole problem, and to report on the higher <Col N="916" /> principles of local government, we are embarking on a Bill of this kind.  This motion which I submit to the House asks for a proper examination of the whole question of local government administration by a committee appointed for that purpose by the Government. It cannot be said, therefore, that my motion ties the hands of the Government in respect of the personnel of the commission.  I am willing that the Government should appoint the commission, bearing in mind, of course, that they ought to appoint persons of normal level judgment, fanatics neither one way nor the other.  When we got a comprehensive report from that commission, which had examined the matter in relation to the position in Dublin and Cork, we could then, with some knowledge of the experience gained by that commission, with some careful survey of all the issues involved, and after expert and impartial examination of the whole position, undertake the enactment of legislation making whatever changes were then considered necessary, bearing in mind all the time that the Department of Local Government ought to be charged with the responsibility of preserving local government, and not of destroying it, as this Bill seeks to do.</P>
    <P>There is no purpose whatever in introducing a highly contentious Bill of this kind in the circumstances that exist to-day.  The commission whose report the Minister quoted reported in 1927, that is 12 years ago.  If the commission's report could lie aside, no effort being made to implement it in 12 years, what is the difficulty in allowing the matter to remain over for another year or two, so that we may have an examination of the higher principles of local government, an examination of where the demarcation line should be fixed between the manager's functions and the council's functions?  Armed with knowledge of that kind, we might then proceed to examine the whole question of local government with a view to bringing it into conformity with the circumstances which exist to-day. I think the Minister should not proceed further with this Bill, but should set up a committee of that kind, so that we can approach the problem with <Col N="917" /> much greater information than we got from the Minister this evening, and with more information than we got from the commission appointed in 1925, whose functions were not to survey the ground that I suggest this committee should be asked to survey.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I desire to second this motion.  I should like to say at the outset that the Minister's advocacy of this measure has not carried it very far. I have rarely listened to a shorter statement explanatory of a very important measure.  Like Deputy Norton, I am wondering whether the Minister is very enthusiastic about this Bill, or whether the statements which appeared in the Press to the effect that there was quite a good deal of dissent and contention in regard to this Bill, even in the Government Party, are quite correct. In any case, there can be very little doubt about the fact that the provisions of this Bill mean the end of local government in this country.  You can disguise that fact in any trimmings you like, or in any language you like; you can make fine points about one matter or the other connected with it, but that is the sum total of the position. Surely there is something very strange about that happening in an Irish Parliament.  Local Government was achieved for this country in the Local Government Act of 1889.  Many years before that Act was passed, an English statesman of a former generation, the late Joseph Chamberlain, was engaged in working out a scheme of local government for this country, and in discussing that matter with Irish leaders at the time, as an alternative to the demand for Home Rule.  The proposals were not accepted, but in the biographies of very prominent Irish leaders of that time there are several striking references to the value of the measures proposed.  Michael Davitt leaves it on record that the passage of the Local Government Act sounded the overthrow of irresponsible bureaucracy, but an Irish Parliament is re-entrenching that bureaucracy under the provisions of this Bill.  No matter how one may talk about this matter in polite and respectable language, that is the exact position.  No one reading anything <Col N="918" /> of the lives of Irish leaders of a former time can fail to be struck with the importance that they attached to the winning of local government for this country.  The late Mr. T.M. Healy, the late Mr. William O'Brien, the late Mr. John Redmond and other Irish leaders, can all be quoted as very strongly in support of that contention.  If they could visit this House, where their successors, Irish representatives, meet to-day, one wonders what they would think of this particular measure, and what they would think of its introduction in an Irish Parliament, the Parliament of a country where there is unceasing talk about liberty, but where liberty is growing less every day of the week.  It is surely a very ironic commentary on the whole position.</P>
      <P>The Minister made what seemed to me to be a very extraordinary case for this Bill when he said&mdash;I hope I did not misunderstand him and that I do not misquote him&mdash;that its object was to relieve overworked local representatives of their responsibilities. That is not exactly the case that is made for it in other quarters.  Some of the Minister's friends down the country make the case that this measure is to bring to an end corruption in local affairs.  Local representatives may have their faults, quite a number of them have; all of us in this Parliament have, and everybody in this world, for that matter, has his own faults; but local representatives, with all the faults they had and have, made a decent effort to do the right, the fair and the honest thing always.  I doubt if charges of that kind could be made against them more effectively than they could be made against a political party, and even against a Government, sometimes&mdash;so far as patronage and matters of that kind are concerned, and so far as spoils are regarded as the prizes of the victors.  That is very different from corruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, on the whole&mdash;and I speak with some knowledge of local affairs, of local bodies, and of the various parties connected with local government&mdash;that, so far as any charges of corruption are concerned, local government is as clean and as honourable in <Col N="919" /> this country as one could expect it to be, and the various generations of local representatives that have handled the local government system in this country have contributed a very fair share to that type of citizenship, to that type of local progress and to the general advancement and management of local affairs that was foreseen when Irish leaders welcomed local government legislation and helped to improve it.  I know that in the County of Cork, when the Local Government Act was passed, the county council that was appointed was well worthy of the largest county in this country.  One of the first actions of that council was to put into operation a scheme of competitive examination in relation to every appointment in the gift of the council, and it was not until recent years, under circumstances into which I do not wish to go just now, that any weakening or displacement of that scheme took place.</P>
    <P>The fact of the matter is that we have certain obsessions in this country. One obsession that has been manifested within the last ten or 15 years is the craze for centralisation.  I think that is probably one of the worst afflictions that we could have, and I believe the time will come when it will be fully realised that that is so.  I must complain also of the fact that there seems to be no settled policy on the matter of local government at headquarters. I am not talking now about the various officials in the Department of Local Government, officials who do their job thoroughly, efficiently, and well, and I must say I have always found them doing it with every sympathy. I am really talking about the Government policy&mdash;indeed, about the policies of two successive Governments in regard to this matter of local government.  We have had this policy of sewing and ripping, and ripping and sewing from time to time, tampering with the whole fabric of local government, and, in the end, damaging it very considerably.  Now we are going to put the coping stone, as it were, to all that work.</P>
    <P>This is a measure in which we are asked to do the impossible because, as <Col N="920" /> a result of this legislation, we will be trying to find supermen in this country. Such men are not here or in any other country.  The so-called supermen in local or national affairs are the people who very often delegate their functions to their subordinates and then take the credit for the work of the subordinates. I do not think there are any supermen to be found for local government any more than for any other sphere of activity.  These people are just a collection of ordinary mortals, with their failings, prejudices, likes and dislikes. I think it is a very dangerous policy to hand over such extremely wide powers into the hands of any one individual.</P>
    <P>It is an extraordinary thing that such a measure as this should be introduced here by the members of a Party who so strongly opposed the idea when they were in opposition.  It shows that there is something in the claim of the man in the street who regards many of the activities of this House with derision and scorn because he thinks there is nothing but a good deal of hypocrisy behind many of the activities of public representatives here.  This is a reactionary measure.  It is a bad Bill on the face of it.  It is a Bill that is going to bring hardship and suffering on the poor.  In any county, even in a small county, no one individual, no matter how many minor officials he may have to assist him, can do justice to the poor in the matter of home assistance, hospital accommodation and the needs ever present at the doors of the poor.</P>
    <P>There is definitely a case to be made for a full inquiry into local government, as asked for in the amendment.  The Poor Law Commission that has been referred to asked many years ago for reforms that even at that period were overdue.  I will give as examples the segregation of epileptics, the care and treatment of unmarried mothers and the segregation of the various classes that are now herded into county homes. In many cases the conditions are such as to make those institutions more forbidding and more miserable than the old workhouses to which we were accustomed. These are the things that the Department of Local Government ought to be concerned with.  They should endeavour to remove the blots <Col N="921" /> that exist so far as the care of the poor is concerned.  Matters of that kind are much more important and more urgent than this particular measure.</P>
    <P>There can be no case made for this Bill except that it indicates a feeling of irritation because of local criticism. It may be that the Minister and his friends dislike criticism.  Of course, this measure would be a very effective instrument to stifle local criticism or local feeling on any public matter.  I do not think the Minister will accept the suggestion of Deputy Norton that the consideration of the Bill should be postponed pending a full inquiry.  The Bill may pass, but I believe that some time in the future, and perhaps not so very far away, Irishmen will regret the introduction of this Bill and, public feeling spurring them on, their activities will be directed towards arranging a system of local government in this country that will be capable of being worked with sympathy and with fairness and with that spirit of humanity and understanding for the poor that ought to be the foundation of sound local government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If there are any Deputies here who came in with an open mind on this Bill, they have got very little in the way of information from either the Minister or Deputy Norton.  I do not think that I have ever heard two worse speeches either for or against a Bill.  Neither one nor the other gave us any details as to the reasons why the Bill should be passed or the reasons why the Bill should not be passed.  We are left just as we were.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did expect that when the Minister was putting his case to the House he would endeavour to inform the House of some disabilities that exist at the present time amongst local authorities. But he did not.  Not one solitary word did he tell us.  In fact, the little he did tell us has cooled my ardour in support of the Bill.  For instance, he told us that there is another Bill following which will, apparently, reduce the membership of the county councils. That is an extraordinary thing.  The difficulty about this Government is that you never know where you are when they bring in Bills.  We had the Public <Col N="922" /> Assistance Bill some time ago which proposed to set up local committees to look after public assistance and so on, but it could not operate until this Bill came in.  Now this Bill is introduced and it cannot operate until we get another, and we are all in the dark as to what the new Bill is going to be. If we are going to have restricted membership of the county councils I certainly am going to oppose it.  When I read that Bill, knowing what I do about local authorities and knowing the absolute necessity for some machinery to assist local authorities at the present time in effectively and efficiently carrying out their duties, I was prepared to support the Bill, but I think the Minister ought now to take the House into his confidence and tell us why he thinks it is necessary to reduce representation on county councils.  It does seem an extraordinary thing that when he is going to hand over all the work, particularly of the board of health, to a manager, at the same time he is going to reduce the membership of the county councils.</P>
    <P>I thought it was a very poor and weak argument of Deputy Norton when he quoted the speeches delivered by Fianna Fáil on the Cork City Management Bill.  Of course, Fianna Fáil have a very happy knack of going back on everything they ever said, but, even so, if a man opposed a Bill at a particular time and after some experience of its operation is now quite convinced that it is right, that is, possibly, a very good argument for the Bill.  Deputy Norton mentioned the Poor Law Commission of 1925, that that Commission was set up for the specific purpose of inquiring into the condition of the poor and the needy, the widows and the unmarried mothers and so on, that it was not their job to report on a Bill of this type.  But, at the same time, notwithstanding that, they did so report or, at least, apparently, did report, that under the existing circumstances, the poor and needy could not be looked after.  In that case it is much more striking evidence that they did give such an opinion than if they were set up for the purpose.</P>
    <P>I do not at all agree with Deputy Murphy that there is any person in the <Col N="923" /> country at the present time who can say that he thinks this Bill is brought in to do away with bribery and corruption. There is no bribery or corruption in the country now.  There could not possibly be since the settingup of the Local Appointments Commission. We ought to hear less of that sort of thing.  It is not to the credit of this House or to the credit of the country for anybody to talk about it.</P>

      <P>No, oh no.  What I have always felt about the position is that at the present time local authorities are hopelessly over-loaded with work&mdash;hopelessly over-loaded.  I do not think that the Bill that is before the House is going to be ideal.  I do not think that it is going to be perfect, but I do think it is going to give us a better and more efficient machine for dealing with local government.  I do not at all agree that the Bill is taking away local government.  As far as I am concerned, I have not any desire to appoint officials.  I would be very glad to see somebody attending to the work, determining what shall be paid to the officials and where they shall be put in their particular offices.  I do not want to do it and I think I have as much and as close experience of local authority work as any member in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the board of health: I am a member of the Board of Health in Roscommon.  Deputy Murphy has <Col N="924" /> mentioned certain matters that ought to be attended to by the Department of Local Government, such as more attention to the poor, the segregation of different parties and so on.  I entirely agree with Deputy Murphy in that.  That ought to be done, and that is one of the reasons why I am backing the Bill.  We cannot do it.  Ten laymen, meeting once a fortnight to consider 40, 50 or 60 items in four or five hours on a Saturday afternoon, are not able to do that.  We try as best we can to do it.  In order to finish the work, when it comes to seven or eight o'clock in the evening, after sitting, possibly, for six or seven hours, I have often seen the work being parcelled out to members.  That is not efficient administration.  You cannot have efficiency in that way.  If Deputy Norton or the Labour Party believe that this Bill is taking away all the democratic principles we had in local authorities, they have not shown it. Nobody has shown it.</P>

      <P>If we were as intelligent as Deputy Corry we would, but, of course, we cannot all be as intelligent as he is.  If I believed for one moment that this Bill was all that Deputy Norton or Deputy Murphy painted it, I would not support it. There is no reason why I should.  I think it has its faults, and I am certainly going to move amendments to it, but I think it is going to provide this country with a better vehicle, a more efficient machine, for carrying out the <Col N="925" /> duties which are imposed upon local authorities than the present system affords.</P>
      <P>I do not agree with this Bill where it provides for the appointment of assistant managers.  I think it is contradictory. It seems an extraordinary thing to me that while the Minister thinks that two counties can be grouped together under one manager, at the same time, he thinks there ought to be assistant managers.  That appears to me to be very inconsistent.</P>
      <P>We are also told, in Section 8</P>
      <P>(1) Where the functional area of a joint body is wholly within a county, the county manager for such county shall be also manager for such joint body.</P>
      <P>(2) Where the functional area of a joint body extends into two or more counties, the county manager for that one of those counties which the Minister shall by order appoint shall be also the manager for such joint body.</P>
      <P>I do not think that that is equitable as between two counties.  I think there ought to be some way of dealing with that.</P>
      <P>We come to the reserved functions. We come first to Section 21.  I hold that Section 21 reserves to the local authority the democratic rights that it always had.  Do you think that democracy is being interfered with by putting in some person to see that the poor and the needy are more adequately dealt with and that the laws passed by this House are better carried out?  Every act of the manager must be inside the law, and we make the law.  If these are to be the functions of the manager, then, in the words of a member of a local authority in my county, I do not see that a county manager is any more than what you might call a working foreman.  That is about all he is.</P>

      <P>I will be as vocal as I am to-night.  I do not mind whether I have the support of anybody in my view or not.  As a matter of fact, Deputies on this side of the House are very acutely divided on the matter. Possibly I am standing alone in this matter.  I am convinced that something ought to be done to put some efficient machine into the hands of the people&mdash;and I am saying the people&mdash;<Col N="927" /> to do their work.  It is all very well for people in public positions like ourselves to shout from the housetops that this is not democracy.  There are very few people down the country saying it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Norton told us about the Dublin Corporation and the Cork Municipal Council.  I would be very interested to see a referendum taken of the citizens of both cities in the matter; but I suppose I will not have the privilege of seeing that.  I would be very interested to see how it would work out.  I would be equally interested to see what the ratepayers of the country think at the present time of this Bill or the continuation of the local authorities, because everybody knows that the work has become so heavy that the details of the work are not carried out.</P>
      <P>I cannot compliment the Minister on his manner of introducing the Bill.  He has not said a single word which will convince anybody that the Bill ought to be passed.  He has, as Deputy Norton said, introduced it in a very half-hearted way.  Perhaps he intends to abandon it.  Perhaps he will put it on the shelf like the Valuation Bill.  It may be all a bit of show.  I think it is up to some member of the Government to make a better case for the Bill before it is put up to a vote.  There has been no case made for it from the Government side.  It deserves to have a case made for it.  In my opinion a good case can be made for it; but it has not been made.  Such as it is, I believe it is an improvement on what we have, and I am supporting the Bill. There are certain sections in it with which I do not agree.  Certain amendments ought to be introduced and I hope to introduce some amendments. But, on the whole, I am accepting the Bill as something better than we have.</P>

      <P>I have been a member of the Limerick Corporation for the past 20 years&mdash;15 years under the old local government system and five under the city manager system.  I must confess that for the past five years we have got on very well.  We could not have a better or a more democratic local government system than we <Col N="928" /> have in Limerick.  We have every power that we had under the old system. I served as a member of the Limerick Corporation under two managers and two acting managers and I found that the four of them were democrats who were anxious to help every member of the corporation, and who did everything possible to carry out the administrative work of the corporation properly.  They were helped by the members of the corporation. I agree with everything that Deputy Brennan said.  The old corporation, who were willing to do their work, were not able to do it.  We had 40 members in the old Limerick Corporation. In the new corporation we have 15, and we get on splendidly and do the work promptly and efficiently.</P>

      <P>I think it is true to say that, irrespective of the views of any one of us with regard to this Bill, whether we are for it or against it, we are here this evening participating in, perhaps witnessing the passing of local government in this country in the popularly accepted sense.  We have had that form of local government in the country for the best part of 40 years.  Most of us here were children when local government was first conceded to this country.  I remember myself, as a child, together with children of neighbours, demonstrating at the election of the first nationalist county councillor in the village to which I belong.  Every nationalist, young and old, at that time, even though some suspected it as being a bribe, regarded it as being a definite advance with regard to the rights of the people.  An old régime was beginning to pass away and a really nationalist and democratic régime was beginning to appear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is nearly 40 years ago, and local government in that popular sense has had ups and downs ever since.  There have been good councils, middling councils, and bad councils, but all the <Col N="929" /> time, taking one thing with another, the people of this country have a lot to be thankful for, and some little tribute should be paid to those men and women who constituted the various public boards.  It is comparatively simple nowadays, with the coming of the bus and the motor car, but local government throughout the country was carried on in the same brave spirit when the best conveyance anybody had was a horse and an open trap.  In those days not even expenses were given to the members.</P>
    <P>When we end a régime like that, of voluntary unpaid public service, at least a very good case should be made for doing so.  I do not think the Minister threw his back into the job to-day. Whether the present Minister spoke as Minister or as an Opposition Deputy from these benches, he is one of those who always made an impressive case mildly and convincingly.  He never went in for overstressing a point or exaggerating a case, but he always made an impression on his audience.  It is rarely I pay compliments across the floor, but that compliments is sincerely intended The only occasion that I was not impressed by the Minister was this evening.  I was rather anxious to be impressed, for this reason, that when I read the Bill first I read it with the mind of an official and, as an official, I did regard it&mdash;and still regard it&mdash;as a very sound Bill.  If our only outlook is greater efficiency and more economy, then I believe this is a good instrument by which to bring that about.  I believe that under this Bill, in nine counties out of ten, we will, at least, have greater efficiency and greater economy. If those are the only things that count, and the only things to be considered, then this is the way to do it.</P>
    <P>In that frame of mind, I visited my constituency, consisting of two counties, and got groups of people together to listen to me and my arguments. I also listened to them and their arguments, and I considered their point of view, and little by little, while adhering to my views with regard to efficiency and economy, I began to think that there were other things which had to be considered.  I put it <Col N="930" /> somewhat like this, provided you can find one good wholetime man, with his expert officials he will run any county better than any existing council or board of health.  If that is to be the only argument by all means put this Bill through.  It is equally true to say, that if we could find the right man the work of the State would be run better by one highly efficient and expert person than by the 140 Deputies and Ministers.  But, would that be sufficient argument for adopting such a course?</P>
    <P>How many would come and vote for the dissolution of Dáil Eireann, and for the appointment of a single individual, even though we knew the country would be run more economically and more efficiently?  Would we not be told we were taking an awful plunge, that while one man might be a good man his successor might be a very bad man, and at all events, whether we got a good or a bad man, the people would say &ldquo;we are giving up the power of control.&rdquo; We may be for or against this Bill.  I have discussed it time and again with my friend and colleague Deputy Brennan, and taking one thing with the other he is for the Bill, and taking one thing with the other, I am opposed to the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to the Bill, in spite of the fact that I am making anyone a present of my belief, that there will be a certain amount of economy and a higher degree of efficiency in the administration of most counties but, as against that, there will be a considerable loss in the way of public interest, public support and public sympathy.  I think the case made at present, for a man paying his rates as carefully as any of us pay anything, will be to a great extent lacking, when you put it into that man's mouth to say: &ldquo;I am deprived even of the right to control the expenditure of the money that I subscribe.&rdquo;  I think further on in this Bill, and it is a detail, the proposal to group certain counties is a mistake.  That is portion of the Bill that can be better dealt with in Committee.  If we are to launch on this particular type of machinery, it is better to leave every county to stand alone.  The Bill is unpopular <Col N="931" /> with the ordinary people in most counties.  It is particularly unpopular in counties that are linked, one with another.  When people view a map they may think, from the administrative point of view, that it is highly suitable to link up this county with that county, as they are lying alongside each other, and their economy is very much alike but, in nine cases out of ten, the mere fact of one county lying alongside another means that there is historical animosity between people on one side of the frontier and the other.  It may have originated in sport or in that kind of country service where the headquarters is on one side of the line or the other.  I know that I do not envy the person who has the job of trying to run in double harness certain counties linked together under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I consider, further, that if a Bill of this kind has to be passed, the shorter the interval between its passing and implementing the better.  In its present form the date of its operation is not stated.  From the time the Bill is passed until the present councils are replaced by managers, you are going to have a state of administrative paralysis through the whole Twenty-Six Counties.  If this Bill is going to be passed&mdash;and I accept the fact that it is going to be passed&mdash;then the coming into force of the managerial system should be at the very earliest moment.</P>
    <P>I have heard arguments in the country for and against this Bill.  Most of the arguments advanced against the councils are rather unjust.  I have heard people advocate a Bill such as this on the ground that councils and local public representatives were corrupt. We have individuals corrupt in every walk of life, from the hamlet to the palace, but I charge that if that is true against a very odd individual, it is unfair to level it against the masses. Local boards, county councils, district councils, boards of guardians, corporations, urban councils and town commissioners have been there for 40 years, and the cases which any of us can call to mind of graft or corruption are <Col N="932" /> very, very few.  Because of these few, to brand the whole lot of them is, to say the least of it, unjust.</P>
    <P>Officials now and then have been found to be corrupt.  Parliamentarians now and then have been found to be corrupt.  It is not even unknown for Government Ministers to be found corrupt. It would be a damaging national suggestion to hint that, because a few officials have been found corrupt, because a few Parliamentarians have been found corrupt, or because a few Government Ministers have been found corrupt, all are corrupt and the whole system should be abolished.  We took power long ago to abolish councils found to be negligent in carrying out their business.  If there is a really sound case for this Bill, then there was a sound case long ago for more extensive abolition of county councils.  The fact that we have abolished, inside 15 years, only four or five councils is in itself evidence that, in the opinion of Executive Councils, two differently constituted from the political point of view, all the other public boards in the country have been carrying out their duties efficiently.  If they have been carrying out their duties efficiently, then it certainly weakens the case for this Bill.</P>
    <P>One of the counties in which it was my business, as a Deputy, to take opinions was a county which has, I might say, groaned under the managerial system for the past five years. I had come from the other county, Offaly, and in Offaly, to my surprise, I found that nobody would agree to support this Bill.  I said to a friend who accompanied me: &ldquo;It will be different to-morrow when we go to Laoighis.&rdquo; I spent the whole day meeting people in small groups, by appointment, and, to my surprise, opinion in Laoighis was more decidedly against the managerial system than it was in Offaly, based on the fact that they had experience of the managerial system for five years. I invited one after the other to make his case.  There was no suggestion that the commissioner was unfair or unjust. There was a certain amount of gratitude expressed that the rate in that particular county had not gone up to the extent it had gone up in other counties.  But the general case made <Col N="933" /> was that the humble individual in that county did not count one bit when there was a central machine operating. My own correspondence as a Deputy with the Minister's Department would indicate that, in these counties, there is more necessity for appealing to a Deputy to intervene on behalf of wretchedly-housed people than in counties where you have the popularly elected representatives managing affairs.  I have to write five letters of that type on business from Leix for every one I have to write on behalf of people in Offaly.</P>
    <P>It may be argued&mdash;it was very fully argued by Deputy Brennan&mdash;that you still have your council.  I wonder how long we are going to have the council under this Bill.  It may be argued that in the Cities of Dublin, Cork and Limerick you have managed to retain the councils, although you have managers. There is not the same necessity for continuous contact between the individual and the machine in a city as there is in a county where people live miles away from the hub of things. The city manager or any of his officials has only to take a penny tram to get to the extremes of his bailiwick, to visit any slum area or to inspect any case that has been reported on as being wretchedly housed.  In five minutes they can visit such a case, and come back and make up their minds.</P>
    <P>But take an extensive county with a county manager sitting in the centre, with his officers &mdash; well-intentioned, hard-working officials&mdash;around him and with the whole county to cover.  There is not the same intimate touch or the same close contact between the individual and the hub of the machine. Whether we are for or against this Bill, for or against this type of machinery, every one of us has found that in areas where the commissioner was acting instead of a council the ordinary person with a grievance had not the same machinery for getting that grievance looked into as he would have in a county where a council was operating. Personally, I think that it was possible to keep councils in the cities because councillors had very short distances to travel.  It did not cost them a lot of <Col N="934" /> time to get to a meeting of the council, where their powers were certainly very limited.</P>
    <P>I am extremely doubtful that you will get suitable candidates to stand for election to county councils at the second election after this Bill is operating in the country.  Men stand for election and sit on our county councils at present because they have a highly-developed sense of civic responsibility, because there is very important work to be done, because they represent one point of view or another, and because they feel that, if they &ldquo;let down&rdquo; on the job, all the class they represent will be let down, and badly let down. Taking one thing with another, all the time down during the 40 years the very best elements and the most representative individuals amongst our people have come forward to give that type of service.  What is the stimulus for them to keep coming forward?  Roughly speaking, you may divide our county councillors into those who represent the workers and the unemployed, those who represent the ratepayers, and those who represent middle interests. Irrespective of politics, you may divide every county council into those three classes, and the best representatives of those three classes come forward to represent the interests behind them and to play a really important rôle in representing such interests.  In order to do that, they travel 20 and 30 miles twice monthly in all weathers in order to attend council meetings.  If you vest all those powers in a county manager, or practically all of them, if you give powers to strike a rate, to borrow money, or to confer the freedom of the county on a distinguished individual when he comes along, do not you know very well&mdash;does not the Minister know very well&mdash;the type of county council he is going to get after the second next election?  It will not be worth the while of any determined and representative person to come into a kind of harmless, social assembly where they will pass the time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in anything you like.  I suppose they have got to keep <Col N="935" /> talking, if only in order to keep the local reporter in his job, but they will be without any effect, without any punch, and without any authority or power.  Let us say that the Bill is going to bring about greater efficiency and economy.  That is the main case for the Bill, and in hard times that is a case that cannot be passed over lightly. That is the main importance of this Bill, and the success of this Bill, from that point of view, is in exact propertion to the amount of central authority you give to the manager.  If that is the view of the Minister and of his advisers, I do not see any point in trying either to delude the Dáil or to delude the people behind us by keeping the remnants of a council that you have kept.  We are going to run the counties and the urban areas in the future by a manager and so many officials. From a strictly financial point of view, I believe that will be good, but do not try to delude anybody that you are keeping a county council.  You are keeping a county council with enough work, really, to keep them going hard for one hour per annum.  I do not believe that you will get suitable people to work, or that suitable people will be forthcoming, as I say, after the second next election, but let us remember that there is no argument that has been used or that can be used in favour of this Bill to appoint a manager and abolish councils that cannot be used in favour of the abolition of this Assembly and its replacement by one individual appointed by the Appointments Commission.  Any one of us knows the answer that such a suggestion would get if it were seriously brought in here, but the answer it would get from us here would be an honest answer, given by honest, outraged, nationalist democrats, and that is the answer we are getting at the present moment when we approach our constituents and ask them to support a Bill of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that, at least for the time being, we should go slow with this type of legislation.  The world, generally, is sufficiently upset and turbulent at the present moment without creating any further internal trouble or turmoil, <Col N="936" /> even of a minor kind.  There are too many democracies either disappearing or in danger of disappearing, without our stepping in to destroy what appears to country people to be their mouth-piece and their democratic institution. Now, let us remember this. This State is about 17 years old.  There was never a democratic state that came into being, to my knowledge, at least, after as long and as painful an effort to secure it.  Countless generations before us struggled and sighed for the day when an Irish self-governed, democratic State would come into being.  It came into being in our lifetime, and I think it is true to say that, nearly from the very day it came into being, irrespective of political complexions, one Government after the other has been slowly but progressively taking back the powers from the people and getting them into central control.</P>
    <P>It may be that each one of these Acts, by which power was taken from the people and vested in the central officers, made for greater efficiency and more economy, but both ourselves, in our day, and the people who went before us, appreciated the fact that there were other things in the life of a nation that mattered, sometimes even more than efficiency and economy; that there were some things, in every State, that carried a higher value than pounds, shillings and pence; and one of the firmest grounds on which either home or industry or State can be founded is on the joint shoulders and through the joint efforts of all the members of the family, of the business, or of the State.</P>
    <P>The more we tend to become a bureaucracy, no matter how highly efficient, and the more we are digging a deep trench between the central Government and the masses of ratepayers and taxpayers&mdash;the more we centralise, in other words&mdash;the more we breed suspicion and distrust; and the more we take control away from the ordinary plain people, who are financing the whole lot of us, the more we undermine, in the long run, the institutions of this State.  Now, in case anyone might think that I am talking merely as a politician, merely in opposition to the Bill because it is introduced <Col N="937" /> from the other side of the House, I say that&mdash;without counting heads and having argued the pros and cons of this Bill in our own committee rooms&mdash;I think, if a count of heads were taken, the majority of the members of this Party and the majority of the members of this Front Bench would be in favour of the Bill.  Perhaps there are points to be made for it.  As an official myself, seeing the local government machine working, not from the outside in but from the inside out, I am more convinced than any of them that this Bill is a Bill designed, and likely to secure, greater efficiency and financial saving.  At the same time, as an ordinary individual, a representative of all classes of people, like any other Deputy here, I firmly believe that in the long run we will lose more than we may gain by this type of legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express myself in favour of the amendment tabled by the members of the Labour Party. Deputy Norton, in the course of his remarks, read extracts from speeches of members of the Government when they were in Opposition&mdash;extracts from speeches made on the Cork and Dublin Managerial Bill.  Deputy Norton made no attempt to embellish or colour or apply any décor to those things.  He relied on the arguments contained in the statements themselves to drive home his point of view.  I propose to follow his very wise example in that regard, being perfectly satisfied, from the statements which he read for us to-night, that they contained a clear, logical and precise condemnation of the managerial system, inasmuch as it is clearly and definitely a departure from the principles of government and control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with some interest to Deputy Bourke, who, I think, is Mayor of Limerick; and I was rather surprised that he should press for the managerial system.  I know Deputy Bourke; I know him to be an upright, and fine sort of man, the type of man who ought to be mayor of an old city like Limerick; but I am afraid that, in dealing with this question, he is slightly confusing the issue and is mixing up the managerial system itself <Col N="938" /> with the question of a good manager. They happen to have a good manager in Limerick.  I think Deputy Bourke is in error in ascribing the successful working of the system in Limerick to the system itself.  We have, in fact, the same type of management here, and any member of the Dublin Corporation will admit that the system is working excellently in Dublin.  That is due to two facts: first of all, to the fact that we had three successful and very efficient managers, and a very good corporation. As I say, I do not for one moment believe that the efficient administration of local authorities, where the managerial system is working, is due to any inherent or intrinsic virtues of the system itself.  It is due rather to the efficient manager.  I would be very surprised if certain members of the Fianna Fáil Party walked into the division lobbies in support of this Bill, as I know that there is not a single member of that Party who is a member of the corporation and who has not, within the last five years, on more than one occasion, condemned outright the managerial system.  I see my good old friend, Deputy Alderman Breathnac&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and would very much like to know what his views are. Deputy O'Higgins struck a note which will appeal to most of us.  He indicated the line of thought which I think a great many members of this House are following, and that is, that the introduction of the managerial system on such a widespread basis is simply an attempt to make absolute dictatorship in local administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not altogether the worst feature.  Whilst dictatorship in matters of local administration may be sufficiently bad in itself, it carries the more serious possibility that, at some time in the not very distant future, we may be examining a Bill setting up a dictatorship in central government. This is a most inopportune time to introduce a Bill of this kind.  The Government has already fortified itself with all sorts of powers&mdash;they are called emergency powers, I think, but I am <Col N="939" /> not sufficiently well versed in parliamentary language or words or acts to rightly describe what their powers are. Still, I do happen to know&mdash;as all of us know&mdash;that they have these extreme powers.  Why on earth they should select a time like this to filch the last little piece of democratic control from local authorities I do not know.  The only interpretation I can put on it is that which Deputy O'Higgins put on it. He went to that trouble, and I believe that, when he was indicating his point of view, he was not speaking as a politician, but was giving a fair and reasonable indication of what was in his mind in relation to this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would like some of the members of the Dublin Corporation who are members of the Government Party to stand up and not be afraid to express their views about this measure.  Let them not be afraid to say what is in their minds.  Let gentlemen like Deputy Dr. Ward&mdash;reputed to have all the mental equipment and attributes of a dictator &mdash;not be intimidated by me.  Let them get up and say what they have to say.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this amendment of Deputy Norton's.  It is justified by the Minister's own statement of the changes in local government administration for the past ten years.  In introducing this Bill, the Minister gave no indication of the changes which were likely to be effected in connection with the improvement of social services.  He made no case showing any improvement that this Bill is going to have on the poor, on the administration of home assistance or on the management of county hospitals.  The only suggestion was that, with the increasing expenditure and with administration having increased in public boards, he may appoint county managers.  In the Bill he has provided that the secretaries of county councils will be the only persons eligible for appointment as county managers.  We see in the Bill that there are provisions that the salary of county managers is likely to be £1,000 a year, with travelling expenses.  Some of the secretaries of county councils have much more than that at the <Col N="940" /> present time, and it is not likely that they are going to apply, for the sake of the honour of resigning a position of £1,500 a year in order to take up a position at £1,000 a year with travelling expenses.  In his argument, it is urged that the boards of health will be abolished, and that the county councils will appoint them.  Is it not the councils appoint them at the present time?  Under the old Bill the county councils elected a board of health, which was responsible for its administration to the county council.  The board of health remains in power as representatives of the council until the estimates are passed and until various reasons are given why certain expenses were incurred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

    <Speaker pid="JamesEverett" hpid="Mr. Everett Mr. Everett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no argument put forward by the Government Party that it is going to reduce the rates. There is going to be greater efficiency, Deputy Brennan says, but it is greater efficiency with a greater expenditure. I know one council at least which gets letters from the Department complaining of the inadequate rate they strike, and suggesting that they should strike a higher rate as recommended by the secretary of the county council.  Simply because they refuse to strike a high rate submitted by the secretary, they are reprimanded by the Department. The position in this Bill will be that the county manager will be the &ldquo;yes-man&rdquo; of the Department.  He will have to carry out the orders of the Department and, therefore, the rate will be the rate passed by the county manager.  It can be held up for a fortnight under the Bill, but that is as much as will happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hannigan referred to this as an Emergency Bill.  I can see ways by which, if this Bill is passed, it will be possible for men to bring about chaos in local administration, and, at the same time, keep themselves clear of being brought in under the Emergency Powers Act.  I can assure the Minister that if he takes away all the rights, there are men who will bring local administration into ridicule.  It is very <Col N="941" /> easy for a number of men in each area to show up the Government in regard to administration and leave the responsibility to the county manager.  The one great concession which the Minister says a public board will have will be the right to appoint the rate collector, who will collect the high rates ordered by the county manager. That is the one privilege which a public board will have under the county manager scheme.  I, for one, give the Minister a promise that should this Bill pass, and all power be taken away from public bodies, he will want a good many county managers to carry out the administration of some of the counties, and I will keep clear of the Government's emergency powers.  We will be able to bring chaos into the whole administration of the county manager system because I can see nothing in it but transferring the job of the secretary to the county manager.  He will be 30 or 40 miles away from the headquarters of the board of health, and he will go once a month, and accept the instructions of the officials of the board of health. Under these circumstances, he may order a big reduction in home assistance.</P>
    <P>Then he comes to the urban areas. He has been for 20 or 30 years dealing with rural administration, and you ask him to take charge of urban areas.  For that privilege a proportion of his salary will be spread over urban areas which, in some cases, are unable to pay more than £400 a year to their secretaries or clerks.  To my knowledge the clerks of these councils are all capable men, and you are now going to have them &ldquo;bossed&rdquo; by a county manager whose outlook will be a rural outlook and quite the opposite of what may be required in a town.  For that privilege, the ratepayers in urban areas are going to pay an extra rate.  That is the only privilege they are going to get because public representatives, no matter from what Party they are drawn, are most conservative in the expenditure of rates.  They are not men who will pass any wildcat scheme involving an increase in rates.  In my own district, the larger number of the poor people are owners of their houses, and people <Col N="942" /> in urban areas are their own landlords, and, naturally, every increase in rates affects them very much.  They are, therefore, the first to complain if the rates are increased, so that the rates are always kept comparatively low.</P>
    <P>Now, we have the position that officials in the Department have taken out of the pigeon-holes an Act initiated and passed by Cumann na nGaedheal, opposed by the Minister and the Fianna Fáil Party, and criticised throughout the Twenty-Six Counties as undemocratic.  It is to be put into operation now by Fianna Fáil, when Fianna Fáil has given the franchise to the younger generation.  In giving them that franchise, great play was made with the democratic programme of giving the younger men the right to elect representatives to urban councils and county councils.  Now, we are to have no county councils and no urban councils, so that there will be no chance for these men to vote.  We talk of Hitlerism, but if ever there were complaints about Hitlerism, the people of this country now can well complain of the Hitlerism that is about to start in the Twenty-Six Counties.  We condemn certain happenings in the Six Counties, but in the Six Counties, though they have done a lot, they have not gone so far as to deprive the poor people of representation on public boards.  I agree with Deputy O'Higgins that you will not get representatives for public boards.  You may try to select a few of your own partisans here and there, but they are getting fewer, and will be still fewer by the time this election comes.  Even those men will have self-respect because large numbers of Fianna Fáil public representatives throughout the country have protested against the proposal and have stated that so far as their cumainn are concerned, they will prevent anybody from going forward. In that, they will have the co-operation of other sections of the community.</P>
    <P>We come then to the mental hospitals. One joint hospital I know is in County Dublin and the representatives are from County Dublin, Dublin City and Wicklow.  Assuming that the <Col N="943" /> county manager is from Wicklow, will he have the right to come up, once in a while, and give instructions to the three permanent officials in the Dublin hospital?  With 3,700 patients there, a whole-time man is required for the position, and I understand that there are officials there who are second to none in any part of the country.  A county manager who has been chiefly concerned with rural areas is to come up to advise the resident medical officer, clerks and secretaries of mental hospitals with 20 and 30 years' experience. How is he going to reduce expenditure in that way?  I submit that it is unworkable.  If the only purpose is to deprive the people of representation on public bodies, it is a wonderful Bill.  Under it, poor people will have nobody whom they can approach to redress a grievance.  What chance will a poor person looking for hospital treatment, or for assistance of any kind, have of getting an interview with the county manager?  We know the difficulty at times of meeting even certain officials of local bodies, and what poor person will have any right of audience?  There will be no representation for them because no man will take up the position of &ldquo;yes-man&rdquo; for the county manager, so that he can be blamed in public for the high rates, the appointment of the rate collector and the giving of authority to the sheriff to collect uncollected rates.</P>
    <P>If this Bill passes in its present form, I can visualise what will be done. Instead of improving the position of administration in a particular county, certain men, not acting unconstitutionally at all, can bring about chaos and prevent the working of this system.  I make no secret of it&mdash;I will do my part, if electors are not to have the right to appoint men.  I have done it before and we will do it again, please God, and thus force the Government to see the weakness of the Bill.  We will force them to realise that although they are the Government to-day, they should listen to the representatives of all Parties and especially to men in their own Party who have experience in public administration, who understand <Col N="944" /> the position and who have no axe to grind other than that of saving the people and saving the Government from itself.  If this scheme is brought into operation, what will happen in this instance to-day may happen in other instances to-morrow.  As I have pointed out, you will have one man in charge who will have the right to appoint an assistant to himself.  He will be county manager and county secretary.  We all know the way in which the commissioners worked.  As already stated here, they were not super-men.  They got the town clerks to do their work in many cases and, after a while, the commissioner system was allowed to lapse.  The same thing may happen in this instance. The county manager, of course, will have a motor car and he will have to be allowed travelling expenses for that. He must have assistants and a special staff and that will undoubtedly lead to increased expenditure.  There has been some criticism of increased expenditure by public boards in the past but that increased expenditure was not due to any mismanagement on the part of these public boards.  It was simply due to the fact that they were made responsible for extra services such as main roads, trunk roads, county medical services, and hospital administration of various kinds.  If there was any justification needed for Deputy Norton's amendment, it was the case made by the Minister himself and the fact that in areas where this system has been brought into operation it has led to increased expense.  The Minister has been unable to quote any case of the failure of administration due to neglect by local bodies in the last 20 years since district councils and boards of guardians were abolished.  We all know that district councils and boards of guardians were abolished more from political motives than anything else.  Has there been complete failure or has there been any improvement in public administration since?</P>
    <P>I never knew of a case such as Deputy Brennan suggested happened under the Board of Health in County Roscommon.  I say from experience that public officials generally are men who have the confidence of the officials <Col N="945" /> of the Department, and there would be very few mistakes made by the officials of local bodies before they would be drawn over the coals by the officials of the Department.</P>
    <P>I have seen no such widespread maladministration, as has been suggested by some other Deputies, arising from the fact that certain work is thrown over on officials.  They are doing that work without the extra salaries that will have to be paid to a county manager and his assistants.  Why did the Minister not say in the Bill what these salaries were going to be?  Was he afraid that some secretaries of county councils would refuse to take up these positions?  Is he not aware of the salaries paid to county council secretaries at present?  Why are you going to increase their salaries in some cases and leave them there?</P>
    <P>Again, the county councils cannot suspend the manager or secretary. Would Deputy Brennan state any instance in his experience in which, no matter how hostile a council or a board was to an official, they voted for the removal from office of that official? Certain influences are always brought to bear in cases of that kind.  I do not suggest that a county manager might do away with funds or be guilty of any serious misdemeanour of that kind, but he might be up against certain members present at a meeting.  It will scarcely be suggested that these members would be justified in seeking to suspend him, because he was carrying out the powers given to him under the Act.  I do not think any public man would seek to remove a manager from office simply for carrying out the duties imposed on him under the Act.</P>
    <P>I submit that there will be less work done in the interests of the people under this scheme than heretofore, for the reason that the county manager will seek to cut down home assistance and to cut down expenditure in connection with the treatment of people in hospitals.  That will not be at all to the advantage of poor people.  He may carry out economies in certain directions, but they will be false economies.  I suggest to the Minister, who made a great speech against the Cork Management Bill some years ago, <Col N="946" /> that even now, when he has the responsibility of office, his views cannot have changed very considerably, and that he should not be responsible for bringing forward this reactionary measure under which the last rights of the people are to be taken away.  The Minister may try to whitewash the Bill any way he likes.  He may try to make excuses around the country, and while there may be a clamour by certain individuals, who could not get elected for the most insignificant ward in an urban area, for this Bill, they will be the only people who will support the Minister on this Bill.  I submit that if the Minister and his Party were looking for the votes of people who are now clamouring for the abolition of councils, at the time of an election, he would very likely be disappointed. Having heard the views of all Parties in the House, I suggest that the Minister would be taking the best course in the interests of the people by accepting the amendment of Deputy Norton, and leaving the matter over for inquiry.  If the Government go forward with this Bill they will do so with their eyes open.  It is not going to achieve the purpose that they suggest, because in certain counties I guarantee that chaos will be brought about as a result of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I suggest to the Minister that before this Bill becomes law he should give very careful consideration to the views expressed by every Deputy in this House.  I have listened very carefully to Deputy Dr. O'Higgins, Deputy Everett, and Deputy Dr. Hannigan.  I happen to be associated on various public boards with some of these Deputies.  I happen to be a member of some boards of which Deputy Dr. Hannigan and Deputy Everett are also members, and I say that I welcome at least 90 per cent. of this Bill.  I have a very long experience of local administration in County Dublin&mdash;a longer experience than that of Deputy Dr. Hannigan and at least equally as long as that of Deputy Everett.  I happened to be elected under the old poor law system as a member of a board of guardians. I was not the statutory age at the time, but my name happened to be on <Col N="947" /> the register.  I was elected as a poor law guardian and a district councillor, and I can say that I have experience of years and years of corruption and bribery in public life.  That state of affairs exists up to the present day. It is only about a week since my friend, Deputy Belton, and myself were at a meeting of a public board, and after listening to some of the things he heard there, Deputy Belton said: &ldquo;Well, I was going to vote against the County Management Bill, but after this I think I will vote for it.&rdquo;  The Deputy cannot deny that.  I can understand Deputy Hannigan's objection to the Bill, because he has a fairly close connection with the activities of bodies like the Dublin Board of Assistance. We had Deputy Everett of the Labour Party talking about Hitlerism, about running away with democracy, and saying that the poor would not be given any consideration under a county managership, and all that kind of tripe. I have been a democrat all my life.  I am a supporter of democracy.  I have been a supporter of Labour on all the public bodies I have been associated with, without being a member of the Labour Party.  But there is nothing as bad in the country at the present day as trade unionism.</P>

      <P>I will tell you.  A great deal has been said here about the wonderful work done by the city manager in Cork, the city Manager in Limerick, the borough manager in Dun Laoghaire, and the city manager in Dublin, but let me remind Deputies that none of these men was an official of the body of which he is now manager.  The present city manager in Cork was brought down there from Drogheda; the manager in Limerick was brought from somewhere else; the manager in Dun Laoghaire was brought up from Limerick, and if you want to give a fair cut of the whip to every individual, then you should not appoint the existing county secretaries as the first county managers.  It may be all right for Deputies to make a little bit of a joke about that.</P>

      <P>As I have said, I have been a member of public bodies in the County Dublin for a period of 16 years, and I know exactly what has happened. In connection with this managership system, a great deal of credit has been given to the men in Cork, Limerick, Dun Laoghaire and elsewhere, but I say that is due to the fact that these men had not previously occupied positions as officials under the bodies with <Col N="949" /> which they are now connected.  Deputy Hannigan said a lot in opposition to the Bill and made a call to democracy to oppose it.  I say that if there is to be any chance for an individual to get a job, for the son of the working man that Deputy Everett represents, or for any other person to get a job, it will be through the operation of a Bill of this kind.</P>

      <P>I again suggest to the Minister that he should give careful consideration to the section dealing with the appointment of the first county managers.  I know it will be a very hard matter to deal with, in view of the fact that those officials are already in office as county secretaries or as secretaries to boards of health. We heard Deputies protest about the way authority is being filched from the public representatives.  While Deputies get up and talk in that manner, I can say, speaking from my experience as a member of public bodies for 16 years, that public representatives are being gulled every other day because, although jobs are advertised, they are filled before the advertisements are issued.</P>

If no Deputy will get up and tell me that, I can reel off the names if Deputies wish to hear them.  I know the sons and daughters of councillors who have got those jobs.

I am satisfied that the majority of the members of that Party honestly and conscientiously believe that this Bill is long overdue.

      <P>This Bill is a Bill that apparently has raised a fair amount of controversy all over the country, and I presume that that controversy is due in no small degree to the tactics of the Government in the recent past.  When I say the recent past I mean within the last ten or 15 years.  I have a distinct recollection of the last local elections in the country. In the course of these elections Fianna Fáil invited the electorate to give them county councils and local authorities that would give effect to the Government's plans, proposals and schemes for the betterment of the country.  I have also quite as clear a recollection that when these elections were over the Government hailed the result as a very great victory.  The people were lauded for giving them a majority in every county council in Ireland except one.  Sligo, I think, was the one exception.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, every county council except three or four.  The claim of the Government was that Fine Gael was defeated in these elections in nearly all counties.  What I want to know is: what has happened since? Did those councils in which Fianna Fáil got a majority let the Government down?  Did those councils refuse to carry out the plans, schemes and operations which the Government wanted carried out?  I will be quite candid and say this: I would not like to say too much against this Bill for fear the Government may withdraw it.  There is so much opposition to it from most of the supporters of the Government that I believe there is the danger that the Government will run away from it. We know that the Government has got into that habit.  They have the habit of proposing something; they are going to do something to-day, but when they see any opposition they do the direct opposite on the following day. There is no doubt about it that some alteration is required in local government. There is some truth in the statement <Col N="953" /> ment made a moment ago and there is this fear: that Fianna Fáil will not give this a chance.  It is true to say that if we were searching all over the country for an example as to why the managerial system should be introduced, we could not get a better one than we got in the exhibition by a member of a county council a few few minutes ago.  Not only is he a man who has had 16 years' experience of local administration, but he gives us this exhibition this evening of his knowledge of local administration or administration of any description. Personally, I believe that the managerial system is a good system.  But I believe also that if the county councils have failed to function properly, it is entirely due to the conduct of the Government and its supporters throughout the country.  When I say the supporters of the Government, I mean the leaders of Fianna Fáil, the rank and file of the Fianna Fáil Deputies.  I know that they do not mind what the ability of a candidate is.  If he has not the particular Fianna Fáil label on him, they do not want him in any local authority.</P>

      <P>If it applies all round so much the worse for the country.  I would be very sorry to see that a man could not be appointed to a position because he had a certain label round his neck even though he was a man of ability.  I say that a man with ability who is prepared to give his time and experience to local administration should be elected no matter what the colour of his label is. There is no doubt about it that not only the Back Benchers of Fianna Fáil but the Front Benchers of Fianna Fáil appealed to the electors at the last election to give them the authority that would enable them to carry their plans into operation.</P>

      <P>Yes, and no.  I assure the Deputy that I backed candidates, not only in my own county but in other counties as well, who were <Col N="954" /> not supporters of my Party.  I supported them because of their ability and they got defeated.  I do not think this Bill will improve the situation very much.  We are not in a position fully to judge.  The Minister has told us here, this evening, that he proposes to bring in a new Bill to show how the county councils are to be elected.  I submit, Sir, that the two should run side by side, or that the election of the councils should be incorporated in this Bill, because otherwise we are only getting piece-meal legislation.  We do not know what the position will be afterwards.  If, when you introduced this Bill, you had also introduced the Local Election Bill, or whatever it is called, we could then see what your intentions were, but in his speech to-night all that the Minister said was that he proposed to introduce a Bill for the election of the councils at a later stage.  Am I quoting the Minister correctly?  Is not that correct?</P>

      <P>I submit, Sir, that in order to give us an opportunity of deciding on this measure the other Bill should have been introduced at the same time, letting the two run concurrently. I think, therefore, that this Bill is a &ldquo;try-on,&rdquo; and that when it has been debated here for a while and enough snowball amendments have been passed, the Government will run away from it.  We have had samples of what has happened in Roscommon; at least we have been told in the Press that very prominent members of Fianna Fáil are declared to be opposed to this particular measure.  I say, anyhow, that in order to give the House an opportunity of seeing what are the intentions of the Government, this other measure should have been introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the Bill itself, I am in favour of it, because I think the position is bound to be better than it is at present.  I regret to say that, because I think it is a pity that such a situation should have arisen, but in view of the circumstances I think there is nothing we can do but accept it.  At least as far as I am concerned I accept the measure.  I would do so much <Col N="955" /> more willingly if I knew when the council was to be elected, what the approximate number of its members was likely to be, what was the area for the panels, whether it was going to be a large area with two or three members elected from each district, and so on.  Finally I should like to know if it is the Minister's intention to have the electorate the same as it is at present under the recent Act for the extension of the franchise.</P>
    <P>The grouping of counties, I think, is rather a mistake.  Where it is proposed to have an assistant to the manager, does that mean that in places like Longford-Westmeath the manager will reside in one place and can appoint an assistant for the other county?  I should like to know exactly what the intentions are in that respect where those counties are grouped in the Schedule.  I also think that that grouping is not a good one.  The conditions in the farming communities of Longford and Westmeath are completely different.  The manager who would be suitable for Westmeath in my opinion would not be a suitable person for Longford, because the circumstances and conditions of the community generally differ a good deal in the two counties.  I am not going to go so far as to say that this Bill means the abolition of democracy.  The councils where the managers have already been appointed are doing all right, and I think there is no reason in the world why they should not do well all over the country.  There are several matters which will arise on the Committee Stage, and can be dealt with when that time comes.  I am voting for the measure.  I do not at all agree that it means the abolition of democracy, nor do I agree with the statement that the manager can be dismissed by the council or suspended by the council.  He may be suspended by the council for an hour until he gets an opportunity of ringing up the Minister on the telephone, and then the suspension will cease.  He cannot be suspended or dismissed except by the sanction of the Minister.  If the Minister has recently appointed a manager and he is doing fairly well, grave <Col N="956" /> reason will have to be shown as to why he should be dismissed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JeremiahHurley" hpid="Mr. Hurley Mr. Hurley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hurley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened very carefully to the Minister, and also to those who have supported this Bill, but they gave no definite reason for doing so.  The Minister in his opening statement simply pointed out the various clauses of the Bill and explained to us what those clauses mean.  I think the House wanted more than that.  The House wanted to know exactly what is the reason for this very drastic step in local government administration, because it is a drastic step.  We have read and heard of the struggle for local government in this country.  We have read and heard of the system which that local government administration replaced, the old Grand Jury system, under which the ordinary people of this country had no voice whatever in local affairs.  At the same time, as far as I know of the old Grand Jury system, it was administered by a number of individuals.  It had certainly very grave faults, but there was a number of individuals running that system.  Now we are going back to a system worse even than the Grand Jury system, because we are going to place the power of local government in the hands of one individual.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As somebody has already said, that individual must be a superman if he is to run effectively the affairs of a county, even of a small county, with all the other bodies which have been tacked on to the administration of that county.  I submit, Sir, that there is no man in this country or in any other country who would come under that category.  You may get an individual who would in some way come near that standard, but now you are setting about picking out 28 or 30 supermen to run local government in this country, because, no matter how you may camouflage it with regard to the local councils and with regard to the representation on those councils, the fact still remains that all the effective local government in the county will be done by the manager.  I speak as one who has had experience of that system for the last nine years in Cork City, and I think I am in a rather more favourable <Col N="957" /> position in speaking on this Bill than many other Deputies in this House. There is a danger that, in speaking of the system, one may confuse it with the individual who runs the system.  I want to speak strictly to the system. Deputy Dan Bourke told us that the system works admirably in Limerick, and pointed out to us that they had a very fine type of manager there.</P>
    <P>That may be true of Dun Laoghaire, Dublin, Waterford, or even of Cork. In Cork we have had the good fortune, if you like to call it so, of having a manager who ran the system simply and solely as a system and did not take into consideration other points that might in some way make that system easier to run as regards the public representatives.</P>
    <P>The Cork City Management Act introduced this system into the country. It was brought in by the Cumann na nGaedheal Government in 1928, and the first election took place in 1929.  I happened to become a member of the Cork Corporation in 1930, very early in the operation of that system.  At first a section of the people of Cork City, probably an influential section, welcomed that change in administration. It was generally believed that everything was to be done well by the superman who was appointed.  The rates were to be cut down and improvements were to be made in various public works, in public lighting, and so on, and nobody counted the cost.  After ten years of the working of that system it would be worth while for us, before we go further with this Bill, to inquire impartially into the progress of affairs there.  I suggest it would be well worth while to have an impartial inquiry carried out, by any body the Minister cares to set up, into the working of that system in Cork.  I will stake my reputation on this, that the Corporation of Cork unanimously will not be in favour of that system.</P>
    <P>At first there were sections of the people and certain individuals elected to the corporation who were in favour of the system, but the Labour Party consistently opposed the Cork City Management Act.  The Parliamentary representatives of the Party pointed <Col N="958" /> out that it was a negation of democracy, that it was taking out of the people's hands the right to govern themselves.  Strange to say, that idea has since been taken up by other parties in the corporation, including members of the Fine Gael Party, who were so enthusiastic in welcoming the Act.  Many members of the Fianna Fáil Party, supporters of the Government proposing the Bill, are now vehement in their denunciation of the ramifications of this system of local government.</P>
    <P>Someone told us that efficiency and economy would be the hallmarks of this new system.  As far as the Cork City Management Act is concerned, neither efficiency nor economy can be shown in its working over the last ten years.  The rates are now 25/9 in Cork, and that is not a very high tribute to efficiency or economy.  With regard to efficiency, certain things happened in Cork.</P>
    <P>There was one incident which the Cork Corporation tried to bring before the Minister as a matter for a sworn inquiry.  The manager purchased land and paid £3,600 for a site for the fever hospital.  That site was afterwards condemned by some officials of the Department and the result is that the 26 acres of land are still in the hands of the Corporation.  Surely you cannot say that that is an index of economy in administration.  It is neither efficient nor economical.</P>
    <P>This Bill definitely shows a want of trust in the people in the matter of local government.  That is written all over the Bill.  It shows a lack of trust in the local people, in their ability to control their own affairs.  It is centralising the administration that should be carried out locally by the people, placing full control in the hands of a department in Dublin.  Nobody can tell me that that is going to make for better administration or greater civic spirit.  When the Cork City Management Act was being considered here, the Fianna Fáil Party opposed it and pointed out that one of the strongest reasons for their opposition was that the temptation was there to extend it to local government in the country. <Col N="959" /> They also said, as I have said to-night, that the Bill, on the face of it, was a negation of democracy.  They were then quite right, but now it has come to their turn to extend that very system of local government to the whole country.  Before the Minister does that, I suggest it would be only wise and right for him to examine very closely the operations of this system in Cork City.  After ten years, how is that system operating in Cork?</P>
    <P>I am quite prepared, and I think I can speak for my Party in this matter, to accept the verdict of any impartial inquiry.  There is no individual in the Cork Corporation to-day who will stand up for the working of the managerial system as far as Cork is concerned. They all see how it has turned the whole system of local government in Cork into ridicule.  At the last local government elections in Cork an individual was put up by some of the students in the University, more or less as a joke.  He was a man who was drawing a military pension.  Very responsible people in Cork City voted for him.  He was nearly elected.  When these people were asked why they voted for so-and-so, they said &ldquo;It is as well to vote for him as for anybody else; he would have as much power in the Corporation as others&mdash;the very same thing.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The whole system of local government has been brought into ridicule in Cork City through the operation of this system.  Responsible people in Cork City will not go forward for election. I think it was Deputy O'Higgins who said that after the second next election under this system there will not be candidates.  That is quite true and that prophecy is going to come true. In Cork City at the present time responsible people will not go forward for election because, with the exception of the one day in the year when the rates are struck, or on the day that the Lord Mayor is elected, the Corporation might as well not be there at all.</P>
    <P>I want to point out that the corporation has no function whatsoever as far as local affairs are concerned.  I will give an example of the working of the Act in Cork.  A rather curious <Col N="960" /> anomaly which I have not been able to understand is that the old corporation committees which functioned under the corporation in the days before this system was brought into operation still operates in Cork City.  We have the law and finance committee, public works committee, public health committee, and so on, and the city manager, of course, is the committee in each case.  A very interesting incident happened some years ago with regard to one of these committees.  The city manager applied to the law and finance committee for an amount of £75 to run his car.  The law and finance committee considered the matter very carefully and decided that the city manager was entitled to this £75 to run his car.  That matter came before the corporation, but all the corporation could say in the matter was: &ldquo;Has this been done?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yes, it has been done and, as well as that, it has been sanctioned by the Local Government Department.&rdquo; I quote that to give an idea of the powers and functions of the corporation, or a county council under this system.  The committees are there, but everything is signed, sealed and delivered when a report comes back to the corporation of what has been done at these meetings. You might say: &ldquo;Please, Mr. Manager, would you reconsider such a point arising under law and finance?&rdquo; and the manager, working the system in all its rigidity, will say: &ldquo;Oh, I cannot.  That is my function.&rdquo;  That ends the powers of the corporation.  I am going to the trouble of explaining the working of this system in Cork City.  I am not altogether blaming the city manager as such, but I say that it is a system that is worked in all its rigidity and all its rigour.  You will probably have under this system county managers who will do the same, and I would like to let the people see what the system is when it is worked with all its rigour.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is one point that must be kept in mind.  If this Bill goes through, it is being passed for not alone this generation but for future generations, until the people in their anger will rise up and abolish the whole thing.  But, in that time, you <Col N="961" /> may have numbers of city managers, and they all may not be of the particular type that people have in mind at the moment.  Mr. So-and-So, secretary of the county council, might make an admirable county manager, but that may not apply to all future managers. I want to point out that the system, operated as it should be operated, as this Bill intends it to be operated, will deprive the local authority of all power and of any effective voice in the control of their own affairs.</P>
    <P>Another point was made with regard to the control of staff and dismissals of staff.  I think it is in this Bill, as well as in the Cork City Management Act, that an official who had a grievance with regard to a dismissal had a right of appeal to the Minister, but that right of appeal had to go through the city manager, so the official concerned had very little chance of getting his case as he wanted it before the Minister.  We, in the Cork Corporation, wanted to have an appeal board of, say, the aldermen or any number nominated in the corporation, to which the aggrieved official could go.  We put up certain amendments and the amendment was not granted.  In the old days if the committees that were run by the corporation met and came to certain decisions those decisions had to be confirmed by the corporation before they were effective.  If there were some provision like that under the present system then the people would have some voice in their own affairs, but under this Bill as it stands the whole work of the corporation, just as the whole work of the boards of health, boards of assistance, mental hospitals, urban councils and town commissioners, will all be done by the manager and, as is done in the Cork Corporation system, he will probably tell the council what is being done, but the council will have no power to change anything, no matter how radically it affects the life of the people whom they are supposed to represent.</P>
    <P>This Bill definitely tends more and more towards the creation of a bureaucracy in this country.  I say that very deliberately because you will have running local government a number of <Col N="962" /> officials who will be responsible to the Local Government Department and who, from their very position, will recognise the authority and the voice of the Local Government Department, and will pay no attention to the local representatives.  Therefore, that is very definitely creating a bureaucracy which is going to have a very bad effect on local affairs and on local government in this country.</P>
    <P>Some people were very disturbed about small points such as the size of the council or the personnel of the council and so on.  As an outsider, I think I can say that I have seen the working of the Cork County Council where there are 68 members.  I think nobody could say, even going into it with the strictest inquiry, that that council has not done its work effectively and well.  I would like to pay that tribute to the Cork County Council.  I have seen the working of the board of health, especially the South Cork Board of Health, and again, I must say that and pay a tribute to the efficient way they do their work.  I cannot speak for Roscommon. If Roscommon is as bad as it is alleged to be by Deputies from that place there must be some very local reason for it.  Speaking generally, I think it will be admitted that local government in this country has been run most effectively and most efficiently by the men, and in some cases, women, who have given their time, their energies, and abilities to the work of local affairs.</P>
    <P>When the Waterford City Management Bill was passing through this House, this Party opposed the Bill, and the then Minister for Local Government, Deputy Seán T. O Ceallaigh, said that his idea of the management system was that the manager would be in the position of a managing director of a company.  If that analogy is applied to this Bill, or to the Cork City Management Act, a great deal can be said for working on those lines, but, under the system as I know it, and as it has been operated for the last ten years in Cork City, the manager is simply a dictator.  No managing director of a company would tell his directors that it is his business, and <Col N="963" /> not theirs, and, politely, that they can do what they like about it.  If a managing director of a company made such a statement to his directors, I am very sure they would show him very short shrift.  That happened, and it can happen under the Act and will happen under the Act.</P>
    <P>Those are some of the reasons why I am opposing this Bill, and they are some of the reasons why I would appeal to the Minister, even if this amendment is not acceptable to him, to hold an inquiry into the working of this system as operated in Cork City for the last ten years.  Cork was the first place in which it was tried, and we should see how it has worked there for the past ten years.  Before the Corporation of Cork was abolished in 1924, there was a very searching inquiry held by the Government of the day, which went on for weeks, and the Cork Corporation, consisting of 56 members, was shown to be free from that corruption, dishonesty and jobbery which has been alleged by different people in this House to-night. If you had an inquiry into the whole system of local government, as suggested by the amendment, I venture to say that the same would be found to be true of the great majority of the councils in this country.</P>
    <P>What is the reason the suggestion made in the amendment would not be accepted?  After all, it is a very serious and drastic step to change the whole system of local government which has operated in this country for the last 40 years by a Bill like this.  I think it is only right and reasonable to ask that, before that step is taken, such an inquiry should be instituted into the local government system from every angle.  Then you will discover its defects&mdash;and I admit it has defects&mdash; but you will also discover that if this Bill is passed with the intention which it bears on its face, to wipe out the whole local government system in this country, then you are going to have very serious reactions all through this country, and probably on people who are now enthusiastic for this change.</P>
    <P>Of course you have people on local <Col N="964" /> authorities who would like to have some other fellow do the thinking for them.  It is very easy to have a county manager or somebody else to do the thinking and planning and all the rest for them.  This Bill caters for that kind of lazy individual.  But it goes further than that.  It is going to regiment all local government effort in this country.  It is suggested that that is unification.  I call it regimentation. It is regimenting the whole system of local government, and that again, I hold, is a bad idea which underlies this Bill.  You cannot regiment local government affairs in this country.  Different places have different problems and different ways of attacking them, and that can best be done by the people of the district rather than by any manager, no matter how clever or efficient he may be thought to be. Therefore, I would very sincerely ask the Minister, before taking a step that may have very serious reactions, to consider and inquire into the whole system of local government, with particular reference to the Cork City Management Act for the last ten years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in favour of this Bill and of the principle of county managers. Unlike Deputy Hurley, I am not afraid of democracy for the future if this Bill is put into operation.  As a member of a local authority who has some experience, I realise the absolute necessity for a manager to carry out the executive and administrative affairs of the council.  I think the time is opportune for a change.  There is no doubt that the Bill changes the whole system of local government in a farreaching manner.  I would be inclined to say if the Minister had brought in a Bill that went portion of the way at this stage, giving the manager full executive and administrative authority, and had left with the councils certain of the powers which he proposed to take from them, the Bill would be more generally welcomed in the House than it has been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think some opponents of the Bill would agree with me that most of the executive functions are performed by the officials at present.  County councils or other local authorities raise a certain <Col N="965" /> amount of money in the year, and they hand over that money, in the main, to the officials to administer. They have very little power of control over how that money is spent after having raised it by means of the rates. We know very well that on every council, especially on town councils, there are a few members who take a keen interest in the work.  They are on the spot all the time, and very often between the meetings they work with the secretary of the council in administering the affairs.  But members of county councils may be drawn from an area extending over 30 or 40 miles. They can afford to give very little attention to the detailed matter of spending the money once it is raised. As things are at present, owing to the very large increase over the last few years in the different services administered by local authorities, especially by boards of health, the members of county councils cannot give the attention that should be given to the administration of the money once they hand it over to the officials.  To a great extent the work of the boards of health has gone beyond the control of these boards.</P>
    <P>It has been said by Labour Deputies and other Deputies that if this Bill is passed it will put all the functions of the boards of health into the hands of the county managers.  As I understand the Bill, boards of health are being abolished, and in future we will have more members in charge of board of health matters than at present.  In County Cork or County Galway, for instance, there are not more than ten members on the board of health. Imagine having ten members drawn from all over County Cork, which is a very large area.</P>

In Louth, <Col N="966" /> Carlow or in smaller counties such a body would be fairly well in touch with the people, but that is not the position in larger counties.  It is nonsense to say that if this Bill becomes law we are going to do away with democracy. There is very little democracy left at the present time.</P>

      <P>You will not get one in the country who will not agree that the old boards of guardians and district councils were a good riddance.  Everyone agrees about that.  We thoroughly agree with it, and we were never sorry for anything we advocated in that respect.  There are many ways in which I would like to see this Bill amended.  In Section 4 there is a proposal to appoint a temporary manager before a permanent appointment is made.  I think that is wrong in principle. I am convinced that the first manager should be a permanent appointment, and I see no reason whatever why the Bill should come into operation before the county manager is appointed by the commissioners.  That would be a sound provision.  Unless he is certain that he will be the future manager, no temporary manager will be in a position to carry on the functions of that position.  Some other sections will, I believe need amendment on the Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the State should provide at least half the salary of the manager, as is done in the case of medical officers of health.  The manager will be administering funds for the State just as much as he will be administering the funds of local authorities. Roughly half of these funds are provided by the county council and half by the State, so that it would be as much in the interests of the State as in the interest of local authorities to do that.  The State should provide half the cost of county managers and assistant managers.  As there is a provision to appoint assistant managers the Minister should schedule counties in which he believes they are required. We know quite well that once it is decided to appoint extra officials under any Act, that provision will be availed of one way or another.  While at the moment there might not be strong enough opposition amongst the people to the provision of half the salary, certainly, if there are to be a number of assistant managers, there will be a big objection.  I see sound reasons for having assistant managers in some four or five counties, but no reason for having them in normal sized counties. On the Committee Stage the Minister should schedule the counties in which county managers are required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Higgins stated that there will be more efficiency and more economy under county managers.  I am not quite sure that there will be such great efficiency.  There may be room in certain directions for efficiency, but I hope the efficiency these officials will bring about will not be at the expense of the poorer classes of the community.  I know the efficiency we could have in that direction.  However, I am sure the county managers will be fair to every section of the community. I should not like to see efficiency in the direction I mentioned.  Under this Bill county councils are given power to appoint rate-collectors.  That is the only power of appointment they have. I do not exactly agree with that.  I say they should have power to recommend other part-time permanent officials, for instance, officials of boards of health, cottage rent collectors, home assistance officers and other officers that <Col N="968" /> these bodies elect at the present time. Seeing that they are given power to appoint rate collectors, they should be given power to recommend the appointment of other part-time officials.  I do not see why all the patronage should be left to the manager, and why the making of small appointments should not be given to the councils.  I suggest that the Minister should amend the Bill in that direction.</P>
    <P>With regard to the appointment of temporary managers during the illness of managers, power is given to chairmen of county councils to nominate managers.  It would be much better if there was a panel of managers to act as managers or assistant managers in other counties in the absence of the permanent officials.  I think it would be wrong to have any subordinate official in a particular area manager even for a short time.  It would be sounder if a panel of temporary managers was drawn up under the Act.  With regard to Section 11 and the delegation of duties of assistant managers, I do not know if that is sound.  The managers should carry the responsibility all the time.  They should be responsible to the councils, and not the assistant managers.</P>

      <P>He is certainly responsible for omissions and commissions in every way.  I say that if a Bill of this kind was brought before the House, leaving power with the manager, and giving him full responsibility, and not giving him any of the other powers that it is proposed to give him, it would meet with more general agreement in the country.  I welcome the Bill.  I think it will bring about efficiency, and that more attention will be given to detailed work of administration than it is possible to give at the present time in the different matters that local authorities and boards of health are called upon to deal with.  I ask the Minister to give consideration to the points I mentioned, and I trust he will amend the Bill accordingly on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I was very interested in the last Deputy's efforts to support the Bill.  Really his remarks amounted to criticism of the Bill.  He suggested certain amendments, and went back a long way to deal with the present state of things.  Obviously that shows that the Deputy is not in favour of the Bill. I am not in favour of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am deducing my conclusions from what the Deputy said.  It is quite obvious that he wants certain powers retained, but to what extent he did not state.  He indicated that he wanted considerable powers retained, and that obviously means that he does not want this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">

      <P>I am absolutely in favour of it.  Let the Deputy give us his own opinion.</P>

      <P>Deputy Allen, like his colleagues, has changed greatly since 1935, when they threw up their arms and stated that all voters in this country should be electors under the local government franchise.</P>

      <P>But they never got the opportunity of electing anybody except in Dublin City and County.  They are not going to get the opportunity to elect councils to administer local government.  Deputy Allen says he is in favour of this change, although he voted for the previous change.  I am satisfied that some reform of local government is necessary.  I am equally satisfied that the way to reform local government is not by abolishing it. That is the essence of the whole thing. If we are satisfied that there is some illness in the local government body, let us diagnose it and try to find a remedy.  I was particularly struck at the half-hearted way in which the Minister introduced the Bill.  I am quite satisfied his heart is not in it.  I am not surprised at that.  What is wrong with local government?  The Minister did not tell us.  He may call this a reform of local government, if he likes. He tried to make the case that we shall still retain democratic control.  If it <Col N="970" /> was necessary to bring in a Bill of any kind, it was due to this House that the Minister should indicate where the flaws in the local government system existed.  He has not done so.  Therefore, I do not think that he has made a case.  I am a member of three councils at present.  Two of them have managers, and one has no manager.  I can pay a tribute to the managers equal to that paid by Deputy Bourke to the managers in Limerick.  I can pay tribute not alone to the Dublin City Manager but to the manager in the Borough of Dun Laoghaire, who happens to be one of the men to whom Deputy Bourke paid tribute.  The present manager of Dun Laoghaire is an ex-manager of Limerick.  The managers do their work well, but what about the people who put up the money?  Are they to have no power or authority in the expenditure of that money?  Are they not as efficient for local government purposes as we are for legislative purposes?  It is worth while considering the case put up by Deputy O'Higgins.  If you carry out this managerial system to its logical conclusion, why not a manager for the Dáil, and save this £480 a year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>You have one that controls the Government, and this Bill will establish Hitlerism down to the toe-nails.  What can any manager or salaried man be but, more or less, subservient to his boss?  I do not believe that a single member on the Government Benches is 100 per cent. behind this Bill or even 50 per cent. Why not find the malady and apply the remedy?  The Government can, by the exercise of the Whip and a machined majority, pass this Bill into law if they so desire.  Four years ago, they extended the franchise and gave votes to people who were not contributing to the local rates.  They gave these people control for which they did not subscribe.  That was contrary to all our opinions of societies.  Trade unions will not allow a member who has not his card stamped a voice in their affairs.  They will use drastic measures against that member.  The present Government&mdash;or practically the <Col N="971" /> present Government&mdash;four years ago extended the franchise to all men and women of 21 years of age and upwards. They gave them the right to vote in the local elections.  That was not going in the direction of reforming local government.  If it is because too many irresponsibles have votes in the election of local bodies this Bill is required, why not face up to that position and curtail the franchise?  I am not advocating that.  Members of the present Government criticised what they referred to as the &ldquo;reactionary clauses&rdquo; of the Greater Dublin Act, of 1930, which provided for a commercial register on which five of the 35 members of Dublin Corporation would be elected.  They said that that was undemocratic, so we wiped that out. What is wrong with local government in the country generally?  Is the trouble caused by the fact that an irresponsible element, which contributes nothing to the local rates, can vote irresponsible members on to local bodies and create chaos in these local bodies?</P>

      <P>If that is the fault with the present system, face up to it.  If that is not the fault, what is the fault? A number of us are old enough to remember the scenes in every county <Col N="972" /> town when the Local Government Act came into operation 40 years ago.  The green flag was hoisted, and there were baton charges all over the country. We looked upon it as the dawn of a measure of freedom.  That is now being taken away by the present Government. They have not shown where the flaw has occurred in that system.  They have said that members of local authorities have too much work, that they are not able to find the time to devote to the work.  Who piled on the work to the local authorities?  Why is the administration of unemployment grants thrown on to the staffs of the county councils?  Why should not the creators of unemployment&mdash;those who control the public boards&mdash;face up to the problems caused by their financial and economic policy, instead of interfering with machinery which has proved efficient in administering local government to the extent for which it was designed?  Why is the present Government piling on work to these bodies which should be done by themselves, and then saying that the local authorities have too much to do, that they must be abolished, and that the work must be done by civil servants? I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>
