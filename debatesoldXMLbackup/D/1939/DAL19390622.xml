      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether, in view of his statement that his Department is not responsible for the programme or policy in operation in the national schools which was laid down by the National Programme Conference of 1925, he has made any inquiries as to whether that conference had consulted any medical opinion as to the probable effects on the physical and mental development of school children of its recommendation that English, the home language of the children and the language of life outside the schools, should be excluded from the infant classes in English-speaking districts; and, if not, whether he will now consider the advisability of consulting the school medical officers or other competent medical opinion as to the actual effect of such exclusion on the children.</P>

      <P>The programme prepared by the National Programme Conference of 1925-26 was then adopted by the Minister for Education as the official programme for use in national schools.  I have not made any inquiry as to whether that conference consulted medical opinion on the subjects suggested by the Deputy.  I do not consider that it is necessary or advisable for me to consult the school medical officers or other medical opinion as to <Col N="1458" /> the effect of the language programme in the infants' classes in English-speaking districts.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education whether he will consider the advisability of laying down for national schools a definite graduated minimum programme of studies in the Irish language, with the object of achieving a continuous and progressive improvement in the knowledge and use of Irish in the schools from the first to the highest standards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that the revised programme of primary instruction issued in 1934 when read in conjunction with the Notes for Teachers published by my Department for the guidance of teachers and others engaged on or interested in primary education is sufficiently definite, graduated and adaptable to suit the needs and circumstances of all types of national schools, and that it is capable of achieving the improvement suggested, in the knowledge and use of Irish in the schools from infants to highest standards.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Lands if he will state how many acres of forestry have been planted in the County of Donegal during the last five years; and whether, in view of the enormous tracts of land available, it is his intention to increase the present rate of planting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>An area of 778 acres in County Donegal has been planted for State forestry purposes during the last five years.  It is intended to increase the rate of planting as rapidly as possible, but this depends to a large extent upon the areas of suitable land available. Unfortunately the bulk of the land offered for sale to the forestry division in County Donegal is quite unsuitable for economic forestry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesSprouleMyles" hpid="Major Myles Major Myles">
      <NameTxt>Major Myles</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot agree with the Minister's answer regarding the unsuitability of the land. I would like the Minister to realise <Col N="1459" /> the importance of this matter in regard to winter employment for rural areas, not to speak of the ultimate benefit of having woods scattered throughout the country.  I would like the Minister to bear that strongly in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any necessity to ask that.  Those in a position to judge say that the bulk of the land offered in Donegal for forestry purposes is unsuitable, but we have increased our rate of planting from 54 acres to 325 acres last year, and the rate will be increased further if it is found possible.</P>

    <Title>Waterford City Management Bill, 1939&mdash;Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh) Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The Bill proposes to extend to the City of Waterford the system of municipal government that associates a city manager with an elected council.  This system is already in operation in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Dun Laoghaire.  Under the Bill, the powers and duties of the corporation will be exercised in relation to certain reserved matters by a newly constituted council and in other respects by the city manager.  The new council will consist of 15 members, four of whom shall be aldermen.  The former council consisted of 40 members, including ten aldermen returned by five wards.  It is considered that, under the new system, a numerically smaller body will be able to carry out the council's functions with greater dispatch.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill, the city wards will be replaced by two electoral areas. The number of members to be elected by each area will be determined so as to secure, as far as is reasonably possible, equal representation on the basis of population.  An election will be held within three months after the passing of the Bill.  Provision is made to bring subsequent elections into line with the triennial elections of county councillors.  The council will elect a mayor whose duties will be substantially the same as heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The functions reserved to the new council will preserve for the council the control of financial policy.  The council will exercise the power of striking the municipal rate and of borrowing money.  There are also <Col N="1461" /> reserved to the council the powers in regard to making by-laws, bringing permissive Acts into force, opposing and promoting Bills and appointing representatives on public bodies.  Subject to the usual safeguards, they will also have power to appoint, suspend or remove the manager.  There is a provision by which the powers of the council can, if necessary, be extended by an order of the Minister.</P>
    <P>The city manager will be appointed on the recommendation of the Local Appointments Commissioners.  Pending the permanent appointment being made, the Minister can nominate a temporary manager.  The person appointed manager will also be town clerk.  The Tuberculosis Committee will be dissolved and its functions transferred to the corporation.  It will be the duty of the manager to furnish information to the mayor, attend meetings, advise the council, plan works which the council wish to have executed and control and supervise the staff.  He will act by signed orders of which a record will be kept.  All the existing separate funds will be merged in a new consolidated fund, referred to in the Bill as the municipal fund.  A new municipal rate will take the place of the existing borough rate, poor rate and water rate.  The contract water rate will remain.  In order to preserve the existing partial exemptions as nearly as possible, the municipal rate will be levied on seven-tenths of the valuation of arable land or meadow within the city and on three-fifths of the half rents rateable under the Poor Relief Acts.  The Bill provides machinery by which an application may be made by the corporation for an extension of the city boundaries and the determination thereof by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Officers and servants of the corporation will continue to hold their positions on the same tenure as at present, but they will be under the control and supervision of the manager. Employees, if they have 20 years' service, are given the benefit of the provisions of Section 53 of the Local Government Act of 1925 and this power can be exercised within a period of two years, or longer, if the Minister, <Col N="1462" /> on the application of the corporation, extends the period.</P>
    <P>Section 37 of the Act contains an important provision under which the corporation may acquire lands and drain them if they are capable of being improved by drainage and such improvement would increase the amenities of the city.  The lands which the section is designed to deal with are the Kilbarry marshes which lie on the south boundary of the city.  The marshes, which are over 200 acres in extent, are covered with water for the greater part of the year.  This waterlogged waste is a menace to the health of the city, which is extending along the higher ground about the marsh. A scheme prepared under the Arterial Drainage Acts, 1925 and 1929 was rejected by the occupiers of the marshes.  The drainage work should not present any great technical difficulties, nor should the cost prove to be prohibitive.  The Bill is presented in the firm belief that it will promote the better government of the city and the efficient administration of the many services the corporation are now called on to administer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisJohnGorey" hpid="Mr. Gorey Mr. Gorey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like a little more detail in connection with this Bill which is of some concern to the constituency I represent.  I can understand the Minister's reference to developments in the Kilbarry bogs area, which is in County Waterford, to which he referred by name, but when he speaks of extensions of the city boundaries, I think he ought to be equally as explicit and to state what is intended, at least on the Kilkenny side.  He has referred to the operation of this system in other cities, but I think Waterford will be found rather different inasmuch as it is on the border of two counties.  He has said that machinery will be established to deal with any proposed extensions, but I should like to know what provision will be made whereby Kilkenny interests can be represented.  At present, we have no county council, its duties being in the hands of a commissioner, and there is very little chance of having views expressed by elected representatives, and none at all by <Col N="1463" /> local residents of the portion of the county which might be interested in any changes proposed to be made.  In view of the fact that the Minister has named developments in the Kilbarry area, I should like to know what the intentions are.  The Minister, I am sure, has no intentions in the matter, but some local people, or people on behalf of the local authority, must have briefed him as to their intentions with regard to developments on the Kilkenny side.  I should like to know what they are, and I think it only fair to the House and to the county I represent that they should know them and that we should know what provision is to be made for the expression of views by residents of any particular portion of that county.</P>
      <P>I am also interested in a business concern outside the borough boundary on the Kilkenny side.  It was our deliberate intention to be outside the borough boundary and that was the reason the factory was set up on the particular site on which it was set up, so that there would be no control by any authority outside the people by whom the capital was subscribed. Waterford City subscribed nothing, or very little, to this particular enterprise. I think it only fair that, at this stage, the Minister should be more explicit. It is the only point of interest in the Bill to the residents of the Kilkenny side of the river.  The drainage of Kilbarry is, in my opinion, very desirable in every way, both from the point of view of public health and of territory for possible building development which that bog would give, if reclaimed. Everybody with an open mind will agree that that swamp is, and always has been, an eyesore.  My only concern is that the Minister will give us an outline of what is intended and who it is that has inspired this particular clause that embraces the County Kilkenny and the corporation activities on the Kilkenny side of the river.  Perhaps Deputy Little could give us some indication of that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill raises a very important principle in respect of the <Col N="1464" /> powers of the city manager.  It would appear from the terms of this and previous Bills which have been introduced that the Government have now become wedded to the idea of the city manager.  When we come to look at schemes of organisation which empower the city manager to exercise virtually all the executive powers of an elected body in a municipal borough, we find two notable examples, in the case of Dublin City and Cork City.  It is a mistake to imagine that the City Council of Dublin exercises any effective control over the municipal government of the city.  The main powers in respect of municipal government in Dublin are vested in the hands of the city manager.  The ordinary members of the council have very little power to shape the municipal policy of the city.  It is true they may be asked to vote money and it is true they may refuse to vote money.  But if one recognises that the municipal services are to be carried on, then the municipal council has to vote the money.  Having done that, the power of the municipal council to direct the municipal policy is negligible indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I notice there is a complete absence of members of the Government Party who represent the City of Dublin to-day.  These Deputies who are members of the Government Party in the Dublin Corporation have been most vehement in their denunciation of the dictatorial powers conferred upon the city manager.  The members of the Government Party in the Cork Corporation have been most vehement in denouncing the dictatorial powers conferred on the Cork City Manager. But there are none of these here to-day to express their views on this Bill. None of the Dublin or Cork Deputies on the Government side are here during this debate.  But this Bill is a continuation of the same policy as is enshrined in the City of Dublin and the City of Cork Management Acts.  In this instance it has been acknowledged by all Parties, except perhaps, the Fine Gael Party, that the government of Cork City is in the hands of the city manager.  The same applies to the Dublin City Manager.  He can decide and direct the policy of the council in any manner that he desires.  It is true, <Col N="1465" /> of course, that the city manager may meet the council.  The council may make recommendations to him and he will consider the recommendations. The municipal council in Dublin may pass any resolution it likes; the City Council of Cork may pass any resolution it likes, but neither the City Manager in Dublin nor in Cork is bound to take the slightest notice of any resolution passed by the council unless the resolutions agree with the outlook of the city manager and with the point of view of the city manager in respect of representative government.</P>
    <P>The whole position reminds me of a story which is told of Disraeli.  He was presented on one occasion with a book and he said he would lose no time in reading it.  He did not.  The City Managers in Cork, Dublin, and in Waterford, if this Bill is passed, can say they will lose no time considering any resolution passed by their councils; the proposal of the council will get as much consideration from the city managers as Disraeli gave to the book presented to him.  I think that is making a mock and a farce of municipal government because in the case of the administration in Dublin and Cork, and the administration that will be in operation in Waterford when this Bill passes, the local representatives have no power to guide the municipal policy of the areas concerned.</P>
    <P>I will agree at once that it ought not be necessary to bring before the council every small matter of routine administration and ask the local representatives to adjudicate upon what should be done in such circumstances. There are a lot of routine functions which could be carried out by any man acting as town clerk or secretary of a committee.  But when you give the manager far-reaching powers such as he has in Dublin and Cork then you make local representative government ludicrous because, while pretending to retain a semblance of representative government in respect of municipal matters you, in fact, give all vital powers to the manager and local government is merely a rubber stamp for the manager and only a pretext for saying that local government exists in both Dublin and Cork.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1466" /> I make no complaints against the managers.  They may be very acceptable citizens, very agreeable people, but the machinery put into their hands makes them virtual bosses of the areas they operate and I protest against that as something that is in direct opposition to municipal government.  This Bill, like the Cork City Management Act and the Dublin Act, is undemocratic. It will be found later on to be most undemocratic in operation.  What the machinery of the Bill may be is one matter, but this is not the way to approach the question of municipal government.  It should not be approached in this dictatorial way.  I think it is a mistake to give one person the wide powers which the manager is getting in this Bill.  It is undemocratic to give those powers and it is making a farce of representative government. Whatever, therefore, the merits of the Bill may be in respect of routine matters, we on these benches are opposed to it on principle because it is destroying local representative government.  It is putting into the hands of the city manager powers which should clearly be reserved to the local municipal council, reserved to people who are more in touch with the desires of the citizens than the manager could possibly be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give Deputy Gorey much information in reply to the question asked about the intentions of extending the boundaries in Waterford.  I have no intentions and the Department of Local Government and Public Health have no intentions whatever in the matter of the boundaries.  In several places in municipal and other areas in recent years power was sought to extend the boundaries.  It was found it was a very difficult and slow process which required the introduction of a Bill.  It was a difficult, slow and costly process. As a result in all these Bills dealing with the reorganisation of local government in a number of cities and towns, Dublin, Cork, Dun Laoghaire and Limerick, a clause was introduced enabling the local authority to apply to have their boundaries extended. This Bill is a shortening of the process and a lessening of the expenses and <Col N="1467" /> costs in each case.  It would be open to them, after a local inquiry and with the consent and approval of the Minister, to have the boundaries extended if it were thought necessary to extend them.  This Bill is adopting the same principles in the case of Waterford where there has been for many years, as the Deputy and other Deputies are aware, a demand that power should be got to extend the boundaries of that city.  In this case at any rate it would mean that the question of the Kilbarry marshes could be dealt with.  It was for the purpose of enabling the corporation, if they thought fit to extend the boundaries of the city, to include the Kilbarry marshes.  It was because of that question, specifically, that the section was put in there.  I am not aware of any intention to extend the boundaries on any side of the city, but I know there were discussions very many times in the municipal council of Waterford in days gone by, 60, 70 and 100 years ago, about the drainage of the marshes by the municipality.</P>

I am sure if Deputy Norton and I were discussing this for years we would not agree on the principles enunciated in this Bill.  Anyway, we would not agree if we were discussing it in the House.  If I had Deputy Norton inside his room or if he were inside my room I am sure I would get him to agree.</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton mentioned vital power.  Vital power is the power of the purse and as long as <Col N="1468" /> the municipal council has control over the money it has control over the fundamental principles of local government. It has not control over the ordinary administration, but it can lay down the principles and direct how money is to be spent under the various headings.  The corporation provides every year a scheme of estimates showing the general principles on which money is to be spent.  It does not control expenditure in detail but it fixes the amount to be expended, the principles on which it is to be expended and the rates to be raised.</P>

      <P>The councils control the money.  Practically every Deputy knows that local government is so many-sided and so intricate that it requires the constant, every-hour attention of somebody.  The manager acts as the manager of a big business <Col N="1469" /> concern.  Members of the council cannot be on the job all the time.  They cannot watch over every detail, and it is most useful and most helpful to have somebody to carry out their policy. They direct policy, and the manager carries it out as the managing director or manager of a big business concern would do on behalf of his board of directors.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is division among my colleagues as there is amongst the Deputy's colleagues. There is division of opinion everywhere on this question of city management. They tried it out in many places in America.  In one case, where they tried it out for ten years, they changed back to the reformed old system.  We are in an experimental stage here, and I think the experiment will work satisfactorily. I do not agree that the system is undemocratic.  If the municipal council had not the power of the purse, it might be claimed that it was undemocratic, but representation of the people and control of the purse are preserved, and I do not think it can be, in any sense, claimed that the system is undemocratic.  As Deputy Norton correctly said, this is a continuation of the policy enshrined in the Dublin and Cork Acts which have, generally speaking, worked out well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>On the occasion of the introduction of the Budget, the Minister favoured the House with a very large collection of figures.  Some of them were informative.  Some of them were apparently introduced for the purpose of mystifying&mdash;if that term could be applied to such an intelligent assembly&mdash;the Dáil.  The sum and substance of the whole thing was that the Minister sought by reason of his speech and of his figures to give the impression that the increased expenditure in this State for the last seven years was largely, if not entirely, due to the cost of social services.  He drew a distinction on the occasion of the Second Reading of this Bill, pointing out that the Finance Bill was really scheming to collect a much smaller sum than I had said.  If it pleases the Minister's aesthetic financial taste, if he has such a thing, I will qualify my statement by saying that&mdash;scheming to get a certain amount of money under this Bill, and scheming to get it under other Acts or other procedure, and boiling it all into the same revenue account, which is all that matters&mdash;he is hoping to collect over £32,500,000, whereas the revenue collected in 1931-32, was almost £25,500,000, leaving the Minister over £7,000,000 more to spend than was available in 1931-32.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister claims to have saved £2,000,000 which had to be spent by his predecessors under certain agreements ratified when the Minister may have been an unwilling member of this House, but nevertheless ratified by this House, and he is proposing to take from the Road Fund £150,000 this year, <Col N="1474" /> so that he has in all exactly £9,165,000 more to spend than the revenue which was collected in 1931-32.  The question now arises as to how it is being spent, and what different services have been expanded.  He claims to be spending on social services this year, according to his White Paper, the sum of £10,121,454&mdash;that is an estimate, and we must distinguish between estimate and expenditure&mdash;subject to certain deductions of one kind or another which the Minister made in his speech. If he reduced the figure of £35,000,000 by £1,000,000 for over-estimation, this particular figure fails to have a reduction of an equivalent proportion made in respect of it.  He has taken £100,000 from the Relief Fund, and he has reduced the Public Works and Buildings Estimate by £100,000 also. Assuming for a moment, however, that the £10,000,000 were correct, and comparing it with the corresponding figure for 1931-32&mdash;I am speaking now from recollection, as I have not got the table here before me&mdash;there is something like £5,500,000 of a difference.  As I have shown that the extra money which the Minister has to spend amounts to £9,000,000, the sum of £3,500,000 has to be accounted for in some other direction.</P>
    <P>The Minister's case in the second part of his speech was that they are paying the same rates&mdash;that they inherited those rates&mdash;to civil servants and to Guards as were paid before the Government took up office.  We have not questioned that.  We do not dispute it.  The Minister will recollect that, when he endeavoured to change those rates, we objected, and opposed him with some success as far as the Guards were concerned.  We would do it again, because if a bargain is made with a member of the Gárda Síochána it should be kept, just the same as if it were made between one country and another.  I think the Minister and the Government have at least learned that lesson, because their attempt to break those bargains was a costly affair for the State.  If one could check the increase that has taken place in superannuation, there appears to have been a very steep rise between the year 1932 and the year 1935, or between 1933 and 1935, but my recollection is <Col N="1475" /> that there is not a figure that can be easily compared in the returns of 1932.</P>
    <P>It is advisable, first of all, to examine this question of the additional cost of social services.  That £10,000,000 which the Minister takes for the expenditure under social services, on table 7, I think it is, is subject to a deduction, as I have said, from the Unemployment Relief Fund of £100,000.  He proposes to borrow a quarter of the £1,400,000 which has to be spent on unemployment relief. That means that, so far as taxation is concerned, it is not called upon to bear this £350,000.  Taking those services which are not, properly speaking, social services&mdash;Local Government, Land Commission and the Gaeltacht Services&mdash;the cost of those three amounts to £2,210,462, to be deducted in addition to £650,000 for over-estimation, leaving the net cost of social services provided for this year at £7,260,992, as compared with £3,620,009 for 1931-2.  That reduction for overestimation is made in the same proportion by which the Minister reduced his £35,000,000.  The excess expenditure on social services now provided for and to be paid for as compared with 1931-2 is, therefore, £3,600,000. The money that the Minister is getting in taxation, together with the savings, amounts to over £9,000,000. There is, therefore, a sum of over £5,000,000 to be accounted for.</P>
    <P>We are not disputing that the Minister is spending&mdash;we know that he is. I read out on the last day the various increases that had taken place under Votes that could not properly be alleged to be social services.  Going further into the list of employees of the State&mdash;civil servants, Post Office officials, Guards, etc., we find that there has been a decrease in certain Departments of 129, but an increase in all the other Departments of 5,100, leaving a net increase in the personnel of 4,971.  That is a very steep increase. Some of it, it is true, is due to the social services the Minister spoke of. For example, in connection with unemployment insurance and assistance, the number has gone up from 284 to <Col N="1476" /> 1,116, an increase in personnel of 832. The number employed in the Post Office has gone up by 836.  I take it there is value in respect of any increase in the personnel there&mdash;that it is not a cost on the State.  The Minister will find that in the course of his Second Reading speech he made reference to the personnel of the Guards. He said that he did not think the Gárda numbers had increased by more than 3 per cent.  Speaking from recollection, and I think I am fairly correct, the figures for 1931-32 were 5,433 Guards, and for last year 6,000, which is a very much larger increase than 3 per cent.  It is almost four times 3 per cent.; it certainly is 10 per cent. of an increase.  These are the headings in respect of which one would have expected to see some economy made.  For many years we listened to criticism in connection with the cost of the Guards and of the Army; but the bulk sum has increased in both cases.</P>
    <P>There would be a certain satisfaction in connection with this Budget if it were balanced.  In my view, it is not balanced.  Last year's Budget was not balanced; neither was the previous year's Budget balanced.  We should like to hear from the Minister, in the course of his observations in connection with the Final Stage of this Bill, what answer there is in respect of that. That is a matter that vitally affects the credit of the State.  Even members of the Minister's own Party, however anxious they may be for the success of Government policy, if questioned by intending investors, in the event of a loan being floated, as to how we have balanced our accounts in the last three years, are bound in conscience to say that we have not balanced them.  The Minister knows quite well what the result of such an admission would be and how damaging to the credit of the State, State.  Apart altogether from the question of the credit of the State, if we never had to go into the public market to borrow money, it is the Minister's responsibility and our responsibility to see that the Budget is balanced each year.  Once in a while, through accident or some untoward circumstances, the Budget in a particular year may be unbalanced, but <Col N="1477" /> to have three years in succession with an unbalanced Budget is not to the credit of the State, or to the credit of the Ministry, or to the credit of the Oireachtas.  I regret, therefore, that it is our duty to vote against this Bill.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the Minister might answer a point.  Deputy Cosgrave has just compared the number of Guards in the year 1931-2 with the number estimated for this year.  Does the number estimated for this year include the 220 mentioned by the Minister for Justice in dealing with his Estimate?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like the Deputy to fall into the same sort of error as Deputy Cosgrave.  The Deputy is aware that the figures which were given in the Book of Estimates for last year were given for the purpose of comparison only, to show the maximum expenditure which might take place on the Gárda rank and file.  It does not necessarily follow that there are 6,000 Guards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that altogether there are to be 220 added to the strength, so to speak, and possibly the number that might be recruited to fill certain vacancies would amount to another 60 or something like that, but the main increase stands.  I do not intend to deal with the point that was adequately dealt with by Deputy Cosgrave both on the last occasion and on this occasion, namely, the alleged excuse for the immense increase in expenditure that has taken place&mdash;the pretence that the great bulk of that particular <Col N="1478" /> expenditure is due to social services. That pretence has been sufficiently exposed by the leader of the Opposition. I put it to the House, and I put it to the Minister, and I think the country ought to ask, is it getting any reasonable value for the huge increase in expenditure?  For instance, is it getting any reasonable value for the additional number of people who have been taken on in administration? Deputy Cosgrave pointed out that there is a net increase of something like 4,900 in the personnel of the administration of this State.  I think it is the duty of the Government at last to face this problem of the continued increase in the personnel of the administration of the State.  Have they given to the State and to the people any additional advantages?  What has the country to show in the way of increased productive wealth as a result of almost 5,000 additional people in the personnel of the administration of the State?  What has the Government to show in any important direction in return for the increased expenditure in this State?</P>
      <P>As was pointed out repeatedly from these benches, and always ignored I must say by the Government, these Budget charges are only portion&mdash;a major portion, undoubtedly, but still not a complete account &mdash; of the burdens placed on industry and on the people by the policy of the present Government.  As we pointed out on several occasions there are burdens placed on individuals, on employers, on industry, and on the ordinary consumers that are not any longer mentioned in the Budget.  Therefore, we are all the more entitled again to ask: Has the country anything to set off in the way of advantages at all comparable to the burdens that the policy of the present Government has put on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does anybody pretend that Government employment of 5,000 people, extra to the numbers employed when they came into office, is a contribution that has increased the productive capacity of the country as a whole?  I do not want now to indicate how the principal industry has suffered under their policy&mdash;we have repeatedly dealt with <Col N="1479" /> that&mdash;but taking all types of production, the older industries and the new industries and agriculture, is there a sufficient return either for the expenditure or for the increased personnel for which the Government has been responsible?  That question needs only to be asked to be answered.  At the present day very few people have any doubt as to what the answer should be, but I was hoping that the Government was waking up to the importance, if not of solving questions of this kind, at least of facing them, and seeing that they were there.</P>
    <P>I spoke of increased burdens.  Very few days pass that some additional burden is not put on the people.  We spent some hours yesterday discussing another measure&mdash;the in many ways very absurd and costly Anti-Air Raid Bill&mdash;to put increased burdens on them, and again only portion of it will be shown in the Estimate.  A certain proportion must be borne by the local authorities and, in that way, the Government shovels a certain amount of its responsibility from the taxpayers to the ratepayers who, in many cases, are the same people.  But apart from that, the measure that we were discussing yesterday&mdash;and it is typical of Government policy&mdash;was putting new burdens on industry.  Not merely is the expense of the new measure for protection against air attack to be partly borne by the Government, and partly borne by the local authority, but portion is to be borne by industry.  Is that a method of helping industry?  I think it is quite typical of Government policy that, at the moment when owing to the condition, for instance, of the railways they have to appoint a commission to attempt a solution of the very difficult problem of transport, another Minister comes to this House and proposes to put additional burdens on the railways for anti-air raid precautions. That is what, among other things, we were doing yesterday.</P>
    <P>It is the same all through.  Additional burdens are being put on, and the House must ask itself if we are eating, as we are, into our reserves, where ultimately is the money to come from for social services?  We may, as one <Col N="1480" /> Deputy on the Government Benches put it on one occasion not very long ago, be able for awhile to live on the accumulated capital of the past.  But is that good policy?  Is there any indication that the increased expenditure by the Government, and the increased personnel of Government employees, have led to an increase in the productive capacity of the country? There was a time when it seemed rather clear&mdash;it was rather bruited abroad by some of their more indiscreet followers&mdash;when it looked as if the Government had deliberately set out to interfere as much as possible with private employers and to substitute for them either State employment or State controlled employment, i.e., directly or indirectly controlled.  I had hoped that that particular phase had passed away, but when we look at the present Finance Bill and the present proposals for taxation we must ask ourselves whether ultimately the aim is not, or if not the aim, the result will not be a gradual substitution of the public employer, namely the State, for the private employer.  Is that the policy of the Government, deliberate seven years ago, now again adopted in order to get over their immediate difficulties in the vain attempt to what they call balance the Budget?  Is it their settled policy or, to use favourite words of the Minister, their &ldquo;considered&rdquo; policy, to interfere with and to put as many difficulties as possible in the way of employment by private employers?  Looking at the general financial policy of the Government for a number of years and especially at the proposal before us this year it is very hard to avoid the conclusion that such is the aim of the Government, or at least that such will be the result of their policy.</P>
    <P>There was a time when the man who is mainly responsible for Government policy put before the people as the idea that we might have to aim at what he described as the hair-shirt policy.  We do not hear that spoken of any longer.  But would not that be the result of Government policy, or to change the metaphor, is not that the goal to which the Government policy is leading?  Is there not bound to be, as a result of the ridiculous policy of <Col N="1481" /> the Government in the way of expenditure and the corresponding increase in taxation, whether concealed or confessed, a considerable lowering of the standard of life of the population as a whole?  Is not that inevitable?  It may be cloaked for a short time by the mere fact of the expenditure, but if we are eating into our reserves instead of increasing our productive wealth, then the result is inevitable and combined with other portions of Government policy it is extremely difficult to avoid the conclusion that the result will be to reduce this country to the level of some of the poorest peasant countries in Europe.  At least we have the advantage that up to the present we have escaped that particular fate.  There is no more talk now about that celebrated hair-shirt policy, and I gather from the tone of the Minister's speech in introducing the Budget a certain amount of hope that that policy had been abandoned.  But when we turn from the tone of the speech to the actual proposals it is very hard to find justification for that particular hope.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave referred to the increase in the number of Guards.  What is the necessity for that?  It is the boast of the Government&mdash;we need not ask now whether it is an unfounded boast&mdash;that the country was never so peaceful.  I wonder, therefore, what is the justification for this particular increase in the number of the Guards. Why is it, with what the Government claim to be an increase in the peaceful attitude of the people of this country, that it has been found impossible to make savings in one of the services that had always been singled out by the present Government, when they were on these benches, as a service on which savings could be made?  The other great service was the Army, and this year there has been what we consider, and what the country considers, quite an unjustifiable increase in the expenditure on that service&mdash;pure waste.  Even yesterday we were discussing some of that increase and the laying of a certain portion of that burden on the shoulders of the local authorities.  They were brought into the Bill merely to secure that they <Col N="1482" /> would bear a share of the burden.  We had what might have been a simple measure made complicated, and to a large extent inoperative, so far as useful results are concerned, in order to bring in the local authorities.  The only justification the Minister for Defence really had for bringing in the local authorities into that Bill was that they could be saddled with responsibility for a considerable amount of the expenditure.</P>
    <P>It is just like that right through.  The taxpayer has been thrown more or less as a shuttlecock between the local authority and the central authority, and the aim of the Minister for Finance is to unload as much as possible on to the shoulders of the local authority.  Whether the burden is to be borne by the local authority or the central authority, the taxpayer has to meet it, just as he has to meet the various concealed taxes that are put on essential commodities.  The mere fact that they do not appear in the Budget is not proof that the ordinary housewife has not to pay them when she goes out to purchase sugar and other such commodities.  The burden is there, and the whole story is the heaping of burden after burden on the people, not staying to think whither that is going to lead.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to address his mind to that problem.  It was put up to him very strongly from his own side of the House.  It is not a matter that ought to be a Party question; it is a thing that affects the future welfare of the country, and the Minister for Finance must be alive to the importance of facing that particular question.</P>
    <P>Year after year, since this Government came into office, we have had increasing expenditure.  Has there been, through these years, a corresponding increase in the capacity of the people to bear that expenditure? Is it not a fact that it is becoming more and more difficult to hit on expedients to find that money?  As Deputy Childers pointed out here, and as we have always argued from this side of the House, the income-tax undoubtedly first hits the person with the large income, but it is bound to go down and to affect employment. <Col N="1483" /> There, I think, Deputy Childers was on perfectly sound ground.  He made an appeal to the Minister for Finance to mend his ways, and I hope an appeal coming from that side of the House will be listened to, because it is an appeal that ought to be listened to.</P>
    <P>We have certain industries here, and I suggest that the Government should put themselves the question seriously: is the best way to help those industries by means of continual subsidy and continual interference, or by a reduction in the cost of the raw material? Would they be helped better by a removal of hindrances?  Undoubtedly, a certain amount of subsidising and protection by means of tariffs is necessary, but is it not time the Government asked themselves whether they are not going altogether too far in that direction, and whether you can run a country for any reasonable length of time with a policy of having to subsidise and protect everything?  Even the main industry is being subsidised.  If you have to subsidise every industry, the question must arise where ultimately are the subsidies and the other forms of help to come from?  It is time the Government faced that particular matter.</P>
    <P>Can we, as a House, justify the passing of a measure of this kind without being able to show that the country is getting value for it?  Is it getting value for the immense additional sums in the way of open and concealed taxes that are being heaped on by this Government? Is there a sufficient return in that respect shown even by Government figures?  Has there ever been serious consideration, not of the number of people put into new industries, but of the number of people working as a whole, taking into account the number who have had to leave this country as a result of not being able to find work in it?  Is it any tribute to the success of Government policy in dealing with unemployment that there is a sum of £1,500,000 put down in the Estimate for relief works for the present year?  Have we not reached the position in which, apparently, this is a perpetual charge?  That was, more or less, the position which was acknowledged by the Minister a couple <Col N="1484" /> of years ago.  That being so, what justification is there for borrowing any portion of that sum?  Apparently it is a thing that is not going to be diminished; on the contrary, it will be increased.</P>
    <P>This year, in order to balance the Budget, and not because there was any increased employment, a certain sum was taken off the amount that was to be devoted to relief works. Apparently, the necessity for spending that money in the way of giving employment is still there.  Has the unemployment problem been dealt with?  There is not even a pretence of dealing with it.  Whether you look at the productive capacity of the country, or the problem of unemployment with which the Government were going to deal, you still have a tremendous lot of lee-way to be made up.  You have had a distinct deterioration in the productive capacity of the country, you have made no sufficient inroad into the problem of unemployment, and yet you are spending this immense amount of money extra and you have 5,000 people extra to help you to spend it.  For these reasons, apart from those we have already dealt with in previous discussions on the Budget, we feel that the Finance Bill ought not to be passed by this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one phase of this matter that, perhaps, is not sufficiently borne in mind, and that is to what extent the imposition of taxes and the increased expenditure generally have affected the lives of the citizens of this State generally.  In a big industrial centre, such as the City of Dublin, which, perhaps, has not felt the effects of the economic crisis as much as other parts of the country, it may not be as apparent as in other places.  One has to get into close touch with the main industry of this country, which is agriculture, in order to realise fully the effect of the Government policy and Government expenditure in this State.  One remarkable statement in the report of the Banking Commission struck me&mdash;as I have no doubt it struck other Deputies here&mdash;and that was that one of the reasons, or perhaps the principal <Col N="1485" /> reason, why we were able so successfully to get over the effects of the economic war, was because the number of farmers who conducted their business in this country without paid labour was altogether beyond the proportion of such farmers in other countries.  Speaking from memory, I think that we have something like 350,000 farmers in this country working their farms without paid labour, and that we have the comparatively small number of 50,000 farmers employing labour.  Now, the effect of taxes and increased expenditure, generally, has been that the 50,000 farmers who were employing labour have had, unfortunately, to restrict their own expenditure, with a consequent effect on employment, and, of the huge number of smaller farmers in this country, who work their farms without paid labour, it must be said that it was they who felt the real pinch of the economic crisis; it was they who had to tighten their belts, and it was they who had to bear the brunt of the situation and who, in reality, were the sufferers, the silent sufferers, as a result of the policy of the Government and of the tremendous increase in expenditure that we have had in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, in this connection, one has to refer to the number of people who emigrated from this State within the last seven or eight years.  Why did they emigrate, and from what class did they come?  They emigrated in order to try to better their conditions, and they came mainly from the class of small farmers to which I have referred.  They were the unpaid workers in this State, who were content to remain unpaid, or practically unpaid, so long as their people could conduct their little farms with some degree of comfort and so long as they could get a square meal, and, perhaps, a packet of cigarettes at the end of the week.  When these silent sufferers, as I have called them, began to feel the pinch so intensely that they could not provide even the meagre comforts that their children were in the habit of getting, it was only natural to expect that these children would say to themselves that it was time to look somewhere else, and they did look somewhere <Col N="1486" /> else and came up either to Dublin or some other industrial centre in this country, vainly looking for employment, or else went to some other country where they could get it.  That is one of the main consequences of what I might call the lamentable extravagance of Government finance during the last seven or eight years.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made here to the increase so far as administration is concerned.  There has been a huge increase in the numbers concerned with administration in this country, and I think that most of us&mdash;and particularly those engaged in the industry of agriculture&mdash;feel that, perhaps, we have a little too much administration. There have been additions to the numbers of officials, here, there and everywhere, and we all feel that business has been hampered, almost, by the number of officials.  Take the case of the ordinary working farmer who is struggling to exist under the most adverse circumstances.  He is hounded by weed inspectors and warble fly inspectors.</P>

      <P>My main object was to make the point, which, possibly, may not be apparent, although it ought to be, that the policy of increased taxes and increased expenditure is falling in this country on the people who are least able to bear these increases&mdash;the people who, mind you, are perhaps the least able to show any apparent effects of the consequences of this policy, because it is really the small farmer who is least able to express himself.  He has, perhaps, many advocates to try to express his condition, here and there amongst the Parties in this House&mdash;in fact, I should say, amongst all Parties in the House, because I do not think that any particular Party in the House regards this matter of the condition of the farmers as its own particular province. I think that every Deputy in the House knows as well as I do that it is amongst that class, if one were to get down to their homes, that one would find the real and actual effects of the policy of the Government in the last five or six years.  In view of these considerations, I think it is time for us to take full stock of the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister told us, after he had been in office for a couple of years, that he had reached a position of normalcy in budgetary matters, but then we found that normalcy meant that the amount of taxation taken out of the pockets of the people of this country openly was going to be kept as big as it was at that particular time, after the addition of £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 to taxation, but that while open taxation was going to be kept like that, the result of the policy of the Government was going to be hidden away in other directions, and that another £5,000,000 or so was going to be taken out of the pockets of the people in additional taxation unaccounted for, you might say, in the books of the community, but taken out of their pockets over the counters in the country as a result of the increased price of bacon, the increased price of flour, and the increased price of butter, and so on.  So that, not only were the people, in what the Minister was pleased to call times of normalcy, going <Col N="1488" /> to pay open taxation, as high as they had to pay in the early days of the economic war, but the addition to the open taxation of that time was going to be doubled in a hidden kind of way.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bennett asks the Minister if he has at all considered what the effect on the people of the country has been as a result of that increased burden of taxation.  We want to know from the Minister here, when he is so satisfiedly placing this blister&mdash;this increased financial blister&mdash;on the country, does he realise that the population of this country fell by 30,000 in the last two years?  Does he ask himself why?  Does he realise, as Deputy Dillon pointed out to him the other day, that the external assets of the people of the country fell by £10,000,000 in the last two years?  Does he understand that the savings of the ordinary people, as expressed in the amount of money put into Savings Certificates and the Post Office Savings Bank, have substantially fallen during the last two years?  In the year 1936, £975,000 was the additional amount put into the Post Office Savings Bank and Savings Certificates by the ordinary people who accumulate their savings in that way. Last year that sum had fallen to £547,000.  That is, the savings of the people had fallen by £400,000 on a previous figure of £975,000.  Before the country became afflicted by the type of taxation and the type of policies that have been pursued since 1931, the annual savings of the people, as reflected in Post Office deposits and in Savings Certificates, were £1,340,000. That, I say, has now decreased to £574,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are particularly concerned with is the latter day trend of such things as show the effect on the people of the country of these policies and as show the circumstances of the people who are supposed to pay this great additional burden of taxation.  I have told the Minister already that he is not going to get it, and that particularly, he is not going to realise his expectations in the matter of income-tax. The Minister cannot get it and he knows he cannot get it in a situation which shows that the population of the country fell by 30,000 in <Col N="1489" /> the last year.  We had a brochure published the other day showing the trend of unemployment in 1938 as compared with 1937.  On page 22 of that document we read in paragraph 2 that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;as regards unemployment the number of persons on the live register was on the average greater in 1938 than in 1937.  The increase was due mainly to decreased employment on employment schemes and in certain protected industries.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Let us take a look at the last two years.  If we take the early months of this year and compare them with the corresponding months of two years previously, what is the trend?  Deputy Bennett thinks that Dublin may not be so badly hit.  I dealt with Dublin a short time ago.  Dublin has been very seriously hit.  I think the figures I gave were that the addition to the number of persons in receipt of unemployment assistance in the last few years has been on the average about 5,000 per month.  Let us take the country as a whole for two years.  The number of persons dependent on unemployment assistance in May, 1939, had gone up by 11,031, an increase of about 18 per cent. as compared with the number in the same month a few years ago. For the month of April the increase was 15,000, or 25 per cent., as compared with a few years ago and for March the number was 13,272 or 22.5 per cent. as compared with two years ago.  For February the number was 13,540 or an addition of 23.5 per cent. as compared with two years ago. That is, taking the last four months, not only has the number of persons who are dependent on unemployment assistance for a living gone up, but the number of persons in receipt of home assistance showed an increase for every single month for the first four months of this year.  There were about 2,000 more receiving home assistance than during the corresponding months two years before.</P>
    <P>The Minister has all these symptoms in front of him, symptoms showing that you had a lesser quantity of potatoes and a lesser quantity of cabbage grown in the country, that you had less bacon consumed in the country as compared with a few years <Col N="1490" /> before and that there was a substantial decrease in the consumption of bread. It is in these circumstances that the Minister places a Bill before this country upon which Deputy Cosgrave commented so pointedly to-day.  How long does the Minister think it is going to last?  When are the Minister and his colleagues going to realise that the more he piles on taxation of this kind on the people&mdash;and he does it not only openly in the Budget here but hiddenly in the way in which I describe, on flour, bacon and everything else like that&mdash;the nearer to breaking-point the strain on the people approaches?  From every place to which the grabbing hand of the tax collector can be turned by the Minister for Finance, something is being extracted.  Local authorities are being forced into the grabbing business. Since the Government came into office the total amount of money collected in rates throughout the country as a whole has gone up by £1,172,000 or 25 per cent.  That is only up to 1938.  If we are to judge by the bill presented by the county councils to the ratepayers last year, then the increase is very substantial because, while for the year 1937-8 the county councils presented their ratepayers with a bill that was 26 per cent. greater than before the Minister's policies began to operate, for the year 1938-9 there was another £250,000 added to the bill.</P>
    <P>From every direction, as I say, to which the clutching hand of the tax-gatherer can go, money is being taken from the people as a result of the policies pursued by the Government. That is happening while the external resources of the people have gone down, while their savings have gone down and while the number of people themselves have gone down.  Judging by the conditions disclosed in the last two years their position is getting gradually worse and the burden that is put upon them this year is one that cannot be borne.  I wonder has the Minister any conception of what is going to be the result of that?  The Minister must know that, when we read here that the increase in unemployment was due mainly to decreased employment on employment schemes and in certain protected industries, <Col N="1491" /> there were fewer industrial concerns working in 1938 than in 1937.  He must know that there was considerably less employment in 1938 than in 1937.  If the figures that are available for registered unemployed at the present time are any index as to the position of agriculture this year, there is no more employment in agriculture this year than last year.  There probably is less.  But, on the employment side, the report says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;As regards employment, the volume of employment as indicated by the net contribution incomes of both National Health Insurance and Unemployment Insurance Funds was somewhat greater in 1938 than in 1937...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;somewhat greater.  Again, it is the present-day tendency that is important. &ldquo;Employment is somewhat greater.&rdquo;  I doubt very much if it was but, at any rate, I have pointed out before and I want it to be more and more understood, that so far from increasing the annual increment in the total volume of employment in this country during their period of office, as compared with the annual increment in the increase in the volume of employment before they came into office, the Fianna Fáil policy has reduced it. Between 1926 and 1931 the annual increase in the volume of employment, as measured by the standard they take themselves, was measurable at 11,400 full-time employed persons, when there were no elaborate relief schemes going on, and when there was no tremendously big expenditure of money on building that, as an average, over the last few years, has increased the number of persons employed in building by 8,000 or even 10,000 persons a year. For the last few years there was a considerable amount of employment on relief schemes.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Between the years 1926 and 1931 the average annual increment in the volume of employment in the country could be expressed as full-time employment <Col N="1492" /> over the whole year for 11,400 persons. That average annual increment was absolutely reduced when the Fianna Fáil policies began to operate, in spite of all that has been said and argued and driven home about the wonderful work-producing policies that they had adopted.  The average annual increment in the volume of employment given between 1931 and 1938, expressed in terms of full-time employment for a certain number of persons over the whole year was 10,571, less than the average annual increment before they came into office, in spite of the fact that every year for the last few years an additional 8,000 or more persons were employed in house building than were in the years 1929, 1930 and 1931; in spite of the fact that an average of 20,000 persons a month, over the last two years, at any rate, were employed on relief schemes and employed on relief schemes in such a way that they reflected themselves in the National Health Insurance payments by a greater volume than they normally would, because of the rotation schemes and because of the fact that National Health Insurance cards were stamped for a very big percentage of them for a part of a week and did not reflect a whole week's work.  However, that is the position.  But, under this statement here that as regards employment the volume of employment as indicated by the net contribution incomes of both the National Health Insurance and Unemployment Insurance Funds was somewhat greater in 1938 than in 1937, is hidden the fact that the average annual increment in the volume of employment has practically completely stopped in the year 1938 as against 1937 when tested by the volume of the amount of money paid into the National Health Insurance Fund, and that instead of 10,000 additional persons getting full-time employment as an increase over the year before, the increase that you do find in the figures is an increase of 1,000.  That increase is entirely negligible and shows that, having reduced the natural tendency to increase employment every year, one after another, they have now come to a full stop and <Col N="1493" /> that, just as they came into office with the rising population and now they have a falling one, the population having fallen by 30,000 in the last few years, they came into office on an increasing average in the volume of employment and now they have brought it to a full stop, having reduced it over a few years.  It is with that full stop that we get not only the bill for taxation we have got for the last few years but we get an additional bill.</P>
      <P>The question was asked here: &ldquo;Is the Government going to be the employer of the future?&rdquo;  The Government cannot be the Government of the future because no Government can do for a people the ordinary work of the people any more than a Government can keep our consciences for us, or can rear our families for us.  They cannot do the work of the nation.  The only thing they can do is to endeavour to create circumstances in which ordinary employers and ordinary workmen, working together, can by co-operating do the work of the nation. The figures that have been disclosed for 1937 show that the increase in the volume of employment indicated by the Census of Production figures for that year was increase in employment given either through Government Departments or on relief works in one way or another.  Out of an increased number of 7,324 persons, I think it is, who were employed, according to the Census of Production, only nine of these were persons additionally employed outside Government employment. If that was the position in 1937 over 1936 the Minister has probably a shrewd idea that the position was worse in 1938.  It certainly was worse in the City of Dublin and if any increase can be shown any place in 1938 over 1937 it certainly is not either in agriculture or in industry or in any other way except employment in some Government Department or other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are indications of the general condition at that time of the people who are now being presented with this bill.  This bill cannot be paid by people in the condition shown by these symptoms. The other day a member of the <Col N="1494" /> Deputy's Party gave them 12 months or 24 months to wake up.  It will not be time enough to wake up in 24 months: it will not be time enough to wake up in 12.  There is an Agricultural Commission finding out for the Government what they ought to be doing in regard to agriculture; there is a Transport Commission finding out for the Government what they ought to be doing in the line of transport; there is a Housing Commission finding out for the Government what they ought to be doing in housing; and there is a Drainage Commission finding out for the Government what they ought to be doing to provide employment of one kind or another.  If the Government is waiting until they hear from these commissions as to what they ought to be thinking about, then it will be too late to tackle the situation, and I do not know what may happen to the unfortunate people who have to live in the meantime.  Such responsibilities as the Minister bears and requires money to carry out cannot be borne, because he cannot get money out of the people in these conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Fianna Fáil came into office we were told that this country was overtaxed by £2,000,000, and that one of the first problems that they, as a Government, would be prepared to tackle was the reduction of taxation.  How was that promise carried out?  Actually, for this present year, when you take general taxation and local taxation into account, the taxation that has to be borne by the general taxpayers and the ratepayers has increased by £11,000,000.  To my mind, that is an unbearable burden on the taxpayers and ratepayers of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said about the unfortunate condition of agriculture.  It has been pointed out by Deputies from all sides of the House that agriculture is in a very distressful condition and requires immediate and urgent attention by the Government.  To my mind, we must admit that the economic war was mainly the cause of that condition, but side by side with that cause and coupled with that cause, is the high burden of taxation and overhead <Col N="1495" /> charges that our agricultural community has to bear.  These are the causes and one would expect that since the London Agreement there might be indications of recovery.  There have been indications of slight recovery, but there should be better indications of a better recovery; and one of the reasons, to my mind, why the recovery is not more pronounced is the fact that the burdens imposed on agriculture are beyond the capacity of the people to bear.</P>
    <P>Agricultural output in 1931 was £62,000,000 and that fell to £47,000,000 in 1937&mdash;the last year for which we have figures available.  During that period, as has been pointed out here in this House, production went up in most countries, especially in most of the countries that are competitors of ours in the British market.  Denmark and Holland increased their output enormously, as also did New Zealand and Northern Ireland.  Government Ministers have been making the excuse that world conditions are responsible for the present condition of agriculture in this country.  Do they realise that, when there was that enormous fall here in agricultural production, from £62,000,000 to £47,000,000, at the same time in Northern Ireland the output was increased from £10,000,000 to £16,000,000, and the pig population of Northern Ireland increased enormously during the same period, while our output here in this country in pigs, poultry and live stock was reduced? Although we had a fallen output and a reduced income, we had an enormous increase in taxation.  How have we been living during that period?  Has the country been economically sound during that period and can it continue to live as we have been living for the past two years?  Have we been living on our actual production during that period?  I believe we have not.  Any prosperity that we had was a form of artificial prosperity.  There are indications at the present time that the sources of that prosperity are gradually drying up.  Taking the Estimate that came before this House for different Departments, we voted £1,500,000 for the &ldquo;dole&rdquo; direct to the Department <Col N="1496" /> of Industry and Commerce, while for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Department of Finance there was a further £1,500,000 for employment relief schemes and minor relief schemes.  To that we can add approximately £500,000, being contributions from local authorities.  That is £3,500,000.  Taking the amount of capital that is put into housing, water and sewerage schemes, you might practically double that sum, making a sum of approximately £6,000,000 or £7,000,000 that we have been spending annually here for the last few years. While there may be much good done in the way of social benefit for our people through these schemes, I submit that that type of scheme is non-productive work and that it is a heavy drain on the resources of this country. To embark on that type of social work the country should be in an economically sound position and there should be increased production to offset the demand on our income for that sort of social non-productive work.</P>
    <P>Examining the £1,500,000 direct &ldquo;dole&rdquo; and the £1,500,000 to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Department of Finance, that sum of money&mdash; at least £3,500,000&mdash;that is being spent on work that is non-productive, is an enormous drain on the resources of the country.  That sum alone is an indication of the enormous burden that has been placed on the people generally and on the agricultural community in particular.  After all, it is on agriculture that we must rely to balance our imports.</P>
    <P>This bill, as has already been pointed out by Deputy Mulcahy, is altogether beyond the capacity of our people to bear.  I think it is bound to show a diminishing return.  The whole thing is a reaction on our production and a reaction on our credit.  One of the most pressing needs of the agricultural community at the present time is credit and we have&mdash;as has been pointed out during the discussion on the Land Bill during the last couple of weeks&mdash;the necessity of establishing some form of credit for agriculture.  The only means of establishing that form of credit is by security of tenure on the land and to make that a collateral security for <Col N="1497" /> credit.  Again, so far as we can judge, the Government intend to destroy that as a means of credit, although I admit that the Minister for Finance said he believed that the establishment of security of tenure was very important as a means of securing credit for the farmers.</P>
    <P>What attempt is being made to help agriculture?  Does the Minister believe that under present Government expenditure this country can continue?  Must it not be admitted that if we want to improve the present position and to carry on at all, we must improve and increase profitable production and that the only way to improve production is to encourage private enterprise? Will this Bill have the effect of encouraging private enterprise?  Will the increase in income-tax encourage private enterprise?  Does the Minister not realise that it is going to have the very opposite effect and does the country not know it, too?  The sooner the Minister and the Government waken up to a realisation of the real position and face up to their duties and responsibilities, with a determination to come to the assistance of agriculture, not by subsidising it, but by relieving those engaged in it of the heavy burdens of taxation placed on them at present, the better.  Until that is done, there is no hope for the country, or for agriculture, and no hope of agriculture competing against Denmark, Holland and Northern Ireland in the only market which we now all agree is available to this country.  It has been pointed out that Deputy Childers has given the Government one more year to face up to their responsibilities in this matter.  I do not think there is much time to be wasted, and I think it is going to be a close shave in any case.  I believe that something should be done, and done immediately.  This Bill is not at all in the interests of the country, and, as far as this Party is concerned we must oppose it.</P>

      <P>We are treated to-day to an examination of the tables which I circulated for the convenience of Deputies and for the better elucidation of the Budget when I made the financial statement.  In regard to that, we were told that a comparison was made between the revenue collected&mdash;that was the word used&mdash;in the year 1931-32 as compared with the revenue which we hope to collect in the current year, 1939-40.  Deputy Cosgrave knows as well as I do that the phrase &ldquo;revenue collected&rdquo; is commonly and properly applicable only to the proceeds of taxation, and, bearing this in mind, and turning back to the year 1931-32, we find that the actual revenue <Col N="1499" /> collected during that year was not £25,496,000, as Deputy Cosgrave suggested, but £21,286,000.</P>

      <P>That was the actual amount collected by the Revenue Commissioners and the other tax-collecting agencies in 1931-32.  For this year, we estimate to collect £26,485,000.  It is true that there is a figure of non-tax revenue, revenue derived from investments, interest upon Government funds invested in various undertakings and concerns, and I am glad to say that, due to good management of these Government investments, there will be a considerable increase in the non-tax revenue for the current year compared with 1931-32.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I am coming to is that Deputy Cosgrave has challenged Table 8 on the ground that the figures given there for the social services proper exaggerate the actual expenditure which we propose to incur upon these services.  And upon what grounds?  On the grounds that we include within the category of social services proper the expenditure which it is proposed to make upon the Land Commission services and upon the Gaeltacht services.  I think the Deputy does not do himself justice, or, at least, I would say that he does not do the intelligence of those who have to criticise his statement justice, because, after all, what is the purpose of the Land Commission?  The main object of the Land Commission is the same as that purpose which was sought to be served when the State established the old age pensions scheme, the widows' and orphans' pension scheme or any one of these public services, the <Col N="1500" /> primary purpose of which is to relieve poverty and unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Including the halved annuities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of which is to relieve poverty and unemployment and to improve the condition of the mass of the people. Everybody knows that the original purpose and the present purpose of the Land Commission is to remedy the grave social problems of poverty, unemployment and congestion arising from the maldistribution of land in private ownership and the natural poverty of certain large and densely populated districts.  That was the original purpose for which the Land Commission was established and that is its primary purpose and the principal objective to-day.  Therefore, because it exists to relieve, as I have said, the grave social problems which arise from unemployment, maldistribution of land and over-population of certain poor lands, it is primarily a social service.  The Gaeltacht Services, Deputy Cosgrave says, should not be included.  The Deputy also takes exception to the fact that we include within this category of social services the expenditure which we propose to make upon Gaeltacht Services.  Is Deputy Cosgrave serious in that?  For what end are we trying to develop the rural industries in the Gaeltacht areas, if it is not with a view to relieving the endemic poverty in those areas which, as the Deputy knows well, were formerly classified as congested districts? The Gaeltacht Services, through which it is proposed to deal with this problem of endemic poverty in these congested districts, are as much social services as unemployment assistance or the provision of milk for the children of necessitous families.  It is quite clear that the moment we examine Deputy Cosgrave's objection to include the Land Commission in the Gaeltacht Services, we find that that objection is not well founded.  The figures which I gave and which show that, as far as social services are concerned, the expenditure which is proposed in this current year, 1939-40, <Col N="1501" /> £5,570,000, did not appear in the year 1931-32.</P>

      <P>The figure which I am giving for expenditure in the current financial year is naturally the estimate.  In the figure which I am proposing to give of revenue in 1931-32, I am dealing with the actually realised position, with the expenditure which took place on the services within this category, and with the revenue actually collected that year.  How did tax revenue for the year 1931-32 compare with our estimate of the taxes levied for the current year?  It was £5,199,000 below our estimate for the tax revenue for the current year.  The expenditure upon social services in 1931-32 was £5,570,000 below our estimate of expenditure for the present year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that, but all in good time.  Therefore, though I have never said it, it could be shown that a large part of the increase in taxation is practically traceable to the fact that we have expanded social services. These are not the only services that have been expanded.  The Deputy said that we appropriated for the ordinary purpose of public services certain sums of money which were formerly paid over to Great Britain.  A sum of £2,999,000 was the actual figure which was collected formerly as land annuities and paid over to Great Britain.  We will make it the round figure of £3,000,000.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">

      <P>Very well, but for the purpose of more easy mental calculation we will make it £3,000,000, and we will proceed to see how that figure was dealt with.  We first of all halved the land annuities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, one second. We have not charged the halving of the pre-1923 land annuities as part of the social services.  I was saying that, first of all, we halved the land annuities. Dealing in round figures, that means that the farmers who are paying pre-1923 land annuities and from whom these £3,000,000 were collected for the purpose of transmitting them to Great Britain, are now allowed, at least, to retain £1,500,000.  They are £1,500,000 better off.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>For every £ which they would pay prior to January, 1932 to the Land Commission, we allowed them to keep 10/- back and we took only 10/- from them.  For what purposes did we apply it?  It is not sent across the water.  It is kept here, and Deputies will find that it is expended upon all these services which come within the category of developmental services.  In the year 1931-1932 there was spent on those services, including afforestation, agriculture, fisheries, industry and commerce and so on, £645,000.  This year we propose to spend upon those other services, including export bounties and other services for the benefit of farmers an increase roughly of £1,532,000.  There you have accounted for £1,500,000 of the pre-1923 land annuities which were collected.  I know that the Deputy will challenge me in regard to certain other matters and that in regard to unemployment assistance we are going to borrow a large proportion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>We are going to borrow a large sum.  But I would ask the Deputy to bear in mind also that <Col N="1503" /> in that service which may be regarded as similar to those which were classified as social services proper and which are mainly expenditure upon education, that there is an increase from £620,000 in 1931-32 to £3,940,000.  Not merely are we spending £1,500,000 upon developmental services; not merely are we spending £5,000,000 more upon social services proper, but we are also spending a sum of £620,000 more upon educational services.  If the Deputy cares to tot all these up I think he will see that they represent a substantial increase of over £7,100,000 spent in this year for the benefit of the people and accounting as I have said for that part of the pre-1923 land annuities and also for the fact that we have as against these increases in expenditure a corresponding economy due to the fact that we no longer pay over to Great Britain a sum of £1,152,000 in respect of R.I.C. pensions.  That is the position.  No matter how the Deputy looks at it, he will see that every penny piece of this increased expenditure has been accounted for and he will have to agree &mdash;because his votes and the votes of his Party in the House so testify&mdash; that that expenditure is justified and is for sound public purposes.  We have heard statements by Deputies like Deputy Bennett that there are too many officials.  I was not in the House but I took occasion to read the reports of the debates on the Estimates and I did not find that Deputy Bennett, on the appropriate occasion, when a suggestion might have been fruitful and beneficial to the farmer, urged that the weed inspectors might do the work of the warble-fly inspectors.  My recollection is that when these warble-fly inspectors were being first appointed no member of the Fine Gael Party, any more than a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, made a suggestion that, instead of the county councils appointing warble-fly inspectors, they should ask the weed inspectors to do the work.</P>

      <P>I have been asked as to the position regarding the Gárda Síochána.  The position is rather <Col N="1506" /> extraordinary.  Undoubtedly, the amount of the Vote has gone up.  I said, when I previously addressed myself to this question, that it had gone up not because there had been any great expansion in the strength of the Guards, but because we had inherited from our predecessors a contract which we had to honour, a contract which the Oireachtas compelled us to honour even in the days of the deepest depression &mdash;the year 1931-32.  We could not interfere with this contract of service which we had inherited from our predecessors. What do we find?  We find that in the year 1937-38 the expenditure on salaries, wages and allowances of the Gárda Síochána amounted to £1,554,000 and in the year 1931-32&mdash;I am taking the audited figures for both years&mdash;to £1,444,000, an increase of £110,000.  I made a calculation and I find that, owing to the effect of these incremental scales, the tendency is for this figure to increase at the rate of 1 per cent. per annum.  That will continue until a stable position is reached.  In the six years, therefore, between 1931-32 and 1937-38, the cost of the Gárda, due to the effect of the incremental scales established by our predecessors, would have increased at the rate of 6 per cent. If we add 6 per cent. to £1,444,000&mdash; that is to say, if we add £87,000&mdash;we get, as representing the natural cost of an unexpanded Gárda Síochána in 1937-38, on the basis of 1931-32, a figure of £1,531,000.</P>
      <P>Now mark what I have said: that if we had not brought a single man into the Gárdá Síochána between the years 1932-1938 the cost of the Gárda would have risen from £1,444,000 in 1931-32 to £1,531,000 in 1937-38.  That is to say it would have increased by £87,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>It has increased by more than that&mdash;by £110,000.  The difference in the figures between 1931-32 and 1937-38 for the salaries, wages and pay of the Gárda Síochána was £110,000 more in the latter year than it was in the former, and of that £110,000, £87,000 was due to the effect of the incremental scales.  That leaves <Col N="1507" /> us with £23,000 to be accounted for. Now, if Deputy Cosgrave's statement was founded on fact that the increase in the strength of the Gárda in the year 1937-38, or the current year because the same figures are given in the Estimates for the two years&mdash;last year and this year,&mdash;then the increased provision would have been such as would be required to cover an expansion in the personnel of the force of at least 500 officers and men, and that would have meant, on the lowest computation, that instead of there being only £23,000 to cover this increase in the personnel of the Gárda, we should have required at least £100,000.  I am bringing that out because I have got here before me the actual figures for the strength of the Gárda, officers and men at the 31st March 1932.  The total strength was 7,008 officers and men. On the 31st May of this year the total strength was 7,105 persons, so that so far from the strength of the Gárda having increased by 500 officers and men, as Deputy Cosgrave has suggested, it has, in fact, increased by only 97 officers and men.</P>

      <P>They are not wrong, and that is the provision that I am asking the House to make, as it may be necessary, and as we asked them to make it last year.  We believe in providing a margin for contingencies. It is because of that fact, notwithstanding that during many financial years the Exchequer had to meet unforeseen demands upon it, and notwithstanding anything that the Deputy has said in this House, that we were always able to balance our Budget, and not merely balance the Budget but, as one of the tables which I have had circulated shows, to make substantial investments in developmental and other services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>And if the Deputy wants to know what is being done with them he can put that question to the Minister for Justice.  Table III, which sets out the &ldquo;Financial Transactions and Cash Operations of the Exchequer for the period 1st April, 1932 to 31st March, 1939,&rdquo; shows that our investments under one head and another exceeded our Exchequer receipts by £8,617,000, and it is due to that fact that, as I pointed out at the beginning of my speech, our revenue from non-tax sources has considerably increased.</P>
      <P>I do not think there is anything more I need say in defence of the measure now before the House.  The debate upon it has been one of those rambling, discursive discussions which I think do not advance the public interest very far.  Some of the conclusions which Deputy Mulcahy likes to draw from certain published figures are not justified by the facts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not justified in giving the public the figure &mdash;and drawing the conclusion that the rate of increase in employment over the period 1931-32 to the present year was less than it was over the period 1926 to 1932.  The Deputy quoted some figures in regard to national health insurance and he knows as well as I do, and he ought to tell the public, that a large portion of the increased revenue in respect of the National Health Insurance Fund was due to the better enforcement of the National Health Insurance Acts: to the fact that people who had not been meeting their obligations under these Acts were, due to more efficient administration on the part of the Deputy's Department, now being compelled to meet their obligations. It did not mean that more people were being put into employment, but that the Deputy was making a better collection in respect of those already in employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>

      <P>I do not.  I am opening my eyes to this fact, that I am perfectly certain that the Deputy, when Minister for Local Government, and charged with the administration of National health Insurance, did tighten up that administration.  I know the Deputy believes in efficiency, and I am not going to be so unfair and so unjust to the Deputy as publicly to say that I believe that he&mdash;having been for four or five years Minister for Local Government&mdash;did not leave National Health <Col N="1511" /> Insurance in an effective position as a collecting agency.

      <P>Now, Sir, I was going to say something about a statement which was made by Deputy O'Sullivan in his speech.  We have heard a great deal about the burdens on our primary industry.  We have been told by Deputy Bennett and Deputy Hughes that agriculture is more heavily burdened than it can bear.  But we heard the Deputies' Leaders, the Deputies' Front Bench colleague, Deputy John Marcus O'Sullivan, suggesting that wealthy urban communities like that in the City of Dublin <Col N="1512" /> should be relieved of their fair proportion of the cost of their own self-defence, and that the amount of which they were relieved should be put as an added imposition upon the backs of agriculture in this country.  The difficulty about the Opposition is that they do not know on which leg they are standing.  If it is admitted that provision has to be made against contingencies, which we all hope and trust, will never arise, is it not only right that the wealthiest community in the State should bear their fair proportion of the cost?  Is it not only right that those who are remote, those who would not form a target for an enemy, those who would never be an object of an attack by an enemy, should not be asked to bear an undue proportion of the burden?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is A.R.P. against the Government we want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what Deputy O'Sullivan was looking for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember when Deputies were crying for markets of one sort or another, and when they got them they were not satisfied.  In the same way, I am perfectly satisfied that if the need for A.R.P. actually manifested itself, the Deputy would not regard it as sufficient justification for the fact that no measures had been taken that at one time he thought only A.R.P. against the Government were required.  The fact is that the House is agreed that some provision must be made for A.R.P., and the question is: where can the cost of that provision be most equitably placed?  The State is bearing a very large proportion of it&mdash;I would almost be prepared to say too large a proportion of it&mdash;and the communities which may be the primary object of attack will have to bear a certain proportion of it also.  The Government's views on that matter are before the House in a Bill, but I do not know whether or not the speech of Deputy O'Sullivan represented the views of the Opposition.  I understand that a division was challenged on this issue last night.  If so, then I take it that the policy of the Opposition is that they prefer to tax the farmers&mdash;<Col N="1513" /> that Deputy Professor O'Sullivan prefers to tax the small farmers of Kerry &mdash;in order to defend the wealthy capital of the country, rather than that the citizens of Dublin should be asked to bear their own fair and due proportion of the cost.  That is the position. This Opposition, which has been telling us during this debate about the sorry plight of agriculture, wants us to impose additional taxation upon the farmers, and particularly upon the small farmers of Kerry and the congested areas, in order that the wealthier sections of our people should be <Col N="1514" /> allowed to get off some share of the burden.</P>

The position of Uachtarán has been set up as a national institution, and I think nothing should be lightly done that would injure that institutional position.  We made it possible in our day to have an institution like it, although we did not attach the same magnitude and importance to the particular type of President that the members of the present Government do.  The members of the present Government considered that it was well worth while for this country to suffer severe losses in men and money to establish such an institution, but here we have an organ of the Press, that the Government Party have control over, within the last few days making use of the occasion of the Presidential garden party to cast ridicule on the whole thing.</P>

I say that that thing should not be allowed, and I take this opportunity to indicate the nature of the objection that I take to what has been allowed to happen, as reflecting on the Presidential position without, apparently, any rebuke or action of any kind.  I want to draw attention to it and to ask what action is going to be taken to prevent the Presidential institution being insulted or degraded.  In particular, I want to ask what steps are going to be taken by members of the Government who, as I say, considered that this country should suffer very severe losses in order to have this institution set up.  In the <i>Irish Press</i> reference is made by a writer to the presidential Garden Party.

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This is a Bill to confirm a number of orders made under the Emergency Imposition of Duties Act.  As the House is aware, orders made under that Act must be confirmed by legislation within a certain period, or they lapse.  Consequently, Bills of this character have appeared from time to time.  This one is introduced in order to confirm a number of orders now standing. Deputies who may wish to raise matters relating to any of the orders scheduled may find it more convenient to do so on the Committee Stage, when <Col N="1520" /> various points can be raised and discussed in detail.  I do not think it is necessary to deal at any great length now with the orders scheduled in the Bill.  The various changes effected by these orders are not of very great importance.  Some of the orders are, in fact, for the purpose of reducing existing duties; others make comparatively minor amendments in the scope of existing duties; one or two represent new duties.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Eireann approves of the Subsidy (Aer-Rianta, Teóranta) (No. 2) Order, 1939, made under Section 79 of the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1936 (No. 40 of 1936), by the Minister for Finance on the 14th day of June, 1939, and laid before Dáil Eireann on the 15th day of June, 1939.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the provisions of the Air Navigation and Transport Act is that an order made by the Minister for Finance concerning the annual subsidy paid to the Air Transport Company covered by that Act must be confirmed by a resolution of Dáil Eireann within a stated period.  This motion is, therefore, submitted for the approval of the Dáil.  A similar order, made last year, was approved by a similar motion.  The amount required for the purpose of the subsidy has already been voted by the Dáil in the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce. <Col N="1521" /> Last year the amount provided was £33,000.  This year the order provides for a total subsidy not exceeding £40,150.  The amount is larger this year because some extensions of the operations of the company are contemplated, and also because it is proposed to purchase new machines in connection with the extensions of the company's operations.  As the House is aware, there are, of course, two companies, Aer-Rianta, Teóranta, the National Air Transport Company, and the subsidiary to that, Aer-Lingus, Teóranta, which is operating the cross-Channel air service.</P>
    <P>The activities of the operating company, Aer-Lingus, Teóranta, show substantial increases in the course of the past year.  As compared with 1936, the number of miles flown increased from 151,000 to 385,000.  The number of passengers carried increased from 1,300 to 4,987.  The weight of goods carried increased from 6,000 lbs. avoirdupois, to 35,000 lbs. avoirdupois.  The regularity of services has increased from 90.9 to 94.2 per cent.  The figures show cause for optimism in regard to the future and they indicate that a very high standard of safety in operation and regularity in conduct has been secured by the company.</P>
    <P>The company is not, of course, making any profits.  It is not a feature of any air transport company at present that it operates without loss and most of the civil aviation companies of Europe are being conducted under Government subsidies.  The percentage of the subsidy in relation to the total receipts is not higher in this country than in other European countries and is, in fact, substantially lower than in a number of countries where civil air transport has been in operation for a longer period of time than here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The percentage of the subsidy in relation to the total receipts here in 1938-39 was 60.8; in the case of Air France it was 61.92; CzechoSlovakia, 66.97; in the case of the Polish air lines it was 70.73; the <Col N="1522" /> German air lines, 40.63; and the Belgian air lines, 34.33.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the percentage of the subsidy in relation to the total receipts.  I can give the Deputy particulars for all countries if he wishes.  In a number of European countries the transportation of mails by air has developed as a normal practice and the receipts of the air transport companies in these countries have been enhanced accordingly.  In due course the transportation of mails by air will be a normal practice here, but a beginning cannot be made until certain arrangements have been completed. As a matter of fact, it is in anticipation of such arrangements being made at a fairly early date that Aer-Lingus Teóranta, is now purchasing additional aircraft which will be necessary, of course, if the mail services by air become an established practice.</P>
      <P>The total amount I have mentioned, £40,150. has to be divided into two parts.  One part, £6,000, is a subsidy to Aer-Rianta, Teóranta, and represents practically the total outgoings of that company, which has at present no other source of revenue.  It will have in future, but at present it has no other revenue except what it gets from the Government.  The balance of the amount is required by Aer-Lingus, Teóranta, and represents the amount necessary to meet the loss in working, plus the additional expenditure contemplated during the course of the present year.</P>

      <P>In accordance with an arrangement with the Army authorities, they are being recruited from the Army Air Force.  Selected pilots from the Army Air Force are transferred <Col N="1523" /> for a time to the civil air company to test their suitability.  Very often they are found suitable, but some may be unsuitable.  If found unsuitable, they go back to the Army Air Force, so that the officers concerned are not losing anything by the experiment. One of the functions of Aer-Rianta, the major company, is to make adequate provision for the training of the personnel for all operations in connection with civil aviation.  They are making their plans for that at the moment.  It involves not merely the training of pilots, but the training of ground staffs and others who require expert knowledge in the conduct of the air service.</P>

      <P>On the section, Sir, I propose, on Report Stage, to introduce an amendment to delete Section 2.  Section 2 provides for the exclusion of Dublin City and County from the scope of the Bill, and, having fully considered the matter since the Second Reading debate, the desirability of bringing Dublin into line with the rest of the country appears to be beyond question.  As Deputies are aware, in Dublin City and County a county scheme has not been adopted under the 1923 Act, and the old code of public assistance operates in Dublin City and County with some <Col N="1524" /> special provisions provided under the Dublin Poor Relief Act of 1929.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand, Sir.  The purpose of this amendment is to clear up what is meant by the definition of &ldquo;medical assistance&rdquo; and to include something that may not be included in the section as it stands.  The Parliamentary Secretary is aware that the boards of assistance at the present time are able to give assistance in the way of optical treatment to poor law patients, when the occasion requires, and it does not appear here whether that power is still retained.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy says, the matter turns on the meaning of <Col N="1525" />&ldquo;medical assistance&rdquo;.  As I understand the meaning, and as the Parliamentary Draftsman and my legal advisers understand it, surgical treatment includes optical treatment; so that there appears to be no need to make the amendment suggested by the Deputy.  It is already included, and the powers that the boards of health have at the present time, in relation to the provision of optical treatment, will be continued under the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister may by order make regulations governing the granting of home assistance and, in particular, regulating the nature of home assistance either generally or in respect of any particular class of person, and prescribing the times and places at which and the conditions subject to which home assistance may be granted.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy sees, under Section 37 (2), the manner in which assistance may be granted will be prescribed by regulations to be made under the Act, but the insertion of this amendment in the definition clause would not serve any purpose whatsoever</P>

      <P>Would the Parliamentary Secretary give us the definition of a &ldquo;joint district&rdquo;?  It says here that it has the same meaning as it has in the Local Government Act, 1927.  I understand that it is the old joint poor law districts that were brought together during the amalgamation schemes, but the matter arises very frequently afterwards, and I should like to have a clear definition <Col N="1527" /> now so as to avoid misunderstanding later on.  I understand that it means, in fact, a county, but I should like to know whether or not I am right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, no.  The expression &ldquo;joint district&rdquo; has the same meaning as it has in the Local Government Act, 1927.  It may not be convenient at the moment for the Deputy to look up that Act, and I shall read it for him.  The clause concerned is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The expression &ldquo;joint district&rdquo; means, as the case may require, either (a) an area in a county consisting of a county health district which has no urban district adjoining thereto and situate in such county, or (b) an area in a county composed of a county health district and every urban district adjoining thereto and situate in such county:</P>
      <P>Provided always that where an urban district adjoins two or more county health districts situate in the same county as such urban district, the Minister shall determine to which of such county health districts such urban district is for the purpose of this sub-section to be deemed to adjoin, and thereupon this sub-section&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>I am referring now to Section. 8</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;shall apply in such county as if such urban district adjoined only the county health district so determined by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I am quite sure that the Deputy cannot follow all that clearly but when he sees it set out, and has time to study it between now and the Report Stage, I think he will be satisfied.</P>

      <P>My difficulty will arise in dealing with Sections 6, 7, 8 and 9, where we have such phrases as &ldquo;public assistance authority,&rdquo;&ldquo;public assistance district&rdquo; and &ldquo;joint district.&rdquo;  I take it that a joint district means, in practice, a county.  Of course, there are certain other difficulties and differences that may arise where there are urban areas but, in fact, the general rule is that all counties, with a few exceptions, are joint districts.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (2) of this section states: &ldquo;In every public assistance district, public assistance shall be administered by the public assistance authority specified in that behalf by this Act in respect of such district.&rdquo; Now, I must also refer to sub-section (2) of Section 9, for the purpose of getting this matter clarified.  Sub-section (2) of that section states: &ldquo;The public assistance authority for a public assistance district consisting only of a joint district shall be the council of the county with which such joint district is co-terminus or in which such joint district is situate.&rdquo;  Relating those two clauses, we find that sub-section (2) of Section 7 sets out that in every public assistance district, public assistance shall be administered by the public assistance authority which means the county council.

That legislation will include the Managerial Bill and the Local Government Bill.  When that legislation has been passed, and the managerial system has been adopted, the difficulties that the Deputy has in mind I think will not arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been endeavouring to study that matter, but I am afraid they will arise.  I do not see any way in which they can be avoided. We have this joint district business running right through the Bill, and we have the other matter of the county council being the public assistance authority.  Then we have the matter of the existence of boards of health, and they are going out of operation as far as public assistance is concerned immediately this comes into force.  We have at the same time the question of the transference of officials.  To be quite candid, I cannot reconcile all these provisions.  I do not know what is going to happen under the Bill even with the very best intentions and even under the managerial system.  The thing appears to me to be mixed up to some extent, and I cannot understand it.  I want to know in particular, in regard to sub-section (2) of Section 7, is it seriously intended that the county council of a county is going to be the public assistance authority carrying out the detailed administration of public assistance?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the word &ldquo;committee&rdquo; but, after all, if you appoint a public assistance board under the Bill, you must appoint people who are elected by the people. If you appoint a committee you are not tied to that.  You may appoint clergymen or outside laymen to carry on.  I do not think that is sound.</P>

After all, it is not the Minister who will appoint these public assistance committees.  It is the members of the county council themselves.

Outside that, in the remainder of Cork, public assistance will be done by small committees. Is that the intention for the whole country?  Under Section 10, in every public assistance district which consists of a county borough and a joint district, those two are permitted to appoint a public assistance board and appoint officers for that board. They will have officials to carry on public assistance, but outside that a county council will have to carry it out through local committees.  Is that the intention?

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arises on the question I raised on the Second Reading of the Bill with regard to the administration of the Boards of Public Assistance in the County of Cork.  In the County of Cork there are several urban districts and I am particularly concerned with the South Cork Board of Public <Col N="1535" /> Assistance where the county is joined on, not only to urban areas, but also to the County Borough of Cork.  We are already chafing under the weight of carrying the burden of the City of Cork, which takes two-thirds of our rates and only contributes one-third. That is not so much the object of this amendment as to get representation for the urban district in that area and the other areas of Cork on those boards. Six urban areas in South Cork&mdash;Kinsale, Macroom, Youghal, Midleton, Cobh and Passage&mdash;have no representation whatever on these boards.  They have to pay rates and have to pay the cost of collecting the rates.  They have no voice in the striking of that rate nor have they any voice in the administration of the spending of that money and I think it is only a fair principle of equity that these authorities should get representation on the general board of public assistance.  I am asking that the Minister would give each urban district in the area one representative from the urban body on the joint board.  I think it is very fair and I am not asking anything very much. I am sure the Minister will see it is a matter that he can easily accede to without breaking through any of his rules or in any way infringing upon the principles of the Bill.</P>

      <P>My objection to Deputy O'Neill's argument in connection with the urban districts having separate representation is that already the urban districts elect the county councils.  They are portion of the electorate for the county councils and they have their voice there.  I think it would be nonsensical to increase the powers or the representation of the urban districts by having them, in the first place, electing the county councils, or at least having a share in electing them, and then afterwards having separate representation <Col N="1536" /> for themselves on urban bodies.  I think that would be nonsensical.</P>

      <P>Before Deputy O'Neill finally leaves us, I had better tell him that it is not proposed to accept the amendment.  Deputy Corry has.  I think, fairly fully dealt with the request for acceptance of the amendment to give special representation on the board of assistance to urban areas.  I do not know if Deputies have yet grasped the fact that there will be only two boards of assistance in the State&mdash; the board of assistance in Cork and the board of assistance in Waterford, where we have a county council and a corporation co-operating for public assistance purposes.  They have already adopted a scheme under the 1923 Act. As Deputy Corry very truthfully says, the urban ratepayers have an opportunity when electing county councillors to secure the proper representation they are entitled to on the county council.  My experience is&mdash;it may not operate in Cork, but it does in the North of Ireland, which is considerably different from Cork in many respects&mdash; that in the North of Ireland people living in urban areas secure an undue proportion of representation on county councils.  That is my experience.</P>

      <P>On the Cork Board of Assistance there are ten representatives of the county council: I do not know how many of the ten belong to urban areas but, at any rate, they were appointed by the county council.  Candidates who stand for election in urban areas to the county council are not confined in their vote to the urban areas.  They very often get votes from the rural areas.  I do not think that any case could be made for giving special representation to the urban areas on the board of assistance, in addition to the representation that the people themselves have vested in them as representatives on the county council.</P>

      <P>The Minister has said that people in the urban areas are entitled to get representation.  We can understand that, but, if they do get representation on the county council it does not follow that they then secure appointment on public assistance committees. I do know counties in which representatives have been put on, but in other counties representatives have not been put on.  I suggest that Deputy O'Neill is asking too much when he says that for every urban area there should be one representative, but I think that where there are two or three urban areas there should be a representative for the group.  There should be some provision in the Bill to bring that in, as the urban problem in so far as home assistance is concerned is entirely different to the problem which prevails in the rural areas. I am on the public assistance committee by rural votes.  If the rural representatives want to get representation they can get it.</P>

      <P>It does peculiarly refer to Cork, and I will ask the Minister, even if he is not accepting my amendment, to consider the position.  I think that the position of South Cork, particularly as we are carrying the burden of Cork City on our shoulders, is one for special attention.  I ask the Minister to give this special care and he will see further on the weight of my arguments.  We have representatives of the urban areas on this board of assistance and we do not seem to get any under this Bill.  I will ask the Minister to consider that and I will withdraw the amendment if he will give some assurance.</P>

      <P>There is no use holding out any prospects, as the amendment could not be accepted.  If he feels he has any real solid substance in his argument, I would suggest that he bring his weighty arguments to bear on the members of the Cork County Council and if he can persuade them that the urban areas are entitled to bigger representation on the county council than they are getting, it is a matter for their discretion, but he need not press for special provision to be incorporated in the Bill that the urban areas will get special representation.</P>

I have just been made wise by the Parliamentary Secretary when he says that there will be only two boards of assistance&mdash;one, the board of assistance for South Cork and Cork City, and the other that for the City of Waterford&mdash;so that this section is only carrying on an injustice, a gross injustice, to the unfortunate rural districts concerned.  This section is put in with one purpose alone as a definite decision of the Local Government Department that this injustice is to continue.  The unfortunate position is that, whilst two-thirds of the rates in the South Cork Board of Assistance joint area are contributed by the rural district and one-third of the rates are spent in the rural district, one-third of the rates are contributed by Cork City and two-thirds of the rates are spent in Cork City.  I think that the agricultural community are entitled at least to a fair crack of the whip.  I do not think it is just to the agricultural community to throw this burden on them. In putting in this section&mdash;which is put in definitely and solely to cover these two joint districts, the joint district of Waterford City and county, and the joint district of Cork City and South Cork&mdash;the Local Government Department and the Parliamentary Secretary have shown their intention of carrying on this injustice to the unfortunate people of those districts.  I cannot agree with the section, and I move its rejection.</P>

I think that if the Parliamentary Secretary were to canvass the opinion of Cork, Waterford and other places in which a situation like that exists, where a town and a portion of a rural district are included, the rural district paying the greater portion of the rates while the city reaps all the benefits, he would, I think, be convinced that something ought to be done to relieve that situation.

I had hoped that, when we were getting changes in local government, the appeals and resolutions repeatedly sent to the Department on the matter would be dealt with, but, instead, we find this section included for no other purpose than to continue that injustice and to make it a permanent feature.

      <P>I can recollect, at a very early period of the existence of the present Public Assistance Board in Cork, the very frequent protests made against the very serious charge upon the rural area, an area which has passed through very lean times and which still has to carry on under this injustice.  I do not think there is any similar anomaly throughout this country&mdash;certainly, it does not exist in County Dublin&mdash;of a rural area having to pay the lion's share of the contribution towards local assistance and reaping the smaller amount, while the city, where all the industry is, and which is supposed to be the wealthier portion, pays the smaller amount and reaps the greater volume of public assistance and is paid, as perhaps is <Col N="1543" /> right, on a higher standard.  The board of public assistance has adopted a very efficient means of administering this, and it would perhaps be well if other counties followed their example, in as much as public assistance is not given to any new applicant unless he is first recommended by the superintendent or the home assistance officer.  The most careful supervision is exercised by that board, and I am glad to say that there is a certain amount of unanimity&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It was inaugurated by another board with which I was connected, the North Cork Board of Assistance, by which it was administered very efficiently.  The most careful supervision is exercised by the senior officials in the administration of public assistance.  I support my colleague Deputy Corry on the opposite side in his efforts to get this section amended.  We are both representing the same area and there are occasions in which we do find a certain amount of unanimity.  The Parliamentary Secretary is aware of the innumerable protests that have been made by the board of public assistance against that injustice and these protests have always been carried by a large majority.  I do not expect my friend, Deputy Hickey, the Lord Mayor of Cork to join us in this.  The Deputy is only human.  If he can grab for his own area a larger volume of money I can hardly blame him.  I think the Minister ought to accede to our request and to remedy that injustice.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (3), page 7, line 20, to delete the word &ldquo;three&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;seven&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision made in this section for the appointment of committees limits the membership to an entirely insufficient number.  It is with some hesitancy that I invite members to visualise the position in Cork under this provision. The county covers a very extensive <Col N="1545" /> area.  The complaint there, and perhaps in other counties, is that boards of assistance with a membership of ten are not sufficiently large for the purpose of local knowledge and local needs. The Parliamentary Secretary will, of course, say that it is open to county councils to appoint committees of a larger membership than three.  But in case committees would be appointed of not more than three members, the position ought to be met in the Bill. The committees appointed should be sufficiently large and well-informed to administer this service as it ought to be administered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 11 provides, as Deputy Murphy has appointed out, that a public assistance authority may &ldquo;from time to time appoint such and so many committees as they think fit for purposes connected with the exercise or performance of all of their powers, duties and functions....&rdquo;  It is conceivable, and to my mind fairly probable, that county councils will appoint a number of committees within their administrative areas to deal with different aspects of public assistance&mdash; dispensary committees, hospital committes and committees to supervise boarded-out children, to mention only a few.  To me, it would appear to be desirable that they should appoint such committees in comparatively small areas if immediate contact is to be kept with the people concerned.  Taking the parish or dispensary district as the unit, if the county councils appoint two or three sub-committees for the purpose of administering different forms of assistance and if they are bound by statute to appoint a minimum of seven members, I doubt if sufficient persons would be found in the smaller districts to man all the committees that might be set up under the Act.  I do not think there is any danger whatever to administration in making three the minimum number to serve on such committees.  The machinery might, possibly, break down if the minimum were made as large as seven.  I do not think that the proposal is a wise one and, consequently, I suggest to the Deputy that he should not press his amendment.  On consideration, <Col N="1546" /> he may see that there is a strong case against it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the Parliamentary Secretary visualises the appointment of a number of committees. Some committee will be invested with responsibility for administering home assistance and it would seem to me that a committee of three for that purpose would be wholly inadequate and might result in injustice to the poor.  That is my concern in the matter and I think the Parliamentary Secretary might look into it again and see if he can meet my point in some way.  I am not tied to this particular amendment but to have three persons dealing with home assistance in a rural district or dispensary district might be very unsatisfactory to the recipients of home assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broderick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not as much concerned with the membership of the committees as I am with the necessity for the formation of these committees. I am not aware of any committee which exists in County Cork but I am aware that a considerable amount of hardship is imposed on people who know not where to go to get assistance or to get instruction as to how they are to get into a hospital.  Occasionally, they meet officials who are far from sympathetic and I think that that is an exceptionally weak link in the whole administration of home assistance and hospital treatment.  The poor people who have to avail of these services have nobody to guide them or assist them but officials.  I feel very much the omission to establish these local committees which would have local knowledge and sympathy with the unfortunate people who are seeking the assistance of these institutions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It can go up to ten or a dozen, but the larger the number of people you have administering public funds without any responsibility to the electorate, the more danger there will be in such committees.  Every local authority is, I think, aware of that. Where you have very small county councils and a large number of committees administering public funds without any responsibility to the people, you may get an undesirable position.  It has been found that persons who act in this way have not the same responsibility as elected representatives of the people.  That is the danger in this whole section.</P>

In Deputy Allen's view, the question has resolved itself into one of increased expenditure.  I have not dealt with that point, but these committees have merely power to recommend; they have no power to pass expenditure. That is, so far as the 1924 Act is concerned. In this Bill they may have such power, and it is undesirable that anybody should have that power without responsibility to the ratepayers. Under the 1924 Act they have merely power to recommend.  I am reminded by a colleague that, even in this Bill, they have not any executive power. They have only power to recommend. I have not read the Bill, and I do not know if I am correct in that.</P>

      <P>There is one aspect of this to which I wish to direct the attention of the Parliamentary Secretary. He said he hoped that these committees would be set up to cover rather small areas, indicating parish or dispensary areas.  There is nothing in the section, or in the Bill, so far as I can see, which would prevent a county council from establishing such committees in, say, electoral areas.  An electoral area, as the Parliamentary Secretary and Deputies know, can be a pretty wide area, particularly in a large county. If you are going to have a committee of the kind visualised in sub-section (3), you may have one consisting of three or four members.  I agree that under the section you could have one consisting of 23 or 24 members, but the section says &ldquo;not less than three&rdquo;.  We may assume, then, that in or about three will constitute the personnel of a committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in so far as it has wisdom.  I suggest that it is possible to comply with the section by appointing a committee of three or four people.  If such a committee is to administer public assistance in an electoral area, as distinct from a dispensary or parish area, you are going to have a very small committee to look after the needs of home assistance applicants over a very wide area.  I think that would be a great hardship on many of those applicants.  It would be impossible for such a committee to ascertain accurately the circumstances of the recipients or potential recipients, or to investigate them with the thoroughness that you could get if there was a larger committee functioning in that area, or if you had a committee functioning in respect of a smaller area.  I think the Parliamentary Secretary should look into the matter with a view to ascertaining whether it is not possible to make the minimum something higher than three. Why not make it five?</P>

      <P>This debate may be very interesting from the point of view of a <Col N="1550" /> purely academic discussion: of trying to make debating points, but really there is not much substance in it so far. The whole discussion is based on the assumption that the county council cannot be trusted to do anything.  I do not accept that premises at all.  The county council have full power to determine the number of committees, the number of persons who shall constitute each committee so appointed, as well as to make regulations governing the quorum, place of meeting, duties, etc., that the committees are to discharge. Is the position being definitely taken by the critics of this particular section that we cannot entrust these simple powers to the county council?</P>

      <P>I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary is quite fair in falling back on the county council all the time in endeavouring to draw a red herring across the discussion here. Now, this is not a county council meeting. This is the Parliament of the country where legislation is being framed.  If this legislation proves unsatisfactory, the blame cannot be put on the county council hereafter.  May <Col N="1551" /> I ask, what type of county council we will have when this measure is in operation?  It is quite possible, and conceivable, that a county council will be simply one individual.</P>
      <P>A situation might very well arise in which I would not be prepared to trust him.  I know, of course, of all the virtuous people who have developed into super-men in this country.  We have quite a lot of them throughout the country, but I am old-fashioned enough to prefer the collective wisdom of a public body, composed of people who know the local circumstances. Holding that view, I do not think that the Parliamentary Secretary has met the position at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The case has been put to the Parliamentary Secretary that the minimum number should not be as low as three.  If the present minimum is insisted on, you may have a situation arising in which three or four will, in fact, represent the strength of the committee.  The case has been made that three or four is an exceptionally small number in those circumstances, if the committee is to administer public assistance over a wide area.  The Parliamentary Secretary asks can we not trust the county councils to do that. We can, generally speaking, but there are some things which ought not to be left to the discretion of the county councils.  This is a national Parliament, framing legislation, and it ought to indicate broadly to county councils what the minimum number should be. We should not pass a function of this <Col N="1552" /> kind on to the county councils and say: &ldquo;We trust you to do it.&rdquo;  We should indicate broadly what the minimum number should be.  The county councils are not such sacrosanct bodies at all.  The Parliamentary Secretary or the Minister dissolved a number of them because they would not carry out their functions or because they functioned in such an unsatisfactory manner. County councils are not infallible or pontifical bodies at all.  They have been found negligent on many occasions.  We ought to indicate here that we regard five as the minimum number.  The Parliamentary Secretary has made no case whatever for retaining the figure of three.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 8:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (3), page 7, at the end of the sub-section, to add the words &ldquo;provided, however, that the number of members so appointed shall, at least, be equal to the number of persons entitled to be elected to serve as members of the said public assistance authority in respect of the functional area of the committee.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The sub-section provides that the public assistance committee appointed by the county council may be composed either wholly of members of the county council or partly of county councillors, and the purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the public assistance committee should have at least as many members on it as there are county councillors for the district covered by the committee.  In one particular county, at least, where a reduction in the membership of the county council was agreed to, the position, following the next local elections, if the changes contemplated had not taken place, would be that each member of the county council would be a member of the public assistance committee.  This amendment aims at preserving a somewhat similar position.  It would follow on much the same lines as have been already argued, and I think it is a reasonable amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DrFCWard" hpid="Dr. Ward Dr. Ward">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess again that I cannot follow the argument, and I am not sure that the Deputy has brought out what he appears to have intended.  The amendment conveys to me the idea that when these committees are appointed by the public assistance authority, at least half of them should be elected members of the local authority. If that is what the Deputy intends by the amendment, if that principle is adopted, it would mean that the whole idea of the appointment of these committees, especially in the smaller areas, would be definitely jeopardised.  Let us take the case of boarded-out children.  Members of a supervisory committee who are not elected members of a county council might be very useful members on such a committee.  Again, if we are to have at least half of the members of such committees elected members of the county council, it will mean that such committees can only function for a fairly wide area.  If, say, the average number would be seven, as the Deputy seems to anticipate, that would require at least three or four county councillors under the amendment, which would cover a very wide area.  I do not think that there is any good case for the amendment.  I think it is better to leave the discretion as to the personnel of the committees in the hands of the local authority.</P>

      <P>Before sub-section (5) to insert the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>The law for the time being in force in relation to the qualification and disqualification of persons for membership of a county council shall, so far as it is applicable, apply to the persons appointed to be members of every committee appointed under this section.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the Bill, as it stands at present, makes no provision for the disqualification that obtains at present in regard to members of local authorities in connection with membership of committees.  The Parliamentary Secretary and the House will be aware that members of local authorities who may suffer disqualification by being involved in contracts and transactions of that kind incur certain penalties.  The purpose of the amendment is to see that that position is preserved in regard to the committees and that the disqualification would apply to members of the committee in the same way as it applies to local authorities at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Allen that these committees are going to be very dangerous.  They will have no administrative responsibility.  It may be all right to say that they will have the necessary local knowledge of applicants, to determine whether they are entitled to assistance or not, but they may act very generously in that respect, and for that reason, it would be very difficult to keep home assistance within a reasonable limit.  If there is a home assistance officer, and if he is doing his job properly, by making the necessary inquiries to determine the <Col N="1556" /> means of applicants, he will get all the information necessary to enable local authorities to do their duty and to decide whether home assistance is necessary or not.  I anticipate that committees of this sort, not having the responsibility of keeping home assistance within reasonable bounds, will act very generously towards local people. They will be parish committees dealing with a limited number of people, and their recommendations will be very generous.  I know that these recommendations will have to be confirmed, but it will be very difficult to control home assistance expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is only a question of setting up committees many counties may not be inclined to do so.  As far as I understand it, this Bill visualises county managers and we do not know what their powers will be.  If the Parliamentary Secretary could tell us at this stage if county managers will have to determine whether committees should be set up or not, or whether they will be set up by the elected councils, it would help.  We should know that.  To a certain extent we are legislating in the dark.  That is what I feel about the matter.  If we could have a picture of what the Government proposals on the whole matter were we would be able to discuss this Bill to greater advantage.  Will the managers determine if such committees are to be set up or will the elected councils do so?  If the latter were to decide the position would be fairly safe.  It would be different if the managers were to decide.  That is the problem to be faced.  I admit that certain committees that perform certain functions can be very useful, for instance, as the Parliamentary Secretary pointed out, in looking after boarded out children, but when they come to expend money in their own areas, the position might be different.  It is well that it should be considered beforehand.  Otherwise it might happen that the whole county managerial system might break down.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the powers are not exercised.  Does the Parliamentary Secretary attach importance to the setting up of committees, or is there anything to indicate that they will have merely a continuation of powers which already exist?  Will he say whether he prefers to have committees set up or whether he prefers to have, matters of administration left to a single council such as a board of health?  I think the point raised by Deputy Allen is one of considerable importance.  If it is felt desirable, in the light of the two other Bills that are to be introduced on the subject of local government, to set up committees of this kind, it is important when considering this Bill at this stage to know whether, when we have county managers installed&mdash;if they are installed&mdash;it will be one of their functions to decide if these committees will be established or if the representatives of local electors will be permitted to decide that question, independent of the judgment of county managers?  A county manager may well decide that he does not desire such committees, and he will function, or arrange matters in such a way that very little authority will be diffused to anyone as far as he can prevent it. What is the intention in that connection in respect to the two other Bills foreshadowed on the Second Reading?</P>

      <P>Personally, I think such committees should serve a useful purpose, especially in relation to the supervision of boarded out children, and even in connection with home assistance, that is, if you get <Col N="1558" /> the best type of citizen to function on such committees.  I believe a good machine could be set up, but whether it will become operative is another question.  The power has been vested in the board of health but it has not been much availed of, and one would naturally be inclined to pre-suppose the same conditions applying in future.  My personal view is that it would be a good thing if such committees could be got to take an interest in social affairs, and in the condition of poor people they have close contact with, and that they are in a position to advise.</P>

      <P>I am merely drawing attention to the fact.  Another point that will arise concerns the parish. That is an entity that has created some difficulty in the way of legal definition. The amendment does not meet the situation, which, I suggest, can and will be properly met by regulation.  It is essentially a matter to be dealt with by regulation.</P>

      <P>I am afraid I am not convinced that a matter of this kind can be dealt with by regulation rather than by a local authority.  Better lay it down in appropriate language that a local authority would be obliged to appoint some persons, corresponding to wardens under the poor law system that prevailed hitherto.  That would be the most satisfactory way to deal with it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 12:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 12 to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Not withstanding the repeal of the Poor Relief Act, 1862, effected by this Act, the provisions of Section 21 of the said Act shall apply in relation to the committees appointed under Section 11 of this Act in the same way as if such committees were public assistance authorities for the purpose of the Poor Relief Act, 1862.</P>
      <P>Under this Bill the Poor Relief Act, 1862, is repealed.  That Act contains a provision that a solicitor acting for a local authority, successors to the board of guardians, who was a member of that local authority, was subject to a penalty.  The proposal enshrined in this amendment is to continue that position, but if the Parliamentary Secretary can assure me that the matter is met any where else I am satisfied.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 33:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of the section to add a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where public assistance has been given by the said authority to destitute persons while awaiting compensation or weekly payment from his or her employer or insurance company for injuries received while in such employment or from any accident or any cause whatever, the employer or insurance company or such person liable shall pay as a first charge out of such compensation a sum of money on demand from the said authority <Col N="1573" /> equal to the amount already paid by the said authority in assisting the aforesaid individual.</P>
    <P>In a case where excess home assistance is paid to a recipient pending a decision in court of workmen's compensation or for a road accident or anything like that, the local authority may pay for a number of weeks and the local authority sometimes has to proceed against the recipient to recover the excess home assistance paid and very often fail to recover.  I suggest in this amendment that where the local authocity presents its bill, the person liable should discharge the amount out of the compensation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>My grouse in this matter is the other way; we invariably find that when a person&mdash;a widow&mdash;gets a widow's pension there is a peremptory order from the Department of Local Government put through to stop the amount of money she has got during the period she was waiting for help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite understand that it has nothing to do with pensions, but it is the same principle.  In a great many cases some of these people, in consequence of the fact that they have not been working regularly, get a very small amount of compensation, and when they get the amount of money due to them they want it very badly. I suggest that the amendment ought to be withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The local authority should have power to recover out of the amount of compensation.  Very often when the local authority proceed to recover in court they do not collect.

    <Speaker pid="DenisAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the point Deputy Hughes has made is something the Parliamentary Secretary should look into, because if he inquires from local authorities he will find that there is a lot in this.  I think a judge recently held in court that if the man was entitled to public assistance in the ordinary course, before he had the accident, that he was not liable to pay anything to the local assistance authority notwithstanding that he might get a very considerable sum of money&mdash;£1,000&mdash;in compensation.  I think it is something that should be looked into.  Provision has already been made&mdash;an extraordinary thing&mdash;in the Workmen's Compensation Act, to pay the medical expenses of the medical officer who may attend him although he is a case that the judge will hold was entitled to public assistance before he met with that accident and although the local authority must bear the burden of his maintenance, the medical officer attending him, although bound under law to give him free attention as a person entitled to public assistance, is paid, but the local authority are not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No provision whatever has been made for them.  We are aware also that employers in this country are paying <Col N="1575" /> very substantial increases in their premiums for workmen's compensation in order to ensure that medical fees will be paid.  I think that when medical fees are paid the local authority, who provide maintenance, should also be paid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not actually visualising the case of a man who is already obtaining home assistance. Take the case of a workman going home from work who meets with an accident.</P>

      <P>I know that.  I just want to make it clear.  Supposing he meets with an accident and the liability is not fixed for two or three months, the local authority must come to his assistance with the intention of collecting later on when the liability is fixed. My experience is that invariably they do not collect.</P>

      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with the principle behind this amendment, and I will look into it between this and the Report Stage, and see in what particular form a similar amendment can be inserted whilst safeguarding certain positions that we will require to safeguard.  It seems to me that if a man is injured by accident and he is covered under the Workmen's Compensation Act, that the cover ought to be such as to safeguard the interests of the local authority, that he should not be thrown destitute back to the local authority.  The provision for compensation under the Workmen's Compensation Act may not be as generous as it ought to be.  That is quite another question.  I do say that if a man is injured and an insurance premium has been paid that is intended to cover a certain risk, that insurance ought to be such as to safeguard the local authority from having to carry the burden of maintaining that man either during the time the case is pending or afterwards.</P>

      <P>I am not so much concerned about the loss to the public authority by giving a man home assistance pending the fixing of liability for his accident, but that man may be in <Col N="1577" /> hospital for three months, and I think the question should be considered of relieving the public authority of the cost of keeping him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an entirely different thing.  As a member of a public assistance board, we have several cases of that, where a man, the employee of a wealthy concern, is rushed to the district hospital and kept there for months and the public authority cannot recover anything from him.  He may be poor. He may have a big family and he cannot pay.  I think it is unfair that the public authority should maintain him in that institution without getting something from the firm in which he was injured.  That is more important than the amendment of Deputy Hughes.</P>

      <P>One aspect of the matter is that a person injured in an ordinary motor accident would not be entitled to claim as part of his damages the amount he may have received in home assistance.  It would have to be paid to the local authority only on demand, and as a result the local authority may not be paid and the insurance company may get off without paying portion of the amount for which they have insured.</P>

      <P>Deputy Hughes quotes the case of a man being injured and being maintained either on public assistance at a hospital or at the expense of the local authority and wants power taken to enable the local authority to recoup itself.  But the amendment submitted by Deputy Hughes goes much further.  Deputy Hughes asks in his amendment that if a man meets with an accident and is insurable under the Workmen's Compensation Act and gets the benefit of it, one may step in and say that the first charge on that compensation will not be the payment of any bills which he may have contracted to provide treatment, but that there shall be paid back to the local authority the small amount it has advanced.  I think that is a most unreasonable demand.  In many cases the compensation is only 30/- and the average is very much less than 30/-, because to get that 30/- he must have been employed for the preceding 52 weeks at not less than £2 per week.  Casual employment would not do.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not paid by the man but by the employer.  Deputy Hughes has moved an amendment to the effect that whatever money is paid the first charge out of such money is to be the payment of the hospital.  In other words, if a man gets 25/- a week as a result of an accident the local authority can step in and say that they paid 5/- a week to the man during the time he was out.  That, I think, is most unreasonable.  I want the Parliamentary Secretary, therefore, to bear that kind of case in mind, and not to allow any contemplated amendment of the existing position in that regard to be used as an excuse for reducing the small compensation which a workman gets in such circumstances. In any case, I do not think that it is possible to alter the Workmen's Compensation law which is in existence by any amendment to the Public Assistance Bill.</P>

    <P>In sub-section (1), page 16, line 45, before the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to insert the <Col N="1580" /> following words &ldquo;after the holding of a public inquiry&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to preserve some local rights in the matter of the closing of local institutions. The section makes provision for such an emergency and the purpose of the amendment is that a decision of that kind will not be taken until a public inquiry is held.  After all, in the last analysis, I think the opinion of the local ratepayers ought to be got in this particular matter and I suppose we have experience enough of local government in recent years to know that very strongly felt local agitations have raged around questions of this kind. The idea of the amendment is to preserve as far as possible the principle that local opinion should be consulted in connection with the closing of the particular institution.</P>

    <P>This section reads: &ldquo;Every district institution shall be available for the assistance of such class or classes of persons eligible for public assistance as the Minister shall from time to time by order direct&rdquo;, and in sub-section (2) there is provision that:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am willing to allow the Parliamentary Secretary to explain the question.  He seems to come in seeking power to create a class which cannot be treated except in district institutions, and it seems unfair to say that they cannot be given assistance outside of those institutions.

      <P>Under sub-section (1) of Section 32&mdash;&ldquo;Every district institution <Col N="1582" /> shall be available for the assistance of such class or classes of persons eligible for public assistance.&rdquo;  Now, the classification that I have in mind is not the classification that Deputy Norton has in mind.  The Minister must be empowered to preserve certain institutions for certain classes of patients. That is the intention here.  The intention of this section is to provide that where institutions, such as sanatoria or institutions for the treatment of epileptics, are specially established for certain classes, they would be available to such people and to no others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree, so far as it is desired to maintain certain institutions for persons of that kind, but, if that is so, although the language of both subsections is capable of applying to quite a different set of circumstances, it would suit a case in which the Minister wanted to clamp certain people, or classes of people, into an institution. That may not be the intention, and it clearly is not the intention, in view of the statement of the Parliamentary Secretary, but the language of the sub-section would suit the circumstances in which, in fact, he did want to put people in against their will.  What is the purpose, however, of preventing the local authority from giving public assistance to such a person, even outside an institution, if there is assistance or service available for that person remaining outside an institution?</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that it is a useful power to have and, in certain circumstances, might be very desirable.  The Deputy knows that there are mental defectives and moral defectives who ought to be treated in an institution, if an institution is provided for the purpose.  If such institutions are provided and the Minister, in the exercise of his judgment and discretion, decides that such people should be treated in such an institution, and not outside, it is desirable that he should have power to prevent the public assistance authority from cutting across that line of policy and maintaining them outside institutional treatment.</P>

      <P>That may be so as a general proposition, and one might subscribe even to a substantial portion of that viewpoint as a general proposition, but you may find a person who is defective, morally or mentally, or with some physical disability, and where the members of his family are willing to do their best to assist such a person, preferring to do that than to see that person maintained in an institution, which they might feel would not conduce to an improvement in his state of health, or to correction of the defects, surely it ought to be possible for a local authority, in such circumstances, to say: &ldquo;Having regard to the home circumstances in this case, and, even though the family are poor, we are prepared to grant outside assistance, and not to compel this person to go into an institution as a condition of receiving treatment&rdquo;.  Would the Parliamentary Secretary undertake to insert a provision &ldquo;with the permission of the Minister&rdquo;, so that a local authority could write to the Minister and say: &ldquo;Here is a case in which we think the person can be allowed treatment at home and we want permission to pay home assistance&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>Institutions, county homes and institutions of that kind, are very often overcrowded and unless a situation is visualised when entirely new buildings are put up, one can hardly contemplate any substantial additions to the numbers in certain areas, without a good deal of discomfort and inconvenience, and while there are odd cases which would be better-off in an institution, I think the liberty of the subject is of very great importance. I would dislike a situation in which poor persons, afflicted in any way and having the feeling which is in the hearts of many poor people about county homes, or what are described as workhouses, would be compelled to suffer the penalty of being unable to get any assistance unless they entered such an institution.  I think there ought to be some discretion in this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an order in respect of a class of persons, and one might agree, as a general proposition in respect of classes of persons, but once a person comes into that class, no matter what his circumstances may be, <Col N="1585" /> a public assistance authority must insist on his receiving institutional treatment, even though the authority might feel that this was a case where the person ought not to be required to go into an institution as a condition of receiving assistance.  I want to preserve a position whereby the authority will have power to say: &ldquo;As a rule, people like you must go in, but we, having investigated the circumstances of the case, believe it is one in which we ought to grant assistance while you remain out of the institution, because we are satisfied that your home circumstances will conduce to recovery and improvement&rdquo;.  I want to preserve power to do that, while not interfering with the general proposition that you may have classes for which institutional treatment is desirable. There ought, however, to be provision for exceptions of that kind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ward</NameTxt>
      <P>I might point out to the Deputy that the section does, in fact, provide for exceptions under the heading of &ldquo;urgent necessity&rdquo;.  The interpretation of that phrase will be largely a matter for the local authority, and I think that some of the cases the Deputy has in mind could, by a liberal interpretation of that phrase, be held to be persons who might get assistance outside the institution provided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>If it does get that meaning, it is surely straining the normal meaning of the phrase.  This may be a case in which assistance will have to be rendered for 12 months, and it cannot be said that that is urgent necessity.</P>

      <P>I have in mind the case of a person suffering from some disability. It may be felt that that person, male or female, belongs to a class which should receive institutional treatment, but there may be a case of an individual who dislikes to go into a county home, or who has relatives <Col N="1586" /> who dislike his going into a county home, who may say: &ldquo;We will look after this person outside if the local authority will help by granting assistance outside and by not requiring this person to go into an institution.&rdquo;  It does not seem to me that &ldquo;except cases of sudden or urgent necessity&rdquo; would provide for cases of that kind, and in any case there is the Local Government auditor to reckon with. Would the Parliamentary Secretary undertake to insert the phrase, &ldquo;or with the special permission of the Minister,&rdquo; so that where you had a particular case the local authority could submit the facts to the Minister and ask permission to grant assistance outside the institution, rather than to provide for the regimentation of a whole class of people and compel them to go into an institution when they would prefer to be treated outside.</P>

      <P>This section is about the boarding-out of children.  I want to know if the Minister has any intention of introducing legislation dealing with boarded-out children.  The reason I ask the question is that our experience of these boarded-out children is anything but a pleasant one.  We have boarded-out children over whom we have no control whatever.  At the moment there is an organisation boarding out children apart altogether from the board of public assistance. There is a sum of £60 given to the foster-parent, spread over a period of four years.  At the end of four years these children come along to the board of health for assistance.  The foster-parents also require assistance.  These are the wives of unemployed persons.  I find in our own area in the board of public assistance in Cork that there are four children who were not registered and who had not even surnames.</P>

      <P>Yes; and I am sure the Minister himself will have had reports from the County Cork of a case where there were four children in one house and none of these four children had any surname.  There was no evidence that they had been registered.  During the past year I have had people coming to me with boys 17 and 18 years of age who have got employment at minor jobs.  These boys wanted the national health cards.  It was found that these poor boys had hitherto been known as members of the family of the foster-parents. When they went to get their cards they found that their names were not the names they thought they were. Within the last fortnight I found that a lady in Cork took a boy from a Dublin institution.  When I wrote to <Col N="1592" /> the institution for his real name, the reply I got was that the institution treats all their patients with confidence. There are eight children in the Cork area who were not registered and they have no surnames.  They are known by the name of Michael or Joseph or Patrick.  The Bill is not apparently providing for these cases, and I would ask the Minister to introduce a Bill to deal with them.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (2) there is a mistake.  Paragraph (a) of the sub-section says &ldquo;in the case of a legitimate child one at least of those parents is living and has not deserted it, to which its parents or its surviving parent object or objects....&rdquo;  I do not understand that.  The word &ldquo;those&rdquo; should be &ldquo;whose&rdquo; apparently.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy will not press this amendment.  It would be utterly impossible to have all the regulations to be made under this Act laid on the Table.  The Table would not hold them; half of them would be on the floor.  Under the amendment, every sealed order made by the Minister would have to be laid on the Table of the House.</P>

      <P>That is a situation for which I do not desire to be responsible but perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary would, between now and Report Stage, give some consideration to the matter.  He might be able to classify the regulations in some way so that all the important matters would be brought to the notice of the House. If the Parliamentary Secretary cannot do that, then I shall not press the amendment.</P>

      <P>We have given a good deal of thought to this matter since the Deputy put down his amendment. We have operated on the principle in the past that when a regulation affected more than one area and was of a general nature, provision was made for laying it on the Table.  I have searched for a better form and I cannot find it.  The line must be drawn somewhere and I do not see any other line than that which distinguishes between general orders and specific orders relating only to a local area.</P>

    <P>In the Schedule, the Poor Law Act of 1889 is repealed.  Examination reveals that the Poor Law Act, 1889, did not apply to this country save in <Col N="1596" /> respect of one section.  The amendment is put down with a view to having the opinion of the Parliamentary Secretary on the matter and of ascertaining whether it is worth while repealing a measure only one section of which is applicable to this country.  I am not particularly interested in the matter.</P>

      <P>The provisions of the Act that applied to Ireland are being repealed. I am advised that the drafting is in the proper form and, on purely legal matters, we have to be guided by our official advisers.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Schedule, I should like to mention that the following amendments are being considered for addition to the Schedule on Report Stage&mdash;the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1879, Section 4; the Local Government (Ireland) Act, 1898, Section 24, sub-section (3) of Section 25, Section 79; the Public Assistance Act, 1937, Section 5.  The following are being considered for removal from the Schedule:&mdash;the Poor Relief (Ireland) Act, 1838, Section 18; the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923, Section 9.  On the Second Schedule, I may have to move an amendment to Rule 10.  I am looking into the matter and am now merely intimating to the House that certain amendments may be necessary on Report Stage.</P>
