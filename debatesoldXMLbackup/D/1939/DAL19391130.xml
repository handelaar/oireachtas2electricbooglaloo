      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether his attention has been drawn to a report which appeared in the newspapers of 24th November, 1939, of the destruction by the customs authorities in Galway of a quantity of boots and clothing; if he will state whether such destruction did in fact take place and, if so, whether he will take steps to discontinue such practices; and, further, if the destruction took place, if he will state what quantity of boots and clothing were destroyed, whether the goods destroyed were in good merchantable and wearable condition, what was their approximate value, and under what authority, regulations or instructions, statutory or otherwise, the destruction was carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh) Seán T. O'Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention has been drawn to the report in question.  The destruction did in fact take place as far back as the 10th August last, and the quantities destroyed were as follows:&mdash;boots and shoes, 145 pairs; proofed coats, 23 articles; hats, ten; stockings, 28 pairs.  They were an accumulation of seizures by the Revenue Commissioners in 1937, 1938 and 1939.  The values of the goods at time of importation were:&mdash;boots and shoes, £25; wearing apparel as above, £24.  The values at the time of disposal would be considerably less in view of deterioration since seizure.  Some of <Col N="568" /> the goods were secondhand and some were of little value.  On the whole they could be regarded as being in wearable condition, but not fully merchantable.</P>
      <P>All these goods were prohibited goods under various quota orders made by the Government under the Control of Imports Acts, 1934 and 1937, and they were destroyed on the authority of the Revenue Commissioners under the powers given by Section 42 of the Customs Consolidation Act, 1876.</P>
      <P>The difficult economic position arising from the outbreak of war is being borne in mind and the recurrence of a similar set of circumstances is improbable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. Doyle Mr. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask, in view of destruction of this kind having taken place so often, would it not be feasible to take some steps, by legislation or otherwise, by which destruction of commodities of this kind could be avoided, particularly in the present circumstances?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBroderick" hpid="Mr. S. Brodrick Mr. S. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the amount of destitution in such places as Galway City, where there are so many unemployed, would it not be possible to amend the legislation so as to hand over goods such as these for some charitable purpose, instead of having them destroyed on several occasions in Galway since the 26th August last?</P>

As a matter of fact, there was an effort made by the customs office in the area to make an arrangement with the local Vincent de Paul Society to get the goods disposed of in Northern Ireland, and they reported that they failed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it correct to say that without an amendment of the law it would have been impossible for the Revenue Commissioners to pass these goods on to the poor of Galway, or anywhere else, and that in fact what is required in this case is a suitable amendment of the law&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The reply to the first part of the question is in the affirmative.  As regards the second part, approval has been given to the corporation's proposal to extend school meals to certain schools within the city.  The proposal of the corporation also related to the provision of meals in a school situate outside the city, but in that case the corporation's law agent advised them that there is no statutory power to provide school meals.</P>

      <P>Representations of the nature outlined in the first part of the question have been made to my Department.  As the Deputy is aware the maximum price which may be charged ex mill for bakers' flour is fixed by order and I cannot compel traders to sell at prices below this maximum.  I understand that the Dublin Associated Millers wrote to the Dublin Board of Assistance and stated that, under prevailing conditions, it would not be practicable for any member of the association to tender for the quantity of flour required by the board as such member could not know what wheat might be allotted to him or the price thereof.  I understand further that the association stated they were prepared to supply the board with flour at the price ruling on the date of delivery and to allocate the order amongst the different members of the association.</P>

      <P>Oil cakes and meals were withdrawn by order from the operation of the Emergency Powers (Control of Prices) (No. 1) Order, 1939, on representations, made by the leading importers of linseed cake and cottonseed meal, as to the increased landed costs of imported linseed cake and cottonseed meal.  It was agreed with the importers that the price of linseed meals and nuts obtained from linseed cake and the price of cottonseed meal should be increased to specified figures to compensate them for the increased costs of imported materials.  The price of these cakes and meals is continually under review. Representations have been made by the Irish Oil and Cake Mills that prices of cakes and meals produced in Drogheda should be increased, and the question is under consideration.  No complaints have been received as to excessive retail prices for these commodities.</P>

      <P>Leather was withdrawn from the operation of the Emergency Powers (Control of Prices) (No. 1) Order, 1939, on representations made by the Federation of Irish Tanners that owing to the increases in prices of imported hides, skins and partly processed leather, the pre-war prices of leather could not be maintained.  The case was fully examined and it was agreed that specific additions should be made to the prices of heavy leathers, to operate in part up to 31st October, and fully thereafter.  Increases were also agreed for light leathers.  These prices are continually under review. The wholesale price of imported leather has risen corresponding to the rise in prices in Great Britain and elsewhere. There does not appear to be any necessity to regulate the retail price of leather, as the bulk of it is supplied to manufacturers and shoemakers.</P>

      <P>Three orders have been made, at the instance of my Department, under the Emergency Powers Act, 1939, entitled the Emergency Powers (No. 14), (No. 15) and (No. 16) <Col N="583" /> Order respectively.  The purpose of the first (No. 14) Order is to suspend the penal provisions of the Milk (Regulation of Supply and Price) Act, 1936, in respect of milk supplied or sold in Dublin by persons not qualified to supply milk to the city under that Act. The second (No. 15) Order makes it possible for creameries not registered in pursuance of the Milk and Dairies Act, 1935, to supply milk for human consumption in Dublin.  The third (No. 16) Order enables a Minister, or a person authorised by him, to requisition articles of food essential to the life of the community.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he is aware that ex-Captain Robert Cotter has been refused a pension on the grounds that injuries received by him were not due to military service, although he suffered extensive inflammation of various abdominal organs following a blow from a pole received in the course of his duties as an officer in the Equitation School and, if so, whether he will now arrange to have a re-examination of this case with a view to granting this officer a pension.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The claim of ex-Captain Cotter for disability arising from certain injuries was examined by the Army Pensions Board and, on their report, the claim was refused on the grounds that the disability from which he suffers cannot be associated with the injuries.  In the circumstances, I do not propose to have the case re-examined.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister saw no reason in this statement of fact&mdash;that an Army athletic champion gets a <Col N="584" /> blow of a ball in the abdomen, suffers acute pain that night, is removed to hospital next day, is operated upon 24 hours later and is a physical wreck afterwards.  There is no connection between that accident and his disability? Surely there is something to look into in that case.  We all make mistakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not the Minister aware that direct evidence of association cannot be got in such cases? Some years ago, the Minister was equally dogmatic in a similar case and when a sympathetic mind was brought to bear on it and it was referred to an outside medical tribunal selected by the Minister, a different decision was arrived at.  Will the Minister take impartial outside advice which is not hide-bound in red tape?  I do not know the individual concerned.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;having relation to the whole prospects of the future of the Bill, because I feel that there will be deep-seated suspicion and objection to the handing over of the very extreme powers that are proposed to be given to a commission of three men outside of the industry and without having any regard to the interests of those who are particularly concerned.  According to the wording of this amendment, we are only asking for an extension of that scope in order to give effect to the proposal that I am making in amendment No. 10, with regard to the constitution of this commission.  If the Bill passes in its present form, and if all these powers are to be vested in the hands of this commission, to be appointed by the Minister himself, I see no possibility of giving a voice in the direction of these matters to the people who are really concerned with this particular industry, and the Bill, in its present form, certainly will not tend to create or encourage that confidence which is sought by the Bill and which we should all like to see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The meddling that has gone on with regard to the pig and bacon industry during the past five years has not been a phenomenal success, and while we had two boards set up, one representing the pig producing end of the <Col N="588" /> industry and the other representing the bacon end of the industry, with one common chairman, neither of them has been the success that we wished for.  If one side got away with more than the other, or with more than might have been considered right, or if one side got away with more, perhaps, at the expense of the other side, that might not be regarded as a compliment to the chairman or a compliment to his competence, but I do not think it is a fitting case to make that, because of that failure, or alleged failure, or because of the success of one side as against the other, the Minister should be entitled to go to the extreme length of cutting out the people who are really interested in this particular industry and preventing them from having any voice in its control.  We heard the Minister say that it was his idea that this commission should carry on the functions of the two boards and get all the information that they could get to enable them to try to produce a scheme&mdash;the best possible scheme they could produce&mdash;with regard to the control of bacon production, marketing and everything else, that would give us the greatest possible benefit.  In other words, the proposal was that they should learn sufficient to go back and teach their teachers in the course of a few years, but that suggestion is being made at a time when the people who really matter with regard to this industry are being excluded from having a voice or any participation in the control of that industry.  We have heard a lot from the Government Party about parish committees, vocational councils, the extension of local authorities of all kinds, and so on, but this proposal seems to be a negation of all that has been preached by the Government in that regard.  If the principle that I suggest in amendment No. 1 is accepted, it will make it possible for amendment No. 10 to be moved, and that, in my opinion, would be as near as I can visualise for a vocational committee dealing with a particular industry such as pig production and bacon curing; but if my amendment is to be resisted and eventually lost, and if the Minister insists upon hand-picking three people <Col N="589" /> of his own choice, I think he can scarcely blame the pig producers, bacon curers and merchants in this country for not having confidence in this commission, and I think it will only tend to deepen the suspicion that things will not be well with regard to the pig and bacon industry in this country as a whole.</P>
    <P>As I stated on the Second Reading of the Bill, this is a Bill of very great importance to all sections of the community. The production of pigs and the curing of bacon are things that we should excel at, and I suggest that we ought to be able to excel in this industry under the ægis of this Bill, and that we ought to be able to extend that industry so as to be able to supply all our requirements at home as well as to supply the export trade, and give a fair return to the producer and, incidentally, to the consumer, and particularly the home consumer, who has been subsidising the industry at a very heavy cost and who, evidently, is going to be called upon again for further subsidies.  This commission is going to be invested with the powers of a tax-gatherer.  It is going to be enabled to call upon the consumers of bacon in this country to pay whatever levies may be necessary to provide the export bounties that may be required. That is a serious responsibility, and I suggest that the Minister ought not to go one step further in the direction that many people think the Government are heading towards, and that is towards sheer dictatorship and a wiping out of all the normal rights and privileges of democratic institutions. We have had experience already in this House of what the lack of control over big corporations, connected with lighting, sugar, and so on, lead to, and we do not want the pig and bacon industry to be taken over and controlled by three people of the Minister's own choosing or of his Department's choosing.  We think that the representation ought to be widened to the extent that is called for in the amendment, so as to enable all the interests concerned to be represented.</P>

      <P>This amendment appears to be an entirely crazy amendment.  For <Col N="590" /> four years now, we have sought in this House to get rid of a gang of plunderers and brigands in this country and we have got rid of them.  No sooner do we reach this first amendment than we have the Labour Party setting out to put the boys back again.  What did the Pigs and Bacon Marketing Boards consist of?  A few curers, two representatives of the producers and sundry other persons.  What actually happened? The board was run by the curers for the curers.  It ended up as a board of curers for curers by curers. Here is Deputy Keyes' proposal.  You cannot understand his amendment unless it is read in connection with amendment No. 10.  Instead of the proposed commission, we should have a board consisting of two persons who are licensed bacon curers&mdash;the same old tulips turning up again!&mdash;&ldquo;two persons having practical experience of pig raising, to represent pig producers; one person having practical experience of the retail distribution of bacon, to represent distributors of bacon; and one person having practical experience of employment in the bacon curing business, to represent workers employed in the business of bacon curing.&rdquo;  There will be two persons on the board, who made their fortunes during the last four years as bacon curers.  It is bacon curers and those who work in the bacon factories who have done very well&mdash;the curers by robbing the public, and the workers, by trade union representation, having secured substantial increases in wages.</P>

I warned this House that I was going to make it and I said it was a public scandal that I should be allowed to make it; and eventually I succeeded after many battles in getting the scandal which permitted it removed.  This amendment by Deputy Keyes is going to put me right back again in the old position to make another substantial sum at the expense of the consumers.</P>

What made the Labour Party suggest that the curers should be reinstated as the lords dictators of the bacon and pig industry of this country?

The Minister has given us this assurance here, that he will introduce an amendment to that effect; and I believe that there is an amendment here which is designed to give effect to that&mdash;though I believe, from my perusal of the Bill, inasmuch as certain officers are removable at the Minister's pleasure, that in itself gives us the right to raise in Dáil Eireann any matter relating to the activities of the commission.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>You are giving them the power to sit behind closed doors, presided over by a curer, and control the situation.  We have had two boards in existence with representatives of the pig producers&mdash;so called representatives during the last four years.  What did they do for the producers?  Had they the gumption to disagree with the curers?  If you look into the records, you will find that the decisions taken by that board were taken with the consent of the two persons on that board supposed to represent the producers. There is only one place where the interests of the pig producers and the bacon consumers are capable of being effectively protected and that is on the public floor of Dáil Éireann.  That is where they ought to be protected. There is only one institution in this State capable of protecting the people against the operations of an industry which is within the control of Denny, and that institution is the Parliament of the people.  There is no combination in this country that will have behind it force sufficient to fight vested interests like the bacon curers, led by Henry Denny, who is at the head of an international bacon combine.  There is no corporation or body which will have enough strength to fight that, other than the Parliament.  I urge on this House most strongly to reject this amendment and to insist that the only authority in this country powerful enough to control these ruthless men <Col N="594" /> will be enabled to deal with them if and when the situation arises, so that our people will no longer be exploited by international combines whose only concern is to screw out of the people the last drop of blood that the Parliament will allow them the power to squeeze.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am against this amendment, too, as my idea of this Bill (as I explained on the Second Reading) is that we should set up a commission composed of people not directly concerned in curing or producing but entirely as it were a commission to carry on the business and at the same time investigate the whole industry and make a report on what would be the best form of permanent organisation. As I said before, certain Deputies expressed the view here on the Second Reading, that all these functions that the boards have at the moment could quite well be carried on by the Minister and the Department. It is possible that this commission might report that that is their opinion, after some experience; and it is possible, on the other hand, that they may report that in their opinion a board should be set up composed as Deputy Keyes has outlined or as outlined by the Prices Commission or, perhaps, by the Agricultural Commission.  However, as an interim arrangement, I am anxious to have a commission of the kind contemplated in this Bill, to carry on these functions and eventually make a report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister give the House any information as to the type of persons likely to constitute this commission, the qualifications they are likely to have, and whether there is going to be representation on that commission for those engaged in the production of bacon for the standpoint of the pig producers and the standpoint of those engaged in the curing of bacon as an industry.  Would the Minister take the House into his confidence on that aspect of the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated here before that it was necessary to set up an export committee in view of the regulations <Col N="595" /> brought in by the British Government for the import of bacon into Great Britain.  That committee is composed, at the moment, of the chairman of the Pigs and Bacon board and of two civil servants, one of whom was in charge of the administrative end of all these Acts dealing with pigs, and the other in charge of technical questions that might arise in bacon factories and so on&mdash;in other words, a veterinary surgeon.  It is my intention to have the same people looking after export and on this commission.  They would be changed, of course, from time to time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to revert to the very unfair criticism by Deputy Dillon of my amendment.  He has not probably read the amendments through, but if he has, I must say that it was deliberately unfair, because the implication conveyed by his criticism was that this amendment wanted to take away control from this House and to vest all authority in this committee of seven which I propose, constituted of people representing the various branches of the bacon industry. In amendment No. 33, I have set down that:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Every regulation made by the commission under this section shall be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution annulling such resolution is passed by either House of the Oireachtas within the next subsequent 21 days on which that House has sat after such regulation is laid before it, such regulation should be annulled.&rdquo;...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was deliberately put in to retain the control of this House whatever the constitution of the commission is going to be.  I want it to be finally answerable to the House, and I am not half <Col N="596" /> as confident as Deputy Dillon seems to be that the Minister has gone far enough to assure us that the House is going to have that control, whether over a triumvirate or over seven people.</P>
    <P>I still suggest that the time has not come when we can afford completely to divorce from the commission the people who have built up the industry of pig rearing and bacon producing because of any allegations that Deputy Dillon may make, that some of these people have got inordinate profits, as we are told, in the past few years. There were two separate boards working and it is proposed now to have a fusion.  I suggest that no case has been made for wiping out from representation on that joint board the three interests concerned, and I believe that if we are going to have what I spoke of earlier, any confidence in the measure and any revival amongst bacon producers, whose confidence has been badly shattered by the constant repetition in this House that they are being robbed, right, left and centre, these interests should have representation. Confidence is what is going to increase the pig population, which is the first essential of this legislation, the first seed of the industry, and I suggest that the best means of getting that confidence is by a widely-drawn governing committee with representation for the people who produce the pigs, selected by the Minister on their nomination, and, similarly, for the bacon curers and the workers in the industry, who surely ought to know something about it and ought to be competent to advise the Minister just as much as three people whom he would select from outside the industry, and who, he hopes, will learn sufficient in three years to come back and educate him.  I think the amendment is very reasonable and ought to be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make this quite clear, that while I hope and pray this amendment will not be carried, because I think it would be disastrous, I deplore, as I said on Second Reading, the decision to appoint the chairman the Minister has in mind.  The Minister <Col N="597" /> has gravely prejudiced the whole Bill by that decision because the gentleman in question is no more competent to fill the position of chairman of the board than Lanna Machree's dog&mdash;less, in fact, because Lanna Machree's dog never made a ghastly failure of such a position, while the gentleman whom the Minister proposes to put at the head of the board has made a ghastly failure of a similar position he has held for the last four years.</P>

      <P>The matter has been raised by Deputy Keyes suggesting that a board constituted according to the Minister's prognostication is very much less attractive than the board he suggests. I should have no difficulty in differing from him categorically, but for the fact that the Minister informs us of the identity of the chairman and I confess at once that the Minister exposes his flank there, because the chairman proposed is a manifestly incompetent person.  All I can hope is that the other two members of the commission will habitually override the chairman.  Nevertheless, when he is awake to the fact that the chairman is bound to carry certain influence and that individual representations on behalf of interested parties will largely <Col N="598" /> fall to be considered by the chairman who, if he is an incompetent person, will not give those representations the kind of consideration they ought to get, I again urge on the Minister in that connection that if this bacon commission is to be allowed to appear as effective as it ought to appear, he should take the opportunity of availing of this gentleman's services in some other capacity, and put in as chairman of the commission some individual who will command the support of all Parties.  Such a person is not difficult to get.  There are dozens of men in this State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This particular amendment of mine, proposing to add a new section before Section 5, has been ruled out of order by the Chair.  The reasons given by the Chair for so ruling are not satisfactory to me, at least.  It may be my fault.  The Chair has ruled that: &ldquo;The subject matter of this amendment would, I think, have been more properly dealt with on Second Reading.  Amendments on Committee Stage must be related more specifically <Col N="601" /> to the sections of the Bill&rdquo;.  With regard to the first portion of that, as a matter of fact the subject matter was dealt with on Second Reading.  I, and other speakers, raised the question as to whether this Bill was, in fact, going to give us that fillip of production which we thought it was necessary that we should have.  The matter, as I have said, was raised by myself and other members.  This Bill, and the measure which it supersedes, proposes to deal with the regulation of pigs and bacon, and we feel that it is necessary that there should be a background to all that.  Perhaps the Chair thinks that that is met by a kind of pious resolution, by a kind of platitude of some sort or another.  We have a kind of background, if you like, in such documents as the Constitution.  We feel that for the people in charge of the Pigs Bill there ought to be some background which we can always fall back upon, and say that the background of the Bill was an endeavour, an attempt, to get a better production of pigs. That is my first reason for trying to get this amendment into the Bill.</P>
      <P>With regard to the second point, that amendments on Committee Stage must be related more specifically to sections of the Bill, I submit that this amendment is in very close relation to Section 4, and the amendment, if in order, would follow that section.  My aim in putting it down was to show what the duties, aims and objects of the commission, as set out in Section 4, ought to be.  That was the purpose I had in putting down the amendment, and I do not think, Sir, that your ruling is satisfactory on the matter.</P>

      <P>The functions of the commission were laid down in the Bill as read a Second Time.  On the Second Stage of a Bill, Deputies may debate not only what is in the Bill but what they would desire to see in the Bill.  Having passed the Second Stage, discussion is confined within the four walls of the Bill.  As far as the main principles go, it is obvious that the functions of this commission are an essential element of the Bill.  On the Second Stage, the points to which <Col N="602" /> the Deputy referred were debated.  In fact, amendment No. 2 might be taken as a <i>précis</i> of say columns 271 onwards of that discussion.  These things are advocated at length.  Such a measure as the Constitution would naturally be largely of a declaratory character. This is not a declaratory Bill.  It is a business Bill, designed for the management of a certain industry.  Amendment No. 2 seems to me to be merely declaratory, or it might be as the Deputy said, considered as a pious aspiration.  In Committee, amendments must be precise and related to particular sections.  They must try to achieve their purpose by amending those sections in so far as that is permissible within the main principles of the Bill.  Being declaratory and not necessary if those functions of the commission are already in the Bill, and being outside the scope of it if they are not, I have ruled amendments Nos. 2 and 3 out of order.</P>

      <P>I have given a ruling and it cannot be further discussed. The Deputy got full opportunity to put his point of view. Amendment No. 4.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  The person nominated by the Minister to be the chairman of the commission shall be a person recommended to him by the Civil Service Commissioners on the advice of a selection committee constituted from among the personnel of the commission or bodies which furnished the following reports, namely, the Report of the Tariff Commission on Bacon, Hams and other Pig Products (Report No. 14), 1932; the Report of the Pig Industries Tribunal, 1933; the Report of the Prices Commission on the Prices charged for Bacon including Hams and Gammons, 1938.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for this amendment is obvious.  We had under the last Pigs and Bacon Board a chairman who apparently was selected by the Minister <Col N="603" /> himself and who has not given satisfaction.  It was found by an independent tribunal, the Prices Commission, that certain things happened. We felt, and the country feels, that it was the business of that chairman, as the representative of the Minister, and, if you like, of this House, to report back to the Minister and through him to this House on the happenings that were taking place. We do not want a repetition of that under this measure.</P>
    <P>The Minister informed us to-day that the person who acted as chairman in the past is going to be the chairman of this new commission.  I will read for the Minister some remarks of his own which he made on the Pigs and Bacon Bill of 1934 when it was in Committee. I am reading from column 149.  The Minister said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Naturally to a position like this a person is not appointed for life.  He may not be a success and have to be removed in a few years.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was the Minister's opinion at that time of the person who might be appointed chairman of the Pigs and Bacon Board.  Is the Minister prepared to stand up now and say that that gentleman was a success in that position? I do not know the gentleman at all.  I do not know who he is, and I do not know what his qualifications for the job are, but I do know that he certainly did not make a success of his job under the old measure.  The Minister comes along now and tells us that he is going to put him back into that job, into the same position, and that he will have the same power and authority as he had in the past.  I am proposing in this amendment that a selection board be set up of persons, as set out in the amendment, who have special knowledge in this regard.  If the Minister agrees to my amendment this much will be achieved: that you will be establishing confidence in the minds of the producers of the country.</P>
    <P>If the Minister persists in making the appointment which he has suggested to the House that he was about to <Col N="604" /> make, it is certain that he cannot establish confidence in the commission. We cannot have a prosperous industry of any kind without confidence.  People cannot go heartily into an industry unless they are confident that they are going to get a fair deal.  We cannot have an increase in pig production in this country without establishing confidence. That certainly is essential.  If we are going to establish confidence in the commission we must have a chairman selected by persons who have some knowledge of the pig industry. I do not mind in what way or where or how the Minister gets this selection committee.  The Minister ought to take some steps to establish that confidence which is necessary.  Unless he does something of the nature I have indicated in this amendment he will not have the confidence of the public in the commission.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not admit at all that the chairman of these two boards has been unsatisfactory.  As I have already said, these two boards had to carry out the Acts under which the boards were established.  These Acts were passed by the Oireachtas.  The chairman had certain functions outside the boards.  One thing that he was anxious to do was to get information from the manufacturers on the matter of costings, so that something could be done even from the very beginning to find out what was the ordinary margin that the curers should get for the curing of bacon.  This was quite necessary in order to carry out the Acts properly. That was there for that purpose and it was tried.  It took a long time before it was eventually found that the Acts were defective and that this information could not be got from the curers in the way that we would like to get it.  In this Bill we are putting in a clause to make it perfectly clear that all the facts in relation to the cost of the manufacture of bacon can be got from the manufacturers.  I hope the commission will then be in a position to say what is a fair margin for the curers, and then give a fair return to the producer.  I go further than that. I am quite satisfied that the chairman of these two boards did his duty well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="605" /> But even if I were not so satisfied I think it would be very difficult for three new men to go in there and take over the working of a new board or commission to carry on from the beginning. It would be necessary to have some sort of a liaison or carry-over from one of these boards to the commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be there. Another point arises.  We would have to adopt one or other course here: (1) Either I as Minister am to be directly responsible for this; if the Minister is directly responsible, then let him make his own selection and if he finds that selection is not satisfactory let him make changes; let him be held responsible to the Dáil.  And (2) on the other hand, if we are to go in another direction and if the personnel is to be appointed by any other method, then the Minister cannot be responsible.  If the Dáil or Oireachtas pass legislation here laying down certain procedure for the appointment of the commission, then the Oireachtas must take the responsibility for the work of the commission.  I prefer personally to take the line of giving the Minister the making of the appointments and afterwards holding the Minister responsible for putting the reports before the Dáil and for anything that may go wrong as a result of his selection.  It is for that reason that I am not prepared to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it to be argued that because the Civil Service Commission appoints the civil servants that therefore Ministers are not to be held responsible for the way in which these discharge their duties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is not the point. Before the Deputy developed on that line I had meant as a matter of fact to deal with it.  The secretary is <Col N="606" /> appointed by the Government.  In practice, I think Deputies will accept it that the Minister in whose Department that person is, has a big say in the matter.  It is true that the civil servants are appointed by the Civil Service Commission, but at least the Minister has sufficient confidence in the secretary of his Department.  I do not look upon this present appointment as anything like that, but it is at least something on the same lines.  I think the Minister should have this appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is perfectly manifest that this House is not primarily concerned in unduly interfering with the Minister's discretion in this matter. But there is the alternative method of choosing the chairman.  Here it is proposed to appoint the one man in all Ireland who has proved himself to be supremely incompetent for the job. Surely the Minister cannot argue that he made a brilliant success as Chairman of the Pigs Marketing Board and of the Bacon Marketing Board.  The Minister may argue that he did not disgrace himself, but it is true that at one stage the curers came together and divided up the hypothetical price fund between themselves without any regard as to what was just.  We know that the Prices Commission did report that while this particular man was chairman of the two boards, a situation was allowed to develop in which a sum of £350,000 was improperly taken from the public by the curers.  Those things are facts and there is no escape from them. I do not particularly blame this man. He was up against a very formidable conspiracy, and I think the wool was pulled over his eyes.  That being so, I say now that if the Minister wants the co-operation of the people and if he wants public confidence in this scheme &mdash;that confidence which is so requisite if the scheme is to be a success&mdash;why does he insist on choosing the one individual in the country who, as everybody knows, has incapacitated himself from filling this post adequately?  We are prepared to leave this appointment to the Civil Service Commission or the Local Appointments Commission.  We would be prepared to leave it to anybody. I do not think we could get anybody <Col N="607" /> body in reason who, on the face of it, is less competent to fill this post than the man suggested by the Minister. The Minister feels that unless he is allowed to appoint this particular individual, he cannot have any responsibility at all.  Why not let him refer the appointment to the Local Appointments Commission or to the Civil Service Commission?  I would be prepared to see this amendment dropped if the Minister announces that he would be prepared to choose anybody other than the person he has suggested.  I have nothing personally against that man.  I had no dealings with him.  I never met him but once in connection with some question of the pig industry in Donegal. All I know about him is his public record as chairman of the two boards.  I would be prepared to accept anybody nominated by the Minister or his advisers to this post, except the person suggested by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister made a very bad case for himself and a very bad case for his new chairman. The Minister has tried to create the impression that the chairman was so hide-bound under the Act that he really could not do the things that were expected of him.  It is an extraordinary thing that the Prices Commission were able to find all the details, all the costings, and to arrive at certain findings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They had the power; he had not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>He had power when the thing was reported to come to the Minister, who should have brought it before the House, but nobody apparently took any interest in it.  It did not matter what they did away with, whether it was £350,000 or £1,000,000 or £2,000,000; nobody appeared to care.  What has given rise to this amendment is that the Minister has intimated that he was going to put back as the new chairman the man in whom we have no confidence and in whom the country has no confidence. Pig production went down while he was chairman.  Everything went down while he was chairman except the profits of the bacon curers.  They went up, and <Col N="608" /> he stood by and let them go up, and he stood by and let the distribution of £350,000 be made without reporting it. If the Minister says &ldquo;I am not going to bring that man back again.&rdquo;  I am quite prepared to withdraw the amendment. I am quite prepared to withdraw it if the Minister will say: &ldquo;I have an open mind in the matter, and I will go out and select whosoever I think is best fitted for the position,&rdquo; but he must be a person who has a record before this country of some ability to run the job.  I am quite prepared to do that, but I think it is asking too much to ask us to withdraw our amendment and agree&mdash;because it is tantamount to that&mdash;to putting back as the new chairman the man who has made such a mess of the job in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point on which I should like to be clear.  I think the less we argue about this the better.  If the result is going to be that the Dáil agrees with me, and that this man goes in as chairman, then the less talk the better if the attitude of the Deputies opposite is that they have no trust in him.  With regard to the Prices Commission, the chairman of the boards did report to me that he was disappointed in the powers he had in regard to getting costings.  It took some time before he found that the powers were defective, because he had to try several times to get those costings. I think Deputies will realise how slow it is to get legal opinion, and how long it takes before you come to a final conclusion that the thing is actually defective, because I think some of the lawyers did believe the original Act was all right and some believed it was not; eventually it was decided that it was defective, and they could not insist on getting costings. The Prices Commission were coming along then.  The chairman was satisfied to let the Prices Commission find out what the position was.  When the Prices Commission reported, we were drafting an amending Act.  We delayed the drafting of that Act until the Agricultural Commission would also have reported, but in the meantime we felt that the Prices Commission were at least able to keep the bacon <Col N="609" /> curers from making exorbitant profits, because that was their business, and we did not feel there was any urgency for the amending of the law as long as the Prices Commission were there to watch the situation.  I do not think the chairman of those boards could be accused of having been negligent as far as that goes.  There may have been certain delay in my Department.  There is always delay in Departments on matters like that, and I think if Deputies opposite were to be just it would be found that the fault would lie with my Department and with myself at least equally as much as with the chairman if there was neglect.  I do not know whether the chairman will be satisfactory in this new job or not. If he is not, I will have power to change him, and I can assure Deputies that if in my opinion any one of the three is unsatisfactory, I will have no hesitation about changing him.</P>

      <P>The chairman explained that before the Prices Commission examined it at all.  I am not able to defend this thing here now, because I would have to look up the details, but at the time I can say that it appeared to me it was reasonable.  They were prevented by laws, or regulations, I forget which, from paying anything out of the hypothetical fund over a long period, and had only a short period in which they could pay it.  Instead of paying 4/- or 5/- on bacon exports over a long period they could only pay 40/-, or whatever it was, over a short period, which would amount to the same thing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of fact it was a scandalous transaction.  The chairman might have come along and said: &ldquo;Here is a matter that came under my purview, and I recommend that the law be amended&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely it was a gross perversion of the purposes of the law, or the Prices Commission would not have made the report it did?  Surely a person in that position, with immense funds under his control, has upon him a special responsibility as trustee, and should have come to the Minister and said: &ldquo;Those men make a case, which I report to you, but so long as I am trustee of those funds they will not be shadily distributed as is proposed.  If they are to be so distributed, let Parliament say so, and I will give effect to the decision of Parliament, but I will be no party to a semi-fraud designed to get around the letter of the statute.&rdquo; It seems to me that on every occasion when he should have been the guardian of the producers, and the watchdog of the consumers and the producers, against the vested interests which were represented there, instead of thinking first of those whose trustee he was, he seemed to be thinking first of the curers against whom he was put in to keep constant watch.  I can well understand that, if one comes in constant contact on a board of that kind with very able men, such as the curers' representatives were, one is inclined to <Col N="611" /> get more and more under their influence, simply because they are always able to put their case cogently and well, while the less initiated members of the boards are more tongue-tied and less facile in putting their case forward.  It is just for that contingency that one chooses a strong, resolute man to be chairman, a man who will take under his protection the less eloquent interests, and, where they fail to make their case cogently and effectively, will come to their aid and fill in the gaps which they themselves are unable to fill in, and see to it that the astute and well-spoken and glib advocate does not get away with everything.</P>
      <P>My indictment against this man is that he signally failed there, and in fact proved himself to be a weak man, easily dominated by the astute and able vested interests, and that the net result was that the interests of the producer and the consumer, for whom he stood as trustee, were hopelessly betrayed. The net fact is that the curers went in to the Pigs and Bacon Marketing Boards with a very modest degree of prosperity and came out millionaires. Those are the inescapable facts.  What pig producer in this country is the better off from the activities of those two boards, of which Mr. O'Brien was chairman?  What curer in Ireland is worse off as a result of the activities of those boards?  Who were those boards primarily designed to serve?  Was it the pig producer or was it the curer? I understand it was the pig producer, but four years' administration have resulted in the men whom those boards were designed to serve, the producers, being made bankrupt, and the men whom those boards were designed to watch, the curers, getting away with plunder unprecedented in the commercial life of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="612" /> The Minister argues with me that that man did his job well.  I cannot see it.  I do not think anyone could have done his job worse, and I think it is a terrible pity the Minister insists on forcing this man upon us when he would be perfectly well employed in some other job and a suitable person chosen to complete the personnel of this board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Deputy McGilligan, I move amendment No. 5:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To add at the end of sub-section (2) the following words:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If and whenever the Minister terminates the period of office of a person nominated by him under this section the Minister shall lay before each House of the Oireachtas a statement in writing of the fact of such termination of office and the reasons therefor.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is only in effect a request to the Minister to implement the promises he has made to the House.  The Minister will realise that in that matter of reporting back to the House, the business, certain reports, and so on, that will arise from this new commission, we feel it necessary&mdash;and I am sure the Minister himself will feel it necessary&mdash;that he should also report back to the House what is asked of him under this particular sub-section, that is, whenever the Minister terminates the period of office of a person nominated by him under this section that he will report that back to the House.  It is a reasonable amendment, and I am sure the Minister will readily agree to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Deputy was right in stating that there was an undertaking given for that to be done.  There was an undertaking certainly that all the proceedings <Col N="615" /> would be reported to the House and if any person were changed that would be noted, but I do not like this point &mdash;&ldquo;and the reasons therefor&rdquo;.  I will tell the Deputy why.  That appears to me to make it very much more difficult to change a person than it would be in the ordinary way.  I might think a person was not suitable, after some experience.  I might ask that person to resign so that I could make room for somebody else.  In all probability, he would resign and would not put me to the point of dismissing him from the board.  But I think that if I were faced with stating reasons to the Dáil for having to remove a man I would be much slower to do it than otherwise I would be.  I think in the interests of efficiency, if you like, it is not a desirable amendment from that point of view.  As I say, it will be reported to the Dáil if any person is changed, but I think that to ask for the reasons would make it much more difficult to make a change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it quite wise for the Minister, under sub-section (3) of Section 5, to set out that if the chairman gets ill he will nominate a person, one of the ordinary members, to become chairman, giving him all the powers?  Then, apparently, they will carry on with just two persons, and only two.  I wonder if that is wise. If you want three people to consider a matter of importance it might be better for the Minister to undertake to appoint a chairman for the time being, not necessarily one of the ordinary members.  My worry about the thing <Col N="617" /> is that I do not like having the board consisting just of two people.</P>

      <P>I do not want the Minister exactly to take that word &ldquo;administrative&rdquo; in the sense in which he would take it as regards a civil servant, as with &ldquo;administrative&rdquo; I would include &ldquo;technical&rdquo;.  We feel it is necessary that these two ordinary members ought to have some experience of the work, some experience of the job, no matter what way you look at it, and that we should not have as the two ordinary members people who had no experience of pigs and bacon, either of the productive end or the other end.  I do not want to embarrass the Minister with the amendment because I do not think it is very important, but I want to point out that we ought to be careful when putting persons in such positions that they have some experience of the business which they are appointed to carry out.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this amendment and of amendment No. 14 is to secure that the payment of the salaries of the commission will be brought under the review of this House.

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 11, after the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to insert the words &ldquo;subject to the sanction of the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We think this is important.  We do not like relieving the Minister of the responsibility for these things.  I would prefer having the Minister responsible rather than an outside authority of this sort.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>In sub-section (4), line 24, to delete the word &ldquo;Commission&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious, of course, what is at the back of Deputy McGilligan's mind in putting down this amendment and that is, not to give this commission authority to appoint a whole host of officers of their own selection.  We feel that that ought to be in the hands of the Minister.  In fact, we are not enamoured with handing over this <Col N="621" /> business to a commission of this sort. That was expressed very strongly on the Second Reading, and this is an attempt to bring back to the Minister a responsibility which we are afraid is leaving the Minister at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that would be a very awkward position, more than awkward, an impossible position.  I do not know if Deputies who have not been in Ministerial positions realise how difficult it is for a Minister to select from a number of applications for a particular job the one that would be most suitable.  The commission have the responsibility for the working of this office, and they are in a better position than the Minister to make a selection.  I ask Deputies not to press the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Supposing the Commission wished to appoint, with the consent of the Minister, are you not prepared to take that responsibility? We do not think it is fair to hand over full powers to a body of this sort.  In the amendment we are asking the Minister to retain that power.  In fact I would accept this wording, to provide that the Minister's consent is necessary. I do not want the Minister to determine what officers are required, their numbers or qualifications, but this body ought to be obliged to get his consent.</P>

      <P>May I put this point, that we do not know what the personnel of the commission may be, but the staff, at all events, ought to be recruited, seeing that this body is akin to the Civil Service, and not an asylum for old men or old women or for friends of the commissioners.  Will the Minister give the House an assurance that, so far as the commission is concerned, it would be required to recruit the staff by open competitive examinations, so that everybody, including those who have to pay levies on home produced bacon, for the purpose of selling that bacon cheaper in the British market, will have an opportunity of competing?  Let us measure recruitment with fair play, by letting everyone have a fair chance of getting into <Col N="622" /> the service of the commission, rather than have a method of indiscriminate selection.  It often happens that the more people one knows the easier it is to get a passport to a job.  I want to prevent that, and I am sure the Minister does.</P>

      <P>I do not care to contemplate a world peopled exclusively by pigs or that the human race has disappeared, because people as a class will probably survive the Fianna Fáil Party. I agree with Deputy Norton that the further we spread the principle of the public services being recruited by competitive <Col N="623" /> examinations, and the further we get away from the old-fashioned British system of patronage, the better it is for the public services.  The Minister very reasonably says that he wants to disembarrass himself of the invidious task of choosing public servants.  Deputy Norton and I are pressing him a little further, not only to disembarrass himself of that disagreeable task but to disembarrass the commissioners of the task, and require them by statute to fill vacancies, the necessity for which the Minister has approved, with persons chosen by competitive examination.  Then if the commissioners are approached to make a sinecure for a deserving person, they will be in a position to say: &ldquo;Even if we did make a sinecure, and persuaded the Minister to consent to the creation of a sinecure, no one could guarantee that the person you have in mind would be appointed, because it is left to open examinations and anyone might get the job.&rdquo;  There ought to be no difficulty about that.  In practice I think that is what the Electricity Supply Board does.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <P>We have been talking a good deal on the question whether the Minister can be questioned about the proceedings of the commission.

I agree with them that if we could get a position in which we would have a debate once or twice a year on questions affecting the commission, and have no questions put in the meantime, it would be the ideal position.  If the commission were to withdraw a licence from a factory, for instance, it might not be advisable that I should be questioned about it here forthwith.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise an entirely different matter&mdash;a question of principle.  This Pigs Commission will be, or ought to be, a sort of subdepartment of the Department of Agriculture.  We cannot compare it in its entirety with the Electricity Supply Board or the Sugar Board because it will not have any resources of its own on which it can fall back.  Its funds will be entirely derived from levies imposed <Col N="628" /> upon the producers of pigs.  It is set out in the section that the Minister for Finance may direct that certain demands from the Ministry of Finance be met as recoupment for the services of civil servants seconded to that particular work.  We are placing this new board in the same position as the Sugar Company or the Electricity Supply Board, who have resources of their own and are carrying on commercial undertakings.  I do not think that it is fair to divorce the Department of Agriculture in that way from the particular type of work to be carried on by this commission.  After all, the Department of Agriculture is being subsidised by the country for the purpose of promoting agriculture and this is a branch of agriculture.  It is questionable that it is fair to impose upon pig producers responsibilities for the recoupment to the Ministry of Finance of sums paid to civil servants who are seconded in that way.</P>
      <P>Section agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not clear whether the disclosure of information under Section 39 of the Act of 1937 would be included in that saving clause.  If the Minister persists in having the chairman of the commission as a member of the arbitration body, he would have certain information at the back of his mind that he had obtained as a member of the board and I think it would be right that the other members of the arbitration body should be supplied with that information. Otherwise, he would be armed with more information than his colleagues <Col N="629" /> on the board might have.  If the words are not put in he might shelter behind the prohibition regarding disclosure of that information.</P>

      <P>Surely, what it means is this: Suppose that a person is alleged to have committed a crime, and it is sought to prove against him that he has systematically indulged in this criminal practice, you cannot call a member of the Bacon Commission into court and say: &ldquo;In the reports made by this man to the Bacon Commission over the past ten years, has it not repeatedly turned up that he engaged in the criminal practices with which he is now charged?&rdquo;, with a view to demonstrating that the crime that he has committed is part of a system of crime that he has been committing in the past.  That seems to me to be the purpose of the words proposed to be struck out, because the words proposed to be struck out restrict the restriction of proceedings taken under the Pigs and Bacon Acts of 1935 and 1937 or of this Act.  When we strike out these words, we prevent a member of the commission coming into court in connection with any civil or criminal proceedings that may arise.  In other words, if you strike out the words that Deputy McGilligan, in this amendment, proposes to strike out, you prevent a member of the commission going into court to give evidence in relation to information that he has acquired in connection with sub-section (1) of Section 10 of this Bill.</P>

      <Col N="633" /> This is to ensure that the Minister will be given an opportunity to avail of sub-section (3) of Section 6, which gives the Minister authority to appoint an ordinary member of the commission where somebody is temporarily incapacitated.  Our idea is that we do not want the business to fall into the hands of two persons, and we think it would be advisable that the Minister should be informed of the fact that any member cannot attend, giving his reasons for non-attendance.  I think the proposal in the amendment is reasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose it is reasonable, but I do not know if it would be practicable in all cases.  For instance, there are small matters in connection with which the board must meet from time to time.  Take the case of one of the ordinary members of the commission, who was going on holidays.  Before going on his holidays, he would probably make inquiries as to what serious business there was to be disposed of, and an arrangement might be come to whereby that business might be dealt with before he went on his holidays or held over until he came back, but there might be a few small or routine matters in connection with which he would say to his fellow members: &ldquo;I have no objection to your dealing with these matters while I am away.&rdquo;  I do not think it is likely that, in practice, any one of the three members would permit serious business to be done in his absence.  I think it is better that we should not be bound by a rigid phrase like that.</P>

    <P>It does not call for much explanation. It seems to be a reasonable kind of proposal, and I imagine the Minister would be prepared to approve of it. It means that any person taking an interest in a bacon curing business, or in any kind of business over which the commission is designed to exercise restrictions, cannot be a member of the commission.</P>

      <P>At the end of sub-section (2), line 38, to add the words &ldquo;together with copies of such information, statistics, and returns furnished to him by the commission under this Act as may be necessary for the proper understanding of such report.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is founded on the electricity supply legislation.  It was argued then, and I think clearly established to the view of the House which then discussed it, that the report and accounts might mean little or nothing and that there might not be the amount of information necessary to clarify certain accounts. Under the electricity supply legislation, the Minister would have to make up his mind as to what statistical information or other information would be necessary for the clarification of accounts.  I think when he got enough to clarify the situation, he was bound to bring all such information before the House.  This is an attempt to bring that situation about.  It says:&mdash;&ldquo;together with copies of such information, statistics, and returns furnished to him by the commission under this Act as may be necessary for the proper understanding of such report&rdquo;.  It has clearly that simple intention.  The Minister definitely knows that a bare statement brought before the House by this body may not mean anything, but if the Minister would have under this particular proposal a duty passed on him, he would thoroughly understand the accounts and be in a position to explain <Col N="638" /> them before the House, and he would probably in such a case have other information and other reports and statistics and these would have to be brought before the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I refer the Minister in this connection to the rather elaborate reports published each year by the Electricity Supply Board.  They are not at all confined to a statement of revenue and to the things put down here&mdash;revenue account, profit and loss account and balance sheet&mdash;and proposed by Deputy Norton.  They do include those, however. The Electricity Supply Board's report has become somewhat stereotyped here now, but in the early stages they produced a comprehensive report giving all the information which would be required in order to inquire reasonably into the matter and understand the position of the board.  I suggest to the Minister that something of the same sort ought to be done.  For example, one might want to understand how the pig industry as such is faring under the guidance of this particular commission. Merely giving accounts does not indicate that.  The Minister knows the Pig Industries Tribunal report which was published.  I do not at all expect that the commission would publish anything like that year after year, but they might publish something which would embody the main features of such a report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

Sub-section (3) says the Minister is entitled to get from the commission information, statistics, and returns; and if (2) and (3) were put into one sub-section and all that laid before the House, it would cover the point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 28:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="639" /> Before sub-section (3), to insert the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(3)  It shall be competent for either House of the Oireachtas at any time to consider every report or statement of accounts or other information concerning the proceedings and transactions of the commission which, under this section, the commission are required to furnish, make or transmit to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Frankly, the object of this amendment is to bring the activities of the commission under review by this House, believing that once we part with complete control of the pig rearing and bacon curing industry to a commission of three persons, it is necessary to provide safeguards, not merely for those engaged in pig rearing and bacon curing, and in the bacon curing industry as a means of livelihood, but for the consumer and for the general well-being of the industry as well.  It does not seem to me that anywhere in the Bill is there adequate provision for that, and the object of the amendment is to ensure that it shall be competent for either House of the Oireachtas to consider every report and statement of accounts relating to the commission's transactions, so that we will have an opportunity of focussing the floodlight of publicity on the commission's activities, and in that way be able to ventilate any grievance which may come to light in the course of the commission's activities and, at the same time, to ventilate any grievance which may arise in connection with the work of the commission.  I think it is an eminently reasonable amendment, particularly when we give a commission of this kind such very wide powers, because, bear in mind that these powers virtually include the right to levy taxation on home-consumed bacon for the purpose of subsidising the selling of that bacon at a lower price in an export market.  Therefore, we ought to have an opportunity of reviewing its activities and expressing a viewpoint with regard to these activities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know exactly what the amendment leads to.  By the <Col N="640" /> section as I propose to have it amended, the commission would, in the first instance, have to supply all the audited accounts with regard to revenue, profit and loss, and so on, and also such statistics, tables and other matters the Minister might ask for. All these would be laid before the House, and, according to the procedure, the House could discuss them. I do not know if the Deputy is getting any further than that in his amendment, and I do not know whether it is any addition to the section.  Deputy Dillon wanted to raise a point as to how far the House should interfere in this business, and I think it might be well to settle the point at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to go this distance.  The House will remember that Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Cosgrave, both men who have had Ministerial experience, intervened on Second Reading to point out that they very much doubted whether it was desirable from anybody's point of view that the Minister should be open to day-to-day inquiry as to details of the day-to-day administration of this commission. Their experience weighs very much with me, and all I am concerned to do is to retain in this House the power to protect the consumer of bacon and the producer of pigs from exploitation of any kind, if such protection should ever become necessary.  Therefore, if the matter is brought before the House from time to time and here discussed, I believe that protection will be forthcoming.  Some people might say: &ldquo;What will you do if there is an abuse current and the report of the commission is not due to come before the Dáil for several months?&rdquo; My answer to that is: &ldquo;It is true that it may be necessary to allow that abuse to continue until we get the chance of discussing it, but the knowledge that it is going to be discussed sooner or later will, in itself, act as a very effective deterrent on this commission from doing anything which they know Dáil Eireann would disapprove of, if they came to discuss it.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, the first plan that suggests itself is that a report on all fours with the report of the Electricity Supply Board should be requisitioned and that <Col N="641" /> the procedure in that regard should be followed.  The procedure there is that the Minister for Industry and Commerce presents to the House the annual report of the Electricity Supply Board, and anyone who wants to debate it can apply for a day, but, so far as I know, he has no constitutional right, no statutory right, to get it.  He can get a day if he can persuade the Government Whip to prevail on the Government to make available Government time for its discussion, but he is frequently stalled off.  It may be that we, the principal Opposition, or the Labour Party, may bring sufficient influence to bear on the Government to force them to give a day, but if Deputy Cole, Deputy Burke of Clare, or some other independent Deputy, wants to discuss some matter arising out of the report, their representations may not carry sufficient weight to get Government time when they could make their view heard.</P>
    <P>I suggest, therefore, that there should be a slight difference in the procedure here.  This is a business that affects every small farmer in the country, and it is a business in regard to which we have already burned our fingers, and I, therefore, ask the Minister to consent to the procedure of an annual, or semi-annual report which he would be required to get the House to adopt.  That would impose on the Minister the obligation of putting it on the Order Paper.  In many years, he might get it passed like the Expiring Laws Bill in ten minutes, but in years where there was a grievance abroad, he would have a row.  He would know that, if he tolerated abuses, he was going to have the deuce of a row when he brought the commission's report before the Dáil, and he would know that he could not avoid doing so because there was a statutory obligation on him to get it adopted by the Dáil.  If that is done, I think it is a sufficient safeguard, and I am prepared to accept it.</P>

      <P>The difficulty I find myself in this matter is that, as I understand the Minister's proposals, he is going to have a chairman who is independent, in the sense that he is not going to be a civil servant, and two civil servants on the commission.

      <P>In any event, it is coming back more into the House.  The Minister will have charge of them. They are part of his establishment. They may be off for some part of the day or week, but I do not see how, in those circumstances, the Minister can prevent himself being questioned from day to day.  At the time the Electricity Supply Board was set up, there was a different plan.  The idea then was that the board should be flung out at arm's length from Government, and that Government should not be allowed to interfere; but it was also realised that as that board was getting a very big advantage in the way of having public credit and certain public moneys at its disposal, the community ought to get something.  The something required was the greatest publicity, and the way in which that was arranged was that the House was invited to suggest what they thought the Minister should be empowered to require from them, and the Minister was made to bring that before the House.  As we all know, a <Col N="643" /> matter can be laid on the Table, and, if a resolution is put down calling for censure or making some point on it, the matter may lie there for months, but there was a promise given when that Bill was going through that if anybody having the support of the Party indicated that he wanted the report discussed, it would be a matter for arrangement with the Whips.  There was a definite background of promise that Government time would be given, but, in fact, that time has never been asked for in connection with the Electricity Supply Board reports.  They gave such full information that it has not been found necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's difficulty, however, is somewhat different from the one I am speaking of.  The Minister on this amendment appropriately says that even if you set out in the amendment that it shall be competent for either House to consider every report, it is always competent for the House to consider any report that is put before it.  The point is not the competency of the House to do so but to get an opportunity to discuss it.  I know of no precedent where there is this requirement that the Minister should bring in a report and should within a limited period get the approval of the House for it.  I do not know of any precedent for that but it is a thing that will have to be done if we are going to have the functions of Government more and more distributed over boards of this kind. Some new procedure under the Parliamentary institution will have to be evolved whereby these things are brought into the House and are open for discussion.  The Minister is right when he says that there is no precedent for this but I think he should try to make up his mind as between two systems: firstly, bring the board back into the House, have the Minister responsible for it and have it shot at daily by questions in the House or, alternatively, push it as far as possible from the House and then try to devise some system whereby you would have full publicity at stated periods for what it has done and whereby there would be an obligation on the Minister to bring <Col N="644" /> in a report, to be guaranteed by a statutory requirement.  Opportunity would have to be given for a discussion of the report if Deputies asked for it.</P>

      <P>As I have said, I expect this commission is to be a temporary arrangement, and we are likely, at the end of a year or two, to have either the Department of Agriculture doing this job or to have a board composed of entirely outside people.  As it is a temporary arrangement, if the House would be satisfied, I have no hesitation in agreeing that, after the report is laid on the Table, the House should have an opportunity of approving or disapproving of it.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether he would be prepared to consider introducing a revolutionary procedure in this matter, whether he could not be persuaded to impose upon himself a statutory obligation to get the report adopted by Dáil Eireann within a certain number of weeks after it is presented to the House.  If that proves intolerably onerous in respect of this commission, we shall have learned a lesson and, as the whole scheme is experimental, it can be rejected at the end of the experimental period if it has proved to be a failure.  If, on the other hand, it proves to be successful then it might be possible to extend it to other Departments to the great advantage of everybody. It might be possible to decentralise a great deal of the routine business which we are reluctant to decentralise at the present time.</P>

      <P>What the Minister is thinking of is Orders and regulations. They impose obligations on outside people.  The report of the commission would not be doing anything of that kind.  It would be simply a record of what had been done.  If the House should express disagreement with what the commission had done over a period, there are two alternatives: the Minister <Col N="645" /> gets out or he gets the commission out but there is no such aftermath or consequence as would naturally be in our minds if we were considering Orders or regulations.  I do suggest that Deputy Dillon's proposal might be considered.  It is unfortunate that this proposal arises only in connection with a Bill which we are told is only of a temporary character and also in regard to a Bill which may cover a body which is only to a small extent under the control of the House or is entirely independent. It is a pity that in such a Bill, which is a &ldquo;mix-between,&rdquo; we should be discussing a thing which is a completely new and bad procedure, namely that Governmental work is being thrown into the hands of outside bodies and these bodies are being removed from the control of the House and from day-to-day criticism.  We are taking matters out of the control of the House.  I think it would be worth while if the Minister brought in a suggestion on the lines of Deputy Dillon's proposal, that the Minister should, within a certain time, have the report produced and should bring forward a resolution calling for the approval of the report.</P>

      <P>I take it that the form of the motion submitted by the Minister would be that the House approve of the report but circumstances might arise in which the Minister would ask the House to disapprove of the report. He would explain to the House why he proposed to do that and why he proposed to invite the House to join with him in disapproving of the commission's report.  Alternatively, he might come in and try to whitewash the commission.  The House might take a different view and reject the Minister's motion and in that event the Minister and the commission would have to go.  It is quite possible that the Minister would come in himself and condemn the report and ask the House to join with him in condemnation of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if this power was also given to the Pigs Marketing Board with regard to the hypothetical levy fund.  It was thought that, at times, the fund might become exhausted, and that it might be necessary to borrow for a short period.  I do not know if it will ever be necessary here.  I take it that they will collect these levies monthly and pay out monthly.  It is possible that the amount of the levy may be a little bit below the amount required, so that the fund might get overdrawn before they raised the levy.  I do not see how they can meet their commitments in regard to the fund unless by means of borrowing, to some extent, before they raise the levy, so that they will be able to meet their increased requirements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is going to be borrowing in the sense that I understand it, then it is certainly a matter for bringing in Ministerial authority and supervision, especially when this big step is being taken of removing these matters from outside the control of the Oireachtas.  I do see the difficulty that they might get into, and, in order to meet it, require an overdraft from time to time, but when I read the word &ldquo;borrow&rdquo; in the section I did not give it that significance. I thought it was really a question of raising loans.  I suggest to the Minister that he should have the section amended to read:&mdash;</P>
      <P>may for the purpose, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, borrow on the security of the fund.</P>
      <P>I do not see why they should not have to come to the Minister for that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is well to remember that under the old boards pretty large amounts, such as £750,000, were being handled, and that there were occasions upon which, within 48 hours, you had £250,000 sterling disbursed.  Suppose the commission marched into their bankers and disbursed £300,000 on an overdraft, and that it subsequently transpired this money should not have been disbursed at all, it would be very awkward.  I can see the draftsman's difficulty in choosing words which would permit the commission to have a reasonable discretion in raising an overdraft on their current account, while at the same time restraining them from contracting large liabilities. But could something not be drafted which would require the commission to get authority from the Minister for Finance to apply to their bankers for leave to overdraw so much?  If that were done, they would be limited to the overdraft which the Minister for Finance had approved of.  If, from time to time, it is desired, even temporarily, to get further bankers' increased accommodation, they would require them to go back to the Minister for Finance and get his permission to ask the bankers for that increased accommodation.  The situation then would be, as I envisage it, that on the 1st January, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, the commission would apply to their bankers for authority to overdraw their account to the tune of £10,000 at any time; but that if, in the middle of May, it appeared they would require an overdraft of £25,000, they would go back to the Minister for Finance and, having got his authority, would apply to their bankers for authority to overdraw the account to the extent of £25,000.  In the absence of the second application, the Minister would know that they could not overdraw beyond £10,000 and, in addition, the bankers would not be entitled to give an overdraft beyond that sum unless evidence was produced to them that fresh permission was forthcoming from the Department of Finance for a larger overdraft.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest, as a way out of the difficulty, that the Minister might insert words to the effect that <Col N="650" /> they might &ldquo;within such limits as were authorised by the Minister for Finance borrow on the security of the fund&rdquo;. That, I think, would give them some manæuvring space in cases where they wanted to get, say, an overdraft of a couple of hundred pounds.  If there was this limit, the Minister would always have control, and the Dáil would have control through the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the procedure may have been when Deputy McGilligan was Minister for Industry and Commerce, but the tendency, with regard to those various boards over the last five or six years, has been that the Minister concerned should, as far as possible, deal with them without going to the Minister for Finance.  In order to keep within that procedure, it would be sufficient, I think, to put in some such words as these &ldquo;subject to the sanction of the Minister&rdquo;, and leave the Minister for Finance out of it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the insurance fund which is a simple one.  The banker knows that the amount coming into that fund every month is about £3,000, and that, under the present levy the same amount roughly is paid out.  If they find they are not collecting enough they will go to the banker and say that they must have a slight overdraft for a month.  They will tell him that, in order to put the fund right, they are going to raise the levy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This fund has probably a month's life, as far as the banker <Col N="651" /> is concerned.  That is all the security that he has.  Unless he can see a prospect of the money he advances being made good, he is not going to advance it.  It seems to me to require something more than the statutory provision that the fund has perhaps a month's life in order to enable the commission to borrow money on the security of it as it stands.  I do not think any bank would advance money on that.</P>

    <P>(2)  Every regulation made by the Commission under this section shall <Col N="654" /> be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and, if a resolution anulling such regulation is passed by either House of the Oireachtas within the next subsequent 21 days on which that House has sat after such regulation is laid before it, such regulation shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything done previously under such regulation.</P>

      <P>The object of this amendment is to ensure that every regulation made by the commission shall be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas so as to give them an opportunity within the next subsequent 21 days of annulling such regulation, but preserving immune anything done previous to the annulment of such regulation. In setting up this commission we are giving it power to control the industry in its entirety.  We give it power to levy what may be termed taxation, to finance the export trade; we are giving it power to invest moneys, to borrow moneys; to fix prices in the home market and by its home market policy, inferentially, to determine prices in the export market. The commission consists of two civil servants and one non-civil servant who are not so far responsible to this House.  The object of this amendment is to ensure that where the commission gets the wide powers contemplated by this Bill that there should be an obligation on them to submit every regulation made to the House, so that the House would have an opportunity of annulling such regulation.  In that way we preserve to the House control over the commission.  I cannot imagine that the Minister can make a strong case against giving that control to the House.  It will not be exercised in the case of any trivial matters, nor will the power be availed of to ventilate frivolous grievances.  The amendment is asking that the House should have control over the commission, power to annul any regulations made by them.  In that <Col N="655" /> way the House could fix attention on the work of the commission.</P>

      <P>It is important that very big matters of this kind should rest in a Bill which, we are told, is of a temporary nature.  There is considerable value attached to this amendment. At the moment legislation is partly done in this House, but in the main we are almost getting to the point of developing principles of legislation in the House and leaving the details to be filled in by outside bodies.  That may be a system to which the complicated nature of Government business will drive us, but in that case there should be publicity given to these regulations and those who are curious about such regulations should have them available in a form in which they can be understood.  I am very keen on having any regulations made by these boards put in such a form and given such publicity as will ensure that they are known, that they are understood and that they are there ready to be interpreted and brought up to date from time to time, because these are matters which we down in the courts have some experience of. You get regulations, and when they are discussed it is then found that they are completely out of date as the events against which they were drafted may have passed and the time lapsed. We want them to be kept in the form in which legislation should be kept.  I move to report progress.</P>

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  I think members of the House have already got a memorandum explaining this Bill, and giving a list of the Acts which it is proposed to continue for another year.  As the House is aware, this Bill, which is an annual one, requires to be enacted before the end of the present calendar year.  It proposes to continue for a further year the same statutes which <Col N="656" /> appear in Parts I and II of the Schedule to the Expiring Laws Act, 1938.  As regards one of the statutes, permanent legislation has been enacted which, when it comes into operation, will make unnecessary the renewal of the Poor Relief (Dublin) Act, 1929.  I refer to the Public Assistance Act, 1939.  A permanent measure repealing the Local Authorities (Combined Purchasing) Act, 1925, has also been enacted, but, as it may not be possible to bring this Act into operation until after 1st January, 1940, it is necessary to continue the temporary Act.  Further permanent legislation in the form of a general Local Government Bill is in contemplation, and this legislation will, if enacted, make it possible to dispense entirely with the Local Government (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1923.  I might add that consideration has been given to the desirability of enacting legislation to give permanence to the Acts hitherto continued by means of an annual Expiring Laws Act, but it is not considered desirable to do so except in the cases to which I have already referred.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a few remarks on this Bill.  Although my remarks will be more or less confined to the duty on wall-paper, they will still have a certain bearing on some of the other duties, and I should like if the Minister could at this stage give us <Col N="658" /> some expression of opinion as to how far circumstances have altered cases. The public are sometimes very much puzzled as to how it is that the Government are contending that they have put a number of people into gainful employment, when the unemployment figures are always rising.  I should like to suggest that, in regard to this particular duty, for every person who has been put into gainful employment two or three have been put out owing to the circumstances under which this industry at present operates.  Wall-paper is one of the constituent materials of the decorating trade.  For every £5 or £6 spent on wallpaper, probably anything from £30 to £40 is spent on decoration.  Decoration may be done in a number of ways.  A number of high-class tradesmen may be employed to do a satisfactory work, which would probably cost a substantial sum of money and give a substantial amount of employment, and probably the most apparent material in that work is the wallpaper.  It may also be argued that the work can be done very much cheaper.  People are in the habit of using a distemper brush to distemper the wallpaper of a room, making a very satisfactory, transitory, cheap job.  Most of the Deputies of this House will probably be looking for a meal to-morrow morning, but decoration is not like that; it does not require to be done at certain stages, and it can very easily be postponed.  If people do not get what they want, they merely postpone the decoration and the employment until a more convenient season.</P>
      <P>It is no use having a Minister for Supplies if there are no goods to distribute. If many of the goods required here were not subject to prohibitive tariffs, probably adequate supplies would be in the country.  At a later stage, no matter what artifices the Minister for Supplies may use, they will not be able to procure articles from other sources of supply.  I suggest that the Government will have to take their courage in their hands and come to an early decision on the question of wallpaper, or else they will probably have to do without supplies for the duration of the war.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="659" /> The present position here is that the Irish manufacturers are behind in supplying requirements, and there is a prohibitive tariff on imported wall-paper. I will admit that this is an extreme case, but a piece of border, 36 over, costing 4/-, might have a duty of 36/- imposed on it.  That is an extreme case, but it runs down from that to probably 100 per cent. and 200 per cent.  In the existing circumstances, the Minister ought to be doubly careful that supplies are available, and that the public, who are the people to be satisfied ultimately, are getting a square deal.</P>
    <P>It is rather difficult to make any suggestion as to what ought to be done, because the manufacturers apparently do not speak with one voice.  Some of them have stated that they want the production of all the wallpaper that is used in this country in order to make an economic unit of the factory.  That is one contention.  In a recent interview the company said that if papers were to be supplied from stock, they would require twice the present equipment and machinery.  On another occasion, and to a merchant who is chiefly interested in the cheaper end of the wallpaper, they said that they were losing money on the cheap end.</P>
    <P>It is rather hard to reconcile all those statements as to what ought to be done, but here are some facts.  This company is now over 300,000 pieces of paper behind in delivery.  Remember, that is after the Government urged that super stocks ought to be held. Earlier this year I suggested that if stocks in certain cases were to be increased, our muzzles would have to be taken off.  This company has unexecuted orders 12 months old.  Is it fair that small traders throughout the country should have two increases put on them in connection with stuff that is 12 months on order?</P>
    <P>The practice of manufacturing small lots of wallpaper has resulted in the following case, which is, admittedly, an extreme case, but still it can be proved.  You could walk into a merchant's stock room and say: &ldquo;I want eight pieces of paper of that particular pattern in your book.&rdquo; He would say: &ldquo;I have not got them.&rdquo;&ldquo;But,&rdquo;<Col N="660" /> you reply, &ldquo;you have 40 pieces of it in your rack?&rdquo;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;but they consist of seven or eight different shades, and I cannot pick out eight pieces.&rdquo; Is that fair?  A recent order given for 39 different patterns resulted in seven being delivered from stock by the manufacturer.  The other 32 were out of stock.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be perfectly aware that small deliveries at frequent intervals cost more money in carriage, bookkeeping, and in manufacture.  I suggest that piecemeal delivery, delivery of parts of orders, has resulted in fantastic costs and a sullen, resentful public, and remember, that it is on the people the ultimate success of the venture will rest.  There is a certain amount of courage required.  There is a French proverb that you have to be cruel to be kind.  Are the Government going to take their courage in their hands and say that circumstances alter cases, that there is a war on, that they cannot risk supplies disappearing altogether, and that some provision must be made to carry on this industry?  I do not know how the stocks have been depleted, but I suggest that they are not half what they were a year ago.  I am sure they would be four times greater if there had not been a prohibitive tariff.  That is so much for the manufacturing end.</P>
    <P>There is another section to be dealt with, the section which concerns the merchant and the decorator, or the consumer, because the decorator and the consumer are linked together.  Some years ago the wallpaper trade had access to probably 12,000 different designs of wallpaper in any one year. I will not contend for a moment that those were sent out to the public. Various merchants made selections from particular manufacturers and they sent out books.  Those books would contain anything from 500 to 600 pieces of paper.  There was a number of merchants in Ireland and in England who sent wallpaper books into this country.  If there was a fractious customer, there were the manufacturers' books which he could be shown, and perhaps if a particular colour matched a special delivery could be obtained from the manufacturer.  Those all added together made a selection of about 12,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="661" /> There are two classes of trade done in the wallpaper industry.  One is the wallpaper pattern book end.  Pieces of wallpapers are cut up and made into pattern books which are sent to various decorators.  The decorator brings the pattern books around to his customer and a selection is made.  There is another class of goods in which there are no patterns cut up; they are what they call the shop grades, and they are something like the cheaper varieties in the wallpaper pattern books.  They are sold to the shops direct and, possibly, to small decorators or to people who hang the paper themselves.</P>
    <P>When this company started here they felt that to ask them to produce 12,000 patterns was a joke.  They said they would produce 500.  That was roughly, 250 for the pattern book, and 250 for the shop grades.  That, from a critical customer's point of view, was an entirely inadequate range.  Be that as it may, the trouble has been that those 500&mdash;250 in each class&mdash;are not available.  At any one time, one-third to one-half of those papers are out of stock.  They are not in the merchants' stock-rooms.  The consequence is that no order can be executed with any certainty by a decorator or no promise of delivery can be made to his customer without actually going to a stock-room of a supplier and taking that paper away.</P>
    <P>I would like to suggest that that is a most unsatisfactory position.  The merchants have paid for cutting up patterns.  They have sent them out in good faith to the public, and the half of those patterns are never available. In the autumn of last year, when the new season's pattern books were being prepared, promises were made of correct delivery.  The books were no sooner made up than the company entered into a dispute with the Minister's Department about certain licences.  I will not go into which of them was correct but, anyway, that range disappeared.  Later on, there was a difficulty about varnished goods, and the merchants were told to make their own arrangements for delivery, but, having sent out patterns supplied by one manufacturer it was very hard <Col N="662" /> to replace them with those of another manufacturer.</P>
    <P>I would like to suggest to the Minister that that position requires looking into.  Irish industries ultimately depend on the goodwill of the Irish buying public and, if that is to be retained, the Irish public require a certain amount of fair play and consideration. I suggest that the public have got no consideration in this case.  I pass to another aspect.  How long are the Government going to carry concerns that they have financed?  Probably, when Irish industries had to start the Government may or may not have been correct in underwriting those issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret to have to confirm what has been expressed by Deputy Dockrell.  On almost every occasion that I make a visit to my constituency I receive representations in connection with complaints of decorators, house-painters.  They complain of a lack of variety of pattern.  As far as they are themselves concerned they would not care if there were only one pattern, but they have to deal with a public which insists upon a certain variety, and whose wishes they have to meet in connection with any work that they undertake.  There were complaints of faulty goods, of a difficult shade in certain papers which their customers resented, and there was the same sort of complaint as Deputy <Col N="664" /> Dockrell has raised regarding duty charged on a certain measurement of paper.  It appears that borders come in in one piece, and that they are then cut, and the duty is charged on the cut portion.  In ordinary paper a piece has a depth of two feet, or two feet six inches.  The border comes in in the same measurement, but it is cut, and if there is a depth of six inches in the border after it is cut it means that they have to pay five times the duty.  They consider that that is unreasonable. Their real case amounts to this, that the general run of wallpaper that is selected would bear a percentage&mdash;I am speaking from recollection&mdash;of somewhere between 20 and 40 per cent. of the cost of the work; and if the customer is displeased either with the variety or number of the patterns produced the work may not be undertaken. In a case of that sort it means that while this duty is responsible for the keeping up of the factory making wallpaper, they are providing only one-fifth of the available employment that is given in connection with decoration generally.</P>
      <P>There was also a complaint regarding certain patterns which the firm had been unable to obtain, and they requested the company to make inquiries amongst the agents or merchants as to whether any of the particular type were in stock.  Eventually these were run to earth, but the company would not undertake to have them sent on.  They simply gave the name of the firms which had them in stock, and by the time the decorator was able to get in touch with the two firms in question half the goods had been sold and the job was lost.  What I am really concerned about in connection with this imposition of duties is a matter as to which I have handed in an amendment.</P>

      <P>This particular Statutory Order is No. 187.  It imposes a customs duty on &ldquo;all sterilised surgical sutures or ligatures which are not of catgut, that is to say, cord made from the dried intestines of any animal or of metal wire, and are imported on or after the 24th day of May, 1939&rdquo;.  This commodity is used in surgical operations. Special precautions have to be taken in connection with its selection and manufacture.  Perhaps I would put the matter much more briefly before the House if I read an advertisement in connection with it without mentioning names: &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;'s Ligatures and Sutures are made to satisfy the most exacting surgical standards.  More than that, they are made to fully solve the problems which the use of sutures brings to any and all operative work. Three of the most vital problems and &mdash;&mdash;'s Laboratories' answers are illustrated here.&rdquo;  Then, under the heading of Problem 1&mdash;Sterility&mdash;there is a picture given of an operator in front of a machine wearing a cap and a mask covering his nose and mouth, and the advertisement says: &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;'s Ligatures and Sutures are sterilised by heat, and heat alone at a temperature well in excess of accepted standards.  Handled only in aseptic rooms, flame-sealed tubes, their sterility is protected by every known &lsquo;safeguard&rsquo;.&rdquo;  As to &ldquo;Problem 2&mdash;Uniformity&rdquo;&mdash;it says: &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;'s Ligatures and Sutures are made from the intestines of young, range-fed lambs only, to assure uniformity at the very outset of processing.  Their uniformity of strength, pliability and gauge is assured by a series of the most modern processes and controls.&rdquo;  Then as to &ldquo;Problem 3&mdash;Less Trauma&rdquo;&mdash;it says: &ldquo;&mdash;&mdash;'s Sutures on Non-Traumatic Eyeless Needles reduce surgical trauma to a minimum, make possible more accurate approximation of sutured surface, answer an operative need of long standing.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My information is that surgeons will not use any of these products in connection with surgical operations, unless they are sure that they are absolutely perfect.  It is a serious matter for <Col N="666" /> surgeons, and it is probably more serious for the patient in the last resort.  But the surgical profession do not take any risk in regard to the use of these matters.  They are provided by firms which are a long time in existence. I have no brief for them, and I do not know where they are.  At one time their manufacture was undertaken in Great Britain on a large scale.  So much so that one London surgeon had a fee of something like two thousand guineas from his hospital each year in order to ensure that the quality, suitability, and freedom from any taint were guaranteed by the manufacturer.</P>
    <P>I have made inquiries regarding the particular firm which is employed in their manufacture here, and I find that the name is given as, &ldquo;International Sutures, Ltd., Dublin, Éire&rdquo;.  It gives the name of a solicitor, and then the name of another Irish gentleman.  It also gives the names of two bank managers, and says that they have 49 shares each in the company.  Then it gives the name of a director, described as a chemist of British nationality. The capital, I understand, is £100.</P>
    <P>We may undertake to help industry in every way that we can, and we are prepared to put up with certain drawbacks with regard to quality, supply, finish, or price.  But my submission is that, in connection with a matter of this sort, no such risk should be undertaken. It is too serious.  It ought not to be done without at least consultation with well-known Dublin practitioners in order to ascertain their views and opinions regarding the whole procedure of manufacture.  If the purpose of this particular order is merely to collect duty, I think it is unfair to hospitals that that should be done. The average annual importations amount to something like £3,000.  There is nothing for the promoters, or for the company, or for those employed, from such a small sum.  There are certain activities from which this country could much better benefit, by having such work undertaken by others, than by starting small things such as this. It is possible, if a small mistake were made, that a patient might get some disease or might die.  It might also mean a further operation after one had <Col N="667" /> taken place.  Generally, from what I have been told by any medical men to whom I spoke on the subject, they are not satisfied with this, and I do not think they will undertake to use it.  On the Committee Stage I propose to move that this duty be omitted from the list of impositions.</P>

      <P>In regard to Deputy Cosgrave's amendment, perhaps I had better put before the House one or two points before we come to the Committee Stage.  I understand that Deputy Dockrell does not propose to put down an amendment as I undertook to look into the point he raised. In fact, I understand that a meeting has been arranged between the wall paper merchants on the one hand and the wall paper manufacturers on the other hand.  I do not know whether decisions will be arrived at at the conference which will be satisfactory to both parties, but I appreciate the point which Deputy Dockrell has made, and I will endeavour to enforce, to some extent, that point of view on those who are engaged in manufacture and are protected by tariffs.</P>

      <P>I ask the Deputy not to persist with the amendment and, at least, not to divide the House upon it. I will undertake to inquire into the statements which he has made in regard to this industry, but I should say, first, that I understand that those who are engaged in it have to comply with the requirements of the Department of Local Government and do, in fact, so comply.  In addition, I should say that there are 55 workers employed in <Col N="668" /> one of the industries at the main branch of the work at Castlebellingham, and ten others are engaged in the sterilising end in Dublin.  It may be that a certain element of prejudice may enter into these things.  Naturally, surgeons who have relied for a long time upon the satisfactory products of other manufacturers may not be disposed readily to change, but I think Deputy Cosgrave will agree that it may sometimes be necessary to induce surgeons to look at the products of alternative manufacturers, particularly when made in this country, to try to get them to overcome what may be, perhaps, more the result of settled habit and practice rather than judicial decision as to investigation of the merits of one or other of these products. I asked, when this was called to my attention, whether representations had been made by any of the professional bodies in regard to the use of these surgical sutures and ligatures and, so far as I am aware, and I speak now subject to the fact that I have not full information before me, I do not think any such representations have been made.  If they have been made I undertake to look into the matter to see whether, in fact, the requirements of the medical profession are being fulfilled by the manufacturers.</P>

      <P>Arising out of Reference No. 7, is the Minister in a position to offer any satisfactory explanation why the duty on soap should be as high <Col N="669" /> as it is made by the Emergency Imposition of Duties Order?  I think it is well-known that the rate of duty, in actual fact, represents the difference in price between the home product and the imported product.  In other words, the charge on the home product is nearly as high as that on the imported product, plus the duty.  That seems appalling.  Admittedly the production here must be smaller but, after allowing for that, there does not seem to be any justification for such a big difference in price as 50 per cent.  I say that if this material, and other materials, were reduced in price, there would be lower prices for laundry work, which would result in a greater amount of employment being given.  I should like to know if the Minister has anything to say why the duty is so high.  I know that this was done on the advice of the Prices Commission, but I hope he will not try to be bound by that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill may be stated in general terms to be to supplement the provisions of the Commissioners for Oaths (Diplomatic and Consular) Act, 1931.  That Act authorised the collection of fees by our diplomatic and consular officers abroad for services of a purely &ldquo;notarial&rdquo; character, that is to say, services such as would be rendered in this country by a notary public or commissioner for oaths.  The present Bill is intended to authorise the collection of fees for the performance of services which are not notarial services rendered both by Irish diplomatic and consular officers abroad and by the headquarters staff of the Department of External Affairs here at home.  These services fall, broadly, into two classes&mdash;those for which a fee is at the moment charged, and those now rendered free of charge.</P>
      <P>The most important class of service for which a fee is at present charged is that which is performed, particularly in the United States, in relation to the estates of persons dying intestate. Irish consular officers are often called upon to trace next-of-kin to conduct correspondence, and even to appear in American courts on behalf of Irish claimants to these estates and, if distributive shares fall to be distributed to persons resident in Ireland, the shares are distributed through our consular officers.  For these services, it has been customary for American courts to allow a fee on the shares distributed. As this fee rests, at the moment, only on the authority of these American courts, it is now proposed to give a statutory basis for its collection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a large class of services which at the moment are rendered free of charge.  Examples of such services performed by the headquarters staff of the Department of External Affairs are the authentication of the official status and the seal of various Irish public <Col N="671" /> officers for the purpose of proceedings in foreign courts and otherwise, and the issue of the documents known as &ldquo;<i>certificats de coutume</i>&rdquo;, that is, authoritative statements of the law of Ireland on various matters, over the seal of the Minister for External Affairs.  An example of the services rendered by our diplomatic and consular officers abroad for which at the moment no fee is chargeable is the service of writs issued by Irish courts on Irish nationals resident in the country to which the diplomatic or consular officer is accredited.  Many other such services might be mentioned.  It is obviously right that a fee should be charged for services such as these which often involve the expenditure of much time and trouble by the officials concerned, and it is accordingly proposed to authorise the collection of fees in such cases.</P>
    <P>The scheme of the Bill is simple.  It would be impossible to anticipate in advance all the services which diplomatic and consular officers may be called upon to perform from time to time.  Therefore, Section 2 of the Bill proposes to enable the Minister for External Affairs, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to make regulations fixing the fees to be charged for specified services rendered by persons to whom the Bill applies.  These persons are set out in Section 4.  Sub-section (1) of Section 2 provides that the regulations are to specify the particular service for which fees are to be charged, and to fix the amount of the fee for each service.  Power is taken under sub-section (2) to make different regulations in relation to different persons to whom the Bill applies and in relation to different countries and places.  The need for this provision is obvious from the difference in the laws and currencies of the various countries to which our diplomatic and consular officers are accredited.  Sub-section (3) will enable the Minister to waive the fee in certain cases where for one reason or another it seems right that no fee should be charged.  Sub-section (4) provides in the usual manner for the Parliamentary control of all regulations made under the section.  Section 3 provides in the common form for the <Col N="672" /> collection and disposal, and the recovery of fees.  Provision of an identical or similar type appears in all Acts giving power to charge fees.  Section 4 sets out the classes of persons to which the Bill will apply.  Paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) enumerate the various kinds of diplomatic and consular officers in the service of the State, and paragraph (d) includes other officers of the Minister for External Affairs, including members of the headquarters staff of the Department, who may be appointed by the Minister to be persons to whom the Bill applies.</P>
    <P>In order that no conflict may arise between this Bill and the Commissioners for Oaths (Diplomatic and Consular) Act, 1931, it is provided by Section 5 that the powers given by this Bill are to be in addition to, and not in substitution for, the powers given by that Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>One useful function discharged by our consuls abroad, particularly in the U.S.A., is the investigation of estates whereunder our people benefit.  In the West and South of Ireland it is quite a common occurrence to have country people bring into you American legal documents setting out that they are the next-of-kin and that a lawyer in America has been required by the Probate Court to communicate with them prior to the distribution of a deceased person's estate in America.  In the old days, more than one case came under my notice in which simple people in the West of Ireland were in process of being ruthlessly plundered by unreliable practitioners in the U.S.A.  One was able to get those with whom one was fortunate enough to come in contact into the hands of a good American practitioner, protect their rights and recover whatever they were entitled to.  When one set oneself to the task of doing that, one found it of such complexity and difficulty that one readily understood how the simple country person was plundered unless he had the assistance of somebody here who knew the ropes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most valuable reforms brought about by our consular and diplomatic officials has been that there has been made available to the <Col N="673" /> simplest person in any part of the State an absolutely safe procedure for protecting his property in any country where we have consular representation. He need not come to me to inquire from me if I know any reliable lawyer in the U.S.A.</P>
    <P>If he goes to any sergeant of the Guards or to a peace commissioner, or to anybody who knows anything at all, he will put him in touch with our consul in New York, and from that moment the consul in New York constitutes himself the protector of the rights of the citizens of Eire, and does everything necessary to safeguard his interests.  If we are going to make that service dependent on the payment of a fee, then I am afraid the country people will not avail of it as readily as they now do.  It may seem unreasonable that people who are about to benefit under a will should not be prepared to pay a modest fee to the consular official who acts for them, but it is not so unreasonable when you have experience of the business.</P>
    <P>Let me tell you of an incident that came to my attention no later than last week.  A friend of mine consulted me about such a case.  He was informed that he was one of a number of next-of-kin of a deceased intestate in the U.S.A.  He looked forward to inheriting a substantial sum.  I put him in touch with the consul in New York. He, with his usual high efficiency and courtesy, dealt with the matter promptly and informed me that the heir to the estate might rest assured he would protect his interests.  After four or five weeks, he wrote that he had gone into the matter carefully, examined the schedule of assets and found that there were 42 next of kin and that the total assets amounted to 95 dollars.  The man who consulted me would receive about 35 cents as his share of the estate.  My friend said: &ldquo;What I never had, I shall never miss.&rdquo;  He went off about his business and was philosophical about it.  Suppose, however, that you had required that man to pay a fee of ten or 15 dollars, or two or three guineas, what would happen?  The story would get about eventually, and what would happen would be that the country people, instead of looking for the right <Col N="674" /> kind of help to get these estates properly dealt with, would simply say: &ldquo;Ah, if we get the money from this estate, well and good, but if we do not, we are not going to send good money after bad by feeing a lawyer to look after our interests, because it might turn out that there might not be enough money to pay his costs.&rdquo;  In doing this, we re-create the abuses which formerly existed&mdash;and which still exist&mdash;which justified the establishment of vice-consuls in New York, Boston and San Francisco.</P>
    <P>If you are to bring about this system of fees for that service, whether the fees be reasonable or unreasonable, you will be recreating these abuses, and it will simply mean that the people concerned will cease to avail of that service. Now, that was an excellent service.  It was one of the social services which is hard to defend on cold, economic argument, but taking one consideration with another you are protecting the interests of simple people who did not know how to protect their own interests.  On the whole, it was a very good service and, in addition to the publicity value that it had for the State, it had the additional social value that the simplest person in this country would be assured that they could not be &ldquo;gypped&rdquo; by a dishonest lawyer who managed to get control in America of the estate concerned.</P>
    <P>Some people here may think that I am taking up too much of the time of the House in this matter, but I think I am entitled to inform the House of certain matters of which the House ought to be aware.  The United States of America is a country with a life and a culture of its own, but in the United States of America, while there is a very high standard of living, of ethics, and of propriety, generally, in the professions, there is, nevertheless, a substantial number of people there who have a very low ethical standard, and one of the favourite occupations of some of these gentlemen in the legal profession&mdash;and, indeed, some of them are ladies....</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of them are what?</P>

    <Col N="675" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Ladies.  I mean, women lawyers&mdash;one of the favourite occupations of these people is to go around the courts nosing out estates of this kind.  They have a system there of going into the probate courts and finding out particulars of cases of intestacy. These lawyers, who are popularly described there as &ldquo;shyster&rdquo; lawyers, collect whatever information is available to them, get in touch with people who may be concerned, and then, once they have got a certain amount of information, they make motions in the courts which give them a kind of a standing in the courts of the United States, and unless you know how to tackle them, by a series of manoeuvres, you will find it very hard to displace them from the position they have secured, or you may find that the costs of displacing them from that position and getting a reliable lawyer in control of the estate would eat up most of what remained of the estate.  Nobody, except somebody on the spot, who understand intimately all the procedure that must be adopted can properly grapple with these problems.  It must be remembered that such things are a matter of State procedure, and not of Federal procedure.  The procedure differs from State to State, and therefore, it is peculiarly necessary, when we know that so many of these estates are in the United States of America, that we should have consular services there, and consular services which, for this purpose at any rate, would be available, free, to the citizens of this State.  Accordingly, if this power to charge fees is to be given for any service done by a consular official, I would ask the Minister to give an assurance now that certainly, in so far as our consuls serve the citizens of this State in probate matters, they will not charge fees for that service, and that such service will be, as it has been in the past, free to the citizens of this State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I can give Deputy Dillon the promise he asks for, but we are, in fact, meeting the position about which he spoke. Deputy Dillon evidently knows a good deal about this problem.  It is a problem that has existed for a long time&mdash;<Col N="676" /> this problem of people dying intestate in the United States of America.  As the Deputy knows, most of such cases arise in connection with the United States rather than in connection with other countries.  As a matter of fact, the courts have the custom now of awarding a fee of 2½ per cent. to the consuls in connection with all these estates, and there is some understanding that the consul would collect that fee from the courts.  That is the practice, but we have no power to waive it. We will have certain powers of waiver in the Bill.  I was not connected with this Department, but I have been backward and forward a good deal in the United States, and I have come across complaints from time to time, through mixing in Irish circles, of the way in which people, as Deputy Dillon properly says, were robbed by these &ldquo;shyster&rdquo; lawyers.  What happened was that certain people&mdash;some in Ireland and some in the United States&mdash; were entitled to a share in the estate of a close or even a distant relative who happened to die intestate in the United States, and these lawyers adopted the practice, as Deputy Dillon has described, of going to the courts and finding out particulars about these people.  The first thing these lawyers did was to go to the prospective clients and get them to sign away a considerable proportion of what they might expect to get.  In some cases, I understand it was as high as 60 per cent. or 70 per cent. of the estate, whether the estates were large or small.  The people concerned did not know what they would get, and, possibly, they said to themselves, as Deputy Dillon has pointed out: &ldquo;Well, if I do get something, it was something that I did not expect to get, and I might as well pay a good sum for it&rdquo;, only to find out later on that they were literally robbed of considerable sums, in some cases at least.  Our consuls, when they were established in New York, Boston and San Francisco, followed up these cases and tried to get the Irish people, who had claims in such estates, out of the hands of these &ldquo;shyster&rdquo; lawyers, but, as Deputy Dillon knows, the consuls found it next to impossible to shake off the grip of these people.  I may say, however, that, so far as New York is concerned at any rate&mdash;through the <Col N="677" /> activities of the present Consul-General in New York&mdash;they have succeeded now, to a large extent, in shaking off that grip.  As Deputy Dillon has pointed out, these things are a matter of State law, and not of Federal law, and each State has its own rights in these matters.  In New York, our Consul-General there&mdash;and I think he is the person to whom the credit is due&mdash;has succeeded in getting the New York State Legislature at Albany to bring in new legislation, and the consul now has a definitely legal status to interfere in these cases and through this new legislation he has been able to shake off the grip, to a considerable extent, of those lawyers who heretofore derived so much profit out of this class of business.</P>
      <P>There was a custom, as I said earlier, of charging a certain percentage on the amount distributed.  If there is no distribution in future there will be no fee, and if the amount is small there need not be any fee.  It will rest with the different consuls&mdash;in New York Chicago, etc.,&mdash;to decide whether a fee is justly and reasonably payable or not; and if a particular person comes before them who is poor and wants every cent. he can get, the consul can waive the fee or say no fee will be asked for in advance in this particular class of cases.  In that way a good case admittedly made by Deputy Dillon will be met under the present head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The various other types of work that the consuls have been doing is most useful work.  Our people here at home and all over America have found our consuls most useful and helpful.  By this amending legislation, amending the Act of 1931, they will be put in a better position to give that service. They will have an official status and will get further recognition from the courts and from authorities both State and Federal, to do work that ordinarily would be done by a commissioner for oaths here, or by a notary public. They will be in a position to act also in the case of any other type of work besides work regarding estates.  They can act for nothing if they think that the case is a deserving one.  Of course, their services will be still available to <Col N="678" /> all persons, and I hope they will be availed of more and more as time goes on and as the merits of the good work they have been doing become better known</P>

      <P>The section says that the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, make regulations fixing the fees to be charged for such services.  I would like to know whether that means that the regulations are going to fix a general principle on which fees would be charged, or the actual fees.  The Minister indicates that, in a case such as that which has been discussed here, it may rest with the consul to decide whether a fee will be paid or not.  That rather implies that the regulations that might be made here will be regulations fixing a general principle with regard to fees, and not expressing that fees <Col N="679" /> of a particular nature will be charged. I think we should like to be clear as to the general principle on which the regulations will run, as far as that matter goes.</P>
      <P>Then, the Minister indicated that free services were given before, and fees may be charged now.  Amongst the free services that were given before, he mentioned the issue of writs of Irish courts on Irish citizens in some of those countries.  I take it, when a measure of this kind is introduced, that there is a certain definite list of things to which it is intended immediately to apply this Bill.  I wonder could the Minister give us a little more information as to the type of services which are going to be charged for in future. I take it that the services of our consuls in various places will be available free in many general ways for persons who call on them.</P>

      <P>Cases once came under my notice where people in the United States wanted to get a certificate of birth or of marriage or of death.  They can get that through the consuls and through the Department of External Affairs.  There will be a scale of fees fixed for all these particular items.  In many cases, if it were to be used, there probably would have to be a seal and a certificate attached to that birth certificate testifying that it was a true copy.  I do not know; in some of these cases affidavits may be necessary.  This would be done, certificates would be made out and seals used where necessary by the officials at headquarters, by some officer appointed for that purpose; and a definite scale of fees would be fixed for such actions.  Frequently&mdash;I do not know how frequently, but sometimes lawyers interested in cases in other countries are written to here, in order to get a certificate of the custom of this country &mdash;the custom of the courts and the common law.  Affidavits have to be made and seals have to be attached, and these are sent by the Department of External Affairs, sometimes direct to the countries abroad and sometimes through the lawyers here who are interested in cases or who represent <Col N="680" /> lawyers in other countries.  A definite scale of fees would be fixed for items of that kind.  These are all that occurred to, me: there are others; probably the Department would give a full list, but these cases occurred in my time and they are types of cases that consuls have been asked to deal with.</P>
      <P>I believe I was wrong in saying that the consuls themselves would have power in all cases to discharge the liability.  They would have to get&mdash; where they want to release a person from the charge&mdash;the authority of the person acting for the Minister, in order to wipe out the fee.</P>

      <P>On the question of birth certificates, I take it that anybody applying for a birth certificate will have to pay the usual fee of 3/7 through the Custom House.  I wonder could the Minister say what additional charge could reasonably be incurred by, say, a person in America applying through the consular services for a birth certificate.  What could reasonably be charged in addition to the 3/7?</P>

At present, if I am in any difficulty about something or somebody in the United States, I feel at liberty to sit down and write to the consul about the matter and he takes charge of it and keeps me advised until it is resolved. What I want to know is, am I in the future to get a bill at the end of the correspondence: To advice given to Deputy Dillon, 6/8; to perusing Deputy Dillon's letter, ¾; and to writing letter to say that Deputy Dillon's letter has been received, 6/8?</P>

      <P>Deputy Norton, and also Deputy McGilligan, spoke on this amendment which, I think, can be accepted. I was going to say for Deputy McGilligan's benefit, however, that it is quite a different matter when we come to consider Orders, because some of these Orders are of a confidential <Col N="682" /> nature.  The regulations are such as could be published, but the Orders are not.  Take, for instance, an Order for a sub-allocation quota, if such were made.</P>

      <P>Production and, up to this, home sales.  Theoretically, it is only the individual curer who knows what the quota is.  They all have a fair idea of what is given to another curer but, in theory, the public do not know exactly what is the quota that a curer gets.  In the same way, there is an Order made with regard to the yield of bacon from the weight of a pig.  That is also confidential as between the factory and the board.  I mention these merely to show that there is a distinction between regulations and Orders.  We can lay regulations on the Table without any confidence being broken, but Orders, I think, would be in a different category.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 34:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1) to delete paragraph (a).</P>
      <P>This raises a rather technical question, but one of no little importance. This sub-section is designed to provide that the board can produce a document certified to be a true copy by the chairman of the commission, or the secretary of the commission, and once it is produced, there devolves upon the official of the board certifying it no obligation to prove it in the ordinary way.  Ordinarily, if a company or a local authority desire to prove a document, one of their officers has to attend the court, go into the witness-box, and swear that he is a competent person, that the contents of the document are true, and that it is a true copy of whatever it is held out to be a copy of, whereupon counsel for the other party can cross-examine and question him, and apply further interrogatories, which not infrequently yield very useful information to the other party to the suit, to their great advantage.  This procedure exonerates the officials of this commission from answering interrogatories.</P>
      <P>The origin of this claim to exempt a Government Department from the obligations that would devolve upon the ordinary citizen engaged in litigation goes back to the prerogative claimed by the Crown, that you could not bring the King into court and treat him like a common man.  Subsequently, the prerogative of the Crown became attached to every Government Department, and Government Departments claimed special privilege when they were at law with the ordinary citizen, but now we are going a step further, and trying to extend this old Crown privilege, not only to Government Departments, but to the semi-autonomous bodies like the Pigs Marketing Board and other semi-autonomous bodies created under Acts within the last ten or 15 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="685" /> It is interesting to observe that they did not go this far when they were dealing with the Electricity Supply Board.  I think there they made the seal of the board evidential of certain things, but they did not exonerate these officers from going down to the courts and proving the documents which they presented to the court.  Now we are trying to take an extra step in respect of the Pigs and Bacon Commission, and I put it to Deputies that any one of us may be engaged in litigation at any time in defence of our rights against a Government Department, or against a semi-autonomous board of this kind, and we should not lightly vote away our legal rights against Government Departments.  It is hard enough to fight the Government in litigation if it is your misfortune to have to do so, without arming the Government with additional weapons over and above those they have already, and I see no reason why the Pigs and Bacon Commission should be given privileges in litigation superior to those already enjoyed by any other independent corporation or company.  Therefore I suggest that this paragraph (a) might be reasonably abandoned, as it merely sets a precedent for an undesirable new departure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy may have given a correct history of the origin of a clause of this kind, but there is no doubt, at any rate, that it does appear in many Acts passed by the Oireachtas. There may be something in the point made by the Deputy that it does not appear in Acts dealing with companies of this kind.  It may have only appeared up to this in Acts dealing with businesses managed by Ministers.  I cannot see, however, what objection there could be to this provision.  In fact, I think it would be a great thing if all companies had the same privilege, if it is considered a privilege.  I do not see why this board, or any other company for that matter, should be put to the expense of sending down a chairman or secretary to say &ldquo;That is my handwriting&rdquo;.  If it is presented to the court and counsel appearing there says: &ldquo;This is an extract from the minutes signed by the chairman&rdquo;, that <Col N="686" /> should be taken as <i>prima facie</i> evidence that it is so.  I do not see what objection there could be to that.  I do not see why we should put the board to the expense of sending a chairman or secretary down to attend court, and perhaps losing a whole day, merely for the purpose of saying &ldquo;That is my handwriting&rdquo;.  I do not think there is any great reason for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason is simply this, that you are trenching on the privileges of the citizen.  The Minister will admit that if we take that out of the Bill, we withdraw from the chairman of the Pigs and Bacon Commission a privilege which this clause confers upon him.  I think the Minister will agree that the average citizen at law with a Government Department is under a disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Bear in mind that he is at the disadvantage that he knows that if he loses his case he will have to pay the costs.  The officers of the Department know that if they lose their case they will not have to pay anything.  It is quite open, in any litigation, for the Pigs and Bacon Commission to send to the solicitor of their opponent a list of documents and to say: &ldquo;Are you prepared to admit these?&rdquo; If the solicitor for the citizen sees that most of the documents are documents that should be admitted and that there is no advantage in having them proved, he can write back and say: &ldquo;Yes, we are admitting these documents.&rdquo; That letter then proves all the documents contained in the schedule, but suppose he does not want to do that, suppose he wants to put the chairman of the commission in the box; suppose that he thinks that in cross-examination he can extract something from him of material value to his client, he can write back and say: &ldquo;We are admitting documents A, B, C, D, E and F.  These need not be proved, but documents G and H we do not admit, and these must be proved.&rdquo;  It does not mean, if you take out this clause, that every document that is ever produced by the board must be proved.  Not at all.  I <Col N="687" /> suppose in 70 per cent. of the cases the documents are never proved by the responsible officer going into the box. What usually happens is that you send a list of documents to your opponent asking if he admits them.  In 90 cases out of 100 he replies: &ldquo;Yes, we do&rdquo;, because he does not want to pile up costs on himself, if it should chance that he loses the action.  Now, Sir, by your leave, there are several amendments of the same nature one after another.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 35, 36, 37, 39, 46 and 54 are all connected with this point.  There is a fine difference but they are all of the same <i>genre.</i> Amendment No. 35 deals with paragraph (b) which states:</P>
      <P>
        <i>Prima facie</i> evidence of any order made by the Bacon Marketing Board, the Pigs Marketing Board or the commission may be given by the production of a copy of <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are moving that the words &ldquo;of any order&rdquo; be deleted, and for them that there be substituted the words: &ldquo;that a particular order has been.&rdquo;  We move that for the reason that it appears that the trend of judicial decision is to veer in the direction of declaring that the sub-section, as at present drafted, means that <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the contents of the order may be given by the production of the copy of the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> containing the Order.  That was never the intention of the Legislature, nor do I think it is now our intention.  The intention is to provide that evidence of the making of the Order may be given by producing <i>Iris Oifigiúil,</i> but that you should exonerate an official of the board from submitting himself to cross-examination as to the contents of the Order, is to go far beyond what the Minister would wish us to do.  Surely you are entitled to put an officer into the box and ask him: &ldquo;What did your commission mean by that Order?  Did it <Col N="688" /> mean this or that?  Can you claim that the words used in this Order were interpreted to mean this or that?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If that be accepted, there is a further matter arising out of line 55, paragraph (b), which reads: &ldquo;<i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> purporting to contain such Order&rdquo;. Surely that should read &ldquo;containing such Order&rdquo;?  It either contains it or it does not contain it.  If it does not contain it, fully and explicitly, it is not reasonable to treat it as a satisfactory publication.  Suppose it is published under the heading &ldquo;Pigs and Bacon (Amendment) Act Order&rdquo;, and then sets out the by-laws of St. Stephen's Green, that should not be good publication for the purposes of this Bill. Nevertheless, what is here will clearly make it good publication, because though the contents of the Order were the by-laws of St. Stephen's Green, they would purport to be an Order made under the Pigs and Bacon Act, 1939, which would fulfil the conditions of sub-section (1), paragraph (b), &ldquo;a copy of the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> purporting to contain such Order.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Under sub-section (2), it is provided that a certificate purporting to be under the hand of the secretary, certifying that the person named in the certificate was during a specified period a licensee, shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the matters so certified. Here is a nice point.  The purpose here is to deal with a certificate certifying that the person named in the certificate was, during the specified period, a licensee.  What we are asked to say is that the certificate is not only <i>prima facie</i> evidence of those facts, but is also <i>prima facie</i> evidence of any other matters referred to in it.  Therefore, if you prepare a certificate declaring that a person was a licensee during a specified period, and then proceed to add to that declaration other extraneous matters, the certificate is not only <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the facts of which it is intended to be <i>prima facie</i> evidence, but also of the extraneous matters which you introduce into it. We are proposing to delete the word &ldquo;matters&rdquo;, and substitute therefor &ldquo;person and period&rdquo;.  I think the Minister will have no objection to that. <Col N="689" /> Sub-section (3) is one of those infernal sections which is by reference, so that you have to go rooting through the Pigs and Bacon Act of 1935.  There is a long section&mdash;Section 112&mdash;in the Principal Act relating to the returns which curers may be required to make.</P>
    <P>Section 151 of the Principal Act deals with returns by minor curers.  These two sub-sections make a rather strange proposal.  Suppose I made a return under Section 112 or Section 151 of the Principal Act to the Bacon Marketing Board, and if the board takes action against me under this Bill or, apparently, for any other purpose, although I can produce my return, it is at once clothed with a statutory <i>prima facie</i> value that it had not got until it is produced by the Pigs and Bacon Commission as a return made by me under Section 112 or Section 151.</P>
    <P>Why they want to put that in, God only knows.  Is it that they can yap at a person and say: &ldquo;You are bound by the false return&rdquo;?  If there is a return made by somebody, then I submit the commission should be made go into court, in the ordinary way, and prove it, or disprove it, without traps of this kind.  I think the Minister will agree with me that, if a person is brought into court and suddenly finds that a simple return he made to the Pigs and Bacon Commission is suddenly converted into a statutory declaration of quite a different type from what he ever intended it to be, that is not a good kind of law, because no ordinary citizen could possibly know anything about it.  With regard to amendment No. 39, proposing to delete sub-section (4), this is the worst of the lot, because the sub-section provides that if the commission take proceedings against me and allege against me that I have failed to make to them the returns to which I have just referred under Sections 112 and 151 of the Principal Act, a certificate purporting to be signed by the secretary of the commission shall be <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the facts so certified, and no further proof shall be required.</P>
    <P>This is a most pernicious document, because it is the same kind of trick as that of the Revenue Commissioners. <Col N="690" /> The law of this country is that I am innocent until somebody proves me guilty.  Now, this is a trick to bring me into court and make me guilty until I can prove I am innocent.  That strikes at the most fundamental rights that our people have.  The Revenue Commissioners are always at this game. They can come into your house, pick up any object, and say: &ldquo;Prove to me that you paid duty on that; it is a dutiable article.&rdquo;  This is a most extraordinary proposal&mdash;to drag me into court and allege against me that I have done something.  That allegation creates a presumption of guilt, so that one is put in the position of having to rebut that presumption.  I submit to the House that this is a lazy provision designed to spare the officers of the commission the necessary trouble of proving documents in court.  As the State has always undertaken to prove that a person is guilty of the offence alleged against him, I urge strongly on the Minister to set his face sternly against what is proposed in this sub-section, and for that reason to consent to its deletion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments are all bound up with the question of the production of evidence.  The Deputy has spoken on amendments Nos. 34 to 39.  I have already spoken on amendment No. 34.  The only thing involved there is whether the secretary or chairman should be present in court to swear that it is his signature that is to a document.  The presentation of the document to the court is to be taken as <i>prima facie</i> evidence.  It does not mean that it is to be taken as conclusive evidence.  Amendments Nos. 35 and 36 go together.  The wording of Section 18, sub-section (1), paragraph (b) follows exactly what is in the Documentary Evidence Act of 1925. I am not an authority on this, but the Draftsman naturally likes to stick to words that have proved to be correct, and that have stood the test of the attacks made on them since 1925.</P>

      <P>No; when I looked at this first I thought there could be no objection to it, but after consultation with the lawyers I found they were somewhat doubtful whether this amendment would exactly cover the <Col N="692" /> point.  It is an amendment into which I would like to look again.</P>
      <P>Now with regard to amendment Nos. 38 and 39&mdash;to delete sub-section (3) and to delete sub-section (4) of Section 18 respectively, I do not think there is anything unreasonable in these sub-sections.  Deputy Dillon seems to think it is taking advantage of a person if the certificate is put in as <i>prima facie</i> evidence.  It is quite, open to the person appearing for the licensee to say that the licensee has made a mistake, that the return made was not correct and did not quite fit in with the case before the court.  All that is asked here is that it may be put in as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of the return which is the subject of litigation.  The next amendment is somewhat on the same lines but not altogether.  We are back again to where we started in amendment No. 34, that a certificate signed by the secretary of the commission can be produced and that there is no necessity for the secretary to appear after he signed the certificate.  It is only as <i>prima facie</i> evidence.  I think that on the whole all that these amendments seek to rectify is that Deputy McGilligan and Deputy Dillon who are arguing this point would prefer to have the chairman and secretary answer to the court that they really signed these documents.  The section as it stands would absolve the chairman or secretary from being present.  The documents would be handed in and accepted as the chairman's signature or the secretary's signature and the case would go on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <P>On what the secretary admitted on cross-examination would depend whether the case would go on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether much can be made of that point.  In so far as (1) (a) or (4) is concerned, all we say is that the document must be taken as being signed by the chairman or the secretary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole point is in this &ldquo;has been duly signed&rdquo;.  This Bill puts an obligation on the commissioners to consider certain matters, in <Col N="693" /> fixing the price of pigs and so on. The chairman, say, is in the box and counsel asks: &ldquo;Is that your signature?&rdquo; and he answers: &ldquo;Yes, I signed that, that is my signature.&rdquo; That is the evidence for the commission.  Then it comes to cross-examination by the other side and counsel asks: &ldquo;You say you signed that document?&rdquo; and he answers: &ldquo;I did.&rdquo;  Then the next question is: &ldquo;Before you signed that did you consider the matters you were bound by statute to consider, because if you did not consider those matters that you are bound to consider, the document has not been duly signed though you have actually signed it, that is because you did not discharge your full duty preparatory to signing it?&rdquo; Has the Minister considered that the matters dealt with by the board or commission were duly considered? Does he believe that the cost of feeding-stuffs was, in fact, considered?  I take leave to doubt it.  But if we put a statutory obligation on somebody to do a certain thing, preparatory to signing that document, why should we withdraw the opportunity of questioning the chairman or secretary who were supposed to do these things, whether they did them or not?  That is a good point.</P>

      <P>I remember being in court in a very important case where a local authority was concerned and where the minutes of the local authority were handed in as evidence.  The secretary of the local authority was brought up to prove the minutes and incidentally he was asked about the sending out of his agenda.  That was a very material point because if the agenda had not gone out in time it would invalidate the minutes.  The secretary was subjected to a very close cross-examination and he got away with it, but very nearly he did not get away with it.  His minutes would have been invalidated if he had not sent them out in time.  There are a lot of surrounding circumstances of that type which the court very often will require to have cleared up.  I do not see any reason why the commission should not be put in the same position as a local authority.</P>

      <P>If sub-section (1) (a) and (3) and (4) are deleted as Deputy McGilligan's amendment seeks, what is the real disability from which the commission will suffer?  Very little except that the commission will be amenable to the ordinary rules of evidence. On the other hand if the Minister insists on retaining these sub-sections there will be a hardship inflicted on the person taken to court by the commission. Deputy Dillon points out that a person is required to make a return and if he fails to make a return he is under certain disabilities.</P>
      <P>The only thing that is needed to prove he did not make a return&mdash;his word is not to be taken that he made it or did not make it&mdash;is a certificate of the secretary of the commission.  That is to be accepted, mind you, as evidence that the failed to make a return.  It goes further than that; not only will the certificate of the secretary of the commission be accepted, but a certificate purporting to be made by the secretary will be accepted.  It would be bad enough that the certificate of the secretary should be accepted, but we are asked here to accept a condition whereby a certificate purporting to be made by the secretary is to be evidence that a person committed an offence.  As I said, whatever disability or inconvenience the commission may suffer by wiping out the whole three sections, the chance of a complete wrong being done to the individual by retaining the sections creates a very difficult situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The words &ldquo;purporting to be a copy&rdquo; are there; if they were not there, there would be no necessity for the thing at all.  If it reads &ldquo;a certificate under the hand of the secretary&rdquo; that is enough, and you need go no further.  I do not know if Deputies are clear about this point; we are putting into this section that, if a certificate is given that a certain return was made or a certain thing was done, the chairman or secretary need not be there to prove his signature, but it is quite open to the litigant, the person who is on the other side, to subpoena the chairman or the secretary for cross-examination.  He <Col N="695" /> cannot evade being there if the other side wish him to be there.  I know that under the old Act those certificates were accepted in some cases, but where counsel wanted to cross-examine the chairman or secretary or both he took the precaution of serving a subpoena on them, and they were there to be cross-examined.  I think we are really only putting in a very formal thing here&mdash;that in ordinary cases the certificate would be accepted without having the chairman or the secretary there to prove it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>No sane defendant will ask the plaintiff to prove those documents if he knows that they can be proved and if he does not want to raise any point in regard to them, because, if he does, all the expense of proving them will be added to the cost of the action, and if he should be put down he would have to pay those expenses himself.  Suppose all those sections are deleted and I take an action against the board, I will send in my list of documents and say: &ldquo;Will you admit those?&rdquo; They will admit some of them.  They will send back a list of documents to me and say: &ldquo;We intend to put those in.  Will you admit them?&rdquo; Unless I am a madman I am not going to pile the costs on to the board, when I know that by piling the costs on to the board I am not hurting any of the officials who have vexed me, because all the money is going to come out of the funds of the board and not out of the chairman's pocket or the secretary's pocket, or the commissioners' pockets.  I think this is just a natural inclination of public servants to spare themselves trouble and time. They take a rough and ready view. &ldquo;We are not going to victimise anybody,&rdquo; they think, &ldquo;but we do not want to be dragged through all this interminable legal procedure.  Let us take a short cut.&rdquo;  Short cuts are all very well, but short cuts often lead to very undesirable tyranny, and though <Col N="697" /> I cannot imagine that the Pigs and Bacon Commission are going to develop into an Irish Hitler, still I like to protect my rights and those of my neighbours wherever I see them assailed.</P>

There is not a lot between us; in fact, it is hardly worth while arguing about it. That is as far as amendment No. 34 goes.  I think Nos. 35 and 36 are in a different category.</P>

      <P>We do not think the powers which the chairman had under Section 68 of the Pigs and Bacon Act, 1937, should be continued in the chairman under the new Act.

      <P>This is a very trivial matter.  This is a section which was put into the 1937 Act, and which enabled the chairman to deal with pigs left in the producers' hands.  If the producer were to write to the chairman and say he had pigs on hands, and <Col N="699" /> could not dispose of them, the chairman could serve an order on some factory to take those pigs, and serve notice on the producer to deliver them to the factory.</P>
      <P>That is the section.  In that case the power is given to the chairman, naturally because there were curers on the board.  There is no great objection to give that power to the commission instead of the chairman.  There was no order made under that section, so far.</P>

      <P>There was some doubt about the section of the original Act where levies would be collectable.  The wording was &ldquo;bacon sold by such person during such month in the State&rdquo;.

      <P>The arrangement in this Bill, as it stands, is that nothing will be deducted from the producer except the insurance levy.  It is further provided that if that levy is in any way increased, it will be collected from the curer so that there will be a certain levy on the producer and that levy cannot be increased in any way.  This amendment is merely a drafting amendment, to make that perfectly clear.  I do not think it is necessary to go exactly into the words.  I think if Deputies realise what the principle of the section is it will be sufficient.  The insurance levy cannot be increased as far as the producer is concerned.  It can be increased as far as the curer is concerned.  If there is an increase, it is taken from the curer.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister tell us at this stage how the question of licences is going to be operated?  This raises the question of licences.  We want an indication from the Minister as to what the policy would be with regard to these export licences.  The ordinary curer is a curer, not an exporter at the same time.  We are a co-operative concern.  We have been both curers and exporters, but on account of the operations of the Pigs Marketing Board and the fact that the curers had to obey certain rules and regulations, to a large extent, we ceased to be exporters from that time on.  Owing to the scarcity of pigs we had to transmit what normally we would have exported to other curers, or kill them for them in some cases.  I understand that the Minister will only give export licences on the basis of the 1938 performance.  That would put us out altogether.  Our position is that we must cater for our shareholders if they send us pigs.  Some pigs that would be utterly unsuitable for killing must be exported.</P>

What I suggest is that there should be a statement now, and there should be a free issue of licences to anybody who demanded them, to all shippers who shipped pigs previous to the time the control came.  We have been shipping to the extent of up to 5,000 pigs, and nearly 6,000 in some years, but since the operations of the Pigs Marketing Board the number dwindled down to hundreds and less.  If it is based on the 1938 performance it would be altogether unfair to a firm in our position who are catering for our shareholders, and must do so according to our rules. The other curers would not be in the same position.  They are curers, pure and simple.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to add a word to what Deputy Gorey has said. Deputy Gorey has spoken from the point of view of the co-operative curing factory.  What about the point of view of the ordinary small pig producer? <Col N="706" /> Suppose I bring in a pair of pigs to the fair of Ballaghaderreen and there are two buyers on the Square, one a buyer for an Irish bacon factory and the other a buyer who intends to export pigs to Birmingham. At the present moment, to-day, the buyer for the Irish bacon factory will tell me, if my pig is over-weight, that he will give me at the rate of 74/- for my pig.  And standing beside him is a man who is prepared to bid me 85/- to 90/- for the same pig.  But, because the Minister for Agriculture will not give that man a licence to export my pair of pigs I am fined on the Square of Ballaghadereen about 30/- to £2 on the pair of pigs.  I do not think that is right.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be unreasonable.  I do not want to recommend that degree of regulation which the British quota has made necessary and at the same time seek to impose upon the Minister conditions which are inconsistent with the whole scheme.  But I do think that when we have determined the proportion of bacon which we intend to send to Great Britain to fill the quota we ought to do our best to make provision in that quota for so much bacon in the shape of live pigs as will absorb all the overweight pigs available in the State and if we err at all we ought to make the quota of live pigs a little too big instead of catering for all the possible exports of the factories and then giving the live pig producer, whose pigs are a little over weight, just the tail-end of whatever quota has been taken in the particular month for Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think it is time the Minister told us what he intends to do in that matter.  Everybody knows that there were some licences given to pig buyers recently for the shipping of live pigs to England and I saw in Ballaghaderreen four or five buyers at the last fair, on Tuesday, and I think the Minister would have been astonished at the difference it made to the whole atmosphere of the town that those buyers were there.  Fat pigs were no longer a drug on the market.  They were eagerly bought and at good prices.  The lean pigs went, I suppose, to the Irish factory and everyone was catered for <Col N="707" /> and everyone was happy.  I know it has been the purpose of the Minister to abolish the fat pig out of our economy altogether.  I am convinced that experience must have taught the Minister that that is not good policy.  It is legitimate to try to get the bacon factories a fair share of pigs of a standard size for their particular trade but the fat pig suits our people in certain parts of this country, not only their economy of production, but the fat pig suits the countryman who wants to cure a pig for himself.  A man buying a pig to cure for his own household, will never buy what a factory would call a bacon pig.  He wants a big, fat 2-cwt. pig. The demand for those is never sufficient to consume all the available supplies.  The case I am making is over and above Deputy Gorey's case that a co-operative concern that was exporting large quantities of pigs in the past should get their share of the licences in the future.  I am making representations to the Minister that the producers of pigs in this country, if they are to get an economic price for their output, ought to be afforded an adequate opportunity of shiping live pigs to Great Britain.  My suggestion is to give the dealers who were shipping pigs to England sufficient licences to go out to the fairs and compete with the Deputy and with other curing companies for pigs.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will remember his point later.  I want to explain the position here.  I do not want it to be thought that I am unsympathetic to the live pig exporter. When a regulation was brought in by the British, in 1934 or 1935, whenever it was, we had to bring in an Act to regulate the export of bacon by quota and also the export of pigs that were going to factories in England.  For the first three or four years that we were working under that Act the British Government was all the time pressing us to keep the live pigs down.  Apart from that, of course. pigs went out, without licence, that were not consigned to factories, pigs that were sent to pork butchers, etc., and which were quite free to go out without any licence.  Take the present position.  We are now in the position that no live pigs can go out without a licence.  There is no such thing as pigs going to pork butchers, or anything like that; they must all have a licence.  The only thing that the British are trying to enjoin on us is that we keep a fair proportion the whole year round.  I am quite sure that if we went to the British and said: &ldquo;We will export half live pigs and half bacon&rdquo;, that for the present they would say: &ldquo;That is all right&rdquo;.  But we are in this position, that for the months, say, from about February to August, we get no live pigs out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is our experience for the last three or four years.  That is the trouble.  We cannot put too high a proportion, because we know that we cannot fill our quota of live pigs during those months.  Now we put a fairly high quota so as to absorb all we can in those other months, even though we may fail in the months referred to.  In addition to that, during November we asked the British Government to take 2,000 more, and they did take them. <Col N="709" /> That is all we can do, I am afraid, during the autumn months.  We will have to leave the proportion fairly low for live pigs, but try to get them to take some extra during those months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that is the sensible thing to do.  I think it is the wise thing to do, to go to the British Government in the months of surplus and say: &ldquo;Here are pigs; take them away if you want them.&rdquo;  I put this to the Minister: Great Britain is to go on four ounces of bacon per person in January.  Why do we not go to the British now and say: &ldquo;There is one matter in which we can apparently reach almost self-sufficiency, and that is pigs, bacon and hams.  If you are prepared to co-operate with us in tempting our people into this business, and hold out the prospect to us that after the war the bacon and pig market here, for strategical reasons, will in future be primarily reserved for the English and Irish farmer&rdquo;; that we do not make any economic representations at all, but simply say: &ldquo;Here is one kind of agricultural production admirably suited to the big man, but equally admirably suited to the very small man &mdash;it is the only form that has that peculiar quality&mdash;and we can get started now on a 20-year plan to build up our bacon output to meet the potential requirements of these two islands &mdash;to go as near it as we can.&rdquo;  There are a number of matters which I do not propose to raise now, because they go a little further afield than the sub-section would permit, but the main point is this: If you go to Great Britain and say, &ldquo;Let us make a 20-year plan&rdquo;, the ultimate objective of which &mdash;though we might not reach that ultimate objective&mdash;would be to provide all the bacon and hams to be consumed in these islands, surely we have an unprecedented opportunity, and it would mean that we never would have too many pigs for the potential market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy may rest assured that these things are being put up.  One is surprised, if you like, at the lack of foresight shown by the British Government at present in not seeing our case for supplying plenty of bacon; but I suppose they are very busy, and perhaps are confused in connection <Col N="710" /> with a lot of these issues at present.  I think that after a little time we will have a better opportunity of looking into and discussing these matters, and we will probably be able to get somewhat in the direction the Deputy wishes.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not refer to my point with regard to the co-operatives.  What we ask simply is, with all this control and all the rest, that that should not be taken as the basis for licences to export.  The real basis should be the time previous to control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to get a basis on which to manage these things.  The basis that the Export Committee took with my approval was that the pigs exported, say, in November, 1938, would be taken as the basic figure for November, 1939.  When that was put up by the Export Committee I thought it was a fair basis to go on.  I suppose it might be argued that if we took some period before control it would be better still.  I do not know, however, Whatever basis you take, I am afraid some people will be victimised and there will be hardship.  We have to do the best we can.</P>

      <P>Let us not overlook this one.  This is the amendment I move on behalf of Deputy McGilligan: &ldquo;To delete sub-section (5)&rdquo;.  It is proposed there that the board could march into court with a certificate of indemnity, and the moment they did that they ceased to be under any obligation to prove that they are owed anything. Upon the person against whom they issue the certificate is thrown the obligation of proving that he did not owe anything.  That is really going beyond the beyonds, that the Department should have the right to put it on a man to prove that he was not in their debt.  There can be no justification for it.  I need not remind Deputies that in the regulation of a business such as this, these levies involve, the preparation of pretty considerable returns.  I admit freely that it is not easy to prove a curer owes these levies, but I put it to the Minister that sub-section (5) should be deleted, and the board restored to the position that any other litigant would be in, if he sought to prove that his neighbour was in his debt.</P>

      <P>This sub-section is unsustainable.  This board is a semi-Government Department and, in fact, is an ordinary commercial institution. Is there any other commercial organisation to which this House would give such power?  Any district justice will feel insulted if a document from the board is handed to him, and if he has to take it as evidence.  It might be produced by a subordinate servant of the board.  In a Bill of this kind it is positively ridiculous to have such a proviso, and the Minister should at once agree to have it taken out.  This is a simple contract debt and we should not put this board in a better position than any other litigant.  If there is a debt let them go to the court and prove it in the usual way.  The board is getting sufficient privileges.  As Deputy Dillon <Col N="713" /> stated, it would be a monstrous thing if a man who did not owe a debt could be brought to court and put to legal expense in order to prove that he did not owe anything.  In this case the onus of proof is on the plaintiff.  These provisions were in the Slaughter of Animals Act and I then objected to them.  It is a bad thing to have them in any Bill, as they simply wipe out the law of evidence and the onus of proof.  All the Department has to do here is to prepare a document which need not be signed by the Minister.  If the certificate had to be handed to the Minister for signature something could be said for it.  In this case some junior clerk in the office of the board may make out a document and send it down to the court where a solicitor produces it saying: &ldquo;There is my proof.  So much is due.  Give me a decree.&rdquo; Would any Deputy take that as evidence? Yet that is what we are asked to do in this sub-section.  There should be no contest about this.  The sub-section should go.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I direct the attention of the Minister to sub-section (3), because I think there is something there that he may wish to amend:</P>
      <P>If any licensee fails or neglects to pay the amount certified by a certificate of indebtedness to be payable by him within four weeks after the service of a copy of such certificate on him, the Minister may revoke the licence in relation to which such amount is payable, but such revocation shall not relieve such person from liability to pay the said amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is not that going very far?  Surely the Government that has a right to go in and recover a levy by way of judgment ought not to have the right to impose a penalty of such immense gravity as to revoke a licence?  That is going a very long way indeed.  If you revive the production quota and its functions <Col N="714" /> again it is a very valuable asset and is negotiable, by the Minister's leave.  Is not that so?</P>

      <P>It is a grave thing to give the Minister the right to impose a penalty, far in excess of what any normal court would impose, over and above the amount of the levy claimed. Surely if the Minister gets his levy and can prove no other malfeasance against the licensee, he ought not to have the right to take away the licence.  I observe that the sub-section does not say if the licensee declines or fraudulently attempts to avoid payment, but if he fails or neglects to pay.  If you put in these words and if the licensee falls down or neglects to pay, he is in the hands of the Minister, who can take his licence from him.  Surely that is wrong?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not remember exactly, but I think in the original Act, and in all the other Acts, the Minister had power to revoke a licence if there was any commission or omission. Certainly all the Acts read in that way.  Personally I do not mind very much about this particular power. I think it is very unlikely that any Minister would act as precipitately as Deputy Dillon fears.  We have fairly drastic powers to revoke licences, such as fresh meat licences, and for creameries and egg exporters, but these things are very carefully considered if any case is made.  In this particular instance if a man said he was not able to pay, or wanted time to pay in a couple of months, or showed any inclination to comply with the regulations, I am quite sure the licence would not be revoked by the Minister for Agriculture, whoever he might be.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy McGilligan, I move amendment No. 55:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), lines 15, 21, 24 and 25, in sub-section (3), lines 35, 40, and in sub-section (4), line 50, to delete in each line the word &ldquo;Commission&rdquo; and substitute in each case the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment raises a rather interesting point and, on it, we can dispose of all the amendments coming within the particular category.  In all these cases we are proposing to substitute the Minister for the commission in relation to the fixing of rates of subsidy and levy.  We have advanced to the position where we now are by a series of steps.  We began by giving Ministers power to make regulations under statutes, these regulations to have the effect of statutes.  Our next step was to create bodies like the Electricity Supply Board and give them power to make bye-laws which would be binding. Now, we move a step further and we give the Bacon Commission power to levy taxes.  Do we think it right to give a commission which is not directly responsible to this House at all, the right to levy taxes?  Our neighbour, Great Britain, cut off the King's head before she would consent to that proposition&mdash;to somebody outside Parliament levying taxes on the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much as I criticise the prospective chairman of the Pigs and Bacon Commission, I am not prepared to advocate that we should cut off his head. But I am prepared to urge that neither to him nor to either of his two distinguished colleagues should we remit our duty to levy such taxes as are right to levy and to answer to the country for having done so.  I do not think that it is any defence if we, the elected legislators, go to the country and say: &ldquo;We did not put that tax on your pigs; it was the Bacon Commission that did it.&rdquo;  I think we ought to answer to the people for the levies made on pigs and the subsidies paid out of such levies.  I put it to the Minister that it would be better in this case if he would fix the rate of levy and subsidy albeit on the advice of the commission.  Then, if we disapprove of <Col N="718" /> the levy, we can make him answer for it here.  His responsibility and the responsibility of this House for taxation of all kinds would then be preserved intact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that there is a good deal in what Deputy Dillon says. This House is so jealous about the collection of taxes that it would not even permit a Minister to have such power, and now we are passing on this power to a commission.  If you take this power from the commission, they will not have very much to do.  In regulating subsidies and levies, if such are necessary, it will be the duty of the commission to go into every little detail and make out the prices of pigs and bacon, both exported and sold at home. They are the only people who could make out what should be the levy on a particular class of bacon and what should be the subsidy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They might.  The levy and subsidy Orders will be published and, in that way, will be, at least, made known to Deputies.  There is no provision for immediate review by Deputies of this particular matter. Under the scheme we more or less agreed to to-day, they could only be reviewed at the end of the year, and it would only then be open to Deputies to say that a particular levy was not justified.  I do not know that it is going to improve matters very much to makes these Orders subject to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fiction to which we all contribute that the Minister is responsible for everything done in his Department.  We all know that the Minister for Industry and Commerce does a great many things the nature of which he does not himself know until his attention is directed to them by Parliamentary questions.  Then he calls up his permanent advisers, who brief him and verse him in all that is done.  He is their spokesman, and <Col N="719" /> must accept responsibility for whatever they have done.  It is quite true that the Minister would not be able in this case to watch these things from day to day, as the members of the commission will be able to do, but that is true of a hundred and one activities of most Departments of State.  If somebody raises the matter in Dáil Éireann it will be the duty of members of the commission to explain to the Minister the grounds on which they recommended the rate of levy should be fixed, or the grounds on which they recommended the rate of bounty should be fixed.  It would be up to the Minister then to come into the House and defend it.</P>
      <P>If we do not do that, where are we going to end?  Under the Butter Act, the Minister reserves that power to himself.  He makes the Order.  The accounts of the Butter Fund have to be submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor-General and, if levies are improperly made or improperly collected or improperly paid out, the Comptroller and Auditor-General will direct the attention of the Committee on Public Accounts to the matter.  The Minister's accounting officer answers for what has been done and, as this Bill before us bears testimony, on occasion the Minister is required to take steps to regularise certain matters in connection with the administration of the fund.  Is there any objection to the Minister doing this himself?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not be a question of grade or class anyway.  If they are defining a class of bacon, for the purpose <Col N="721" /> of collecting a levy, they will not say that the levy will be collected on one grade or another.  That, however, was not what I had in mind.  What I had in mind was that we might collect a different rate of levy on bacon consumed at home or exported to one country rather than another country.  For instance, at one time, there was a fairly good trade for the export of hams to France, and it might be possible that that would bear a better levy than the export of hams to, say, Britain, America or some other country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I see the Minister's point, but what I am aiming at is to try to protect the interests of the consumers as well as of the producers. I am sure the Minister will agree that, at the beginning, there were great difficulties with regard to this matter of classes or grades, and what I want to know is whether the same difficulty is going to operate again. For instance, we have bacon of different classes or grades, such as grade A, grade B and grade C, and now that the heavier pig is not going to be exported, that kind of pig must be made into bacon.  Now, I suppose we may presume that the best of the bacon is going to be exported, and I want to protect the consumer, in some way or another, so that he will know what particular grade of bacon he is getting.  I think that there should be some system of branding grades.  We know that, at certain times, bacon of, let us say, grade C, was sold as grade A bacon, and that the same price was charged for it.  We know that, even bacon of grade Z, if you want to go down the alphabet, was charged for at the same price as grade A bacon, and that it was sent out as food in this country and as very good bacon, and that it sold at very good prices. Now, presumably, we are going to export bacon to Britain for good prices, and I certainly do not want to see that market wiped out, but it must be remembered that it is the consumer who has to pay the piper, and I want to see the consumer safeguarded.  In other words, I want to see that the consumer will know what bacon he is getting, and that he will not have to pay grade A prices for grade C bacon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Deputy's point arises here.  We levy on certain classes of bacon, and these classes refer principally to the countries to which the bacon is exported. I think, however, that the Deputy is referring to the case of the curer who pays 84/-, 82/- or 75/- for certain grades of pigs, and that the Deputy wants the consumer to get the advantage of that difference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, I think there is a certain difficulty there.  I am told by the inspectors of my own Department that if you take, say, 100 pigs, some of which go into Grade A. or the first class, and some of which go into grade B or grade C, at 84/-, 82/- and 75/-, it is quite possible that, when they are taken out of cure, some of the pigs that were bought at the lowest price may produce the best bacon.  All kinds of factors enter into this matter, such as the way the pigs were fed, and so on, but it is impossible to grade bacon exactly on the question of where the pigs came from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>

I want to see the consumer safeguarded, so that he will not get, let us say, No. 3 quality bacon, and have to pay No. 1 quality price for it.</P>

One of these is a contravention of the Act of 1935 itself.  This section proposes to apply the provisions of that Section 30 to the Act of 1937 and this Act; that is, a contravention of the Act of 1935 or of the Act of 1937 or of this Act would make a person liable to revocation of his licence.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (2) of Section 40 of the Act of 1935 is hereby amended by the insertion of the words &ldquo;or for reward&rdquo; after the word &ldquo;sale&rdquo; and the said section shall be construed and have effect accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="727" /> The provisions of Section 40 of the Act of 1935 made it unlawful for a person to cure bacon for sale unless he was the holder of a licence or was a registered pork butcher.  It has been found that certain persons who were formerly curing bacon are still curing for farmers.  When challenged, they say that the bacon is not for sale.  This makes clear that they must not cure for reward or for sale.  I think it is necessary to stop this, though I do not know if it has been done on a very big scale.  It does not prevent a farmer killing his own pigs, but stops certain people from carrying on trade in that small way for reward.</P>

Up to the moment there are possibly, in some villages and towns, men carrying on a very small business, they are not exporting bacon and are no danger to anybody.  Their bacon is not leaving the country, they are curing it, and it is perfectly sound bacon.  This is being done for neighbours.

      <P>At the end of the section in page 20 to insert the following new sub-section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  In this section and in the Acts of 1935 and 1937 the expression &ldquo;appointed price&rdquo; means minimum price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to alter &ldquo;fixed price&rdquo; to &ldquo;minimum price&rdquo;.  Obviously, it would make for more competition and afford a better opportunity to the producer.  In practice, I think it is difficult to operate a fixed price, and I am sure that the inspectors of the Department and others concerned would have to admit that, in many cases, the fixed price <Col N="734" /> is the minimum price.  I cannot prove that, but I believe, from a good deal of contact with people, that it is very difficult to have this rigidly imposed fixed price.  I cannot see the advantage of it, but I can see advantages in having a minimum price, because, as I say, it is going to give a better opportunity for competition and, in that way, favour the producer of the pig.  There are certain districts which are not prolific in pigs, and if there is no opportunity for bacon curers, for instance, to settle in the areas in which pigs are prolific, they will have no chance of going outside to buy them. The area from which I come is a big bacon-curing centre, employing a good many men, but Limerick and Tipperary adjoining, are not very big pig-producing counties and, in the past, before any of this interference by legislation took place, our men had the privilege of curing pigs at Limerick from counties far removed from Limerick.  I am afraid that if we are going to have a fixed price, with production quotas excluded, there is a danger that my area would be likely to lose.  I can see some of the employees walking around idle, at a time when there should be an opportunity to buy these pigs in fair competition, and give an advantage to the producer, rather than that we should stick to the rigid fixed price which, I believe, in practice is scarcely attainable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree that, in present circumstances, at any rate, we should change from a fixed price to a minimum price.  That was one of the questions that was very fully considered when drafting the Bill which we drafted as a result of the findings of the Prices Commission and the Agricultural Commission.  If we depart from the production quota, I think we are running one risk, that the bigger curers may take advantage of the opportunity, with their better organisation and so on, to try to get more pigs than they are getting at present, and to leave the smaller curers with somewhat fewer.  If, in addition, we make a minimum price instead of a fixed price, I think we are almost certain to give that big advantage <Col N="735" /> to the bigger curers.  Apart from that, we are aiming at a certain thing in this Bill.  I do not know whether we can achieve it or not, but we are aiming at getting the best we can for the producer and the consumer out of the bacon business.  We can, I hope, after getting the costings of bacon production, fix what might be regarded as a fair margin for bacon production for the curer.  We know what he is going to pay for his pigs because the price is fixed.  We allow this margin to the manufacturer and we then know what the ex-factory price should be.  If we tell the Prices Commission what that price ought to be, the Prices Commission can look after the bacon as it goes to the wholesaler and the retailer, and make known to the purchasing public what the price of bacon ought to be.</P>
      <P>Again, I say on that point that if we depart from the fixed price to the minimum price, the bacon curers will say that they have paid so and so for pigs&mdash;not the fixed price, but something over&mdash;and it will make it extremely difficult to get down to this matter of costings, to a fair margin for the curer and a fair price for the curer, and afterwards put the bacon through the wholesaler and retailer, and get the best possible results for the consumer.  I ask the Deputy not to press this amendment at the moment.  If we had some experience of working this scheme without a production quota, we might say that we could go further in decontrol and could fix a minimum price.  If we did reach that stage, I think all other things might go.</P>

      <P>In speaking of a minimum price, if a particular curer pays more than the minimum price, it means that he is going to have less profit.  The Minister, in giving a final price for bacon, would be influenced by the minimum price fixed, and surely at this stage it is not going to be suggested that the curer should be saved from further expenditure, if he is good enough to spend something more on a pig?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the Deputy's point. The Deputy says that, in fixing that margin for the curer, we say: &ldquo;You need not pay more than the minimum price, but if you do, it is out of your own pocket&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister take this into consideration?  It is desirable, I take it, and the Minister will probably agree, that curers in all areas should get a sufficiency of pigs? The object of this amendment is not to give the pig curer an advantage, but to enable the small curer to get a sufficient supply of pigs at all times.  The Minister takes the view that it may have a different reaction altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give some assurance that these activities of the commission will ensure that there will be a sufficiency of pigs for curers in various parts of the country?  Otherwise there is a danger that where the production of pigs is on a large scale, the big bacon curers may buy all the pigs and the small curers, either in that area or in some distant place, may not be able to get any pigs.  Will the <Col N="737" /> Minister think over that and try to deal with that situation on the Report Stage?  Will he give some kind of assurance that as far as he and the commission are concerned they will try to get an even distribution of pigs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a point to which we have given a great deal of consideration, and I cannot see any solution for it.  That is why I am proposing here in the Bill to make the abolition of the production quota only experimental.  I do not know if we can go back to that again if the big curers injure the smaller curers.  It is very difficult to guarantee what Deputy Norton asks.  Suppose we say that every curer must get a fair number of pigs.  It will be possible then for a curer in some part of the country to take things easy and to say: &ldquo;I am guaranteed a certain number of pigs and I do not see why I should have to go out and look for them.&rdquo;  It is very difficult to give a guarantee of that kind in legislation.  All we can do is to watch things, to watch how the scheme will go after the abolition of the production quota.  If we see any unforeseen hardship arising, we shall have to mend our hand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another aspect of the question to which I do not think that Deputy Keyes has adverted.  There are two separate theories in connection with the price of pigs.  It may be that you are going to fix a minimum price and invite cut-throat competition between curers.  That may be a very good thing, but it is open to certain dangers.  Henry Denny may make up his mind that he is going to clear up the County Kerry.  He will do two things.  He will send all his buyers down into Kerry and he will tell them to pay 5/- per cwt. more for pigs than any other curer in Kerry.  He will keep on doing that until he makes the fairs of Kerry very unpopular with all other buyers, and then, when he has the whole field to himself, he will cut down prices.  At the same time he will go into the Kerry area and sell bacon at 10/- per cwt. less than the price at which the Kerry factories can sell it.  He will keep on doing that until the Kerry factories say to him: &ldquo;Take us over; we are done for; we cannot stand the racket any longer.&rdquo; Then, when he has got all the factories and dominates all the fairs in the area, he pulls down the price of pigs and shoves up the price of bacon.  The reason the Minister retains the production quota is that when he sees that happening he will step in and say: &ldquo;Whoa! We cannot let you cure more than a certain number of pigs.  We are going to give the Kerry factories a certain number of pigs to cure, and if necessary we are going to give them a quota sufficient to consume all the bacon which we allow them to produce.&rdquo; If the Minister has to use that power, it will be a great misfortune, but the fact that he can use it is the most potent deterrent you can possibly get to prevent the big combine trying to smash the small local unit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another aspect of the situation of which we have lost sight altogether.  Rather than getting an abnormal profit for a lucky farmer at a particular season of the year.  I <Col N="739" /> should like to be able to say to all farmers who produce pigs at all seasons of the year: &ldquo;You are going to make a fair profit on all the pigs you put in.&rdquo; Therefore, we should prescribe a fixed price for pigs on the 1st August which will bear a certain relation to the price of the standard ration for a pig&mdash; which will bear, if I may say so, a certain relation to the pigs cost-of-living figure.  With this, the farmer will have the assurance that the fixed price on the 1st December will bear the same relation to the pigs cost-of-living figure over a four-month period, as the fixed price on the 1st August bore to the cost of living or of feeding stuffs on the 1st August.  That means to say that you can tell the man who puts in six pigs: &ldquo;If none of your pigs die you will have a profit on the 1st December. It is not going to be an immense profit. but you are absolutely certain that you are not going to be at a loss.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Deputies may have heard me plead to the Minister to make a ten or 20 years' agreement aimed at supplying all the bacon and ham requirements of these two islands out of the joint resources of Great Britain and Ireland. If we can do that, and we have at the same time a fixed price in strict relation to the cost of feeding stuffs, we could guarantee for every farmer in this country one branch of agriculture on which he would never fail to make a profit.  Therefore, what I am asking the Minister to do, in preference to Deputy Keyes' proposal, is to consider the desirability of accepting an amendment which I propose to submit to him on recommittal, analogous to that to which reference is made at column 139 of the Pigs and Bacon Bill Special Committee Report.  I then submitted an amendment to the original Bill which I knew was too rigid and which I knew would have to be withdrawn. Instead of it, the Minister did put in a proviso that when the Pigs and Bacon Marketing Board were fixing prices for pigs they were bound to consider the price of feeding stuffs.</P>
    <P>In England they went further than that because they based the price of pork on the price of feeding-stuffs. What I am asking the Minister now, <Col N="740" /> instead of accepting Deputy Keyes' proposal to fix a minimum price, is to relate the price of pigs to the price of feeding-stuffs hereafter so that he can say to small farmers who get into pig production: &ldquo;There is one branch of agricultural in which you are bound to make a profit.&rdquo;  I think that is a better scheme than Deputy Keyes' plan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dillon has introduced a regular Juggernaut attached to the very mild proposal of mine.  He thinks that this proposal to fix a minimum price is going to flatten and steam-roll the pig-rearing industry, that some foreign combine is going to go into Kerry and buy all the pigs by paying 10/- per cwt. more than anybody else is prepared to pay.  The Deputy visualises a nightmare of that kind arising out of this proposal.  But for the hard working, industrious pig rearers in this country we do not want either fixed prices or the monster that Deputy Dillon has conjured up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And which did come to Sligo.  The Deputy had better ask them about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>What we want is competition and fair buying that will give satisfaction to the producers.  I am reminded that last week Deputy Dillon complained that if the fair had been held at Knockcroghery it would have put at least £2,000 into the pockets of the pig rearers of that district, in which I am sure he is interested, because it would have given them the chance, as he said, of sending their pigs across to England.  What I am suggesting to the Minister is that if he adopts my proposal and agrees to have a minimum price that will lead to competition at the fairs and will bring increased revenue to our pig rearers.  The buyers will be prepared to pay a couple of shillings above the minimum price for pigs of the first grade which are required to meet the demands of a particular trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does Deputy Dillon want to stand in the way of his people down in Knockcroghery getting an extra few thousand pounds for their pigs?  He seemed to <Col N="741" /> be very much concerned about them the other night, but here is a way to confer a benefit on them, and it is surely the Deputy's business to try and serve the interests of his people. I am not a bit afraid of this terrible nightmare which Deputy Dillon has pictured for us of some Continental firm coming along here and buying, at fabulous prices, all the pigs in the County Kerry, with the result, as he thinks, that activity in the pig industry will come to an end there.</P>
    <P>I do not believe for a moment that anything of the kind is likely to happen, and I suggest to the Deputy that we should approach this matter in a commonsense way.  The farmers surely are entitled to get every opportunity of securing the best price available for the pigs they have to offer.  That situation will be brought about if you have a minimum price.  There will be keen competition at the fairs because the buyers who want to secure top-grade pigs will be quite ready to pay a few shillings extra for them so that they may be able to fill the demands of the factories they represent.  I hope the Minister will not be influenced by what Deputy Dillon has said to depart from the attitude that he indicated earlier. I believe that the introduction of the principle of a minimum price would produce the most beneficial results, and therefore I would appeal to the Minister to give it a chance.  The Minister should not allow himself to be tied up under any Act of Parliament, but should leave himself in the position in which he will be able to introduce, if he finds it necessary, a minimum price as against a fixed price.</P>

I think that other big changes will be necessary, but at the same time I am almost certain that a stage will be reached when we can get a consolidation of all the pigs and bacon legislation properly done.</P>

      <P>Could we have an assurance from the Minister that all the curers will be able to get an adequate supply of pigs to cure.  That is the real point.  This amendment may, perhaps, not be the best way of meeting that, but I am not too sure that Deputy Dillon's method is the way to meet it. You may have a situation in which curers, in certain areas, will not be able to get pigs because of the fact that some big combine in the industry may come along and buy pigs in that area for reasons known to itself, and may export those pigs elsewhere for curing. I think we should have some indication from the Minister that, so far as the activities of the commission are concerned, all curers will be able to get an adequate supply of pigs, so that you will not have a situation of that kind arising.  We do not want to have a situation in which an octopus in the industry may collar all the pigs available over some particular area, pigs of a particular type, while other curers cannot get a sufficient supply of pigs. If such a situation did arise it would have the effect of throwing a number of people out of employment in the bacon curing industry in certain parts of the country.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister acknowledges that the only relevant factor for fixing prices now is the cost of feeding stuffs, will he consider taking steps to relate the price of pigs to the cost of feeding stuffs.  What I suggest to him is that he should strike out a cost-of-living figure for the pig: that he should fix a basic price for pigs and give the pig producer a cost-of-living bonus, as the pig's cost of living rises or falls.  I think the Minister should consider that. If he does not, then I am afraid that his best laid plans may &ldquo;gang aft a-gley&rdquo; by the intervention of the Minister for Supplies or the Minister for Industry and Commerce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will read the clause in the original Act he will find set out there all the various considerations which the board had to take into consideration before fixing prices. None of them now arise except the one relating to the price of feeding stuffs. All those conditions were put in because of the fear of over production. There is no such thing as over-production now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that he ought to fix a cost-of-living figure for the pig.  Let us suppose that to-day it is 100, and that the price on that basis is 84/- for top grade.  On every point of a rise in the cost-of-living figure the price of pork could be raised by, say, 2/-.  If the cost-of-living figure went up to 104 the price of pork would go up by 8/-, leaving the price for top grade pigs at 92/-.  I admit at once that that would involve some kind of agreement with Great Britain whereby we would keep the cost-of-feeding stuffs in strict relation to prices.  There is, of course, a difficulty there, but if we are going to make pigs one of the biggest factors in our agricultural industry, surely that is a difficulty that we ought to tackle and try to fix up.  A further point that I want to impress on the Minister is this: the urgent necessity <Col N="744" /> of telling me to-day what he will give me for my pigs&mdash;not now, when I have no pigs to sell&mdash;but on the 1st March, when my pigs will be ready for sale. If I am to go out and buy bonhams at the next fair, and if I am to be tempted to go into the business now, I must be told what my pigs will be worth when I have them finished.  I must also be told that the price of feeding stuffs will remain at a stable figure during the period that I am fattening the pigs, or that the Minister's fixed price will fluctuate up and down with what the price of feeding stuffs turns out to be on the average between now and the 1st March.</P>
