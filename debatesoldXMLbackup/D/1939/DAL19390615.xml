      <P>Go ndeontar suim Bhreise ná raghaidh thar £10 chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1940, chun caiteachais i dtaobh Foirgintí Puiblí; chun Páirceanna agus Oibreacha Puiblí áirithe do chothabháil; agus chun Oibreacha Dréineála do dhéanamh agus do Chothabháil.</P>
      <P>That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1940, for Expenditure in respect of Public Buildings: for the Maintenance of certain Parks and Public Works; and for the Execution and Maintenance of Drainage Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Supplementary Estimate arises really out of a gift which the trustees of the Rotunda Hospital propose to make to the State.  The matter arises in this way: At the beginning of 1935, Deputy Oscar Traynor, the present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and several former I.R.A. officers, on behalf of the Dublin Brigade Council of the Old I.R.A., submitted a memorandum to an inter-Departmental Committee of this State suggesting that, perhaps, the Rotunda Gardens might be taken over by the Government and converted into a public park to be dedicated to the memory of all who gave their lives in the cause of Irish freedom. On investigating this proposal, it was ascertained that arrangements had already been completed for the erection of a nurses' residence on portion of the Rotunda grounds, and that the space remaining for the park would be approximately an area of one and a half acres.  In the course of the inquiries, members of the managing committee of the Rotunda and the <Col N="999" /> governors became aware of the purpose for which the inquiries had been made, and, as a result, after overcoming a considerable number of legal and other difficulties which were in the way, on the 8th April, 1938, at a meeting of the board of the hospital, a resolution was passed unanimously making a gift to the Government of the plot of ground available at the northern end of the Rotunda Gardens, subject to the terms of an agreement to be drawn up by the board's solicitors.  The only condition attached to the gift was that proper precautions were to be taken against undue noise, as the nurses' quarters, where nurses on night duty sleep during the day, were within a short distance of the plot.</P>
    <P>Arrangements for the transfer of the plot have not yet been completed but a draft agreement, which is being prepared, provides <i>inter alia</i> (a) for the erection and maintenance by the Commissioners of Public Works of a suitable railing between the gardens and the remainder of the hospital grounds, (b) for the closing of the entrance to the gardens at times to be fixed by mutual consent, (c) that no building shall at any time be erected on the grounds without a licence in writing from the governors of the hospital.  The adaptation of the plot as a Garden of Remembrance is under consideration.  Apart from the cost of providing a memorial, the grounds will have to be improved at a cost, perhaps, of some thousands of pounds and will, naturally, have to be maintained from year to year.  Owing to the unusual nature of the transaction, it has been thought desirable that the matter should be brought to the notice of the Dáil by means of this Supplementary Estimate.  While the sum of £2,060 provided in sub-head A of the Estimate is technically described as being in respect of the purchase, it is, in reality, a payment to enable the governors to provide accommodation elsewhere for the employees of the hospital housed in two lodges in the grounds, which lodges may, perhaps, have to be demolished.  I should like to make quite clear that while we describe this as a purchase in the details of the printed Estimate, it is, in substance, a <Col N="1000" /> free gift.  For the very valuable site, the governors are getting barely what would compensate them for relinquishing the existing buildings upon it and enable them to defray the law costs incurred.</P>
    <P>In submitting this Estimate to the Dáil, I think I ought on behalf of the Government and, I am sure, on behalf of the House, express to the governors and board of the hospital and to those who have acted as intermediaries, our very deep appreciation of their public-spirited action in this matter.  I am sure I can undertake on behalf of the Government and of the Oireachtas that the purpose to which this very valuable site will be devoted will be worthy of the gift which they have made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to bring before the Dáil a viewpoint in connection with this Estimate.  I agree wholeheartedly with the provision of a Garden of Remembrance for the high and laudable object indicated in the Estimate and I think the governors of the hospital have been public-spirited in setting aside this portion of their property for such use.  But I do not at all agree that the site available is adequate for the purpose indicated in the Estimate.  I happen to know the site particularly well.  It surprises me that there is an acre and a half available. When pathways are run through this piece of ground and when the other adjuncts to a garden are installed, the portion which will be left will be extremely small and will represent a very tiny Garden of Remembrance. One could hardly call it more than a souvenir.  I am wholeheartedly in sympathy with the idea to provide a Garden of Remembrance, but my complaint is that the site secured by the Government is not sufficient to do justice to the high and laudable object underlying the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other sites in Dublin might be acquired for this purpose.  The Mountjoy Square site might be acquire and dedicated to that special purpose. There is a magnificent park at Fairview covering a very extensive area. It should be possible for the Government, by arrangement with the Dublin Corporation, to acquire that park, in whole or in part, and to set up there a garden of remembrance which would <Col N="1001" /> do credit to the purpose underlying this Estimate.  I am afraid that the project for which provision is being made in this Estimate will be a very tiny one and that the garden will be a very tiny garden which will not do credit to the object of the Estimate.  I should hope that, at this stage, it would not be impossible to do something on a much bigger and loftier scale than is contemplated here.  The garden at the Rotunda is a very small one and it will look smaller when railed off from the present nursing home.  It should not be impossible for the Government, or whoever is dealing with this matter, to find much more spacious accommodation and to provide what everybody would look upon as a very beautiful garden.  The magnitude of the garden would be rather the measure of our appreciation of the sacrifice of those who died.  I am afraid the project contemplated will not enable us to look upon it in the way we should like to look upon it.  I should hope that, at this stage, it might be possible for the Government to undertake further inquiries and to acquire ground which, in its dimensions and potentialities, would show much greater credit to the object visualised in this Estimate than the site proposed to be acquired at the Rotunda Gardens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>One has to take every factor into consideration and I am not aware that any city in Great Britain has so valuable a site in so central a situation devoted to such a purpose as this will be.  We could have a much larger site but it would not be a site upon the main artery of our city, within easy access, and standing on very historic ground.  Let us not forget that the Rotunda has certain associations with very historic action here, as has also O'Connell Street. There may be differences of opinion as to how adequate the memorial will be. I think that the good taste and the genius of the Irish people will enable us, even in that circumscribed site, to erect a monument which will be worthy of our dead.</P>

      <Col N="1003" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section I stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to raise one point on this section.  It is some time ago since an opportunity was afforded me of looking up the assessments for surtax, but my recollection is that for the year 1931-32, although it may not have been published in that year, the sum assessable for surtax was over £11,000,000&mdash;something like £11,000,000.  The sum realised in that year in respect of surtax amounted to almost £789,000.  In the year 1935-36, after some alteration had in the intervening period been made, not only with regard to the rates of surtax, but also with regard to the extension of it, bringing in persons who had an income of £1,500 to £2,000 who were not assessable for surtax in 1931-32, my recollection of the figure that was assessable is that it was £8,780,000. The number of persons assessable in 1931-32 was somewhere about 2,600, and the number went down in 1933-36 to 2,300 odd.  Has the Minister any observations to make with regard to that matter, whether the shrinkage was due to a reduction in the value of the property these persons held here, in their incomes, or whether there was a removal of such persons with their property?  The point in regard to it is that at the time the change in the rates of surtax was effected, we had many expressions from those benches over there about taxing the rich and about making the rich pay.  If we take the example of what was got out of them, which is the real test, the amount has diminished from £789,000 &mdash;again I speak from recollection&mdash;to a sum of £657,000 in one of the intervening years so that we have lost, so far as revenue from that source is concerned, over £130,000 in the best year the Minister has had.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not the whole of it.  Income from this source has gone steadily down.  I am again speaking from recollection, but I think the particular sum which the Minister shows in his latest Estimate of receipts and expenditure is approximately £500,000.  The increase in the surtax percentage that has been <Col N="1004" /> included in the clause here may possibly increase that sum, but if we compare the £789,000 that was received when the rates were lower, with the £500,000 which would come in this year but for the change that is now being made, we have apparently lost an income of £289,000 on this policy of taxing the rich.  What is more disconcerting than that is that if these figures are to be taken as evidencing the facts of the case, we have lost the spending of £2,250,000.  Persons who are paying surtax are no longer able to do it, and we are getting less from these people than formerly.  Not only that, but we are not partaking of the advantage that would accrue to the country from the spending of £2,250,000 that these people had some four or five years previously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought perhaps that Deputies might wish to carry it a little further.  Deputy Cosgrave was not Minister for Finance in 1931-32.  If he had been such, I do not think he would have laid quite so much stress on the figures for that year as he has done.  If the Deputy will remember the figures for 1929-30, he will recall that receipts from surtax in that year amounted to £549,972 and in 1930-31 to £597,000.  Then there was an abnormal increase of almost £200,000, bringing the figure for 1931-32 to £788,861 or £789,000 as the Deputy has said.  In the following year the figure fell to £650,000 and in the next year to £632,000.  Then it rose to £652,000 and in 1935-36 it was £657,000.  I think if the Deputy had studied the matter seriously he might have asked why it was that in this year, 1931-32, there was a very substantial increase in the yield from surtax.  If he had put a question to me&mdash;he did not mention it in the House before&mdash;or if he had asked me for further information.  I would have told him that in that particular year, 1931-32, there was received one large payment that had been in dispute in respect of tax relating to the years 1926-27 and 1927-28.  That <Col N="1005" /> amounted roughly to £190,000.  It is due to that fact that, in the year 1931-32, the yield from surtax amounted to £788,000.  If it had not been for that unusual and abnormal payment the yield would have been less than £600,000.  As against that, the yield has gone up since.  I am quite prepared to admit that the increase in yield has not been due to an increase in incomes chargeable to surtax. Perhaps it is due to our alteration in the rates.  In that connection the Deputy has to remember that, arising not only out of the change which has taken place in income-tax rates, and in surtax rates since 1931, those who are large income-tax payers, surtax-payers and supertax payers have taken steps, as far as they can, to minimise the effect of those increases on the rates upon their very large incomes.</P>
      <P>It happens that a large part, I should say, of our surtax is paid by that class of persons known as double residents, and they are affected not merely by what we do here but by what is done in Great Britain.  I think that what has been done in Great Britain affects them very much more than anything that we have been compelled to do here.  One has to keep this fact in mind: that if you make your tax exorbitant here as compared with the rates in Great Britain it may tend to drive all those people out of the country and you may very well lose on the transaction.  What is happening is this, that people with very large incomes, in order that they may not have to pay at the upper end of the scale, are distributing their property. They are distributing it among their sons and their daughters&mdash;to members of their own family, because in that way you see they can quite easily, in view of the fact that the scale is a graduated one, reduce the tax payable whilst keeping the total income within the family: that while the family will have the same amount of money to spend, the amount of taxes that can be extracted out of it will be much less. That is the attitude generally adopted and it has had its effect.  Again you have the new shifts and expedients which have been devised for evading liability to tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart altogether from the transfer of <Col N="1006" /> the assets of a number of those families and the formation of private companies to hold them, a large part of their incomes has been invested in gilt-edged investments.  Since 1931-32, the return given by those investments has been decreased substantially.  Naturally that has had its effect upon assessments in respect of unearned income, and also, of course, during some of those years&mdash;the depression years&mdash;we had a fall in British industrial dividends. Naturally that had its reactions here.  What happens when a man dies? During life he may have managed to keep all his property in the one hand and to retain the income from that property for himself, but when about to die he has got to dispose of it.  As a rule he likes to provide for every member of his family according to his views on that matter, and that does have its reactions on the surtax yield.</P>
    <P>One of the things that we have got to bear in mind, and I think Deputy Cosgrave has quite properly drawn public attention to the matter, is this: that if you proceed to make these rates of surtax too steep, particularly at the higher end of the scale, you may defeat your object because the time may come when a man may say to himself: &ldquo;Whether is it better that I should have a nominal income of £20,000 or £25,000 and be taxed accordingly, and at the same time keep my children and provide them with all the amenities that they are accustomed to, and that they would expect to have in a household where such a very large income comes in, or will I relinquish a certain amount of control over it, give it to those children and provide them with the necessary funds which will carry a lower rate of tax?&rdquo;  That fact has got to be kept in mind, and is one of the things that has been operating here to reduce the actual yield which we have got from surtax to less than the proportionate increase which one would expect from the increase in the surtax rates.</P>

      <P>One part of the Minister's explanation seems to dispute another part of it.  In the period 1929-30, the Minister says they were under £600,000.  Despite that fact, there was a gradual rise in that period <Col N="1007" /> until the figure reached practically £600,000.  The Minister has not referred to the drop in the assessable income or to the reduction in the numbers. He will admit that he has learned something in the last seven years.  He no longer rants about taxing the rich.  He finds they can escape him.  He was probably told that at the time, or at least I rather think he was.  But two things have happened.  One is that the numbers have gone down and the second, that income has gone down.  The explanation given by the Minister does not, I think, account for both.  Surely people were as much interested in avoiding all these things in the period 1922 to 1929 as they have been since. While there may have been a fall in dividends during a certain number of years there has been a rise in the last couple of years&mdash;I should say a remarkable rise&mdash;and the Minister has got the advantage of that.  Dividends earned in 1935 and 1936 show a marked improvement on what they were in 1929, 1930 and 1931.  The Minister's explanation does not hold water.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>A rebate at the rate of 5d. a gallon shall be allowed on all hydro-carbon light oil, imported into Éire, on and after the 11th day of May, 1939, on which the said customs duty is charged and which is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners to have been used in the ordinary course of his business by the owner or driver of a street service vehicle which plies for hire from a street stand in the County Borough of Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I just want to say that those engaged in the taxi trade in Dublin have been very greatly burdened by the rather excessive taxation that has been imposed, and the multiplicity of facilities given to various transport combines operating in the City.  If this amendment were accepted by the Minister it would bring them a considerable measure of relief.  I know that, if I refer to some of the other burdens with which they are afflicted, I may not be in order, but I should like to suggest to the Minister that the increased charges for motor requirements, the issuing of unlimited figure plates, and the granting of licences for syndicate proprietors, are having a very serious effect on the whole trade. There is anxiety on the part of those interested in the taxi business in Dublin to bring it into line with that in other great cities, but I fear that, considering the way they are being burdened now with increased regulations and everything else, and by allowing those syndicates to take the trade from them, they are gradually being wiped off the street.  A report issued quite recently shows that something over sixty of them have gone off <Col N="1010" /> in the last twelve months.  When that stage is reached, the usual thing happens&mdash;up go the prices charged by those allowed in to carry on a kind of combine or syndicate.  I think if the Minister could see his way to accept this amendment it would be a step towards giving them some relief.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is designed to save a body of men who, it now appears, are in real danger of extinction.  They are a body of men composed largely of that type of person who wants to earn his own living, who does not want to be a charge on anybody, and is even prepared to work longer hours and under more stringent conditions than the man who has a safe job will accept.  They are largely proprietors of individual taxi-cabs and hackney cars.  As far back as 1924 they were induced to enter into this business inorder to provide taxi facilities in the City of Dublin, and they did. They are all small men in a very modest way of business, and gradually one statute after another passed in this House has added to the burden that they have to bear in carrying on their business.  There is the road tax, the motor driving licence, the hackney figure plate, the hackney driving licence.  They have had to bear the very substantial increases that have been placed upon parts as a result of the tariffs imposed on those parts. Anyone can understand that a hackney vehicle which is continually plying in all weathers does stand more in need of part replacement than the average private vehicle.  Their insurance rates have risen steadily, and of course, the obligation which we placed upon them to carry third-party insurance has been an added expense.  The taxation is high, and the effect of competition during the last ten or 15 years has been substantially to reduce the fares that they used to be in a position to collect. They did at one time I think get 1/- a mile and 6/- an hour for waiting, with double rates after midnight.  They waived the double rate: they consented to certain reductions in the standard charges, and then I think a further regulation was made which reduced still further the charges that they were entitled to collect.  Then we <Col N="1011" /> put a tax on petrol, and now we have substantially increased that tax.  In that situation, those men who stand on the hazards of the city find themselves confronted with new forms of competition, many of which do not have to bear the same burdens, and are in a position to take the cream of the trade, leaving the hackney men with the skimmed milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have got here now&mdash;it is a comparatively recent innovation in this country&mdash;the &ldquo;drive yourself&rdquo; plan, under which you can hire a car for a certain sum per diem, buy your own petrol and so forth, and dispense with the services of a chauffeur.  I believe you can hire a car now for £1 per day. They are not required to pay any of the special hackney charges at all. The person using those cars is in a comparatively advantageous position compared with that in which he would be if he had to avail of hackney cars. I understand that certain persons have assembled fleets of baby Fords which are hired out for specified periods at very reduced rates.  Then, of course, there has been the development of the transfer of buses from their normal traffic routes to special routes for special days, so that on the day on which the hackney man might expect to reap a harvest he finds himself confronted with a stream of Great Northern Railway and Great Southern Railway buses, which take people for 1/- or so over the popular route of the day.  All that they have had to face, but, superimposed upon all that unusual competition, a new factor has appeared in Dublin, and this affects exclusively the Dublin hackney men. Some gentleman or company has established a bureau which you can ring up; you call a car from the street and it takes you to your destination and back at an unprecedentedly low rate.  Well, competition is the life of trade, but, where you have a group of men, who have to furnish a constant service to the public on the hackney hazards of the city, being driven out of business by a person who devises a scheme of transport which secures the cream of the traffic and is in fact not called upon at all to do the less remunerative tasks of passanger <Col N="1012" /> transport, you have a situation closely analogous to that which precipitated the crisis in the railway system of this country.</P>
    <P>We all remember that the railways found themselves required to carry all the unremunerative traffic, while the private haulier took all the remunerative traffic.  The end of that was that the railways went burst.  Now the railways were a very much more prosperous and solvent institution than the unfortunate taxi-drivers of this city and all that this amendment proposes is that these men should be put in a position in which they can compete with those who have managed to divide the business up into cream and skimmed milk with the object of taking the cream themselves and leaving the hackney drivers with nothing but the skimmed milk.  We propose, if no other system of regulation is available, to restore some of the cream to the skimmed milk they are at present being left with by relieving the taximan who stands on the hazard of a part at least of the tax levied on petrol so that his competitive power will be somewhat restored.  It is going to be a trivial thing from the point of view of the Exchequer, but it is going to be a very substantial concession to each individual taxi-driver in the City of Dublin, and indeed elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister that it is a concession that might very properly be made, especially in view of the fact that unless it is made all these men, who are the best type of citizen, the fellow who is earning his own living and does not want a dole or a subsidy from anyone, and who is prepared to work hard in order to get himself and his family on in the world, will be driven out of business and put on the dole.  God knows we have sufficient on the dole in this country as it is&mdash; people denied the opportunity of earning a living.  These people have carved out jobs for themselves by their own enterprise and managed to make ends meet, and it is no easy task, for many of them have to buy their cars on the instalment plan and keep their families while paying the instalments on the taxis.  They have done it, and it reflects great credit on them that they have done it, and now they are in grave <Col N="1013" /> danger of being wiped out.  There is no use bemoaning the fact that they are wiped out after the wiping out has been done.  Lip sympathy is very cheap and it helps nobody.  If we are going to do anything, let us do something now and save them from being wiped out.  I do not think we have much time.  I think that 12 months from now most of them will be gone and they will be gone because they are burst.  Let us not stand idly by and see them wiped out.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied, and I think they are satisfied, that if this concession is made it will do something to help them, pending a general review of the situation and an examination as to whether the hackney driver should not either be given a larger fare, if the larger fare can be got, or else that a general review of his overhead charges should be undertaken by the Government with a view to making it possible for him to reduce his operating expenses and so secure some margin of profit on the operation of his enterprise. I think certainly that the Government will have to review the position generally sooner or later, and one of the principal objects of this amendment is to keep these men in business pending the completion of that review and the establishment of some permanent basis upon which these men can reasonably look forward to operating and making a fair livelihood.  They are not asking for riches or that they should be allowed to make excess profits or anything of that kind.  All they expect and desire to get out of the business is a modest livelihood, and we ought not to stand idly by while that opportunity is taken from them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. A. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support the amendment asking for this small concession for the taxi drivers of the City of Dublin.  I think it is almost too late to give them this little help and that the time has arrived for a complete reorganisation of the taxi system in Dublin City.  I think the Government, or whoever is responsible, should cease to issue any further licences either to drive or put cars on the road for hire.  The business is <Col N="1014" /> already overdone and there is keen competition for the little business that there is to be done.  The Dublin taximan is working well over 100 hours per week in order to try to get a meagre kind of living.  The taxi-men are overtaxed. Everything that is done by this House in the way of introducing new regulations in connection with the taxi business makes it still more difficult for them to earn a living.  Deputy Dillon has referred to the fact that they are a splendid type of men.  Most of them have either borrowed or raised the money through their friends to purchase their own taxis with a desire to earn their living.  Deputy Dillon referred to the fact that the cost of spare parts has increased.  If there is the slightest change in the regulations their meters are taken off for alteration and the slightest alteration to them cannot be done for less than two guineas, which in most cases means a week's earnings to them. There are too many of them on the road at the moment and it appears to be very easy for new men and new companies with outside capital to come along with further taxis in the city.</P>
      <P>I have seen as many as 100 taxi-cabs in O'Connell Street at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning during the season all waiting to pick up an odd half-crown or an odd 5/-, and the men go home at 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning, their total earnings for the night not being more than 7/6.  I have been out pretty often at these hours in the morning and I have had conversations with taxi-men and they tell me that they are lucky if they bring home 7/6 after being out from 6 o'clock in the evening until perhaps 5 o'clock the next morning.  I think that any concession that could be given could not be given to more hardworking men than the Dublin taxi-drivers. The appeal made to the Minister, if granted, should not end here, but he ought to consider other concessions regarding the limitation of licences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I ought to remind the House that this duty on petrol was first imposed in the year 1931.  In the Budget of that year four pence a gallon was put on petrol, to give it its popular name, and later in the year an additional four pence was put on.  The position remained static at eight pence a gallon until this year's Budget, when we had to increase it by two pence.  The amendment wants us not merely to relieve the taxi-drivers of the increase which was put on in this year's Budget, but to go back and reduce the tax which was put on in 1931.  I should have thought that that position would be supported by very strong arguments, and particularly that the insuperable objection to accepting the amendment would at least be dealt with and overcome. That objection is this, that however much you may want to help the taxi-drivers, this is not the way to do it, unless you want to open the door to wholesale evasion.  There has been a great deal of experience of what could be done, once you propose, in regard to a particular tax on a commodity, to make a special concession to any one section of the community.  The <Col N="1016" /> British, when they had to impose the tax, at an early stage had a number of concessions of the kind that this amendment asks us to grant, but their experience with them was such that when they came to propose the duty a second time they wiped out every exemption because of wholesale evasion of the tax.  That is precisely what would happen here.</P>
      <P>We could no more restrict the consumption of petrol at the reduced rate to taxi-drivers than we could compel them to use it in a car of a particular colour or class.  Everybody would have a friend and everybody would get a few odd gallons here and there. Perhaps I ought not to qualify that by saying a few gallons, but rather that everybody would get as many gallons of petrol, taxed at half the rate, as they could persuade their friends to give them.  There is no way of checking that sort of evasion.  So far as the Revenue Commissioners are concerned, and upon their advice in matters of this sort I am guided, they tell me that it would be impossible to administer a concession of this sort with any sort of equity to the general body of citizens. After all taxi-drivers are not the only users of petrol.  You have the business houses, buses, and the other hire services of which we have heard.  Every one of these people have to pay the tax at the same rate.  I do not know whether Deputy Byrne was agitating that we should relax certain regulations that were introduced as a result of legislation passed in this House in order to safeguard the lives and limbs not merely of passengers but of pedestrians in the City of Dublin.  I am not aware that Deputy Byrne at that time got up and made the same sort of speech that he made now.</P>

I think I have gone outside the strict limits of order in touching on that aspect.  I could not accept the amendment because I think it is open to evasion.  That applies also to amendment No. 3 and consequentially to amendment No. 5. If the matter is to be dealt with at all it could only be dealt with by some sort of special consideration in regard to motor vehicles.  I am not promising that, as I am not the Minister primarily responsible, but that is one way in which something might be done. Certainly, this is not the way.</P>

When a tourist goes there he gets a limited <Col N="1018" /> number of vouchers which are subsequently redeemed by the Government at the full rate.  In fact what is happening is that the Government in the case of tourists pays the full price for the petrol.</P>

First of all they want us to construct this sort of circumlocutory machinery, and then they will tell us afterwards how the cost of the Civil Service has gone up and how the cost of administration has gone up.  There is one way, perhaps, in which this can be done, in my judgment.  That is a way which will not involve all this trouble with coupons and checks and counter checks and the difficulties and temptations to evasion of the present method.  It is a matter for those who feel that something should be done to help the taxi-drivers to come and make a case upon a sound basis, not to put up an amendment which, I am afraid, <Col N="1019" /> they know from experience could not be accepted.  Any person who remembers the debate which took place on petrol duties in 1931 will know that it was quite impossible for any Minister for Finance to accept the proposal now proposed.  I am fortified in my attitude by the attitude of my very able predecessor.</P>

      <P>I am sorry the Minister cannot see his way to give more favourable consideration to this amendment, particularly having regard to the extra burdens placed on those unfortunate people.  Deputy Dillon and other speakers have referred to the difficult conditions which exist for this branch of our workers.  The Minister says it will open the door to many other people, business people and others, and that they would get in on it.  He suggests that there is some other way of approaching the matter than by bringing it up in the House in this fashion. The Minister refers to opening the door, but the information I have is that all doors in the Department for the redress of a grievance of this type have been closed.  Within the last couple of weeks we approached the Minister for Local Government on matters affecting this grievance, and we were turned down.  We were told no useful purpose could be served by receiving a deputation.  The Minister for Justice has given the matter at least some consideration.  Will the Minister for Finance undertake, if he cannot meet this amendment, that other burdens placed upon these workers will be redressed&mdash;that they will get some redress?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We thought that by putting down this amendment the least the Minister could do would be to enable the taxi-drivers to carry on their business.  If these people are to be driven out at the rate at which they are going, you will soon have considerably more unemployed, and that is not going to be of any advantage to the citizens.  The citizens are anxious to get any transport service they can get at the cheapest rate.  I do not think the Minister or the Government should be responsible for driving these people out <Col N="1020" /> and letting other people crawl in to take advantage of what the taxi-drivers have worked hard to achieve.  I do not believe that the citizens will get the advantage that would be expected from such a procedure.  Eventually, when this group of traders cease to exist, the other people will raise their prices, and John Citizen will be paying all the time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it is true.  There is one company in operation and there is another company in process of formation. I understand the second company is a British company.  The first company arrived I know not whence, and they are setting the pace and now they are being joined by a company from Great Britain.  If the two of these companies function over 12 months, they will wipe every independent taxi-driver off the streets of Dublin.  Do we want to wipe the taxi-drivers off the streets of Dublin?  Is it just to do so?  If it is, then the sooner they are wiped off, the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is perfectly right in saying that this is a painful operation and it is one of the tributes to progress that must be made and the sooner they are smashed, the better. That is a reasonable point of view, but that is not our point of view.  We take the view that they ought not to be smashed and that it is a proper thing for the Legislature to intervene at this stage and say: &ldquo;Believing, as we do, in the distribution of industry, in the promotion of the small unit, and in the promotion of individual ownership, we do not want these men replaced by large combines on the American lines, like the Yellow Cab Company and the Checker Cab Company and so forth, with which we are familiar in American cities.  We do not want them so replaced.&rdquo; I have seen that system in America giving rise to great abuses.  I <Col N="1021" /> saw price wars involving civil commotion frequently in big American cities between rival taxi corporations, and the moment the price wars were stopped, I saw the individual citizen exploited by these taxi-cab companies, who proceeded to charge the utmost tariff the traffic would bear.</P>
    <P>We ought to choose as between those two things now.  It is perfectly relevant. Unless you give these men relief now, they are going to go off the streets of Dublin before the Legislature can come to their assistance with remedial legislation which will protect them against the corporations.  Does the Minister believe that these men ought to be swept off the streets of Dublin?  If he does, then we understand his position.  Suppose he does not say that, and suppose he says: &ldquo;I agree with you that the individual taxi-driver should be preserved,&rdquo; then he ought to tell us.  If he does not do what we say is necessary, what is he going to do?</P>

They are not going to be abandoned.  We are going to take effective measures to protect their legitimate interests.&rdquo;  If he says that, I will advise my colleague to drop the amendment.  If he says:  &ldquo;Although we cannot do it this way, we are going at once to give effective protection and they need not be uneasy that we will allow them to be wiped out,&rdquo; all will be well, but if he does not say that, then I think we shall have to fight every inch of the way.</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows the position as well as I do.  He has been as long in the House as I have <Col N="1023" /> been.  He knows that if the Opposition wish to raise this matter seriously, there is a way of doing it.  It could have been raised on the Vote for the Minister for Local Government.  This thing has not arisen over night.  If the state of affairs which Deputy Dillon has depicted to us in such moving terms has arisen, it has not arisen over night.  These competitive services have not been placed upon the streets of Dublin within the last fortnight or three weeks; they must have been there for some time, and there was an excellent opportunity to raise the whole matter, or at least one aspect of it, when the Vote for the Department of Local Government and Public Health was before the House.  Another aspect of the matter might have been raised when the Vote for the Department of Justice was before the House.  If these things failed, and if the matter was one of such urgency, Deputies always had the opportunity of putting down a motion and having the whole matter discussed in its proper setting, instead of trying to labour this particular aspect of the matter and getting an innocent Minister to commit himself in the way in which Deputy Dillon asks me to commit myself now. Of course, it looks so nice to be able to get me up in order to try to get me to say such and such a thing.  I am only here, however, to say that, in my view, a concession of the sort now asked for ought not to be granted, because it would be difficult to administer and would open the way to evasion.  Notwithstanding what the Deputy has said, I am not satisfied that that concession would be justified. I have no knowledge of what is the state of affairs which Deputy Dillon has put before the House.  I know that the Deputy is talking as an advocate and not as an investigator.  I do not believe for a moment that he went around and saw all the taxi-people, saw all their accounts, examined the accounts of their competitors, or that he did any of the things that it would be necessary for a responsible Minister to do in order to satisfy himself that the condition of affairs, which Deputy Dillon has described here in the House, really existed.  We have only got an <Col N="1024" /><i>ex parte</i> statement made by Deputies Peadar Doyle and Dillon.</P>

      <P>We all know that Deputy, the Lord Mayor, has a big heart and that he seems to believe everything that he is told, particularly if what he is told happens to afford him an opportunity of getting a swipe at the Government.  Nobody has more sympathy for any particular cause that may be put before him, if it gives him an opportunity to attack the Government. Now, I do not say&mdash;I am not going to say, that there may not be something in this case that has been put forward.  I do not know.  I do not know whether or not the case the Deputy has made is well founded.  It is a matter for serious investigation.  I understand, from Deputy Peadar Doyle, that he himself, in fact, has gone to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in connection with this matter and that that Minister has indicated that, in his view, the case for the concession does not exist. Now, if the Deputy approached the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, I suppose he approached him on behalf of this association, and I presume that he submitted a memorandum of the case which this association wanted to have made.  I am perfectly certain that, if he did submit such memorandum, it was seriously considered and that the Minister for Local Government and Public Health who, perhaps, is the Minister in a position to do something in this matter, considered it carefully and, having considered it and investigated the whole position, and being familar with the facts, found that the real state of affairs did not justify him in making any concession.  Now, it is on that that I am going to stand.  I am going to stand on the fact that the Minister responsible, having examined <Col N="1025" /> the case that was put before him, decided that no case for a concession existed.  Having regard to that, I, at any rate, in the light of those circumstances, would not feel entitled to give the sort of undertaking that Deputy Dillon has asked for.  Deputy Dillon and those who feel as he does, of course, can go again to the Minister, as one with first-hand knowledge of this matter.  But in my view the particular concession now proposed is not a thing that ought to be granted because it is not one that could be properly administered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to what I have said and suggested that some of my statements were actuated by a desire to have a swipe at the Government.  Regardless, however, of any alleged desire to take a swipe at the Government, I should like to say that the statement to which I referred was made by a deputation of taxi-owners, in a room here in the House, to the Dublin Deputies within the past week.  They stated their grievances and every member was invited to meet the taxi-owners.  I have only stated the views put forward by these people to the Dublin representatives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is quite clear, from the statement the Minister has now made, not only what his attitude is, but what the attitude of the Government as a whole is, not merely to this concession but to any concession.  He first sheltered himself behind the plea that it was not his business, as Minister for Finance, to give way to any concession; but in the speech to which we have just listened he has changed the foot on which he is determined to stand, and because the Minister responsible has turned down the idea for any concession, and because the Minister responsible has taken up the line that there is no case for any concession, the Minister for Finance now says that it is on that foot he chooses to stand.  Now, Sir, when an amendment of this kind is put down to a Finance Bill, I should like to protest against the idea that the Ministers concerned should never consult each other.  This amendment has been put down.  It is possible for <Col N="1026" /> other Ministers to come in and indicate, as a reason for rejecting this particular proposal, that they are prepared to give relief in other ways.  I suggest, Sir, that there is nothing disorderly in a proceeding of that kind being taken, and I certainly think that it would have been the duty of the Minister, once this amendment was put down, to make himself acquainted with any representations that had been made to other Ministers by an association, and to make himself acquainted with the attitude of the other Ministers on this particular matter.  From the first speech of the Minister, I gathered that he had not done anything of the kind, but from what we have just listened to I gather that he has, and that, apparently, he knows what was the decision of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, and that was to reject the concession; and the conclusion he comes to, as Minister for Finance, is that he rejects it and that the Government, speaking through the responsible Minister, the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, says that there is no case for the concession.</P>
      <P>I suggest, Sir, that there is a complete change, and that it has not met the arguments put forward by Deputies Dillon and Doyle.  The Minister has suggested that if what has been put forward by the two Deputies who have spoken on this side, and by Deputy the Lord Mayor, is a matter of urgency, it can be dealt with by a motion put down on the Order Paper.  Just imagine a matter of urgency being dealt with in that way!  Anybody who is acquainted with the procedure of this House knows that a motion may be on the Order Paper for 18 months, but meanwhile these unfortunate people have to suffer from the particular grievances about which they complain.</P>

      <P>In his remarks, the Minister said that there was one aspect of this matter that could have been dealt with on the debate for the Estimate for Local Government and Public Health.  Would I be in order, Sir, in asking what aspect of it could have been dealt with on that Estimate?  My <Col N="1027" /> reason for asking that is that I have made representations to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, and I know that representations have been made to other Departments, but our chief concern now is that the door seems to be closed everywhere, and these matters do not seem to come under any of the respective Departments.  That is what seems to me to be wrong.  These matters do not seem to come within the administration of any of the respective Departments, and I would like to know if the Minister could help us in this direction <Col N="1028" /> by indicating what is the aspect of the matter which he refers to that could be dealt with by the Department of Local Government.  It is not in keeping with the reply we got from that Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before sub-section (2) to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>A rebate at the rate of five pence a gallon shall be allowed on all hydro-carbon light oil, imported into Eire, on and after the 11th day of May, 1939, on which the said customs duty is charged and which is shown to the satisfaction of the Revenue Commissioners to have been used by a clergyman or a medical practitioner in the ordinary course of his duties.</P>
      <P>This particular amendment might have been associated with the last amendment but they were separated after full consideration on account of the very peculiar position in which the Dublin taxi-men found themselves, owing to the big combines coming in to swallow up their business.  This amendment, relating, as it does, to clergymen and doctors&mdash;in other words, to people whose means of livelihood is gained by looking after either the bodily or spiritual welfare of the people&mdash;was placed separately.</P>
      <P>In this country, people have grown accustomed to paying a tax on their income and they are rapidly or gradually getting accustomed&mdash;whether they are reconciled or not is another matter &mdash;to paying a tax on every commodity they buy out of that income.  A tax of this kind, in addition, places a tax on the source of the income.  The particular classes referred to in this amendment earn their livelihood through the medium of the motor car, roughly in proportion to the miles they cover; and I doubt if anybody ever pauses to think of the amount of State taxation imposed on a person who makes his livelihood sitting in a motor car.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If you take the mileage covered by any busy clergyman or medical practitioner, it is giving a fairly long life to a car to say that its life is three years&mdash;three efficient, working years. The cost of every new car purchased in this country priced in or about £260 or £300, is approximately £75 to £100 more than the purchaser in Newry or Belfast would pay for his car.  Assuming <Col N="1030" /> that the working life of the car in its first ownership is three years, that is equivalent to an annual tax of £25 to £30.  There is then the tax on the car&mdash;its road tax&mdash;dependent on the horse-power; but it could be taken at the average figure of about £15 a year.  There is then a compulsory insurance of £15, £16 or £17 a year.  With a petrol tax at the rate of 10d. per gallon, assuming that the average man covers thirty miles a day &mdash; that is a tax of ½d. a mile covered &mdash; you have another tax of about 10/- a week or £25 a year.  In all, in respect of that car the worker pays £80 a year on, as it were, the raw materials of his industry.  If he is doing well at his business, income-tax&mdash; which has a habit of increasing&mdash;comes down on top of him as well.  I think the whole idea is wrong.</P>
    <P>It is popular in this country to regard the British Government in the Ireland of the past as a Government that had nothing in common with the people and that had no sympathy with the people, and yet, at the height of a world war, when the British Government found it necessary to impose a tax on petrol, it is within the recollection of anyone who was in practice at that time that that petrol tax in its application to priests and doctors only applied to a fifty per cent. degree. Priests and doctors were exempted from half the petrol tax.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated here to-day that one reason why an abatement in this tax could not be made in respect of taxi-drivers was owing to the difficulty, or the impossibility, of administering it.  I suppose there are 20 agents or officers or civil servants of one kind or another at the present time in this country to every one the British Government had here when they were administering that rebate.  That may be an exaggeration: I have not the figures available; but I do not think it is a very big exaggeration.  We are only administering three-quarters of the country, yet with a very considerable less number of agents and officers of one kind or another the British Government were able to carry out that remission which the Irish Government it appears pretends is impossible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1031" /> It was done in a very, very simple way, it was done in a harmonious way, and it was done out of a spirit of consideration, in order to mete out justice to the people engaged in humanitarian work.  We have a Government now in this country more ruthless in its outlook and showing very much less consideration than the British Government which it is popular to denounce.  The machinery of administration was that the particular person kept the receipts and the local excise officer remitted half the tax.  It was done either daily or weekly or quarterly, or at whatever time one went all the local excise officer.  We were all alive at that time and I do not think any of us ever heard any suggestion of abuse, or ever had any practical experience of abuse, by the individual buying the petrol getting a remission of half the tax, and passing the petrol on to a neighbour.  The Minister seems to have a very low opinion of the taxi-drivers, at all events.  He seems to think that they have no trade <i>esprit de corps</i>, and no sense of either honour or honesty.  I do not know where he gained that particular insight into the character of the taximen, but, certainly, when certain trades and professions were exempted in the past by the British Government in this country, there was never any suggestion of abuse, or any suggestion of dishonesty, and I never heard that it was anybody's experience that there was that type of dishonesty which the Minister seems to fear.</P>
    <P>The Minister may argue that the people I refer to, namely, priests and doctors, get their working expenses allowed when their income-tax is being reckoned.  Let us take one class by itself.  Take clergymen first.  A very small percentage of clergymen have an income sufficiently high to pay income-tax at all.  Much the same applies to doctors.  Perhaps a higher percentage of doctors pay income-tax, but surely the percentage that do pay income-tax are hit heavily enough if they have to pay £80 a year tax of one kind or another on their cars, a quarter of their income by way of income-tax and a further taxation on practically every article they buy, without having to pay an extra ½d. or ¾d. on every mile <Col N="1032" /> they travel to visit a sick person.  There are ways, and obvious ways, in which an imposition of this kind can be met. Remember that, talking particularly of rural Ireland, threequarters of the mileage covered by any general practitioner is covered without a fee at the end of it.  It is not the type of case he is compelled to visit by virtue of the fact that there exists a red ticket and he is a dispensary doctor, but at least threequarters of the work done by any general practitioner, and by most of the specialists in this country is work, at the end of which there is no fee.</P>
    <P>It would be well for everybody to appreciate that fact, because there are enough people anxious to kick the medical profession, and if there was a general understanding of the profession and the work of the profession, they would have more defenders than they have at the moment. The big bulk of the doctor's practice is the type of case who is neither a paying patient, nor a dispensary patient, but he has to pay a new tax or an increased tax now on that kind of charitable work, and the fact that so much of it is charitable work is to get no consideration from an Irish Government where it got it from the British Government.  Are we proud of that, or is the State so &ldquo;hipped&rdquo; and up against it that it cannot do without that extra little bit of revenue?</P>
    <P>To get back to the doctors who pay income-tax, it may be argued by the Minister that allowance is made for all these kinds of things in working out income-tax.  In theory, that may be so, but, in practice, the Minister knows that it is not so.  A reasonable allowance is made for the use of a car, but that allowance does not go up or down with fluctuations in petrol or oil prices, and does not every extra 1d. or 2d. put on the gallon of petrol lower the amount which the doctor paying income-tax, or any other person paying income-tax, is allowed towards a reduction in his income for income-tax purposes?  I urge the Minister to consider this amendment in the light of the existence of the precedent established by an alien Government in this country, experience of which at that time shows that its working was easy <Col N="1033" /> and simple, and that there was no dishonesty associated with it through those years.  Surely an Irish Deputy in an Irish Parliament is not asking for anything exceptional, or anything unreasonable, when he asks that the same consideration be shown towards facilitating those who are working amongst, and on behalf of, the poor in this country as was shown by the British administration in this country.</P>

      <P>It was quite true that, from the year 1910 to 1920, when the original petrol duties were enforced, there were various reliefs and rebates at one rate or another in regard to this tax, but when the British reintroduced the duty on petrol, they granted no rebate or exemption whatsoever, but imposed it on everybody at a flat rate.</P>

      <P>After all, we have put only 2d. a gallon on petrol, and I think it enough.  When I say &ldquo;only,&rdquo; I am speaking relatively.  It may be a heavy enough imposition and I am certain that people who have to bear it regard it as a heavy imposition; but, in 1931, there was a tax of 8d. put on petrol, and my predecessor flatly refused to consider any question of a rebate.  There was, in fact, a motion moved that where petrol was being used entirely for agricultural purposes, a rebate of 4d. per gallon should be allowed, and the then Minister for Finance said it would not be possible to accept the motion as it would be impracticable to administer it effectively. <Col N="1034" /> Doctors and clergymen are not the only people who use motor cars professionally, or in the course of their ordinary avocations.  There are commercial travellers, veterinary surgeons, vocational teachers, national teachers, secondary teachers, and a host of officials of one sort and another.  As well as that, you have this fact, that, whereas doctors and professional men generally may use petrol in a car which they are fortunate enough to own, there is the whole mass of the wage-earners of the country who have to use petrol in cars which they do not own, when they travel in buses or other public conveyances, and they have to pay this duty on the petrol.</P>
      <P>I could not possibly see how it would be possible to defend this tax as a whole if we once made a concession in regard to any particular class in the community, whether taxi-driver, medical man or clergyman.  The use of petrol is now so common and comes into so many of our activities&mdash;not merely pleasurable activities, but necessary occupations&mdash;that if this tax is justifiable at all and if it is to be accepted at all, everybody will have to bear his share of it, according to the use he makes of petrol.  There is no other way in which that tax could be equitably and justly administered.  We heard a great deal about what doctors do and what they do not do.  But there is one thing which emerges and that is that to the extent that they can satisfy the inspector of taxes that they use their car for the purpose of practising their profession and that such use constitutes a necessary expense in earning their income, that fact is taken into consideration when they are assessed for income-tax. That applies to other users of petrol in the same way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see why one could possibly base a case for making a special concession in regard to professional men on the ground that they have to pay income-tax.  The bulk of men, whether they use their car for pleasure or business, also pay income-tax.  Men use their cars in their own business.  We could not possibly justify a concession of this sort to one section of the community <Col N="1035" /> on the ground that that particular section of the community is already assessed for income-tax.  As I said in the beginning, petrol is now so widely used, either directly by the person who is fortunate enough to own a motor car or by the person who may have to use a lorry for the purpose of earning his livelihood or by a person who has to travel in a public conveyance, that we could not grant a concession with regard to this tax to one particular section of the community and retain the impost on another.</P>
    <P>The same case could be made, and, indeed, a stronger case could be made, on the same principle for allowing those others to go tax free.  One could extend that and say that surely the man who is using petrol in a lorry as part of his business should have his petrol free of tax.  One could extend other arguments that Deputy O'Higgins is using here to cover the whole range of petrol users.  In the end, what is one up against?  We will have to choose between putting a tax on petrol or on sugar or some other commodity which may be regarded by some people as being more essential to life than petrol is.  The position is that you may have to distribute your taxation over a range of articles, when it may be found that it was better for us to increase petrol duties to the extent we have increased them rather than put additional imposts upon sugar or other articles.  Having come to that decision, I cannot accept anything which would exempt any particular section of the community from the incidence of this particular tax.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister's case is rather an unworthy one, and rather unfair to himself, because we know from experience that he is quite capable of making a good case for or against anything any time he puts his mind to it.  He is able to make that good case for or against any particular thing without deliberately misconstruing or distorting the application made. I made a special case for priests and doctors, first on the ground that so much of their work was done for nothing. <Col N="1036" /> Imagine the idea of trying to make a parallel between them and a bus company!  If the Minister knows of any transport people who carry passengers for nothing, this amendment would not have been put down for the doctors, because then they would travel over that particular system.  Alternately, if the doctor knows of commercial houses who are sending their lorries around plying for nothing; he would find something that is rather unique in the history of this country.</P>
      <P>The point I want particularly to put to the Minister is this&mdash;I do not think it is an assertion that would be disputed that the average doctor, whether operating in the city or country, does anything from 50 per cent. to 60 per cent. or 70 per cent. of his work gratuitously.  It is purely work done in the spirit of charity, out of kindness of heart.  For the balance of the work many of the doctors are well paid, but at least three-fourths of their work is work for nothing.  It is work purely within the spirit of the doctor's profession in the effort to help somebody who is afflicted.  That work can be done in a very generous way or in a very limited way, but if tax upon tax is piled upon the doctor and his work is made more expensive on him, then the Government is naturally making it more difficult for him and he will have to restrict the amount of work he is to do gratuitously.  This tax is forcing him to do less gratuitous work so as to enable him to provide for his family. There is at least this much&mdash;there is a case for the people mentioned in this amendment, distinct and different from the other case instanced by the Minister. It is because of that that these particular classes were named in this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case made by the Minister was not an answer to the application made. I am quite aware of the fact that in a minute or two, just after I sit down, the bells will ring and this amendment will be defeated.  We knew that before we put down the amendment.  We know it always before we put down a motion or amendment or make any request or application.  We are quite aware of the fact that it is idle to ask for any concession, no matter how strong the case <Col N="1037" /> for the concession is.  So far as the Minister made any particular defence of the principle in this case, it was a defence of injustice against a small class because the injustice was common to greater numbers.  That is a very poor defence.  It is probably true.  I take the Minister's word for <Col N="1038" /> it.  But is there any crime in asking for the exclusion of a small class from injustice, particularly if the small class we ask to be excluded are a small class that have a particularly strong case?</P>

      <P>The House has just got information in the course of the Minister's statement&mdash;they got it earlier in the Budget&mdash;about this section, and about the intention of the Minister to take steps to deal with forestalling.  If this particular clause is going to be worked it will apparently cost some money.  The House has got <Col N="1044" /> no information regarding the amount of forestalling that went on, and whether there was a great loss of money, and so on.  Neither did it get any information regarding what the cost of this new proposal is to be.  On a former occasion attention was directed to the very large increase in the Estimate for the Office of the Revenue Commissioners and their staff.  Apparently, under this there will be a further addition to staff.  If this section is to be in operation during a full year, but used only for a month or two prior to the introduction of the Budget, it is possible that the administration of it will cost more than any saving that may be effected.  No case whatever was made by the Minister for this clause, and I think the House is entitled to hear some reasons for its insertion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of cost, I am advised that the cost of administering this Bill will be infinitesimal: that it will be part of the ordinary routine work of the Revenue Commissioners' staff, and, in fact, has been in regard to any commodity which already bore tax.  With regard to the need for this, it has been manifested in the case of every Budget where it has been found necessary to alter the rate of customs or excise duties on any commodity.  It has led to this position, that unless the commodity already bore a tax we could not prevent undue clearances from bond.  It has encouraged people to withdraw certain commodities from bond far in excess of what would be their normal requirements.  When, as on a number of occasions, we have had to impose duties we had to adopt the cumbersome method of imposing an excise duty on stocks already drawn from bond as well as a customs duty, and I do not think that either from the point of view of the Commissioners or the point of view of the owners of dutiable commodities&mdash;those who would be the vendors of them&mdash;that has been a convenient practice.  It is certainly difficult to administer.  In relation to stocks of tea and sugar, we have had to have an exemption limit within which stocks would not be liable to excise duty That fact in <Col N="1045" /> itself has occasioned a great deal, I think, of controversy and ill-feeling and, in some cases hardship, because we have had the case of the honest trader perhaps with a stock of £50 or £100 over that which we fixed and he had to pay, while another man was cute enough to make large withdrawals from bond and distribute them over a number of his customers and friends in advance.</P>
      <P>Since we have now to face the fact that perhaps over a number of years there may be changes in the rates of various commodities of one sort or another, I have come to the conclusion that it would be much better to discourage the sort of speculation which takes place every year when it looks as if the coming Budget is going to be an unfavourable one, and that it is better for us to try and regulate during a reasonable period the rate of withdrawals from bond.  We do not want to inconvenience anybody.  I am perfectly certain that the Revenue Commissioners will administer this with the greatest possible discretion and make every allowance for the legitimate requirements of traders.  I think it is much better that we should be able to regulate withdrawals from bond and thus avoid the necessity for imposing excise duties as we have had to do on whole stocks: of trying to mitigate, for the person who honestly held stocks, the provisions which we have had to impose in some cases in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have to be very general in saying how we would propose to administer this particular provision because I have not in mind any particular commodity to be taxed, nor do I know the particular circumstances which may exist that would make it necessary to impose a tax, but I can say for a certainty that the Revenue Commissioners will administer this with every discretion and with every allowance from the taxpayer's point of view.  I, myself, personally hope that when we have increased the rate of duty on any commodity that we shall be able to content ourselves with a customs duty rather than have a customs and an excise duty and all the rather cumbersome machinery which, as I have said, we have had to utilise <Col N="1046" /> to mitigate the effect of impositions in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>I understand that, so far as importers are concerned, they are not averse from a provision of this sort.  They feel that it will convenience them and make it easier for them.  Whenever we do increase the rate of duty on a particular commodity difficulties arise naturally between the retailer and the wholesaler and between the manufacturer and the wholesaler.  This, we think, may help to even matters out and make the whole course smoother for everybody. I should say in relation to certain commodities that undoubtedly there seemed to be last year&mdash;it is difficult to talk on this matter without appearing to condemn one particular section of the community rather than another&mdash;a general feeling, which was rather tentatively borne out, that there were excessive withdrawals from bond of one commodity or another before the introduction of the Budget.  I do not want to stress that very far, but the mere fact that it has been possible on occasions to anticipate budgetary changes in this way makes it desirable that we should devise, if we can, machinery which will prevent that anticipation, and it is really on these grounds, rather than upon actual happenings in the past that this proposal is put before the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us see what this is going to do.  How the Government ever allowed themselves to be dragged into this beats me. This is the most glorious scheme for transferring the Revenue from the Exchequer into the hands of the bonded warehousemen.  I shall certainly go into the wholesale tea trade in Dublin if this is passed, because there will be a fortune to be made in it.  I am a tea importer&mdash;as a matter of fact I am not, but I am putting the case&mdash;and normally I go to Mincing Lane and buy tea there to be consigned to me in Dublin.  I either leave it in the bonded warehouse or I take it into my free warehouse for distribution amongst my customers.  As I buy largely in Mincing Lane, I send all my travellers out and keep them out pushing tea as hard as they can so that it will keep turning over rapidly <Col N="1047" /> in my hands.  Suppose I find the market on Mincing Lane is coming forward unsuitably for me, I draw off the market, and I call in my travellers, because I have not got the kind of stuff I want to sell.  Now, you pass this section, and on 1st January the Minister makes an Order restricting my extractions of tea from bond.  I call the boys in, and I say:&mdash;&ldquo;There is 4d. going on tea, boys.  We will stop selling.  I am going to draw tea on the basis of my sales during the past nine months, when I was pushing tea as hard as I could, and I am going to transfer it out of the bonded warehouse to my free warehouse.  You boys can all slack off, and on 1st May, after the Budget, we will take the road, and we will have three months' accumulation of tea on our hands at 4d. a lb. cheaper than any other man in Dublin&rdquo;.  If we have not&mdash;suppose our competitors have something to say to it&mdash;at least we will collect 2d. of the extra 4d. that the Minister puts on. What importer would not welcome that scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy tell me how he is going to collect the 2d?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Because tea must, if he waits long enough, go up 4d. if it is a direct imposition on tea.  I admit that the average retail customer buying a ½lb. of tea can barely see 4d. in the lb. on tea, but the big fellow who is buying tea continuously will see 4d. in the lb. on tea or 2d. in the lb. on tea when buying it by the chest from travellers' samples.  The tea importer has landed the tea in Dublin which he intends to sell at 1/6 a lb. to the large retailers down the country.  The Minister puts 4d. a lb. on it.  The tea wholesaler may not be able to get the full 1/10, but at least he will be able to say to the tea retailer to whom he is selling the tea: &ldquo;If you had to buy that tea with the duty on it, it would be worth 1/10; I will give it to you at 1/8,&rdquo; and he will rake in a golden harvest.  What is to stop him? Remember, there is no trade at present being so excessively done as the tea trade, and there is no trade in the world in which you can call your <Col N="1048" /> traveller off so easily, because if a tea merchant in rural Ireland, or indeed anywhere, is habitually dealing with a certain group of tea firms, he is not deterred by the failure of their traveller to call; he will send for samples.  I will take darn good care, if I do not want him to buy my samples at a given time, that I will place a figure on them which will put them out of competition. If I know they are going to be worth 4d. more by holding them for a couple of months, I will take darn good care that the price I put upon them now will induce my customer to deal with somebody else in the interval that elapses between the Minister's Order and the imposition of the duty.  Who would not be a tea importer on those terms?  It is &ldquo;jam.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Of course, that is the very kind of dilemma into which the Ministerial mind falls.  They retire to Raglan Road and get as completely out of touch with the country as the man in the moon.  Some fellows cannot stop selling tea.  The small retailers down the country.  The big chaps have not.  It is the big men &mdash;largely London men&mdash;who can control their sales whatever way they like because they are selling tea all over the world, but there will always be enough little fellows in Dublin who will have to keep selling in order to keep the wolf from the door.  They are legion.</P>

      <P>I do not expect the Minister to understand.  He never does understand until he burns his fingers.  I remember a time when he said he would fix this business in a moment; that the antediluvian people <Col N="1050" /> who went before him did not understand how to levy duty on stocks of tea.  He proceeded to levy duty on stocks of tea, but he is still looking for the stocks of tea.  He got about half-dozen &ldquo;goms&rdquo; in the country to pay the duty, but 99 per cent. of the tea wholesalers in the country simply laughed at him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If I were the Deputy I should not be so informative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can refer to his records, and unhappily he will find my name amongst them for a very substantial sum, very unwillingly paid, when I saw every one of my neighbours with considerably larger stocks not paying a farthing and laughing in the Minister's face.  The Minister knows that.  That is why he abandoned that system.  He had to learn by experience.  I do not grudge those respectable old firms&mdash;and most of them are respectable old firms&mdash;a bit of a &ldquo;killing&rdquo; on this.  They will get a considerable &ldquo;wipe&rdquo; out of this, while the Treasury will get little or nothing, and in due time this expedient will be abandoned.  I just wanted to warn the Minister, before he fell into the trap, that the effect of this will be to make a substantial present to the larger tea wholesalers, mainly men who represent the big London firms, because they have the capital to enable them to hold off here for a couple of months and build up the stocks upon which they will collect the duty that the Minister fondly hopes to get for the Treasury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says, of course, that he cannot possibly foresee what commodity this provision is intended to control.  It is as simple as falling off a log.  He has drafted this section in order to catch tea, and he has put it in the Finance Bill because, first, he thought he was forestalled in this Budget, and second, because he thought he would have to bring in a Supplementary Budget before the end of the Financial Year, and he knows the easiest thing to get a grip of is tea.  I will give him a wrinkle.  If he wants to bring in a Supplementary Budget, and get a duty on tea, let him <Col N="1051" /> bring it in before September, when the new tea lands.  There is no use in bringing in a Budget to collect your full revenue on tea if you are going to bring it in after all the new season's teas have been bought and delivered. No sane man buys a considerable quantity of tea after Christmas.  He buys between September and Christmas, when the new season's first crop teas are coming in.  Anything he buys after that is second crop and inferior stuff.  If the Minister wants to bring in a Supplementary Budget, he should bring it in about the month of August and then he will get revenue from tea. He need not resort to this expedient at all.  The ordinary rules of trade will prevent the forestalling that the Minister apprehends.  This is designed to collect revenue on tea, and nothing else but tea.  It means that the Minister is taking time by the forelock, because he knows he is in a very rocky condition financially, and he wants to construct one more nest to rob against the evil day he has brought on the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to prolong the debate unduly, but I should like to point out to the Deputy, first of all, that the powers given in this section can be exercised by the Minister at his own option.  It does not compel us to do any one of the things the Deputy seemed to think it would.  If it did, I do not think that all the dire consequences the Deputy has foreshadowed would follow.  I may be wrong, but I cannot foresee any merchant or trader with an established connection allowing that connection to lapse for so prolonged a period as the Deputy suggests.  Neither is there anything in the section which fixes the particular period at which the Minister may exercise these powers.  It does not necessarily follow that they will be exercised in February or March or April.  I should like to make it quite clear to the Deputy that the powers do not relate only to tea.  There may be other commodities in which there may be a temptation to gamble.  I think we can trust the Revenue Commissioners, who know the course of trade in this country very well and who know the course of importations, <Col N="1052" /> to advise me to exercise these powers at the period which would be most proper for the end which we might have in view.</P>

      <P>I suppose it is one of the occasions on which the new officer in the Department of the Prime Minister will be employed.  We very seldom have any announcement from him and, whenever there is one, it is an explanation of the Government's stupidity or ineptitude or about something they are going to attempt.  Sub-section (6) states:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Whenever the Revenue Commissioners, in pursuance of an order made by the Minister for Finance under this section, refuse to allow the delivery of goods or prohibit the sending out of goods from the premises of the manufacturer thereof...&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1053" /> You are going to interfere with manufacturers now; the policy up to this has been to get them more and more into production, but now they are to stock up goods on the premises.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;No action or other proceeding shall lie against any person on account of his failure to perform a contract...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course one of the things that makes business people laugh at Governments, not only in this country but in others, is when Ministers of State, who know nothing about business, and their advisers, who may know a little more but not much, commence to regulate business.  Look at the position of the manufacturer here who is allowed to manufacture, let us say, 10,000 pairs of boots and has contracts for these.  One person has an outstanding order with him for 1,000 pairs of boots and he has been allowed only ten pairs.  The manufacturer has filled up other contracts and one man must go without. That man has as good a right to have his contract fulfilled as the others, but they get in earlier, the Minister's Order is there, and whoever had this contract will not be allowed to get the goods because of the Minister's Order. I do not know whether it was after dinner that this was drafted or not, but it has all the appearance of it.  It is a ridiculous, nonsensical, autocratic section which should not be in any Finance Bill.  The whole section, from one end of it to the other, is more in <Col N="1054" /> keeping with an autocracy or an oligarchy than it is with business.  We are told that it is to prevent forestalling. Our experience of these matters is that, although there is a great deal of talk about forestalling, taking one year with another, it cancels out.  It does not amount to much.  The Minister has always got his expedient for dealing with it&mdash;he can change the tax.  There is not much left to tax. One thing I suggest that he should tax is Ministers' speeches.  The Minister might not get a lot of revenue, but it might be a more pleasant world to live in.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That the First Schedule stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>On the First Schedule I wish to make a few remarks, and they have relation to reference No. 6, which deals with paper which is, in the opinion of the Revenue Commissioners, of a kind suitable for the decoration of walls or of ceilings.  I think there are three different impositions in this particular reference.  The special provisions set out that &ldquo;The duty mentioned at this reference number is in addition to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; and that refers to a duty of 5 per cent. on paper.  There is another paragraph in the special provisions column setting out: &ldquo;The provisions of Section 8 of the Finance Act, 1919, apply to the duty mentioned at this reference number.&rdquo;  I take it that means that this number is subject to the Imperial or British preference.</P>
      <P>There is another paragraph in the same column setting out that where an article chargeable with the duty mentioned at this reference number consists of paper which is suitable for use as wallpaper border, and so on, it shall be subject to a rate specified.  I would like to ask the Minister if he realises the extent of this.  Perhaps the Minister would not mind saying how many of these strips would be in a roll, and what would be the greatest duty that could result from this imposition? I do not know if the Minister is prepared to answer that.  Is he prepared to give me that information? How many strips would be in a roll? They say here that there would be two or more.  Would the Minister be surprised if there were 20 in a roll?  Is that a fair question to ask him?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy had better conclude his remarks first.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  I think in this matter, and also in relation to some other duties, the effect on the consumer has been overlooked by the Government.  After all, they have got, as they would say, to sell the goods to the consumer and, if he does not think that he has got a square deal, he has the remedy in his own hands.  The paper trade, for walls or ceilings, is a peculiar trade, in this way, that it brings a whole lot of employment with it.  Things are fairly bad in the building trade and the painters suffer in common with the rest of the building trade.  There is also what one might describe as the jobbing trade, and this has a very serious effect on the jobbing trade.  I have asked the Minister do the members of the Government realise to what extent this duty can amount.</P>
      <P>I will proceed to show my calculation and perhaps the Minister, when he is replying, will tell me if there is any error in it.  I want to preface my remarks by saying that it is not merely a question of the sale of wallpaper, but there is the probability that the wallpaper extends to only 10 per cent. of a contract, and a very considerable amount of employment may hinge on whether the public consider they are getting value.  The Minister is just as well aware as I am that, before the duty on wallpaper was imposed, if an ordinary customer wished for a selection of borders, there were many thousands of patterns available.  You are now down, if you take the pattern book trade, to a selection of 250.  That number has to be reduced considerably, because deliveries are in some cases many months behind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having got to that point, we will proceed to consider the person who does not think he has got the selection he requires, and who wishes to take some imported article.  Let us suppose a border is imported.  I would like to contrast the present position under this Budget with the position as it was formerly.  The duty has been increased from a ld. the linear yard and 50 per cent., whichever was the greater, to <Col N="1058" /> 1d. and one ½d. and 75 per cent. There is also the imperial preference, so that so far as British papers are concerned, when they are less one-third, the 1d. and one 1/2d. would work out at 1d., the original duty.  But if you take a foreign border, the duty is increased by 1/2d. the linear yard&mdash;that is, 50 per cent.  I have asked the Minister how many of these strips you would have in a roll of border.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would prefer to hear my case?  I have here a pattern of border, and there are 26 strips in it. Now, there are other borders printed, with more strips, but we will take the 26 strips in that particular border, that I have here in my hand, and let us say that it is a foreign piece of paper.  The duty would be increased by one halfpenny a yard, which would be 50 per cent., and 26 times the halfpenny, which would bring the duty to 1,300 per cent. increase on the former duty on the wallpaper, or rather on the border. I do not know whether the Minister considers that duties like that are supposed to be paid or what the idea is, or whether they would justify the term &ldquo;astronomical&rdquo; increases in the duties. I do not know what would qualify it for the expression &ldquo;astronomical increases&rdquo;, but any way that is 1,300 per cent. of an increase, and there are others which, possibly, would be more.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister how far he thinks he can go before he creates a reaction from the people who have to pay for this.  Remember, I take it that the Minister's idea is that there should be a sale of wallpaper and that the people who, possibly, cannot get, in certain qualities just what they want, should be able, by paying some moderate duty, to obtain what they want, especially when such a considerable amount of employment is hanging to it as hangs to it in the decorating trade.  Another question that strikes one is this: Why, just at this juncture, the Minister should have steepened up the ordinary duty by 50 per cent.?  I suppose that he may answer that that was so as to give the British a preference and leave the duty the same as it was before.</P>
    <P>However, the point that I really wish to bring, in all seriousness, to the <Col N="1059" /> Minister's attention, is: how far duties such as this can be carried without having a very disastrous effect on the demand?  Undoubtedly, it can be felt in the better-class section in the decorating trade, but I would ask the Minister, when he is replying, to give some idea, if possible, as to what the policy of the Department is in regard to this matter.  In other words, do they want certain classes of business to be carried on at all, or do they wish them to cease?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it was necessary for the Deputy to make all these elaborate calculations, I think that he would have got the same effect if he had just said that the duty was prohibitive.  That is what it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, the word &ldquo;prohibitive&rdquo; is a relative word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is intended to ensure that these materials will not be imported.  The sole change which I was anxious to effect in this duty at the present time was to see that, in so far as border was concerned, the duty would apply to the length of each strip of border instead of to a sheet containing a number of borders.  That change was made as a result of our Agreement with the United Kingdom, under which certain preferences were to be given, and the terms of that Agreement made it necessary in this case to increase the full rate by the appropriate amount.  The change was made at a time when the effect of this duty on prices was being investigated by the Prices Commission, simultaneously with the review undertaken under the terms of the British Agreement.  That review has now been completed and the report has been received.  I think that the fact that such a review was proceeding would answer to the consumer's interest.  However, the effect of the change here is that the duty will apply to each strip of border instead of to a sheet containing a number of borders.  The object is to prevent evasion of duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, to my mind, really has not touched on the point.  I was endeavouring to make. Perhaps I did not make my point to <Col N="1060" /> the Minister with sufficient care.  My point is this: how far a reduction on a selection of many thousands to 250&mdash; and that 250 is reduced by gaps in the delivery extending into months&mdash;how far he would consider that adequate? The Minister says that the intention of the duty is prohibitive, and that the material should not come in.  Well, that is quite honest.  He says that I should have applied the word &ldquo;prohibitive&rdquo;. At any rate, I became emphatic and said that it amounted to 1,300 per cent.  Well, I should say that they are about the same.  However, the Minister has not answered my question, and that is the question to which I am really anxious to get an answer, namely: How far he thinks he is justified in prohibiting stuff coming in, in the face of the present supply? There is another matter.  The Minister says that the Report of the Prices Commission has reached him.  Well, it seems to me that this is like two at a sweep.  Apparently, the Prices Commission are investigating prices of wall paper.  I do not know what conclusion they have come to, but apparently the Minister, meanwhile&mdash;and now I want to be quite fair to him&mdash;seems as if he were anticipating their decision and increasing the duties on these commodities before a decision was come to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I explained to the Deputy that the increase in the full rate of duty is incidental to a change we made.  Under the terms of our agreement with the United Kingdom, whenever we change a duty we are obliged to institute the preferential rate.  The only change which it was desired to make in this duty was to ensure that it would apply, in the case of borders, to each strip of border and not to a sheet containing a number of borders.  But having made that change, it was necessary to institute a full rate and give the British manufacturers a preference.  That was why the full rate has been increased, and the only reason why.  That increase was made with the full knowledge of the fact that the duty was being reviewed at the time by the Prices Commission.  I think the point the Deputy is trying to make is that the <Col N="1061" /> imposition of a duty upon wallpaper means that there is going to be a restriction in the varieties available to the public.  That is so.  There is no use in denying the fact.  We will have fewer varieties of wallpaper than when we had every manufacturer in the world to pick from, but I think we will have an adequate supply.  There will be difference of opinion as to what constitutes an average supply.  So far as I am concerned I will put on all the pressure I can to ensure that the persons manufacturing wall paper here will produce the largest number of varieties possible with efficient production. But there is no denying the fact that we will have fewer varieties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; that is the point on which I do not understand the Minister.  There is wallpaper, and there are borders.  Why was it necessary to increase the duty in order to give the British a preference?  He has changed the duty so as to leave it the same for the British and increase it for the foreigner.  I want to know, theoretically could he not have given the British a preference off the existing duty?  Was there anything to prevent him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>He could.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes; that is the point I wanted to make as far as wallpaper is concerned.  I am unable to understand the Minister's point that he wants to increase the duty on borders to this, what I described as astronomical and he described as prohibitive, extent.  Of course, he is entitled to do it, but it is a most extraordinary duty and put on in a most extraordinary way because the duty is usually supposed to be put on the article as purchased and he has cut it up.  Supposing, for the sake of argument, a person said to him: &ldquo;I am not going to cut them up into strips at all.  I am going to use it as wallpaper,&rdquo; in what position would the Minister be?  It seems an extraordinary position. However, I suppose we will have to be satisfied with the Minister's explanation, but I am afraid that what he has gained on the swings he has lost <Col N="1062" /> on the roundabouts, because there is no doubt about it that the present position has had an adverse effect on employment in the painting and decorating industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The result of the wallpaper tariffs is that nobody is going to use wallpaper.  That has already happened.  A great many people are painting their rooms, and that is simply just too bad for the paper-hangers, but they are not the only class of people who have suffered from the reckless use of tariffs in this country.  It is useless to think that if we reduce the range of wallpapers to the level it has reached now in this country that wallpapers can be as widely used as they were in the past.  Nobody wants to see a dining-room, a hall, three bedrooms and two bathrooms all covered with the same wallpaper in the course of a perambulation down the street in which he lives.  That is what is going to happen, because, when you get a very small variety of wallpapers with only a few patterns available, the same wallpapers turn up again and again in neighbours' houses, with the result that eventually people make up their minds that they are not going to paper but will paint the walls.  Deputy Dockrell has dealt exhaustively with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer to reference No. 1 Reference No. 1 relates to thread&mdash; cotton thread, flaxen thread, hemp thread.  We all know the history of that disreputable tariff.  The tariff was put here on cotton thread at the request of a bankrupt firm from Leicester.  J. &amp; P. Coates offered to manufacture thread in this country, and were told that this bankrupt concern in the middle of England had the monopoly and were going to be left with it.  This concern went down to Westport and, in collaboration with the local people, built a factory, and it then transpired that they had been trying to get Coates to buy them for years, and Coates would not take them if they were given away with a pound of tea.  But, when they got the monopoly here they went back to Coates and said: &ldquo;Now have we got something you are prepared to buy?&rdquo; Coates said: &ldquo;Yes, you have the Irish monopoly.&rdquo;  This bankrupt concern <Col N="1063" /> then sold their enterprise including the Irish monopoly, to J. &amp; P. Coates for a very substantial sum of money, and the firm in Westport is now controlled by J. &amp; P. Coates, who were prepared to come in and run the industry for nothing but who, in fact, were required to pay a levy to this bankrupt concern in order to get in.  That is the truth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not a word of truth in that statement from beginning to end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Every syllable is true, and everybody knows it is true, and the Minister's brazen-faced denial of it will not convince anyone.  Observe the result of that.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The only reference I have to make to the matter is that if the firm has not been declared bankrupt the Deputy is not justified in so describing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows perfectly well that what I am saying is true, and J. &amp; P. Coates now control the Westport Thread Company in lieu of the company to whom he gave the monopoly, and no brazen-faced denial will cover up the Minister. Every conceivable measure was taken to cover up his tracks but, nevertheless, those tracks remain.  Observe the result of that.  This enterprise that started in Westport pleaded with the Minister that they could not maintain the industry there at all if they did not charge a substantial additional sum for the thread they were producing. While they were still in Westport they managed to secure the Minister's consent to fixing a price for thread that was used by the shirt manufacturers of this country about 60 per cent. higher than the price charged for the same thread in Great Britain.  Samples and certificates were sent to the Minister to show that was going on.  It was part of the undertaking which that <Col N="1064" /> firm gave when they came in here that they would produce thread for the industrialists of this country at a reasonable price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>At the same price at which the same thread was sold in Great Britain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>At the same price at which the same thread was sold in Great Britain.  Not for one hour was that undertaking ever kept.  From the day they came in they have charged the manufacturers a very wide margin of profit in excess of what was charged for better thread in Great Britain.</P>
      <P>In regard to sewing cottons, I have sent to the Minister, I have shown to the Minister, I have read out in this House that firm's price-list in Great Britain and their price-list in Ireland. I have shown him that they were charging 15 per cent. more in Ireland than in Great Britain.  Those standards having been fixed before the transfer to J. &amp; P. Coates took place, they are carrying on on virtually the same basis to-day.  And nothing is done about it. Does the Minister deny that the shirt manufacturers of Donegal laid before him certificates and price-lists to show that for the thread they could get for 57/- in England they were being charged something like 80/- here.</P>

Yet the Minister has the barefaced effrontery to say &ldquo;No.&rdquo; I actually had them in my own hand and read them, and saw the samples, and I know that the Minister received them, and I saw his letter saying that he was considering them. If the Minister consults his own files he will find a letter stating that he received those samples and documents, and yet he says that he never got them.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to say something in a roundabout way that <Col N="1066" /> the Rules of Order do not permit me to say bluntly, because I know that definite, conclusive and inescapable proof was placed in the Minister's hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Rules of Order apply to me also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Exactly.  We must recognise that and deal with one another accordingly.  I know that inescapable proof was placed in the Minister's hands that prices were 15 per cent. higher than the prices charged in Great Britain.  They are charged at the present moment.  Not only that, but terms and conditions of trade are sought to be imposed by the Westport company which were never imposed by the British company, and the Minister knows that, because I directed his attention to it myself.  Leaving out of the question the excess cost that has been imposed on the ordinary consumers of sewing cotton, the manufacturers of shirts in Donegal who are competing with the Derry shirt manufacturers find that this essential raw material has been raised in price to them and they are at a proportionate disadvantage in competing in the British market with the shirts that they are trying to sell and that they did sell in very large quantities there.</P>
      <P>Now, these manufacturers ought to be allowed to import that thread under licence and they are being denied that right.  Take the case of the embroidery people.  There are people here who were induced by the Minister to get into the business of embroidery with cotton thread&mdash;coloured embroidery on a white background.  They got thread from Westport and did a large order with it.  The order was delivered, but the bulk of it was returned on the ground that the colour in the thread ran and stained the white material on which it was embroidered.  They complained, and the Westport Thread Company said they were now enclosing a hank of thread which would come up to the requirements and which was guaranteed to be a fast dye.  The firm used that and when it was washed in cold water it ran.  Eventually, the firm lost the order altogether.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what the situation is <Col N="1067" /> now with regard to those coloured threads, but at that time it was perfectly impossible to get any thread from Westport that could be relied upon to retain its colour at all; with the result that that industry was very gravely prejudiced.  It was a valuable industry, one that had established and developed itself without the assistance of tariffs, one that had extended itself at the request of the Minister into new branches.  So far as I am aware it has largely lost the trade that it was developing of embroidering with coloured threads on other backgrounds.</P>
    <P>There is a reasonable <i>modus vivendi</i> that can be arrived at and that is that that firm in Westport that is now controlled by Coates&mdash;and no one makes better thread than J. and P. Coates of Paisley&mdash;should manufacture in Westport black thread and white thread&mdash; black sewing cotton and white sewing cotton, and should get licences to import coloured threads, and should bring the price of the thread down to the same level as that charged for the same thread in Great Britain.  Then there would be no serious ground for complaint. There is no valid reason why they should not do that, and the Minister ought to insist that they do it, but if not, if they cannot be made to do that, then those manufacturers who use thread as a raw material in an export industry in this country ought to be allowed to import thread free of duty.</P>
    <P>Now, sir, there is also a reference here to flaxen thread.  The Minister has never given any explanation of that.  There were two groups of firms shipping flaxen thread into this country &mdash;the Linen Thread Company of Glasgow, and Barbour's, and there was one other firm in the North of Ireland. Then somebody started a linen thread company in Dublin, and it was represented to this House that the Linen Thread Company of Scotland was so big that it could afford to dump thread here without any profit in order to capture the market for itself.  As a matter of fact, it never had succeeded in doing that, because Barbour's and the other North of Ireland firm always sold linen thread here in competition with them; but, on that excuse, there was a duty of 100 per cent. put on linen <Col N="1068" /> thread to keep the Glasgow Linen Thread Company out and to keep Barbour out.  And what happened?  After the 100 per cent. duty had been put on, the Linen Thread Company of Glasgow arrived in Dublin and bought the Dublin firm, and they are now mulcting the consumers of linen thread in this country behind the tariff of 100 per cent. which is now operating.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister got so lost in the labyrinth of his own follies that it is extremely difficult to follow him. Up to recently we had the ridiculous situation where a 100 per cent. tariff was put on in order to keep out a linen thread company and it is now operating to protect that linen thread company in Ireland against the competition of Barbour and other Northern Ireland linen thread manufacturers.  Yet, nobody seems to give a hoot.  No one seems to care.  If tariffs are going to be used in this country in this way, inevitably the bona fides of the Government will become suspect.  Personally, that is not very distressing to me, because the more tariffs that are imposed by imprudent men the more manifest their own inherent evil will become to the people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is one consolation to those who recognise the horror of tariffs that they have that intoxicating effect on those who use them.  They drive them from madness to madness, until, eventually, the people revolt against being made the slaves of the vested interests who thrive and prosper on the tariff ramp. Nevertheless, so long as there is a Parliament in this country, it is right that those of us who do see the profiteers and tariff-mongers, who live on sucking the blood of the consumers of the country, getting these monstrous tariffs and so shamelessly abusing them, should show them up and that the people should be informed of the outrageous character of the machinations of those who deal in such things. I urge strongly that the shirt industry and the embroidery industry should be relieved of the burden which they are <Col N="1069" /> at present bearing as a result of these tariffs.  I think it is fatal to both industries if the present abuses are allowed to continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should say that the sole change effected by reference No. 1 is to give the Revenue Commissioners power to exempt from duty ply yarns of cotton imported for use in a braiding machine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should, first, like to mention that I support what Deputy Dillon had to say on the question of coloured cotton.  So far as I know, there are at present four fast-dye cottons made in Westport.  That is the entire selection.  The rest of the sewing cotton is such that the colour washes out after one wash.  There is no fastness in it at all.  With regard to reference No. 4, I should like to know from the Minister what is the purpose of this duty.  Is it purely a revenue duty, and, if so, how much revenue does it produce?  This duty affects one industry only.  It is an old-established industry running back nearly 100 years to the first existing plant in Dublin.  It receives, and has received, no form of Government assistance whatever, and, in fact, rather the reverse, because large numbers of its raw materials are governed by duties and quotas.  It is an industry which gives employment to over 3,500 persons, and which pays out in wages nearly £350,000 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, however, unique in this, that its chief competitor is its own customers, because, unfortunately, practically everybody can do a certain amount of laundry work at home.  The iniquity of this duty is to be found in paragraph (b), under which domestic washing machines are free of all duty, as a consequence of the London Agreement. Why it should have been confined to domestic washing machines I do not know.  Hotels have, in many cases, installed these so-called domestic washing machines, and that is another form of competition which is, to an extent, subsidised by the Government. Admittedly, that does create a certain amount of employment, but I think it must be considered better from the public health point of view and <Col N="1070" /> every point of view that this work should be done in a large factory, specially designed for the purpose, rather than, possibly, in a cellar, or some other such place in a hotel.</P>
    <P>It seems to me that there is no possible reason for this duty.  I have outlined some of the reasons as to why I think it should not be imposed.  The laundry industry which is affected by it does all the things I have mentioned&mdash; gives considerable employment and pays good wages and it receives no assistance of any description from the Government.  The Government then comes along and imposes a duty of 20 per cent., which is certainly not a protective duty and cannot produce very much revenue.  The Minister will probably tell me that this is an old duty.  I know it is an old duty&mdash;it is merely altered by the fact that the component parts are now free of duty &mdash;but the fact that it is an old duty does not make it a good duty, and I do not think it could possibly be considered a good duty.</P>
    <P>However, lest my eloquence should not have converted the Minister to my view, there is one other point I should like to make on it, on the assumption that it has to stand.  What is the interpretation which is to be put on paragraph (c) which refers to &ldquo;drying cabinets and drying machines&rdquo;?  I do not know what was originally intended when this was imposed, but I believe it has been interpreted as covering a machine known as a hydro-extractor.</P>
    <P>That is a centrifugal machine which forces water out of clothes by centrifugal force.  It does not dry them, in the ordinary accepted sense of the word, but it has been so considered by the Revenue Commissioners.  It is a high-speed machine travelling at up to 1,750 revolutions per minute, or more. One effect of the alteration in the duty is that these machines will be imported in parts and it seems to me that, if it is intended that that particular type of machine should be covered, the Minister should consider the question of altering it, so that the machine may be imported in one piece and so that any danger which might arise from ineffective assembling of such a high-speed machine would not arise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>This duty is a protective duty.  Its purpose is to encourage the assembling of these pressing and washing machines, and drying cabinets here.  It has had that effect.  These machines are being assembled.  The change which is being made here is to exempt from the duty the component parts of these machines.  Heretofore, the duty applied to both the machines and the component parts.  It is not intended to change the duty.  I could not at this stage, however, deal with the case of a particular machine which might, or might not, be a drying cabinet, as defined here, but which has been held to be such by the Revenue Commissioners.  If the Deputy will get in touch with my Department, I promise him this, that if there is a machine which is not being assembled here, or which is not procurable here, and which is required by the industry in which he is interested, or any other industry, we will consider whether it would be possible to bring it outside the scope of the duty.  The sole intention here is to ensure that this duty will apply to machines which are, or can be, assembled here.</P>

      <P>Sub-section (2) of this section states: &ldquo;This Act shall be construed as one with the Land Purchase Acts and may be cited with those Acts.&rdquo;  I want to draw the attention of the Minister to cases under the 1881 Act which do not seem to be covered by previous Acts or to be covered by this Bill.  Under the Act of 1881 the Land Commission advanced two-thirds of the purchase money to the purchasers, the tenants, and the landlord <Col N="1077" /> executed a mortgage in perpetuity for the other third.  A case has come before the courts from my constituency, namely the case of the Wilson estate, situated in the south of Westmeath. The annuities were very high under the 1881 Act and, even with the reduction, they are comparatively high in relation to other annuities.  The tenants found the payment of the interest on the mortgage very severe.  Eight or nine years ago they ceased to pay the interest on the mortgage.  One of them was brought into the High Court recently, and sale of the farm was ordered.  It is the intention, I understand, to bring other people into the Circuit Court.  Of course, the sale proved abortive.  I have been already with the Land Commission in reference to this particular case.

I ask your indulgence in allowing me to bring this matter up now because there are a number of evictions pending.  It is not one farmer who is affected but dozens of farmers. Without exaggeration I could say that there must be 40 or 50 tenants on that estate and that is only one of the estates in the county.  I understand that there are odd cases of a similar nature in every other county.  It is a matter, I suggest, for the Minister to deal with on the Report Stage and I would ask him to deal with it then.  I have done my duty by drawing attention to the facts now.</P>

      <P>I should like to make one observation which I think is quite in order on this section.  Sub-section (2) provides that this Act shall be construed as one with the Land Purchase Acts and may be cited with those Acts.  I do not think any power on earth could construe any Land Act by itself, much less with the other Land Purchase Acts.  The position is becoming so hopeless, from the point of view of the ordinary practitioner, with all the various Land Acts and the various Amending Land Acts, that I think the only remedy is to wipe them all out and give to the Land Commission power to do what they please, anywhere they please, when they please and how they please.  Then we would know where we were; but to put a provision in the Bill that this Land Purchase Act is to be construed with anything is quite a hopeless proposition. It would be utterly impossible to relate it to any of the Land Purchase Acts.  I suggest that the Minister should codify all the laws relating to land purchase or put one guillotine section through to provide that the Land Commission may do what they wish.</P>

      <P>After the word &ldquo;landlord&rdquo; in line 35, to add the words &ldquo;provided that alternative dwelling accommodation is available in the neighbourhood&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The object of this amendment is to secure that the Land Commission shall be obliged to provide alternative accommodation when they are dispossessing a tenant of a dwelling house. In many of the cases in which the Land Commission acquired land up to the present the dwelling house on the land was a very substantial building and was the residence of the landlord, generally speaking.  In this Bill, however, compulsory powers are being taken to take tenanted land and it follows that much smaller houses will be involved.  I think that it would not be fair, when the Land Commission compulsorily acquire tenanted land of that kind, that they should have power to throw a man out of his dwelling and leave him without anywhere to go.  It seems logical, of course, to say that when the Land Commission exercise this power of acquiring the land, they should have the right to get possession of the house also because they cannot allot the land without getting possession of the house.  That is all right but a man may do his utmost and yet fail to get alternative accommodation. It may be that at the time he was thinking of getting a house as alternative accommodation, something occurs to that house and he cannot get it.  Then the Land Commission may proceed with the allotment of the land and forcibly put him out.  I think that this section should be so amended that the Land Commission will have to show <Col N="1081" /> to the court that alternative accommodation is available for the tenant who is being dispossed of his holding and his dwelling.</P>

      <P>I should like to raise a point of order on this section.  This is an Act to amend and extend the Land Purchase Acts in divers respects. Now, the Increase of Rent and Mortgage Interest (Restrictions) Acts, 1923 to 1930, have nothing whatever to do with land purchase.</P>
      <P>I would like to know whether, in view of the fact that the Long Title gives no power to do this, it is in order to have a section like this included in the Bill.  Why should an Act that was passed to deal with another matter, with rent restriction, be roped into a Bill of this kind.  The Rent Restrictions Act was passed into law to give protection to persons in occupation of houses: to prevent their being evicted and thrown out by process of ordinary law at a time when there was a shortage of house accommodation.  I submit, on a point of order, that this particular clause is out of order in a measure which purports &ldquo;to amend and extend the Land Purchase Acts in divers respects&rdquo;.  Such an extension as this would mean that there is scarcely an Act passed either by this Parliament, or that was on the Statute Book at the time that we took over in 1922, that could not be included, by amendment, to suit this purpose.  In my submission, this particular clause is clearly out of order in this Bill.</P>

It ought not to have, but if the Rent Restrictions Acts are to be used to prevent the Land Commission from doing its work, then I think power ought to be taken to deal with that. Surely these Rent Restrictions Acts were never intended to be used for the purpose of preventing division of land taking place, but people might attempt that, and the purpose of this section is to see that they cannot do it.</P>

Such cases have actually happened. What we are providing for here is that people who take up that attitude will not be able to shelter behind Acts which were never intended for such a purpose.</P>

      <P>As a layman I have the gravest doubt that the Rent Restrictions Acts would ever be pleaded in a case such as the Minister has mentioned&mdash;that is, that in order to prevent the Land Commission functioning, or getting possession of a house, a person who got temporary accommodation in that house would, for the purpose of thwarting the Land Commission, be able to establish his case in court by pleading the Rent Restrictions Act.  What Deputy McMenamin desires to get, what he is entitled to get, is what the Minister himself would seek to get if he were placed in the position of one of those persons, in occupation of a holding for perhaps 50 or 100 years, and that is that before he is evicted there should be alternative accommodation for him in the neighbourhood.  That is not by any means unreasonable.  We are not standing for persons endeavouring to secure a temporary grip, as it were, upon a dwelling.  We are not interested in that.  We feel, so far as the Rent Restrictions Act is concerned, taking simply the commonsense point of view, that in any court in the country the district justice or the circuit judge would see at once it was an attempt to evade the law.  It is altogether a different proposition where the Land Commission comes along, and, in the case of a person occupying tenanted land, having paid a land purchase annuity for a certain number of years, tells him that on a given date he must get out whether there is alternative accommodation or not.</P>

      <P>There is absolutely no difference between that and the action of the landlords in the past.  So far as the eviction of that man and his family is concerned, there is no difference. There are parts of the country where it is not easy to get that alternative accommodation.  If it is not there the man might as well be exiled, because he must leave the neighbourhood and perhaps make for one of the towns.  What we are putting up in this amendment is a fair proposition. If the Minister thinks that there is a loophole in it in respect of cases such as he has mentioned, let him undertake to consider the matter and bring in an amendment on the Report Stage. We are endeavouring to ensure that we will not legalise an injustice by allowing this clause to go through as it is at the present moment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is under a complete misapprehension if he thinks the Increase of Rents Acts were never intended to apply to the cottages or small tenancies which he apparently has in mind when he wishes to have this section inserted.  The Increase of Rents Acts have applied for the last 20 years or more to those particular tenancies.  They have applied since 1915.  They have applied in this country, under an Act of our own Parliament, since 1923, and several amending Acts have been passed to that particular Act by our own Parliament, specifically allowing holdings of the type that will be caught by this section to be given the benefit of the provisions of the Increase of Rents Acts.  It is a bit late in the day for the Minister to get up here and, in tones of indignation, say it was never intended that the Acts should apply to tenancies of this kind.  It has, in my opinion&mdash;and I think it is incontrovertible&mdash;always been intended.  In fact the Acts have been applied in a widespread fashion to small cottages and gate-lodges throughout the country.  No later than last March I myself appeared in Deputy Corry's constituency in County Cork for a tenant who was seeking the benefit of the Increase of Rents Act&mdash; this very Act&mdash;against the landlord in the case of a gate lodge.  That tenant got the benefit of the Act, in regard to <Col N="1087" /> a gate lodge on the estate, against the landlord, and got the rent fixed in reference to the rent of 1914.  In many respects that was a hardship on the landlord.  I say that quite candidly although I was appearing for the tenant.  Why should the Land Commission, who are nothing more than landlords, in reference to tenancies in gate lodges and cottages on an estate, have power to do away with what, in fact, is a vested right in the tenancies, given by Acts not merely of the British Parliament but of our own Parliament successively since 1923?</P>
      <P>It is idle to say it was not intended that the Act should apply.  Deliberately and specifically, tenancies of gate lodges and tenancies of small cottages in the country were allowed to be brought within and to remain within the ambit of the Increase of Rents Acts.  Why should the Land Commission have a privilege, merely because they want to make the way clear for themselves, merely because they want to be the modern juggernaut amongst Government Departments, sweeping everything out of their way?  On sub-section (2) of Section 1 of the Act we had a reference to the fact that what the Land Commission really wanted was a one-clause Act enabling them to do anything they like, where they like, whenever they like, at whatever price they like, and at no price if necessary. They did that under the guise of effecting a social service.  They did it, in fact, by doing the greatest injustice throughout the length and breadth of the country, and the sooner they realise that the better.</P>

      <P>The Minister is rather butting in on the few observations I wanted to make.  He has again displayed his ignorance of this particular Act.  The Increase of Rents Acts apply to weekly tenancies.  I suppose it will be levelled against me that I do not represent an agricultural constituency. I do not, but I do happen to know something about the country, and I do know that there are weekly tenancies of cottages&mdash;in fact, it is within my own professional experience&mdash;where those Rents Acts apply, and where the tenants have got the benefit of them. What this section is going to achieve is that the juggernaut of the Minister's Department will crush them under its chariot wheels.  That is what the Minister wants.  This section and the following section are on a par.  I had intended to make a few observations on the next section.  The Minister, under the following section, wants to have certain privileges which previously attached to the Crown.  What he is doing in this case is trying to get away from, I think, a court decision of our own that State Departments were not entitled to the privileges of the Crown in reference to this particular Act.  Whether there was an actual decision on that I do not know, but it did arise several times in my own professional experience.  The Minister's Department, in this and the following section, is trying to get back to the position where Government Departments were Departments of the Crown, and, as the Crown, were not bound by an Act of Parliament unless <Col N="1089" /> specifically mentioned in it.  The Crown would not have been bound by the Increase of Rents Acts, but the Minister is afraid to go into court and say:  &ldquo;The Land Commission now being the successors of a Department of the Crown has the same privileges as a Department of the Crown,&rdquo; and, therefore, he wants to shove in an innocent-looking section for the benefit of his Department; in other words, to give them the same privileges which the Land Commission had when it was a Crown Department.  They want to get the benefit of being the successors of the Crown.  That is what this and the following section purport to do. The Crown could have put out their tenants, and the Minister now wants to deal in the same way with weekly tenancies of 1/- or 2/-, because he is in precisely the same position as the Crown in the old days.</P>

      <P>The Minister might take the advice of persons experienced in law.  What we are asking is that in this case the same responsibility should be put upon a layman functioning in the Land Commission as there is on a court presided over by a person qualified to administer the law.  Why should we seek to give greater powers to lay people than we give to our judges?  We restrict our judges by reason of the Rent and Mortgage Interest Restriction Acts.  They are lawyers experienced in the administration of the law, and they have some conception of the responsibility that attaches to a person in that position. It is now proposed to take certain powers and hand them over to be exercised by laymen.  The Minister ought <Col N="1090" /> to have a little more sense than to ask for such powers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one other point to which I should draw the attention of the House, and that is, that even in cases where the Increase of Rent Acts apply, the courts have jurisdiction and discretion to give a decree for possession and put out the tenant where the circumstances require it. The usual shorthand expression for the circumstances in which the courts exercise that discretion is, where there is greater hardship in refusing to give possession than in allowing the tenant to remain.  If the Land Commission have a case, and it can be proved that the staying in possession of some unfortunate person in a gate lodge at 1/- or 1/6 a week is going to prevent the division of an estate, all they have to do is to get the local State solicitor to go into the district court and say to the district justice that this man is holding up the division of the estate by staying in the gate lodge.</P>
      <P>If there is any truth, or any reality, or any justice in that case, he can get his order from the district justice without the necessity of having an Act of Parliament.  I submit that there is no reason why the Land Commission should be in any better position in reference to the Increase of Rent Acts than any landlord in my constituency in the City of Dublin. There are many landlords who, before the War, put money into house property. They are suffering very severe hardship as a result of the continuation of the Increase of Rent Acts in the case of small houses in my constituency, and there has been nothing done to alleviate that hardship.  All their overhead expenses have been increased in every way, and they are getting no corresponding relief by way of being enabled to increase the rent. Why should the Land Commission be in a more privileged position than the ordinary person suffering from the effects of the Increase of Rent Acts, which were designed to meet a situation brought about by the War?  There is no reason why, if the Land Commission have a case, they should not make that case in the place where every citizen has to make his case, namely, in our own courts.</P>

      <Col N="1093" /> Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 5 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to call the Minister's attention to another serious aspect of this matter.  There is a provision bringing our old friend, the retrospective effect of legislation into full force in this section.  Not content with the Increase of Rent Act in future not applying to holdings to which the Minister does not want it to apply, there is a provision that it is deemed never to have applied.  In other words, if a tenant of a gate lodge, to which that Act applied, had a standard rent fixed by the court on this particular gate lodge, he having in his submission to the court been charged too much rent by the landlord, then had the rent fixed in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  At present if this section is carried, everything that the court has done will be undone, and he will find himself in the position of reverting to the old rent he had to pay, and that was extracted by the landlord contrary to the provisions of the Increase of Rent Act.  That does not bother the Minister.  The Minister wants me to give particulars of injustice. Here is one.  Leave out the ones that have been done.  We are going to provide that the Act shall be deemed never to have applied to property which the Land Commission have bought.  In other words, we are going to take away rights which tenants, perhaps, have enjoyed for the last 20 years under a court order, and in the teeth, perhaps, of written agreements with landlords.  We are going to make this position, that the Increase of Rent Act is deemed never to have applied, the court orders are accordingly void, and landlords can recover at least 12 years of the full rents that they were able to extract.  The Minister, I take it, does not want me to give any more examples of injustice if he persists in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy ought not try to get away with the suggestion that the Land Commission can take the place of landlords.  What the Land Commission is trying to do is to settle people on the land, and it is only where they require <Col N="1094" /> houses of this kind for purposes of land division that they will move.  If they find the occupant of a gate lodge is, as in the case mentioned by Deputy Cosgrave, a person whose people have been on the land, not alone will he get the house he is living in or a better one, but the land in addition.  Where we find people there who are simply holding on to houses and obstructing the Land Commission, especially people who would not be eligible for land at all, who may be engaged in business in towns, and who are not agriculturists, if we allowed them to rely on the Increase of Rent (Restrictions) Act they might prevent us proceeding with the very useful social work of land division.  It is to prevent that that we are making this provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister does not want me to think he is indignant, then I admire the irrelevancy of his observations.  His remarks have not in one single respect, in one single word, anything to do with the point I made.  The Minister started by telling me, in tones which I would have thought were tones of indignation, but which he repudiates as such, that I should not think that the Land Commission are to be in the place of the landlords.  If they are not, the Increase of Rent Acts do not apply to them at all.  It is only, in fact, because they are in the place of the landlords that the Increase of Rent Acts would be inclined to worry them.  The point I raised was not whether or not the Minister is to be hampered in this great social work of land division.  I made all the remarks I intend to make in that respect.  I confined my observations to one point, and that was that if you do want this section to prevent the Increase of Rent Acts being raised as a defence, why do you want the retrospective portion of it when it will carry with it the implication of injustice to which I have referred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister did not answer that, and no spate of words will get the <Col N="1095" /> Minister away from that.  I am going to sit here as long as I can to bring the Minister to answer that.  There is no use in the Minister saying that he is engaged in a tremendous social work. Perhaps he is and perhaps he is not&mdash; there is room to differ on that point. But assuming every single thing that the Minister said is true, why does he still want to provide that the Increase of Rents Acts are to be deemed never to have applied to the particular houses in question?  Putting in that provision will not have anything to say to the question whether or not the Minister will get possession.  If he provides now that the Increase of Rents Acts, from the passing of this measure, will not apply, there is no defence to the action if he brings ejectment proceedings. Why does he want to have it retrospectively operative from 1914?  I would like to have a specific and clear answer to that.  Perhaps, 1914 is not the exact year.  The Increase of Rents Act was passed first in 1915.  But this is to have retrospective action to 1915. The Minister does not know, and I am quite sure he does not know, and he takes advantage of the fact that he is ignorant of a lot of things and then benevolently puts forward the view that he ought not to be worried because he does not know.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether he does know it or not, the Minister can take it that there have been numerous instances of the type that will come within the scope of this section where applications have been made to the court to fix a rent against the landlord of the gate-lodges or cottages on the land.  No such application would come before the court unless the case of the tenant was that the rent he was being charged by the landlord was outside the increase allowed by the Acts, and the courts have so held and fixed the proper rent at an amount less than that fixed by the landlord, and the landlord was made recoup the tenant over a period of 20 years, in accordance with the court decision, the amount he had overpaid him on the premises. <Col N="1096" /> What is going to be the effect of this?  The Act is deemed never to have applied.  All the orders of the court are to be wiped out.  What is the position of the tenant to be in respect of the landlord who has disappeared, not to speak of his position in reference to the Land Commission?  I want to know from the Minister why he wants this drastic retrospective operation of this section, and I do not want to hear any more on the question of the Minister's social work or the powers or objects of the Land Commission. I only want to know this. Assuming the Minister gets everything that this section purports to give him, with the exception of the retrospective operation, how will the operations of the Land Commission be hampered?</P>

Deputy Costello is aware that we are taking a similar power in respect of other rights, grazing and turbary, where we are being prevented from doing our work properly.

    <P>Section ordered to stand part of the Bill.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 6.</P>
    <P>Moneys due or payable to the Land Commission shall have and, save as regards moneys due or payable to the Land Commission as successors to the Commissioners of Church Temporalities in Ireland, shall be deemed always to have had the like rights, privileges, and priorities as are conferred by sub-section (2) of Section 38 of the Finance Act, 1924 (No. 27 of 1924), on the moneys to which that sub-section applies.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>To delete all the words in lines 37, 38 and 39, save the word &ldquo;the&rdquo;, in line 39.</P>
      <P>This section is like the last one, of course, and is going very far.  I am prepared to give the Minister power from now on, or from the time of the passing of the Act, for the recovery of these debts, but I am not prepared to agree that this should be made retrospective. It seems to me that there is considerable doubt about the legality of this section.  Surely, it is going very far. The words of the section are: &ldquo;Moneys due or payable to the Land Commission shall have and, save as regards moneys due or payable to the Land Commission as successors to the Commissioners of Church Temporalities in Ireland, shall be deemed always to have had the like rights&rdquo; and so on.  Why does the Minister take that right?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment seems to me to be a queer amendment, because, in one part of it the Deputy is giving us some power that we are not asking for&mdash;where he seeks to give us a right to priority in the case of moneys due to the Church Temporalities Fund&mdash;and then, on the other hand, he leaves it open to propose claims for money that has been paid under, what we consider always to have been our right&mdash;that is that the Land Commission always believed that it had the right to priority in certain claims, and we are making it retrospective in case actions may be taken in respect of cases in which that right has been asserted.  That is the reason for the retrospective provision.  We do not ask for the power the Deputy proposes to give us by including the Church Temporalities Fund.  Therefore, he seems to be contradictory in offering us something we are not looking for and then restricting us in something which we do feel is very necessary.</P>

      <P>The Minister cannot have read the amendment.  The Minister describes the Deputy's amendment as a queer amendment.  Certainly, if the amendment read the way the Minister has read it it would be a queer amendment.  If the amendment is accepted, the section would read: &ldquo;Moneys due or payable to the Land Commission shall have the like rights, privileges, and priorities as are conferred by sub-section (2) of Section 38 of the Finance Act, 1924 (No. 27 of 1924), on the moneys to which that sub-section applies.&rdquo;  What is queer about that?  The Minister has not read the amendment, or he has not appreciated the effect of it.  It is merely to leave the first words of the section&mdash;&ldquo;Moneys due or payable to the Land Commission shall have&rdquo; and delete every one of the other words down to &ldquo;the like rights,&rdquo; etc.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the section when the words are deleted.  Putting it shortly, it means moneys due or payable to the Land Commission shall have the same rights as are conferred by sub-section (2) of Section 38 of the Finance Act.</P>

      <P>The section as it stands would not include the debts due to the Church Temporalities Fund.  We are providing here: &ldquo;Moneys due or payable to the Land Commission shall have, and, save as regards moneys due or payable to the Land Commission as successors to the Commissioners of Church Temporalities in Ireland,&rdquo; etc. We do not propose to include those as having the right of priority.  I am advised, anyway, by a pretty competent lawyer that if we do not include those words the Church Temporalities Fund would then have a priority as well as the other debts due to the Land Commission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not asking for it.  Deputy McMenamin is proposing that by deleting these words moneys due to the Church Temporalities Fund will be included in the same category as the land annuities, and then, on the other hand, by deleting the other words, he is leaving us open to an action for recovery in cases where we have acted as having the right of priority.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>I would suggest that there is a way in which the Minister and Deputy McMenamin can come together, that is to say, that the Minister can have in the words &ldquo;save as regards money due or payable to the Land Commission as successors to the Commissioners of Church Temporalities in Ireland&rdquo;&mdash;let him have those words in, and let him strike out the words, &ldquo;shall be deemed always to have had.&rdquo;  Will the Minister take that line?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not take that line for the reason I have mentioned.  I would have no objection to taking the particular power that has been given to us.  We are offered that, but in proposing the change suggested in the amendment we would be leaving the field open to people who might think they have a claim against us.  If it is only to date from the passing of this Bill the field might be open for people to claim.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not only fair that people should know where they stand with regard to an Act passed with all the solemnity of an Oireachtas sitting and considering it?  We lay down the law.  People assume that is the law. They exercise their rights.  They go to court to exercise them, and then they find that those are only rights for the term in which they ran.  In other words, they were only there, to use the language of Deputy Corry, for the purpose of getting legal practitioners something to do.  Directly it is found that it means the exercise of a right by a citizen the Parliament is asked to correct that.  There is no finality in that and no respect for the status of this House or this Parliament as long as that continues.  What we are against in connection with this particular Bill and the clauses which we seek to amend is that it is deemed always to have been that case.  It was not that case and, in the exercise of the Minister's jurisdiction, he must have some regard for justice, common ordinary justice, for the individuals who comprise this State.  Yesterday, six months ago, 12 months ago, citizens had those rights.  Directly they exercised them a Bill is introduced here to take them away.  Does the Minister think there is going to be any respect for either this House or the Oireachtas, or for the whole of this country if that is going to be the position in the future?</P>
      <P>If, perhaps, it may have happened that in the short time at our disposal in dealing with this Bill a mistake was made in the drafting of an amendment, some consideration is due to members.  We have had four or five Bills fired at us&mdash;this one, the Tourist Bill, a Bill dealing with Waterford, and two or three others that escape my memory for the moment, including the Finance Bill and the Appropriation Act.  The Minister asked for permission to introduce this Bill in December. He circulated it on the 27th May.  We had a Second Reading on the 6th June. This is the 15th June.  Amendments had to be put up in those four, five or six days, as the case may be, although the Minister had six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What the Minister is doing in this particular section is taking some power <Col N="1103" /> which he had not got before this Bill was introduced.  It is a power which he seeks to antedate.  I submit that it is not just to the citizens of this State to be presented with a situation like that; that there ought to be some finality about our law; that there ought to be some regard for citizens' rights.  While the Land Commission may claim by reason of this clause to enter into possession of certain moneys, certain individual citizens believe they had that right and may have balanced their budget in accordance with the exercise of that right.  If suddenly, at a moment's notice, that right is going to be taken away, it is not good business. It may suit the administration of the Land Commission but it is not just and it is not good.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It was believed until a recent decision that that right was there.  The Land Commission have always acted&mdash;and I am sure in the Deputy's own time, when his Government was in office, under Deputy Costello as Attorney-General&mdash;as if they had priority in this case.  In a recent decision it was held that they had not and it is to ensure that we will not have actions occurring in respect of things that happened long ago that we are taking this right.  If the Deputy casts his mind back I think he will remember that he had to do similar things himself in order to make sure that cases of that kind would not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this House merely for the purpose of upsetting judgments given for people when they went to the courts and asserted their rights and secured them, who probably paid income-tax on this particular part of their budget?  Is it right that when a decision is given against the Land Commission all the Land Commision has to do is to walk in here and get a Bill passed and upset the whole thing?  It is about time we stopped that.  Government Departments have no more rights than any ordinary citizen and if a decision goes against them they should take the consequences and foot the bill.  The ordinary citizen does it outside and should not every Government Department do it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>May I say that I was wrong in stating that a decision had been given against us.  The Land Commission has always acted as if it had priority, but there is a doubt which, I understand, has not been decided, as to whether the Land Commission has priority and this is to ensure that it has in case it has not, so that if there were actions brought we would not have to come in here for legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is not that very bad. Here are people who get legal opinions and come into court and are advised and then we come along here before the court has decided and lay down the law.  Is there no provision for the payment of the costs in which these people have been involved?  We are getting powers for the Land Commission and surely to goodness, common justice ought to govern our actions in cases of this sort.  Where we are going to take away a right from a man that he had we should at least make compensation for any loss that he may suffer in bringing the action.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a cure. Could I put just one question to the Minister?  The Minister has conferred on him all the rights and privileges deemed to exist under the Land Acts and under the Finance Act of 1924. Supposing, when this section becomes law a court of justice decides&mdash;as I am telling the Minister it may very well decide and may properly decide&mdash;that the privileges conferred by the Act of 1924 have been rendered completely nugatory by the passing of the Constitution, will the Minister then walk into this House again and say they intended to obtain the privileges of Crown debts but unfortunately used the wrong phrasing?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite positively.  The Deputy when he was Attorney-General acted in the same manner.  If we find that we have not covered the points we wish to cover and if we find that the courts so decide we certainly will come in and obtain legislation through the Oireachtas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a small matter compared with the fundamental matter as to whether the courts are going to make the law or the Oireachtas is going to make it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The question has been raised here where we may act on what clearly was the intention of the Oireachtas and where the State Department may act on the assumption, unchallenged, that it has certain rights, and where somebody may then raise a point and get a decision otherwise. Surely, the Oireachtas has the right to decide whether or not that shall be the case, that whatever they say cannot be mistaken by the court which has the interpreting of the statute that we pass.  I say that if we find that some law has been passed through the Oireachtas and is held not to cover the points that we wished here that it should cover then we must bring in further legislation to make that perfectly clear.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>If that principle is carried out to any great extent it means that the ordinary citizen will have no legal rights at all eventually, so far as proceeding against a Government Department is concerned.  If a plucky citizen takes an action on what he thinks is a proper interpretation of an Act and proceeds against the Government, and then if the Government passes a new measure ante-dating the provisions of the Act in order to prevent this particular person taking advantage of any legal decision, it has practically abolished any legal rights that the ordinary citizen can have.  I, for one, have always been against this practice of retrospective legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister staggered me with his last speech, because he has laid down this extraordinary proposition now that, if a Minister meant something and expressed something else and people acted upon that something else and the courts decided upon that something else, and upon the plain interpretation of the wording, then the Minister is to come along and say: &ldquo;I meant something else, and I am going to set aside retrospectively the transactions which other persons have entered into on the ground that I myself may have expressed myself imperfectly.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>How is anybody to know what is in the mind of the Minister except from what the Minister says?  There came into my mind just now, when I heard the Minister speaking, those very familiar words used by an old judge that I am sure stuck in your memory, Sir, when reading the Law, and they were these: &ldquo;It is trite learning that the thought of man is not triable, for the devil himself knows not what is in the heart of man.&rdquo;  I believe that is very good theology also, but the devil himself does not know what is in the mind of the Minister at the present moment.</P>

      <P>I cannot say whether it will be a social service or not.  The Land Commission has the right to incur a loss on the resale of land, but it is not clear that it has the right to do so on the resale of sporting rights. No loss has been incurred yet, but in case it might turn out that rights should have to be sold, it is desirable to have the power to sell them even at a loss.  I do not know if the killing of game is a social service, but it is a point which I do not propose to discuss.</P>

    <P>This section purports to amend section 21 of the Land Act of 1931.  I think it will be agreed that when people are entitled to dividends, they are entitled to them of right and they should not have to go to any expense of any kind in order to have these dividends given to them.  It was for that reason that I put down this amendment.  Sub-section (b) of (1) of this section says &ldquo;notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing paragraph of this sub-section, the Judicial Commissioner may, on application to him in the prescribed manner of any person claiming to be entitled to the dividends on any land bonds so retained, make such order as to the payment of the said dividends or other wise as the justice of the case may require.&rdquo;  In other words, application will have to be made to the Judicial Commissioner to get the dividends.  My view is that they are entitled to them of right or not at all.</P>

      <P>The original clause in the Land Act dealing with this had in mind the segregation of ten per cent. of these land bonds for a particular purpose.  That was deemed to be sufficient at the time.  If it is now proposed to take in addition the percentage that formerly accrued without reference to the Judicial Commissioner it is certainly taking something which was formerly given.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the Judicial Commissioner would have power to award the persons this ten per cent. which is held at present in a sort of Limbo.</P>

      <P>The difference between the amendment and the section as it stands is to make it mandatory on the Commissioner.  We propose here to leave it to the Judicial Commissioner's discretion.  It is not fair that that ten per cent. should be treated as the amendment suggests.  That ten per cent. is held there in case there should <Col N="1111" /> be some adjustments and it is not clear whether the person is entitled to it or not.  If it is considered that the ten per cent. retained is sufficient to meet any adjustments made, the interest will not be held but, where it is held, if the Judicial Commissioner is satisfied that there would be a hardship on the person he may make an order for payment. We are in the same position as that suggested by the amendment except that what Deputy Cosgrave suggested is provided by us whereas the amendment makes it mandatory.</P>

Does the Judicial Commissioner ask for that discretion?  He does not.  The judge would rather have the law laid down.

      <P>I should like to know whether the Minister thinks this section meets what, in my view, has created a difficulty in connection with applications under Section 39 of the Act of 1923.  Four and a half per cent. land bonds ceased to be issued some years ago.  Section 39 of the Act of 1923 sets out that the redemption price, when fixed, shall be advanced and paid by means of 4½ per cent. land bonds and distributed by the Judicial Commissioner. I take it that, once the last issue of 4½ per cent. land bonds was exhausted and when no more 4½ per cent. bonds were being issued, that held up any redemptions under Section 39 of the Act of 1923.  I cannot see how the Land Commission could allow any redemptions under that section when it appears to be mandatory that the redemption should be payable in 4½ per cent. land bonds and when no such land bonds, in fact, existed.  I should like to know whether this section removes that difficulty with <Col N="1116" /> regard to applications under Section 39 of the Act of 1923.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It adopts the provisions of Section 36 of the Act of 1931 which directs that payment of interest on claims against purchase money shall be at the rate of 4½ per cent. pending distribution of the purchase money. Where the purchase money is payable in 4 per cent. bonds, the interest payable shall be at the same rate as the relevant bonds bear&mdash;4 per cent.  While land bonds are awaiting distribution, the Judicial Commissioner may, under Section 36 of the Act of 1931, order the dividends to be paid to the vendor or other person entitled to receive them and if there are any mortgages, charges, or other interest-bearing incumbrances affecting the purchase money, the interest payable shall be at the rate of 4½ per cent. pending distribution of the purchase money, notwithstanding anything in the instrument creating the incumbrance.  Since 1931 the rate of interest on new land bonds has been altered to 4 per cent. and this clause provides that the rate of interest on mortgages, etc., affecting purchase moneys shall correspond to the rate of interest on the land bonds constituting the purchase moneys.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister explain to the House what is the intention with regard to paragraph (b)? The price of land bonds varies.  There are times when they are at a discount and there are times when they are at a <Col N="1117" /> premium.  The Land Commission is unable to regulate the price so that it would be always par but it does appear strange to introduce a cash payment when the regular procedure or practice has been to issue bonds.  At the moment, it is possible that these land bonds are slightly over par and, presumably, the fact that that is so was in mind when this particular sub-section was introduced.  Now, they have got to take the rough with the smooth.  Some people may have been at a serious disadvantage by the fact that land bonds issued at even 4½ per cent. were as low as 88 at one time. Even now 4 per cent. bonds may be slightly over par.</P>

      <P>(2) The foregoing sub-section shall apply and be of force and effect only where the Land Commission shall offer to take such possession on the day originally agreed upon or fixed by them.</P>
      <P>This section authorises the Land Commission, where they do not get possession on the day fixed, to be paid out of the land bonds for the time they are kept out of possession.  My amendment is merely to make the section apply mutually&mdash;to give the same rights to the tenant or the person from whom they are taking the land if the Land Commission is not in a position to take the land on the day that has been fixed.  The Land Commission takes power to re-imburse itself for any payments in respect of rates or other liabilities during the period it is kept out of possession.

      <P>Cases have occurred in which the Land Commission say &ldquo;we will take possession of these lands on the 1st July.&rdquo;  On the 24th or 25th June, the person in occupation sells his cattle.  Then the Land Commission comes along on the 26th or 27th June and says: &ldquo;we will not be able to take possession until the 1st August or 1st September.&rdquo;  It is not an economic proposition for a person who has sold his cattle to purchase cattle again for the sake of grazing the land for a month or two.  The land is not used for that period but the person who is in possession is liable to rent, rates and other charges.  The Minister in this case has taken precautions to ensure that the Land Commission will only discharge its obligations from the date on which it gets possession.  Deputy McMenamin is endeavouring to ensure that the same rights will be conferred <Col N="1120" /> upon individuals who are informed that the land will be taken over as from a certain date.  Then, having cleared the land so as to give possession, they are informed subsequently that the Land Commission will not be able to take possession until a later date.  Meanwhile, they have to meet rates, rents and other charges.  I think it is a reasonable amendment.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1122" /> This section has been apparently drafted as a result of a decision of the courts.  The Land Commission appears to be terribly afraid of the courts but they appear to be altogether too much alarmed about this matter. In this section the Minister provides that one lay commissioner may be sufficient to carry out serious acts relating to property whereas, if I remember aright, there are five or six such commissioners.  I was originally disposed, when drafting the amendment, to suggest that the concurrence of not less than three lay commissioners should be necessary to carry out these duties but I thought the Minister would think that I was too reactionary. I have therefore suggested two instead of three.  Of course, in case of a dispute between two, there would be no decision at all: I thought perhaps the Minister would not take it in that light, and therefore I put down &ldquo;two&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;one&rdquo; in order to show that there was at least agreement between two persons on anything that was done.</P>
    <P>It was decided that all the commissioners would have to join in any of those acts.  The Minister says that was not the intention.  What matters is not what the intention was, but what this House says.  In the particular section referred to the word &ldquo;commissioners&rdquo; obviously meant all the commissioners. That may not be what the Minister in charge of the Bill at the time meant, but that is what he said, and I do not see why there should be any grouse about it.  There is no use in getting into the jitters about it.  We are dealing with land, which is the most valuable asset that we have, and every care and precaution should be taken to see that every act done in connection with it would have at least the appearance of authority and con sideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said on the Second Reading of the Bill that the courts had decided that where the word &ldquo;commissioners&rdquo; was mentioned it meant all the commissioners. Now, we are going as far as the intention that was expressed in the 1933 Act, namely, that where the word <Col N="1123" />&ldquo;commissioners&rdquo; is mentioned that at least two are in mind.  What is proposed in the amendment is that, when the Minister appoints commissioners to do certain work, at least two will be appointed.  I think if that is done it will give perfect security with regard to any matter of this kind; that is, where there is a question of the acquisition and distribution of property or anything of that sort.  It is no great burden to place a responsibility such as that upon two individuals.  They are laymen, and they are being given extraordinary powers under this Bill as well as under the other when this one has been passed.  It is not unreasonable, I think, to ask that not less than two should undertake the very serious and onerous responsibilities which this Bill places upon them.</P>
      <P>I suppose we may take it that this Bill has been introduced to correct the omission in the 1933 Act&mdash;that where the word &ldquo;commissioners&rdquo; was mentioned, at least two were involved.  In substance that is what we are asking in this amendment.  It may be that before the Report Stage is reached the Minister may think it necessary to introduce a special clause giving to a single commissioner a particular responsibility, but normally, where the commissioners are dealing with the acquisition and distribution of land or exercising the other wide powers given under the 1933 Act, then we think that at least two ought to have the responsibility.</P>

      <P>As far as the acquisition and allocation of land is concerned and the fixing of price, two commissioners act.  As regards many routine acts performed by the commissioners, I think it would be hardly necessary to have two.  I can give the Deputy some examples, and I am sure he will agree that in dealing with these matters it would scarcely be necessary to have two commissioners: the signing of vesting orders, routine amendments to list of vested holdings, routine fixation of appointed day, routine business arising out of management of property and things of that sórt.</P>

      <P>On the section, I would like to know if there is any place where one can get these determinations by the Minister.  This section is being related back to Section 6 of the 1933 Act.  I think that in matters of this kind it would be far better if these things were prescribed by the rules rather than made administrative acts of the Minister.  Under this the Minister has power to make rules.  Therefore, I think these things should be prescribed in the rules.  If that is done a person will be able to find out the proper number of commissioners, and so on, that have actually dealt with a particular matter which has been before them.  The certification business is a case in point.  It made this section necessary.  If something had been prescribed in the rules that matter would not have arisen at all.</P>

      <P>This is a section which gives me a great deal of difficulty.  Under sub-section (2) the Minister can appoint a certain number of commissioners to do certain work. Suppose the Minister appoints three commissioners, and that the three are necessary to carry out such-and-such work, but suppose one commissioner takes it upon himself to do the work. That is, a less number than the Minister has specified.  What is the remedy open to the individual concerned?  His remedy as regards going to court seems to be taken away.  According to my reading of it, sub-section (3) does not safeguard him either.

Three commissioners, let me say, are necessary to do such and such a work. Through inadvertence, let me say, two of them act.  Two of them send down an order to the local official.  The local official does not take it upon himself to refuse to obey the order. He does not take it upon himself to send the order back saying: &ldquo;I will not obey this, because, in my opinion, it is <i>ultra vires.</i>&rdquo;  The Minister might indicate what remedy has the person aggrieved.</P>

      <P>If this amendment is accepted it might cover Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney's objection to Section 14.  I must say that I do not like this section at all.  The section says:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every provision of the Land Purchase Acts whereby a right to require the Lay Commissioners to state a case in respect of a question of law is conferred is hereby repealed, and in lieu <Col N="1128" /> thereof it is hereby enacted as follows, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) whenever a question of law arises in any proceedings under the Land Purchase Acts before the Lay Commissioners, any person aggrieved by the decision of the Lay Commissioners on that question may appeal from such decision to the Appeal Tribunal;</P>
    <P>There is no trouble at all about a question of law.  What I am concerned about is an appeal on the question of fact, because there are cases on record where serious mistakes were made. They were perfectly <i>bona fide.</i>  Cases arise, for example, where one inspector did one part of the thing, and later on a new inspector went out and, not appreciating what had already been arranged, did something contrary to it. Then the two tenants would be vested, and the rights as pointed out by the respective inspectors registered on the folio.  As a result, on the facts, a grievous wrong might be done.  I think it is vital in those cases that there should be an appeal on the question of fact.</P>
    <P>There is one case which covers a lot of those matters&mdash;the case of Chambers and Beatty.  I think it happened about 1910.  It went before the late Mr. Justice J.O. Wylie.  The facts were as follows: The Land Commission got some substantial portion of land in the County of Dublin.  They divided it into two holdings.  One of the holdings abutted on a road and on a canal.  The other holding was inside and was landlocked. Chambers had been allotted the farm of land which abutted on the road.  Beatty had the one that was inside and was landlocked.  The inspector who allocated the land to Beatty told him there was a right of way over Chamber's land.  The inspector who mapped out Chambers's land indicated to him that there was no right of way over his lands.  The two holdings were registered.  Beatty's land was registered with a right of way over Chambers's land, while Chambers's land was registered without any right of way over it.  It was perhaps a small matter which might have been arranged quite easily, but you will meet people who want to assert their rights.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1129" /> I take it, it would not have been a very serious matter for Chambers to give Beatty a right of way over his land, but he would not do so.  The then Judicial Commissioner decided, I think, that Beatty had the right of way.  They went to the Chancery Court and were told there that the only way to assert this right was to start a suit.  A suit was started before the Rolls Court, and the Master of the Rolls ordered that the folios be amended by giving the right of way.  He held that a <i>bona fide</i> mistake had been made.  Chambers then brought the case to the Court of Appeal.  The Court of Appeal reversed that decision, and said that the charges on the folios were binding and that Beatty had no remedy.  The case then went to the House of Lords. It came out in the discussion in the House of Lords that after the then Judicial Commissioner had heard the case he had sent an inspector down to inspect the lands; that the inspector made an affidavit for him, and on the inspector's affidavit made after the hearing before the Judicial Commissioner he then decided the case.  Lord Buckmaster, who presided in the House of Lords, asked Serjeant Sullivan, who was appearing for Beatty: &ldquo;Are you suggesting that the Judicial Commissioner received the affidavit and gave a decision thereon after the case was heard before him?&rdquo; and Serjeant Sullivan replied, &ldquo;Yes, that is what I am suggesting.&rdquo;  Then Lord Buckmaster asked Mr. Jellett, who appeared for the Land Commission, &ldquo;What are you going to do about this?  A mistake has been made.&rdquo;  He asked him if he would pay damages, and Mr. Jellett said that so far as he knew there was not any money to pay damages.  Then Lord Buckmaster said, &ldquo;Very well; I will go to the Treasury myself, and see that the money is provided.&rdquo;  They adjourned the case, and they appointed the late Mr. Denis Henry to act as arbitrator to award the amount of damages, and they agreed upon a sum of £400.</P>

People like that would claim that they have rights and they will insist on standing on their rights.  I say that this Bill is quite arbitrary enough without a thing like that happening.  I am sure that if the Land Commission was given an opportunity they would be quite accommodating in these matters.  The Land Commission will not be considered when you meet with cantankerous people who have rights conferred on them and will not give way.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.

      <P>You have here that, when requested, the lay commissioners shall give the authority on which any decision of theirs is founded and in (b) &ldquo;the lay commissioners may, if and whenever they so think proper, state a case for the decision of the Judicial Commissioner in respect of any question of law arising in any proceedings before them under the Land Purchase Acts.&rdquo;  I think that that covers the legal side of it and that the commissioners have common sense enough to know their job.  What happens is that you have these people bandied from one court to another, and dragged into legal proceedings for the lawyers to fatten on them, while, as I pointed out on the Second Reading, the ordinary people are paying the piper, in the shape of unpaid rates and unpaid annuities.  Unfortunate people living on 20 or 30 acres of land have to pay the annuities and rates due by other people, while the lawyers fatten on proceedings that go on in the courts. That is what is causing the opposition and the amendments to this Bill.  All the goal posts that were put up, and that the lawyers were fattening on, are gone now and they will have no further opportunities in that respect.</P>

I see no justification for it, except the case that the Deputy quoted, and if there was ever a case to show what was going to happen that shows it, as a question about <Col N="1133" /> a right of way would be going from one court to another; until the unfortunate people concerned would not only lose the right of way but everything they had in order to pay the lawyers.</P>

      <P>I strongly object to this section.  It takes away the automatic right of a person who feels himself aggrieved on a question of law to appeal to the tribunal which, after all, is a tribunal of three laymen and one lawyer.  If he thinks there has been a wrong interpretation of the law he may ask the tribunal to state a case, and he may ask the Land Commission to state a case but they may refuse.  His advisers may tell him that he is perfectly right in law but his remedy is nil.  If there is a mistake made in law by the Land Commission, apart from the one right that is now taken away, there is no way in which he can appeal.  It is all very well to say he has an appeal on law, but he cannot appeal on law unless he gets a statement of fact from the Land Commission.  The Court of Appeal cannot understand or decide what the <Col N="1134" /> law is until they know the facts to which the law has to be applied.  Supposing a man wishes to go to the Appeal Tribunal to have a question of law decided he cannot go unless the facts are found for him.  Take a case like this, where an interpretation of that section is wanted, as to whether land has been correctly farmed or not. If correctly farmed it can be taken for the relief of congestion in the immediate neighbourhood by the Land Commission simply saying: &ldquo;We are going to take that.&rdquo; When asked to state the facts, and to say if the land was found to be properly farmed, and if they have found they had power to take it, even though there is no congestion in the immediate neighbourhood, they simply say, &ldquo;We will not tell what our reasons are&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It is perfectly obvious what is in mind, and it is perfectly obvious, even on the uncontradicted evidence that the land has been properly farmed, that there is no way of going to the Appeal Tribunal because there are no facts.  Therefore, for all practical purposes the appeal in law can, in a great number of cases, be made completely useless.  I put that point to the Minister in the previous Land Bill, and I put in an amendment to alter that position, but it was rejected.  I have not put in an amendment to this Bill, but I am going to oppose the entire section, which takes away the one way in which a man can get a question of law determined, whether the Land Commission like it or not.  Whether the Land Commission like to have the law determined by the court or whether they do not, persons who go before the Land Commission ought to have the right to have the law interpreted by a court of justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 11:&mdash;</P>
      <P>At the end of the section, to add a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3) Notwithstanding anything contained in the preceding sub-sections of this section, the Land Commission shall only be exempted from giving the notice required by sub-section (2) of Section 10 of the Land Act, 1931, where the amendment made as contemplated by sub-section (1) of this section is on its face and in fact a correct rendering and interpretation of the order contemplated by the said sub-section (1) hereof.</P>
      <P>The section provides that where the Land Commission propose to make, in a list of vested holdings, an amendment required by an order of the lay commissioners, they need not give the notice required.  If the party concerned has any complaint, he can enter it when the vesting order is being made.  My objection to the section is that when a party is served with a list of vested holdings he accepts that and thinks it is correct. He considers that that list is quite all right and quite in order.  The next thing is that he gets notice of the vesting, and, having assumed originally, when he looked up the list, that everything was all right, he also assumes that everything that happens in between is equally all right, whereas in fact the position may have altered. The whole thing is over and done with before he discovers it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be cases where cantankerous people would object to everything, but I am not concerned <Col N="1137" /> with those.  I am only concerned with the type of case that I have outlined. In that type of case the man would make no mistake on his own, but, having got the list of vested holdings, he would assume that everything was in order, and subsequent to that the commissioners, the tribunal, or a Court of Justice, might after the list and the person concerned has no notice of that.  The list of vested holdings with which he had been served might be changed in the meantime and he would receive no notice of the alteration. He would be in the position of saying to himself &ldquo;I will not have to bother about that, because the list is quite in order.&rdquo; In fact, however, that list that he originally got has been changed, and there is a danger there that an injustice could be done.  I do not suppose that the giving of these notices would be a very difficult matter, and I think it should be done. My view is that, when there is any transaction in connection with land, the parties interested in it should get notice of what is being done.  Of course, I know you will get people who, when they get notices of one kind or another, will object to everything.  Such people exist and, I am afraid, they will always exist, but I am speaking of the perfectly innocent and <i>bona fide</i> people to whom, in my opinion, an injustice could be done in this matter, and I would ask the Minister to consider that point seriously.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this amendment is not necessary.  It is only when an amendment of this list is made by order of the Land Commission that appeals are made to the court, and that is done in public.  It cannot be done to the detriment of a person, as has been suggested by Deputy McMenamin, without his knowledge.  What we want to guard against is that, when the amendment is made, the person concerned, if he has already objected, cannot object again on the new list that is made out. There is reserved to him that final stage before the vesting order is made on which he can object.  Actually he has two points on which he can object, and this will provide him with a third. It will be done as a result of an order <Col N="1138" /> of the Land Commission or of the Appeal Tribunal, and therefore it will be done publicly, and no right of objection is taken from him except an amendment of the list.  There may be some item on the list that may be amended as a result of some of these things that are set out here, but I think there is really nothing in the point made in the Deputy's amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points in connection with Section 20.  One is that it may happen that an allottee who has been in possession for some years may have improved the land although he may be in default in connection with the payment of annuities. As a result of his improvements, he has put some value into the land and probably has improved the place generally.  Is there any provision for affording that person compensation in respect of such improvements as he may have effected, say, by manuring, or otherwise adding to the value of the holding?  The second point has reference to where the Land Commission write off as irrecoverable certain moneys that were due.  Could the Minister tell the House what actually happens in that case?  Does the Land Commission bear the loss or does it fall to the Land Commission to make good, out of the Guarantee Fund, sums <Col N="1139" /> which are due and owing to the Land Commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no statutory provision for giving compensation to defaulters whose holdings are sold, but in certain circumstances the commissioners do give some compensation, but not as a right.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister tell us exactly what is meant here by the phrase: &ldquo;The Land Commission may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, re-sell such holding?&rdquo;  Does that mean, demand a price or get consideration for putting a person in as an allottee?  There is a distinction drawn here.  It says that the Land Commission may re-sell such holding or re-allot such parcel.  Presumably; these are not equivalent terms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <P>There is one point on which I should like some information. What precisely is meant by the word &ldquo;holding&rdquo; in this section? It seems to me that a holding is something which is held by one person from another, and a holding here would probably mean something in which the landlord is the Land Commission and the person in possession is the tenant, and he is paying interest in lieu of rent, or something of that kind.  The words used here are: &ldquo;Where there is any money owing to the Land Commission in respect of such holding or parcel on account of any purchase or other annuity&rdquo;.  How can there be an annuity payable out of a holding?  What precisely is the definition of a holding?  It seems to me that there cannot be an annuity payable out of a holding; it can only be payable out of land which is held in fee simple, and land which is held in fee simple&mdash;that is, registered land&mdash;is not a holding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
