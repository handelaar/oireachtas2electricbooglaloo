      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he is aware that the village of Watergrasshill, County Cork, is dependent on one pump for its water supply, and that during the summer months this supply is completely dried up, thereby causing extreme hardship to the people of the village; that for the past five years the North Cork Board of Health have had under consideration the provision of a water supply to the village, but nothing has been done; that the board of health has already built 12 cottages in a three-acre plot adjacent to this village, and that those cottages have neither water supply nor sanitary facilities; if so, if he will state what steps his Department proposes to take to provide a proper water supply and to end a state of affairs which is a danger to the health of that district.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Dr. Ward)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the necessity for providing an improved water supply for the village of Watergrasshill. My information is that the North Cork Board of Health and Public Assistance have not adopted a scheme recommended by the county medical officer of health and that they favour a source of supply which has not been established to be either reliable in <Col N="188" /> quantity or economical in cost, as compared with the alternative source.  The board were informed in October last and again in the following month that before the source proposed could be further considered, it would be necessary to have gaugings taken over an extended dry period.  Further information in this respect has not been supplied and on the 19th instant an inquiry was addressed to the board as to whether they were in a position to supply particulars of any gaugings since made.</P>

      <P>The five migrants from County Kerry to the Leonard Estate near Batterstown, County Meath, were migrated under the group migration scheme which did not include the provision of dairies, fowl-houses or piggeries.  It is not the practice of the Land Commission to provide such buildings.  The holdings in question, when shown to and accepted by the migrants, were each equipped with a dwellinghouse and one outoffice.  No promise was made to the migrants that the Land Commission would facilitate them in the production or disposal of milk supplies.  A free grant of £20 was sanctioned for each migrant for internal fencing.  £10 of this amount was paid to the migrants in advance, but the balance will not be paid until the Land Commission are satisfied that the fencing for which the grant was sanctioned has been completed.</P>

      <P>Resolution No. 1 will fall to be further discussed on the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill, and it will be, therefore, appropriate to discuss it in lesser detail to-day than otherwise, if that opportunity were not forthcoming.  But there are two points in regard to this Resolution, to which, I think, the attention of the House should be directed, because they are points that seemingly escape the attention of Deputies, who, in regard to other matters seem to be exceedingly well informed.  Many people seem to think that when you increase income-tax by 1/- in a given year, or super-tax by the amount described in a subsequent Resolution, you spare the poorer section of the community from any part of the burden provided by that tax.  I want to remind the House that that is very far from being true, and that this 1/- on income-tax is going to strike far harder at the wage-earning community than it is on anybody else.  The person who is paying this tax, if it hits him really hard, can go and live in the Isle of Man, or somewhere else, such as the Channel Islands, where his income is relieved from tax.  Remember, that it is by no means impossible to the class of persons who are here caught, because the person who is paying this tax is a person who is getting the bulk of his income from investments.  That is the person who is hardest hit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>That is Resolution No. 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There are substantial concessions to the married wage-earner and, in fact, a very considerable number <Col N="194" /> of married wage-earners are not going to experience any substantial increase in their burden at all as a result of this extra 1/- on income-tax.  This 1/- of an increase has been, so to speak, telescoped into a very narrow margin but, on persons in that category, it is going to be immensely heavy.  How is it going to affect the wage-earner?  It will affect him in two ways.  The first I propose to explain by illustration, and the second by personal experience.  Deputies may have recently read that the Duke of Northumberland closed Alnwick, one of the ancestral homes of that family, and he did so because taxation had reached a point which made it impossible for him to maintain all the establishments he has in Great Britain. That meant that possibly hundreds of people living at Alnwick were thrown out of a job.  We all know that no ordinary man requires six or seven houses, that any reasonable man cannot keep more than one, but the rich have indulged themselves with certain luxuries which involved employment for their neighbours, because they were rich and their employees benefited from the employment created.  We all know the situation which exists at Cong.  There you had a great landowner recently closing up the place and throwing 200 people out of employment. That has nothing to do with this Resolution.  Other things contributed to that.  These big individual cases catch the public eye.  We can appreciate that, while we have very few people with great fortunes, they can close big establishments and make radical economies, and the resulting sensation attracts the eyes of all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are hundreds of people who will be hit by this tax, who have seven employees, but who could do with five, but they never bothered to throw two men out of a job, whose wages, perhaps, came to no more than £4 a week between them, but they are now notified that on their income is going to be placed a burden by this Resolution of from £1 to £500, and they are going to cast about to see where economies could be made to meet that added burden.  That is <Col N="195" /> going to result in a number of people being thrown out of work and, in most cases persons who will find it difficult to get employment elsewhere.  These people are of the retainer type, with no special skill, who were kept by well-off people because their employers did not want to put them on the dole, and they will now have difficulties when looking for work.  The result of this imposition of 1/- on income-tax, is that it is going to mete out substantial suffering, not for the person who can economise to meet the tax, but for the person at whose expense the economy is made in order that the tax can be paid.  In short, we are taking from the worker who is dismissed the money that we are giving to the Minister who levies the tax, and those who imagine that this tax is going to fall exclusively on the rich, should open their eyes to the fact, that what we are, in fact, doing is sequestering the wages of certain men now getting wages, and paying them to the Minister for Finance who is using them for such purposes as were outlined in the Estimates which this House has passed.  That is one thing I would like the House to remember.</P>
    <P>The second is that there is no shopkeeper in Ireland but knows that the result of the extra 1/- on income-tax is going to be that certain persons are going to buy less in the coming year than they did the year before. We know that anyone who has to pay an additional tax, or to meet additional expenses can do without a suit that he would otherwise buy, or can make last year's overcoat do for a year longer.  The net result in the case of the average shopkeeper is that inevitably he is going to cast about for economies, and the readiest economy that can be made is to reduce his staff. Any man in business will tell you that that is so.  If he has to pay additional taxation and if, as a result of the taxation of his customers and his business, the turnover is reduced, and he finds himself with a staff larger than he requires, his natural inclination is to bring his staff down to the level of the minimum requirements of his business, and that means further <Col N="196" /> unemployment.  Those are facts that Deputies should keep in mind when they imagine that no one is being hit but the rich man when income-tax is raised.  It is true that you may increase employment in the Civil Service by employing additional civil servants, but the measure of employment you are going to create in the Civil Service, numerically, does not compare with the number of persons who will be thrown out of work as a result of the tax.  That fact, I believe, is absent from the minds of Deputies.  It is almost impossible to prove because the unemployment here created is not consciously or deliberately created as a result of the tariffs, but a series of events is put in motion which, in the experience of those who are in business, or who are employers, ends in certain individuals losing their employment who can ill afford to do so. I believe it would be of assistance if the Minister could now say that he regarded this burden of taxes as quite unthinkable for any protracted period, and that he had reason to look forward to its reduction next year.  In the absence of that, the House should know that they are striking, not at the rich, but at the most vulnerable wage-earners in the increased rate of income-tax proposed by this Resolution.</P>

      <P>This additional 1/- on income tax is the real red light of danger in the economic situation here.  The Minister comes before the House and imposes another 1/- income tax for the reason that there is not another source of taxation he can think of, until he gets his Valuation Bill through the House.  Local authorities cannot stand the pushing over on their shoulders of taxation that should be shouldered by the Exchequer, but it has become the policy of the Government to shove taxation on to the backs of the local authorities, just as it has become their policy to shed taxation in support of wheat, butter and bacon into obscure balance sheets of one kind or another throughout the country. This is the red light and it is burning here with a very dangerous brilliancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon has pointed out one objectionable aspect of this increased <Col N="197" /> income tax, but there is another.  The suggestion is that, as a result of this increased income tax, many of the people earning more modest incomes will not have to pay much more because they will not have anything on which to pay.  They will, in fact, pay less under a régime which has a 5/6 rate of income-tax than they would pay under a régime with a 4/6 rate. The Minister for Industry and Commerce has recently published figures showing the position with regard to industrial production in 1937.  Additional persons to the number of 7,324 were put into occupation, and a net increase of 7,315 persons were put into occupation by Government departments and local authorities, including work on relief and constructional work carried out by the Government or local authorities, so that a net increase of nine persons in 1937 found employment over the whole gamut of our industrial production as compared with 1936. The year 1938 has passed since, and if the Minister knows anything about 1938, he must realise that industrial firms in this country during that year found much greater difficulties in carrying on than in 1937.  The British <i>Board of Trade Journal</i> the other day contained the statement that, in the first three months of this year, 13,600 persons left this country by sea to take up permanent residence in Great Britain.  That figure does not include the people who crossed the Border. The Minister for Industry and Commerce, in his publications on the Census, estimates that for every four people who cross the sea from this country to Great Britain, one crosses over the Border.  In the case of Dublin City in the last two years, half the increase was in the last year, and persons to the number of 4,900 odd have been forced to seek unemployment assistance so that they can get some kind of subsistence in the country.</P>
    <P>These are some of the indices of the financial condition of industry and business during the year 1938 which the Minister for Finance now expects to bear another 1/- in income-tax. There are many people who paid income-tax last year who will not pay <Col N="198" /> it this year because that additional burden of 1/- is put on the firms which gave them their employment. The Minister knows very well that you cannot increase income-tax substantially and leave it on the backs of the big people who pay income-tax.  It inevitably slips back on to the people who have to buy the commodities to keep their households and their families going.  The Minister need not be told that by us.  He is in much closer association with his Parliamentary Secretary than we are, and his Parliamentary Secretary, only two years after the Minister had added his three 6d.s to the income-tax, thought it better to inform the House that these taxes could not be kept off the working man and that they found their way down on top of the working man, so that not only are you going to have the position which Deputy Dillon describes, but you are going to have the position which I describe and you are going to get less income-tax from the people with the more moderate incomes under this increase of 1/- than you would get without it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon asked the Minister if he would promise that this would not continue next year.  It does not matter whether it continues next year.  If there was any hope in the Minister's mind that it would be possible to reduce income-tax next year, he would not have raised it by 1/- this year; but if the Minister thinks he can put an extra 1/- on income-tax this year and take it off next year, and get the income which might normally be expected from a reduced income-tax, he is making a mistake, because the 1/- on income-tax this year is going to damage the very source from which any income-tax would come.  Deputy Cosgrave has already pointed out that although the Minister put 1/6 on income-tax in 1932, he never got as much super-tax as he got in the year before the 1/6 was put on.  Repeatedly, it has been pointed out that 6d. on income-tax at that time should bring in an additional £500,000.  What did happen?  In the year 1932, super-tax brought in £789,000 and income-tax, £3,820,000.  The extra 1/6 was then put <Col N="199" /> on.  We will skip the next year, when the Minister perhaps did not get the full value of his 1/6 increase.  In 1934, super-tax brought in £635,000&mdash;a decrease of £154,000&mdash;and income-tax, an extra 6d. on which should have brought in an additional £500,000, brought in an additional £878,000, when increased by three 6d.s.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to repeat the amount which he stated he expected to get this year from the increase of 1/- and the amount which he stated he expected to get in a full year.  The Minister must know, unless he is completely blind, the condition of affairs in the country, the difficulties under which industry is suffering and the precarious nature of a large amount of the employment at present afforded.  He must know that he is not going to get from this tax this year the amount which he says he expects to get from it.  Yesterday we heard that £880,000 was received into Treasury last year as a tax on sugar. The amount of customs duty received on sugar had&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No, it is not.  I am telling the Minister he cannot reasonably expect to get the amount of money from the 1/- increase that he states to the House he expects to get. I want to know what windfalls he hopes for or what great expectancy he has of receipts from customs duty on such commodities as sugar to get him out of the very serious financial dilemma into which the Budget, as presented in its present form, is inevitably getting him and the country.  An additional £500,000 was collected in taxes last year as a result of the decline in beet production and in the production of sugar derived from that beet.  The general position of the country is serious enough to necessitate frankness here, and the main thing that is driven home, to my mind, by this increase of 1/- in the income tax is that the Minister is not prepared to be frank.  The Minister is <Col N="200" /> facing the present financial year hoping that something may turn up. He puts a tax on the only other thing on which a tax can be imposed after the financial operations of the Government for the last seven years.  It is simply put there because it has to be put some place.  The statement has to be made that the revenue must be increased by a certain figure, and the easiest thing to do is to put 1/- increase on income tax.  That 1/- is going to have the effect which Deputy Dillon mentioned, not alone on people of greater means.  It is going to have an effect also on the people of lesser means, and I warn the Minister it is going to have an effect, thirdly, on people who are dependent for their employment on those who will have to pay that tax directly.</P>

      <P>The result of this Resolution is that it effects a reduction in the personal allowance of a married man from £225 to £220, and in the case of a single man from £125 to £120. It is a complementary part of the Budget proposal.  The Deputy will remember that when I announced this reduction in personal allowances, I stated at the same time that I proposed to increase the allowance in respect of earned income from one-sixth to one-fifth, subject to a maximum allowance of £300.  It is not necessary to have a Resolution to give <Col N="202" /> effect to that, as it represents a mitigation of the tax imposed on the taxpayer. It is necessary, however, to bring forward this Resolution to reduce the personal allowance to the extent which I have mentioned&mdash;£5. The proposed additional burden is mitigated by the increase in the allowance in respect of earned income.  It is necessary, as I say to have this Resolution as it is a complementary part of the whole scheme.</P>

      <P>The reduction in the personal allowance applies to all taxpayers, but in the case of those whose income is mainly earned, the other part of the proposal will represent a relief to them.  I shall give one case since the Deputy has asked for it.  Take the case of a single man having an income of £150, all earned.  Under the pre-Budget arrangement, his earned income allowance was calculated as one-sixth of the total amount of his income, £25.  In addition he had a personal allowance of £125, bringing his total allowance up to £150, so that he would pay nothing.  His position will remain unchanged under the present proposal because while his personal allowance is reduced by £5, namely, to £120, his earned income relief will be increased from one-sixth to one-fifth, or £30.  He will be in the same position as at present, since his total allowances will amount to £150.  In the case of a married man having an income of £270, all earned, and having no children, his allowances prior to the introduction of the Budget would be as follows: He would have an earned income allowance <Col N="203" /> of one-sixth, namely, £45, and a personal allowance of £225, leaving his income of £270 tax free.  Take again the case of a married man with no children, and having an income of £275, all earned.  Under the present proposals, his earned income relief would be one-fifth of his income, or £55.  His personal allowance would be reduced from £225 to £220, leaving his total allowance £275, so that he would be better off under our proposed scheme than he would be last year, to the extent of the tax on£5.</P>

      <P>There is a question I should like to ask the Minister.  There has been a number of cases down the country in recent years where you had small businessmen who operated small shops and who, because they had certain difficulty in keeping their accounts and so forth, converted their shops into limited liability companies, and then continued in much the same position themselves but proceeded to draw interest on the shares they held in the company.  I presume the Minister sees the point.  They now, I take it, are in receipt of an income that is not an earned income whereas, prior to converting the business into a limited liability company, the income received from carrying on their little businesses, I take it, was regarded as earned income in the ordinary course of their business.  Is it intended that they should occupy an inferior advantage in the eyes of the law?  I think that this comes strictly within this particular Resolution, which has to do with the distinction between earned and unearned income.  Is it intended that as a result of their improving their accounting system they are to be put in an inferior position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the income-tax law to that in which they were before they constituted themselves a limited liability company, or is their only resort the fraudulent practice of paying themselves, by way of salary, the entire profits of the company every year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, Sir, this is a duty which it is proposed to impose upon bicycles.  As to the propriety of imposing a duty on bicycles at all, I think there could be very considerable argument, particularly when it is proposed to impose the duty without any statement from the Minister for Industry and Commerce as to what, according to his expert information, the resultant increased cost of bicycles to the consumer is going to be.  All of us are well aware that the bicycle is the wage earner's motor-car.  We can see hundreds of them, thousands of them, in our cities every day carrying the wage earner to his work and back, and we all know that in rural Ireland the average working fellow travels between his place of residence and his job on a bicycle.  Whether you ought to impose a tax upon that, in my judgment, is very doubtful.  I do not think you should.  However, to-day I do not propose to open a general discussion of the desirability of taxing commodities of this kind.  I want, <Col N="205" /> rather, to confine my inquiry to a particular case which I know has been brought before the attention of the Minister for Industry and Commerce. The Minister for Industry and Commerce asked that towns which particularly desired the establishment of some industry within them should approach him with a plan, and said that there was no use in coming to him with vague suggestions that something ought to be done; that he wanted them to come forward with a plan as to what was to be done and also a plan for the financing of the proposed undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the town of Clones, in County Monaghan, was getting along very well.  It is very peculiarly situated, because it is on a promontory projecting into the territory of Northern Ireland, with the result that it has the Border on three sides of it.  The original institution of the Border injured Clones, but it was not until the frantic tariff policy of the Fianna Fáil Government was embarked upon that Clones was really struck a deadly blow by the Border.  That was bad enough.  Its business was immensely injured, a great deal of its trade went to the towns on the northern side of the Border, and the consequent unemployment was very serious.  Clones, however, had the advantage that it was a great pork market, and that provided a great deal of direct employment for the people of the town.  It also served to bring an immense number of people into the town because the pork market there was a notoriously good one and there was always a ready clearance of all the pork that was offered and as much competition as was ever to be found in a Northern Ireland market.  Hit by the institution of the Border originally, Clones then woke up one day to find that the Minister for Agriculture had prohibited the pork market&mdash;simply like that&mdash;had forbidden the holding of it, whereupon everybody employed in it was thrown out of the job, and, besides that, the result was that there was no reason for people to come into the town at all.  You could buy Indian meal at 2/6 cheaper, and clothes and other commodities from 10 per cent. <Col N="206" /> to 30 per cent. cheaper, within half a mile of Clones town than in the town of Clones itself.</P>

That is a very creditable record, and that £10,000 of local money was raised because they wanted to provide employment for those whom the Executive Council had thrown out of employment.  They came to Dublin with a scheme for the manufacture of bicycles, with a continental bicycle manufacturer who was prepared to sponsor the scheme, and with a body of Irish capital sufficient to finance it and also with an undertaking that he was experienced in the production of cheap bicycles on the Continent <Col N="207" /> and was prepared, with his Irish colleagues, to produce them in Clones if the Minister would provide the requisite facilities.</P>

      <P>I am keeping my eye on bicycles and nothing but bicycles. Here was a town in which the people came forward with their own money and with their plan and who were prepared to hire a firm of costing accountants to produce costings of bicycles in order to enable the Minister for Finance to adjust the tariff to a figure <Col N="208" /> that would give them no more than a modest margin of protection.  That plan having been outlined and the circumstances being well-known to the Government, as well as the peculiar emergency existing in Clones, a tariff is here imposed.  By this imposition without any reference to the scheme laid before the Government, it becomes abundantly clear that a firm is to be brought in and established in Dublin or some other urban centre for the manufacture of bicycles to the destruction of the plan adumbrated for the establishment of this industry in an area in which there is at present a grave emergency not created by local causes but created in all its details by the policy of the Government.</P>

      <P>The people of Clones are entitled to ask to be restored to the <i>status quo ante.</i>  The Government should, in the circumstances, come to their aid on the same lines as the British Government came to the aid of the distressed areas in Great Britain. If this area is to be turned into a distressed area by the Government, the people should get at least as much consideration from the Government as the distressed areas in Great Britain got from the British Government.  I do not want to be unreasonable.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce or the Minister for Finance may say: &ldquo;Very well, there were overriding reasons of a grave nature which made it impossible to locate that particular <Col N="209" /> industry in Clones, although we propose to locate it somewhere else.&rdquo; All I ask them to do is to say: &ldquo;In as much as these people put up the money and prepared a scheme in order to co-operate with the policy of the Government, we are prepared to give them the undertaking now that, as we have failed to meet what was a highly constructive effort to meet us, we will undertake, in the course of a reason able time, to locate some kind of permanent employment scheme in the Clones area which will absorb the unemployed which we have prevented local people from absorbing by their scheme.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I do not believe that any officer of my Department would be <Col N="210" /> guilty of so grossly misleading Deputy Dillon, as, apparently, he has been misled.  The idea of manufacturing bicycle parts has been in our minds since we first commenced our programme of industrial development.  It was an obvious thing to consider. Bicycle parts had been manufactured here before and, clearly, could be manufactured here again.  There was a substantial market for bicycles in the country&mdash;sufficient to ensure economic production.  There seems to be no technical or other reason why factories should not be established here for that purpose which would be completely successful.  We have been a long time trying to promote plans for that purpose. We started by imposing duties upon assembled bicycles in order to procure for our people, at least, the employment which can be given by the assembling of bicycles.  In fact, no assembled bicycles are being imported at present.  They are all imported in parts which are assembled by various firms.</P>
      <P>As the second stage, we desired to get the parts made here and that is the main idea behind the duty imposed by this Resolution&mdash;to get these parts made here.  Naturally enough, we took steps to ensure that somebody would be interested in the manufacture of these parts before a duty was imposed. We have had negotiations, stretching over five or six years, with a number of firms.  They put up proposals of one kind or another for this purpose.  We never until now got into a position in which we were satisfied that the imposition of a duty would be followed by the establishment of the industry. May I say that it is true that we got from the Clones Industrial Development Committee proposals for the manufacture of bicycle parts there, but it is an exaggeration to say that we got a scheme for that purpose.  We never got a scheme for that purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If I am to be allowed to speak without further interruption, I shall continue.  We got from the Clones Industrial Development Committee a proposal that there should be established at Clones a factory for the manufacture of bicycle parts.  We never got a scheme&mdash;that is, in the sense in which I used that term.  We never got detailed plans for that purpose. We knew that they were in touch with a Continental firm of manufacturers in order to secure the technical assistance that would be required for the purpose.  We knew that they were relying on the Industrial Credit Company, or some other financial group, to provide the finance, but an essential part of the scheme was the prohibition by legislation of anybody else engaging in the same business in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that this is an industry which should be established upon a monopoly basis.  I think that there should be room for more than one concern in the manufacture of these parts and that we should not confine the industry to any one concern.  In so far as the Clones Industrial Development Committee are concerned, they are now free to proceed with their scheme. The imposition of this tariff will enable them to proceed with their scheme, subject to their being able to finance it and to their willingness to engage in the manufacture of bicycle parts in competition with other firms or, at least, to face the possibility of other firms engaging in the same business. They will get the same facilities, the same assistance and the same encouragement from me and my Department as any other firm will get.  I shall give Deputy Dillon and the Clones Industrial Development Committee this assurance&mdash;that no British firm will be enabled to engage in the business, that no licence under the Control of Manufactures Act will be issued for this industry, and that only firms qualified as Irish firms, in accordance with the Control of Manufactures Act, will be allowed to manufacture these goods here.  I can, however, tell the Clones Industrial Development Committee that I know they will not be the only <Col N="212" /> persons engaging in the business.  We have received a large number of proposals from different committees in different parts of the country, from different groups of individuals and companies to enter into this business.  We are proposing to say to any one of them, &ldquo;You can go ahead.&rdquo;  It is within our knowledge that certain people will certainly do so.  Study of the list of new companies registered in the trade in the Official Journal, or wherever that information is published, will give the same information to anybody.  Companies have been established and registered, for the purpose of manufacturing these goods. They are free to do so.  We are imposing a duty upon those parts that we want manufactured here.  There is a licensing clause attached.  Our intention is to issue licences for the free importation of these goods until somebody is manufacturing them here upon terms and conditions in the quantity and of a quality and price which we approve.  When that situation has been reached the licences will be withdrawn, subject to a further condition.  There are, as I have said, a number of firms engaged in the assembling of bicycles. It is our intention that the position of those firms will not be disturbed, that these firms will get the parts which they now import from manufacturers of those parts in the country on the same conditions that they are now getting them.  If, in fact, no matter how many people may engage in the manufacture of parts, we find that any of the assembling firms are unable to secure supplies of the particular parts they want on the usual terms and conditions the licence for the importation of those parts will continue to be issued.</P>
    <P>This will be an industry of some importance.  We expect that some 300 or 400 workers will be employed in it and we think that is a useful development to promote.</P>
    <P>We are proposing, now that the duty has been imposed, to notify all the firms and individuals that have been interested in the matter of our intention, of their liberty to proceed with <Col N="213" /> their plans, and of our willingness to assist them if they do.  But, we are not going to give any one firm a monopoly.  That may mean&mdash;I think it will mean&mdash;that some of the projects that have been submitted to us will not be proceeded with because they were based on the idea that there should be only one production centre, one firm, engaged in the business.  I think the Clones plan involved a monopoly and I think it will probably be abandoned if a monopoly is not possible. A monopoly is not possible and, in these circumstances, it may be that that particular endeavour of the Clones Industrial Development Committee will come to nothing.  If they are willing to proceed on the basis of manufacturing there in competition with any other manufacturing firm that may go into the same business they will be treated by my Department in precisely the same manner as any other firm.  I am at least equally anxious, if not more anxious than Deputy Dillon to assist in the promotion of some industrial activity at Clones.  Time and again I have sent to that town intending industrialists who had approached my Department with projects of which we were prepared to approve.  I asked them to go, in the first instance, to Clones to see if conditions there would be suitable to their enterprise.  Only in the last few days I did the same thing again. Possibly, at some stage, some of these efforts of mine will be successful but there is no good blinking the fact that it is extremely difficult to get industrialists, who are not tied to Clones by sympathetic considerations or by any need of getting capital in that locality, to go to such a town as that.  It is far away from the main centres of consumption and not suitably located for the purpose of distribution.  Nevertheless, there are certain forms of industrial activity which could be usefully carried on there and perhaps in the end we will succeed in getting some of them started.</P>
    <P>If the persons concerned with this cycle manufacturing project for Clones are satisfied that they can do as well there as some other firm can do anywhere else, they are free to go ahead. <Col N="214" /> If they make their project successful there will be no one better pleased than I.  I should say to them, however, that it is not probable they will succeed in getting financial assistance from persons outside those immediately associated with the enterprise. I think they would have some difficulty in that but, if they have not, I will be pleased.  That is all I have to say on the matter.</P>
    <P>Upon the general proposal here I think there can be no question.  We are imposing this duty merely as an indication of our willingness to assist in this manner the establishment of the industry here.  We are notifying the parties who have an interest in the matter, who are engaged in the manufacture of these goods.  We are telling them that as soon as they do manufacture these goods in the quantities and variety of makes and at prices which we regard as reasonable the licences will be withdrawn and the protection given by the Resolution will become effective.  There is one thing we are making clear to them, that is, whatever facilities or assistance any one of them will get will be equally available to any other Irish firm engaged in the same enterprise.</P>

The position at the present time is that, in spite of enormous expenditure in various directions by the Government, on relief works, unemployment assistance, housing subsidies and everything else like that, the figures for October last indicate that there was one person less employed in the manufacture of tobacco than there were before the Fianna Fáil Government took over the country to develop it along their lines.</P>

      <P>The Minister uses the word &ldquo;guest house&rdquo; in this section.  Am I right in supposing that guest house is a lower grade hotel? That is not how the word is used in the English language.  In German, the word used is equivalent to the old name of hotel, very often.  In England, and I think possibly in the United States&mdash;after all that is where the term is rather familiar&mdash;the term &ldquo;guest house&rdquo; is very often used for a private and rather high-class hotel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>By &ldquo;low-grade&rdquo; I mean it does not fulfil all the conditions which would allow it to be registered as an hotel.  I take that as being the meaning, and that in fact a man will if he can try to get it registered as an hotel, because it is a more pretentious thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>And if he is prepared to carry on a hotel business.  I can imagine, for example, that a hotel must be prepared to supply a hot meal at any time&mdash;I am merely giving this as an illustration&mdash;whereas the proprietor of a guest house may not be prepared to do so.  He is prepared to take in guests for a week or three or four days, and cater for them during that period, but he is not prepared to deal with casual callers and give them meals or give them a bed for the night.  Those may not be the regulations, but I am giving it as an illustration of what is in my mind when I try to distinguish between a hotel and a guest house.  The regulations may be of that character; they may impose certain conditions which an individual running a place described as a hotel now would regard as too onerous, and involving a different type of business, in which case he would seek registration as a guest house.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>If he is up to a certain standard he will try to get registered as a hotel.  I think, in fact <Col N="221" />&mdash;especially if they are called private guest houses&mdash;the term is used in England for a rather exclusive type of hotel, where there is a certain choice of the people who utilise them.  For instance, a hotel, if it has a room, cannot refuse it to a guest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>But a guest house can.  It has a certain selection of clientele.  I think there is that use of the words in countries which you may be anxious to cater for, and I should like to point out to the Minister that there is a certain danger of misleading that type of guest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as hotels are concerned, there will be registration of hotels, and then there will be grading. The hotels will be graded according to the accommodation they have to offer.  The lower grade hotel will, nevertheless, be a hotel.  The regulations which will apply to guest houses will be different.  They will involve different obligations upon the owners.  It may be, perhaps, that they will not involve an obligation to provide accommodation for the night for a casual visitor, or an obligation to serve meals at any time that guests may arrive and seek them, or something else of that kind. A hotel will be subject to those conditions, and must fulfil them, but the proprietor of a guest house need not do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In connection with that matter of the grading of hotels, there are guest houses which have their own clientele and charge certain prices. In the absence of a better term, I might say they are &ldquo;exclusive&rdquo; in a certain respect.  If, in the grading which is proposed to be adopted here, they get a lower standard than they occupy at the present time in the minds of the people who patronise them, it may interfere with the particular class of client they get, and might diminish their business.  Is there any prospect of having such a type of grading as will not degrade that type of establishment <Col N="223" /> from the position it occupies at the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not intended that it should be a lower grade&mdash;it will be a different business&mdash;any more than it would be correct to say that to register a premises as a holiday camp is to degrade it.  You are merely saying it is a holiday camp; it is not a guest house and it is not a hotel.  The same distinction applies as between guest houses and hotels.  A premises is registered as a guest house; that means it is a guest house and not a hotel.  It would be incorrect and improper for the proprietor to describe it as a hotel if in fact it is not, and if he is not prepared to undertake the obligations and conform to the regulations which apply to hotels.  It is not a lower standard; it is a different standard.  Some of the houses on the guest house register may be the most expensive places in the country to live in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point to which I want to direct the Minister's attention.  In the matter of grading, will care be taken to ensure that the standard of those places will not be interfered with?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The grading will be done within the class.  There will be grades of hotels.  They will be all registered as hotels, but they will be graded according to certain standards. The grading will take place within that class.  There may be grades of guest houses, but they will be all guest houses on the register.  Between guest houses and hotels the announcement will merely be that a different type of business is being carried on in those premises; that what goes on in the guest house is not a hotel business; that it is a different type of business&mdash; a business which does not cater for the public in the same manner as hotels.</P>

      <P>I quite understand the Minister's distinction, but is there not this danger, from the purely practical point of view?  You have particular things called hotels. Sometimes they are graded as &ldquo;De Luxe&rdquo;; sometimes they are graded &ldquo;A&rdquo;, &ldquo;B&rdquo;, &ldquo;C&rdquo;, and so on.  The same thing may be done with the guest houses.  Is there not a danger that you will create the impression that, on the whole, the guest houses are little places which take in a few lodgers?</P>

      <P>That is not meant, but when you get your register you have in one place &ldquo;hotels&rdquo;, and in another place you have &ldquo;guest houses&rdquo;.  In fact, most of the guest houses may be and probably will be of the type referred to by the Minister, but, although they may be of a more exclusive and higher grade than any hotel you have, is there not a danger that they will be brought down in the minds of the people who see that register?</P>

      <P>There will be on the register some intimation as to what different regulations apply in respect of guest houses, an intimation that you cannot just walk in and ask for a room for the night, but that accommodation must be booked in advance and the proprietor would be at liberty to refuse to accept you as a client.  There will also appear on the register the charges for accommodation and these charges may show that a particular guest house is of a very high standard or is a very expensive place to live in.</P>

The proprietors get in touch with London and American guests for that particular place. They do not advertise that they are open to all, but restrict themselves to particular tourists.  It is desirable to have a number of those places here.</P>

I do not know how their prices will be distinguished from the others.  It is the name, the group, under which different types of premises will be registered, that will matter.  If I took this Bill in the ordinary way&mdash;and I presume that the board will largely follow on those lines&mdash;I would have got the impression that in a town like say Killarney there were a number of guest houses taking three or four people, giving them bed and breakfast and possibly a chop in the evening. I would get that impression, and such impressions may pull down their reputation.</P>

Do I understand from this Bill that it will be in the absolute power of this board to abrogate that and say they will refuse to register those premises as a hotel, though they may register them as a guest house?  I rather visualise a conflict there, between the board and the owner of the premises.  Already, by statute, his premises have been legally defined and licensed as a hotel. Assume the board goes along and says these premises are not suitable; that they may do as a guest house or something like that, but do not come up to the standard required for a hotel.  I can visualise a conflict arising there, where a man could take mandamus proceedings against the board to compel them to register his premises as a hotel.

It is not for the board to interpret this. It is for the House to know what it is passing.</P>

      <P>As to the other matter, are we not in this Bill defining as little as possible?  The Bill would have been much simpler if it was stated: &ldquo;We are setting up a board, we will provide so much money and we will let them manage the thing altogether.&rdquo;  To a large extent, when any controversial point turns up, that is what we are doing.  But the Minister says: &ldquo;That might be a little bit too thick; we might not get that through the Dáil.  We will have to pretend to have a Bill, but any point of importance we shall have we will leave that to the board.&rdquo;  Is not that what it really means?  Is not that really the purpose of the Minister?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there not a likelihood, without some sort of association between these bodies and the board, that there might be a conflict between them at some time?  The Minister has experience of local authorities which have much the same boundary, portion of one and portion of another, and he knows the disposition that there has been occasionally on the part of these bodies to have disputes.  Here we have much the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="232" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>You may have much the same thing, because these bodies have already been in this business and they are doing useful work which is of benefit to the country.  Wherever their signs appear, however much we may disagree with them in particular cases, they attract their members.  They have been of value to this country and have been worth thousands of pounds in the way of advertisement.  It appears to me that there might be some closer association between them and the board, something at any rate different from what we might call the malevolent neutrality which is likely to develop between them.  If you have a board set up consisting of people who have never had anything to do with this business before, they may have the attributes of an all-powerful institution. We know that those who are unaccustomed to the exercise of authority are inclined to abuse it.  It would appear to be desirable that some effort should be made in the Bill itself to promote harmonious co-operation with these bodies.  If the work these bodies have done in the past has been of benefit to the country, every effort should be made to maintain that helpful attitude of theirs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that so long as these bodies are prepared to work in accordance with principles which the board approve of, these harmonious relations will exist.  But we cannot say that any one of these bodies is not at some time going to adopt practices which we could not approve of, such as selling signs for money without any investigation or supervision of the standard of accommodation of the hotel, or in some way abuse the position, which would necessitate the board interfering.  Here we are only dealing with the question of publication of grading or designation by these organisations, and I say that there is nothing to prevent that.  The putting up of signs is another matter, and what the Bill provides is that these signs may not be erected without the consent of the board.  That is something <Col N="233" /> that we should maintain.  But that is a different matter.  So far as what is at issue here is concerned, if a cycling or motoring or hikers' organisation want to publish a handbook and say, here is a list of hotels for motorists or cyclists or fishermen, or some other particular class of persons, they can do so, and they can grade the hotels in a different way from the official grading, having regard to the special facilities they may require for their members.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one observation of the Minister which, I think, on reflection he will probably modify to some extent.  He says that he couldn't say that one of these associations might not at some time sell signs.  It is very unlikely that a body of this sort would do any such thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of grading, can we have any indication as to what the grading will mean?  One takes up a confidential handbook, some of them published under the official aegis of a Government and some under the aegis of some association corresponding with the tourist association here.  Then there are guide books to the hotels. Very elaborate guide books are published in Italy.  Sometimes hotels seem to be graded according to their size, sometimes on other considerations altogether.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, does it mean value for money or excellency, apart from value or size altogether. One may find a hotel that charges a certain amount and for that amount may give much better value than a hotel that charges a great deal more. On what basis does the Minister expect the grading to take place?  Will it be size, value for money, absolute comfort or the quality of the food?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should imagine that the grading would be done according to the clientele for which the hotel caters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister means that the grading will be given to the hotel not by its high standard but only by the charges the hotel makes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The board will have the job of seeing that the hotels are giving value for the money they charge.  If a hotel proposes to charge 25/- a day, the board may say &ldquo;we do not think that the hotel is giving value for the money and we are not prepared to register you.&rdquo;  The purpose of the board is not to refuse classification but to bring the hotels up to a high standard.  It is like first, second or third class on the railways.  I travel third class because the accommodation which is offered me on the railway, having regard to the fare charged, is what suits me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not met my point.  Suppose the board says &ldquo;the hotel is not value for a certain charge&mdash;we will grade you not grade A but grade B or C&rdquo;, am I to take it that that hotel will be graded A without any change in the hotel except the change in the prices charged?  The hotel charges, say, two guineas a day; the board says &ldquo;it is not worth two guineas a day; we will therefore grade you C&rdquo;.  Is that clear?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good. That hotel them says it is going to give the same accommodation, the same quality of meals, cleanliness and everything else and it is to charge only one <Col N="235" /> guinea a day.  Is it possible under the circumstances that it would be graded A?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The board will make the regulations.  It is to see that the hotels of the first grade must have accommodation for visitors up to the standard set.  The hotels which do not conform to the standard would not get into that grade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a point I want to raise:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2) of the section it is provided that when the premises have been graded &ldquo;the board may at any time, if it so thinks proper, withdraw the grade then allotted to any of such premises and allot a different grade thereto.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is a very wide discretion.  I suggest to the Minister that the words &ldquo;for reasons stated&rdquo; might be inserted.  This may not be the subject of litigation, but the reasons ought to be stated.  There is no reason if a hotel is brought down to grade B or C that the reasons should not be given. Though that should not be the subject of litigation, at any rate the man is entitled to know what the cause of his degradation is, if there be discretion <Col N="236" /> in the power of the board to bring it about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

      <P>Do I understand that the Minister's attitude is this:&mdash;that when it comes to a question of registration the board must have some evidence to go on, such evidence as it gets from its inspectors?  Do I understand that in that particular case the Minister was quite willing to allow further investigations by a senior inspector or a member of the board but when it comes to the question of grading the board should not have any evidence of its inspectors or anybody else, that it may act purely out of the blue?  I presume the board will act on evidence.  It will act on evidence.  It will act on the evidence of its inspectors. Is it not only just&mdash;and justice is as strong in this case as in any other case&mdash;that the person who is being degraded will have an opportunity for an inspection of his premises?</P>

      <P>That is so, but this is a different matter.  The person applies for registration and for re-registration. When he is getting registered, the board of its own initiative grades the hotel.  It does that according to its own policy, its own standards, and generally to raise the level or standard of accommodation so as to ensure better accommodation for tourists.  There is no question of anybody applying for a change from one grade to another.  The board will determine to what grade he belongs.</P>

      <P>I put down an amendment jointly with Deputy O'Sullivan in order to ensure that if an error was made a remedy would be available.  I understood the Minister to say that there would be the same machinery.  It would be a different thing, of course, but the same principle is involved.  In the case of re-registration the matter will not be so serious.  The main questions will <Col N="239" /> arise at the first registration, and it is there mistakes of judgment might be made.  When you get the first registration over, your problem is solved. Some may fall by the roadside, but in the main your difficulty will occur with the original grading.  That was the purpose here in the case of the machinery I was endeavouring to carry through with regard to the registration provisions.  I think the Minister could not defend it with regard to registration, and the same thing applies to the grading.  There is no answer to it.</P>
      <P>I should like to say one last word with regard to the section.  I do not want this Bill to go through without drawing attention to the fact that if a man is licensed, if his premises are licensed as an hotel, under another statute or a code of statutes, he hangs out a sign or paints on the hotel wall the word &ldquo;hotel,&rdquo; or any other words indicating that the place is an hotel, having been empowered to do that by the law.  I would like to know from the Minister where in this Bill he purports to repeal the licensing code. I think the appeal machinery must come in here.  It is only a question of a senior inspector or a member of the board.  If it is justified in the other case, it is justified there.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), line 15, to delete the words &ldquo;any person employed in,&rdquo; and substitute therefor the words &ldquo;the person for the time being in charge of&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In my opinion it is not just to this House to give such power as is provided here to an employee.  Some subordinate employee who, perhaps, is hostile to his employer, and wished to injure him, might be in a position to give information which might be entirely wrong, but which would be detrimental to the premises.  That might be done absolutely <i>malafide.</i> Information of this kind should not be given except by some one in authority, a manager, sub-manager, a head waiter or some one occupying a senior position in a hotel.  I think the proposal goes too far.  If a hotel was owned by a company, and staffed entirely by employees, the manager, assistant manager or manageress should be the person to supply the information.</P>

There can be no reason why an inspector should depart from the practice of seeking information from an employee, other than the manager, except there was some suggestion that there was a desire to conceal information.  We must act on the assumption that the inspector will be a responsible, sensible person who will not be misled by lies.</P>

He may not have verified the facts, and may have no means of doing so.  In my opinion the wording of the section is too loose.  An inspector might walk into a kitchen and ask the girl who is washing up the delph: &ldquo;What about so and so.&rdquo;  That information should be got from some person in a responsible position.  It is due to those who have a great deal of money invested in hotels that information should not be taken from people in a lower grade, as it might seriously injure these properties.  This is only a precaution but it is essential in a matter of this kind.  There may be <i>malafides</i>, or it may be done in perfectly good faith, where full information was not at the disposal of the person giving it, but it is put on paper.</P>

My only desire is that the Bill should be as workable as possible, and that the least evil consequences should follow.  This is new machinery and it is not amending or improving previous legislation. The Minister can take it from me, if he is in the House five years hence, that there will be a Bill here to amend this one.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's prophecy is a safe one.  I do not think I have been responsible for the introduction of a major measure that was not amended once.  That is the only way we can proceed.  If the situation justifies it, I hope a Minister will never be afraid to come forward with amending proposals, if it is necessary to do so.  It is desirable to give inspectors this power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must assume that you are going to have reasonable, responsible men, who are anxious to be fair to everybody, whose concern in relation to hotels will be, not to injure any one section, but to improve the standard of accommodation.  When a question <Col N="245" /> as to registration or re-registration arises, and an inspector visits premises to get information, he is entitled to get it from whoever can give it.  What the Deputy wants to suggest is that it must be got from one person, even though that person may not be the most suitable one to give it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>Not from one person, but from the person in authority at the time.  I did not think it would be necessary to press this matter, but I happen to be a little longer in the world than the Minister, and I know more of the ups and downs of life.  I remember a case where in an establishment with a large number of employees, a trick was played on one employee by a person who was sent there to get material for a lawsuit. This person went to a junior employee, and got him to do a certain thing he had no authority to do, and that was, in fact, illegal.  As a consequence of that act, a lawsuit arose, and the employer was heavily mulcted in damages.  I do not want to give too many facts of that case; I merely want to give the Minister an outline of what could happen.  That case is sticking in my mind and were it not for the fact that he was a man of substance that man would have been bankrupt after that action.  I was in touch with that matter myself.  This is a new kind of thing and I want to impress on the Minister that there is a very dangerous loop-hole there, athough it looks perfectly innocent.  The wisdom of this course is obvious to me and I did not think I should have to press it so strongly, to ensure that no person could give out information except somebody in a responsible position.  If an inspector thinks that he is not getting the truth from the person in charge, let him stay there for a week.</P>

      <P>The Minister is aware that, under sub-section (2) an offence is created in respect of failure to comply with certain matters in sub-section (1).  As the section stands, an inspector would be entitled to come to a hotel and, even though he were met by the proprietor on the doorstep and was told by the proprietor,&ldquo;I will give you all the information you require,&rdquo; to say to the proprietor,&ldquo;Stand aside.  I want to see the kitchen maid and get the information from her.&rdquo;  Does the Minister contemplate that state of affairs?</P>

      <P>The object of this amendment is to restrict the powers of the inspector to that extent, because everybody is human, and when we are legislating here, we must contemplate practically every eventuality that may arise.  It is quite possible that you might get a difficult inspector who might interpret his duties in that way, and who might go to a hotel proprietor, push him aside and say, &ldquo;I am entitled to go in and to find my way to the kitchen or to the attic,&rdquo; and get the information in the absence of the proprietor. The Minister says that the section does not contemplate that that should be done, but my submission is that the legislature should not give power to a person to do something which the Minister contemplates should not be done.</P>

It will not be possible to get perfectly angelic inspectors, and when the board selects them they will select men with certain defects.  That is bound to be the case, because they are human beings.  As Deputy Esmonde has said, the Minister does not intend that these things should be done, but we are leaving the way open for their being done.  Why should it not be prescribed? Everybody who knows anything about the world knows that people in authority, in the main, perform their duties reasonably, but there are cases to the contrary, and I am sure the Minister knows them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not quite get my point.  I opened my remarks by stating that an offence is created under this section.  It is a new offence, a statutory offence, and a penal matter involving punishment. It is something which is going to place a citizen of this State in the position of having to answer a criminal charge, and although the Minister says it is not contemplated that any inspector should go into a hotel and push the proprietor aside, suppose the proprietor says: &ldquo;I am not going to let you in.  I am the person who can give you all the necessary information,&rdquo; and suppose the inspector says: &ldquo;That does not satisfy me.  You must get out of the way.  I want to go in and investigate this matter with an employee of yours.&rdquo;  An offence has been created under sub-section (2), and that is the importance of the section. The Minister says that an inspector is never going to do that, that no reasonable inspector will do it, but if there is an unreasonable inspector he is going to set something in motion which will make a citizen guilty of a criminal offence.</P>

      <P>I suggest there is another aspect of the matter, and it is an aspect which may be more likely to arise than the point raised by Deputy Esmonde.  An inspector looking for information, in the absence of a suitable representative of the owner or applicant for registration, may consult somebody in the premises, of no matter what status, and that somebody may purport to give him the information. That party may not be competent to give the correct information, but on the giving of false information a penalty is incurred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the information in question is of an important character and it ought not to be demeaned by allowing it to be sought from anybody in the employment of the proprietor.  Even the stable boy mentioned by the Minister is not excluded from being consulted by the inspector.  In the absence of the manager, or hotel keeper, the inspector will ask somebody.  He may ask the waitress serving him his meal.  She may have had a row with her boss and might be glad of an opportunity to get her own back and she may tell him something not in accordance with the facts in order to slip one across him. You are putting hoteliers in the position of being under suspicion.  The Minister hopes that the inspectors are all going to be above reproach, but I think he ought to approach the hotel keepers on the same basis until they are proven guilty, and they ought to be assured that this information, which is going to have important repercussions on their business, will be got from some responsible person.  It merely means the insertion of a provision that the hotel keepers, the applicant or some other person in a responsible position will be consulted, and not leave it possible for any Tom, Dick or Harry to be consulted and to give false information, either maliciously or accidentally.  The thing is too loose <Col N="249" /> altogether.  I am surprised that the Minister has not been influenced by the logic of the arguments put forward by Deputy MacMenamin.

      <P>The phrase used was that he might brush the proprietor aside and go down to the kitchen.  What surprised me was the Minister repudiating that action.  I thought he would stand over that action.  In view of the debate that has taken place on this matter, I would urge on the Minister the importance of having a check on any report that comes in, whether it has to do with grading or registration.  I think there is a certain danger in this matter. You will sometimes get peculiar <Col N="250" /> inspectors.  I myself have had some experience of inspectors, all intelligent men, but a few of them very peculiar. It is not a question of dishonesty.  It is their peculiarities which get them into all sorts of trouble which they need not get into if it were not for these peculiarities.  It is not their lack of intelligence that is responsible for the trouble.  They create a great deal of trouble merely because of the peculiarities which you are bound to get in the case of some individuals when you are dealing with any body of men.  I think there should be a check on their reports and an opportunity afforded of rebutting them both in the case of grading and of registration. The whole debate has tended in that direction, namely, the necessity of having a check.</P>

      <P>This is the type of amendment which we get most frequently and which we are never able to accept.  It may appear quite a trivial matter to make this change, but the effect of the change is considerable. Let us try to visualise a person instituting proccedings for some offence under the section.  It is an ordinary <Col N="251" /> simple matter to say that the thing was done, that, in fact, the inspector was obstructed, or that he was in some other way interfered with, but it is an entirely different matter to prove that the thing was done wilfully.  In this particular case the Deputy wants to insert the word &ldquo;wilfully.&rdquo;  I do not think we should insert it.  I think we should say that it is an offence to obstruct an inspector whether it is done wilfully or not.</P>

That is a matter that is altogether too subtle for me&mdash;even though I did study metaphysical science in my youthful days.  He says that he is not prepared to impose on the prosecutor the onus of proving that the obstruction or the failure to give information was wilful, but at the same time he provides that when a person is prosecuted for giving false or misleading information, it must be proved that it was wilfully or negligently given.

      <P>What is an offence?  A criminal act. I expect the Minister knows sufficient about the criminal code to know that <i>mens rea</i> applies to all criminal cases. He demonstrates it here by inserting in paragraph (c) &ldquo;wilfully or negligently.&rdquo; In these other cases, <i>mens rea</i> is also involved and a person found guilty of such an offence shall be liable to a fine of £5.  The Minister is there creating a criminal offence and <i>mens rea</i> is a necessary element in a criminal offence.  That is the point to which Deputy O'Sullivan has drawn attention.  It is ridiculous to suggest that in the first two paragraphs it should not be necessary to prove that the offence was wilful.  It must be proved in all criminal offences and that is implied in the opening words of paragraph (c).</P>

      <P>If the Minister refers to the end of the section, sub-section (3) he will find a definition of the word &ldquo;inspector.&rdquo;  I would ask the Minister to place himself in the position of a district justice presiding over a court of summary jurisdiction who is going to try an offence under this section. Take paragraph (a) sub-section (2) under which the offence will be one of obstructing and impeding an inspector. What has the prosecution got to prove?  They have got to prove that a certain individual whose status can be ascertained, from sub-section (3), namely an officer of the board appointed by the board, has in fact been obstructed.  It may not be within the knowledge of the proprietor that he was an inspector but an offence has been committed, a criminal offence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows quite well that no proceedings will be instituted unless, in fact, there is the belief that this thing has been done wilfully, but it is difficult to prove that a thing has been done wilfully or that the refusal to give information was <Col N="254" /> wilful.  In fact, however, unless the circumstances are there in which an inspector believes that he has been wilfully obstructed, he will not go to court, because he will know that the justice would not listen to him, much less impose a fine.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnLymbrickEsmonde" hpid="Mr. Esmonde Mr. Esmonde">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is, however, that, if the case comes to court, the justice is obliged to take the view that this matter has been carefully considered by the Legislature and that they have deliberately omitted to insert any word to guide the justice, over and above the fact that there has been an obstruction of an inspector or duly appointed officer of the board, and the justice is obliged to interpret that section accordingly.</P>

      <P>I cannot see the Minister's objection here.  If the inspector produces his warrant and the door is not opened, while it will be <Col N="256" /> extremely difficult to prove wilfulness in the case of false information, it will be very difficult to prove lack of wilfulness in (c), (a) or (b), if the thing occurs.</P>

      <P>We are speaking of the section, as it stands, and the amendment.  The main objection was the difficulty of proof.  In the case of (a) and (b) there is no difficulty of proof of wilfulness because, in 99 cases out of 100, if the thing is done, that in itself is <i>prima facie</i> proof of wilfulness, and therefore there can be no real objection to putting it in in order to save misunderstandings of one kind or another.

      <P>With regard to amendment No. 44, surely it is not intended that the word &ldquo;negligently&rdquo; should stand there?  It is quite possible, as I mentioned in connection with paragraph (b), for a man to give information through negligence on his part, and surely the word that is intended <Col N="257" /> there should be &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; and not &ldquo;negligently&rdquo;.  It is a very simple thing to give wrong information through sheer negligence, but not criminally, and yet, as that stands there, if the information is given through an oversight, it is an offence.</P>

      <P>I think that if a person gives information which, with a little trouble, he could have ascertained to be not correct, it should be an offence. Again, to approach this matter from a commonsense point of view, no inspector will bring proceedings unless he has a case that he thinks will stand in court.  If he thinks that the case is so ridiculous that the court would not listen to him and the case would be laughed out of court, there will be no proceedings.  It is only where there has been serious impediment to the carrying out of the inspector's duties that this will happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to the fact that the Minister sees no difference in this matter between choosing inspectors in the ordinary way or from <Col N="258" /> Grangegorman.  I suggest, Sir, that that ought not to be the attitude of any Minister who has had inspectors under him.  He knows that the qualities of these inspectors vary to a tremendous extent.  He knows, as I know, that some of the inspectors would be most reasonable men and that some would be fairly reasonable, but that there will be found in any body of men a certain number of unreasonable men, and they will act unreasonably, accordingly. It is absurd to come to anybody who has ever had experience, either in an administrative capacity or as a simple citizen of this State, and suggest that inspectors, occasionally, will not act unreasonably, and that the only choice you would have in that case is to suggest that, if they act at all unreasonably, they are from Grangegorman. That is not the alternative. The fact is that you will have every type of inspector, varying in every degree between reasonable and unreasonable men.  What we have to take into account is not the ordinary reasonable type of inspector.  There would be no necessity for one-third of our laws if everybody were reasonable, and if the reply the Minister has given were to be taken as correct, there would be no point in legislation.  It is just because you have all this difference between, on the one hand, the ordinary reasonable people and, on the other, the extremely unreasonable people, that you have to guard against it. Surely the Minister knows that some of these people will act unreasonably on occasion, and to say that, because we demand a provision to see that there will be some safeguard against occasion a provision to see that there will be some safeguard against occasional unreasonableness, we are practically saying that the board would have people fit only for Grangegorman, shows a complete incapacity to grasp the situation.</P>

      <P>What the Deputy is saying is, in effect, that because we recognise that in order to carry out the intentions of this Bill inspectors and so on should have certain powers, and because there is a risk that some people might act unreasonably, or because some unreasonable person might be appointed, we must prevent the Act from functioning properly, and must <Col N="259" /> not allow the inspectors to carry out their duties properly.</P>

It is because amongst them, as amongst other people, there will be individuals who, for one reason or another, will refuse to do what is required of them that legal powers are required.  These legal powers have never been exercised, in my knowledge of ten years' administration, except when the need arose.</P>

      <P>I completely disagree with the Minister.  This proposal is made not on the off-chance of injustice being done, but in the certainty that there will be abuse.  The Minister has continued to refuse to meet any point raised.  He has something down in black and white before him, and he assumes that all inspectors are reasonable people.  A number of them will not be reasonable.  They will act unreasonably, and there is no safeguard for those concerned if they do.  The board will have to stand for what they do.  If they do not, their <Col N="260" /> machinery will be in danger of collapsing. I cannot, for the life of me, see why, in matters of this kind, the word &ldquo;reasonably&rdquo; cannot be put in. When the inspector produces his warrant, it will be almost impossible for the person concerned to prove that what he did was not done wilfully.  If he can show cause, why not allow him to do so?  The Minister said that that would lead to the breaking down of the Act.  That was, of course, an exaggeration.  Inspectors are reasonable or unreasonable, we are told. They are neither.  They are a mixture of both.</P>

If it is the Minister's intention to create only one offence, then I think that this paragraph does not give effect to his intention because it creates two offences.  What the Minister wants to prevent, I think, is the owner of a hotel wilfully giving false information.  That is covered by the word &ldquo;wilfully.&rdquo;  A person might be acquitted of the offence of wilfully giving false information and still be liable for negligently giving false information, which would be a different offence, requiring different proof.  I think that it is only a question of drafting.  If the Minister drops the word &ldquo;negligently,&rdquo; what he has in mind will be covered.  This is the only case I can think of in which civil negligence constitutes a crime.  I do not know of any case where a person guilty of civil negligence is deemed to be guilty of a crime.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (1), lines 6 and 7, to delete the words &ldquo;at or near the principal entrance to such premises.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment raises the question of exhibiting the prices to be charged by a hotel.  In the case of an ordinary restaurant, there would be nothing objectionable in that but, in an area in which there would be a number of hotels of different grades, this practice might be abused.  The people who will go into a Grade A hotel will not be concerned about the charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think we may accept that there will <Col N="263" /> be no question of their being unable to pay for the food.  That question does not arise.  I think it would not be a suitable thing that somebody maliciously disposed could gather a number of boys or girls from around the street and send them up to the hotel door. They could justify themselves by the fact that they were reading the price list of the food supplied there.</P>
    <P>Other objections occurred to me and to meet them I drafted the amendment to delete the words &ldquo;at or near the principal entrance of such premises&rdquo;. It occurred to me that such place as outside the office window or in some lounge, or some place inside the entrance to a high-class hotel would be more suitable.  If it were outside the hotel anybody at all could walk up and pretend they were reading the price list of the food, whereas, as a matter of fact, they were really intending to create an obstruction or nuisance, knowing perfectly well that they were people who were not suitable to be there at all.</P>
    <P>I put down this amendment fearing that the duty that is being imposed in this section would lead to trouble and would only be a menace to certain hotels.  There would be no objection in the case of a restaurant, or any of these other premises with which this Act is dealing, because hikers and people like that, young people, with limited means, would require to know the price of the meal they intended to consume.  There are other cases where the provision is uncalled for and would not be necessary.  I would go so far as to say that the price list should be exhibited somewhere&mdash;at the office window or some place like that, where it could be seen by every visitor.  Nobody would be deceived, but I do see certain cases where this provision could be abused if it was insisted upon. Therefore, I put down this amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="265" /> It occurred to me when considering this section that if a register is being prepared in which the grade of an hotel will be set forth, it would be hardly quite fair that an hotel proprietor should have to hang a sign outside his door to the effect that his hotel was of such and such a grade.  The ordinary people living around the district, who were not using the hotel at all, could say: &ldquo;Look at this place, it is only Grade C or Grade D.&rdquo;  We had examples of that sort of thing during the last war, when terms of contempt were applied to people who were graded as C men.  I think that it is enough that the tourist should get the catalogue that is being circulated. They can see from that how the hotel is graded.  I think that would be enough, without compelling the hotel proprietor to hang the sign outside the door, indicating the grade of the hotel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there are advantages from the point of view of the public in having the standard of the hotel indicated by the sign outside. You have that, in fact, at the present time.  Various organisations supply signs indicating the standard of the hotel, and I suppose the absence of those signs also indicates the standard of the hotel.  In my view it is an advantage to have that provision in the Bill.  Again, I want to impress upon the Dáil that the object of this Bill is not to impose burdens on hotel-keepers or to make it more difficult for them to carry out their business.  It is quite the reverse.  The object of the Bill is to assist hotel-keepers and increase their business.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister's case is not analogous at all.  I think he is referring to the signs of the Automobile Association and the Royal Irish Automobile Club and those other organisations.  I would like to direct the Minister's attention to the fact that when they give these signs to an hotel they do not indicate the grade of the hotel.  You have to go to the booklet or catalogue which they issue in order to find out whether it is a one-star, two-star or five-star hotel.  It is only in the booklet that is set forth. I think this thing is pushing efficiency rather far.  I think it would be quite sufficient to have the sign, but not give the grading, seeing that we have power in this Bill to keep a register in which the grading of the hotel will be set forth.  These catalogues will be available to tourists at any bookstall.  That is quite sufficient, in my opinion, and will conform to what the Automobile Association and the Royal Irish Automobile Club do.</P>

The average holiday-maker will be a person of limited means, who will be looking for an hotel that will provide accommodation suitable to his means. It will be of assistance to that person to have some such indication given. I suppose there are two points of view in this matter.  There will be holiday-makers who will dislike having the standard of the hotel in which they are staying displayed in that particular way.

      <P>No. I would not agree with that at all.  It is a different matter.  What sub-section (3) of Section 43 provides is that the consent of the board will be required before any other signs are displayed outside the hotel. I attach importance to this matter.  I think that we should keep the display of those signs, which purport to indicate the standard of an hotel, subject to the control of the board.  I feel that in the case of certain responsible organisations the board will have no difficulty in maintaining harmonious relations with them, and that the standard and procedure in their cases will be the same as that of the board's. There may be other kinds of organisations furnishing those signs and prepared to give them to any hotel that is willing to pay enough for them, or giving them on some basis of which the board could not approve.  Therefore, I think that we should keep the matter subject to the consent of the board.</P>

      <P>But it does not affect the board's standard, grading, or anything of that sort.  These bodies have been in existence for many years.  They have been indicating that certain hotels are appointed by certain bodies as being suitable for their members. I can see no reason why the Minister should propose to give power to the board to refuse its consent to the issuing of those signs.  These bodies have done considerable service to their members and to this industry.  What the Minister suggests would inflict a serious penalty on them.

      <P>Excuse me.  I think that twice to-day the Minister gave this explanation&mdash;I may be wrong, and my memory may be playing me a trick&mdash;that there were certain organisations that might sell signs, and therefore that the board ought to control them on that account. That was the principal explanation that the Minister gave twice to-day on this very matter.  That is not the explanation he gives now.  Now he wants uniformity of standard.  That is what it amounts to.  Those people will have to conform their standard to the board's standard.  In other words, in practice they are to be wiped out, because it is inconceivable that two bodies should reach the same standard in the case of different hotels.  It is not in the exceptional case of fraud, which was what the Minister first suggested, that these signs are to be prohibited. It is in reality to make the board the only body that can put any signs outside an hotel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Take the extreme case that the Minister mentions, namely, of bribery. <Col N="270" /> Even there, why cannot the Minister allow the ordinary channels of commerce to destroy such an association. It will be found out very quickly if it issues signs to bad hotels.  Why continue this unnecessary interference? The first inclination appears to be: Interfere if we can.  My inclination is always the opposite: do not interfere unless you have grounds for interfering. I agree that we are approaching this from a different standpoint.  Suppose the bodies mentioned do differ from the board in grading, that is no reason for preventing them saying: &ldquo;We recommend this hotel.&rdquo;  I think it highly undesirable that the board should be given the power the Minister speaks of.  If the Minister had based his case on his first explanation, namely, corrupt practices, there might be some grounds for it, but now he seems to take the ground altogether from under his feet.  He now says it is intended that the signs issued by the bodies mentioned shall not appear if they are different from the signs issued by the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has suggested that there is some conflict of opinion between two statements I made.  I submit that there is not.  I assume that certain organisations will work on the same general lines of policy as the board and in harmony with it.  I should imagine that there will be no conflict between them, but if there is a conflict the board's will must predominate where the conflict arises because of a different point of view from that of the directors of the organisations concerned.  There is no reason why those organisations cannot recommend hotels to their members, or why they cannot publish and issue guide books or indicate a preference for certain hotels.  What we have before us here relates to the display of signs.  That is a matter that, I think, must be under the control of the board.  I regard it as a most important matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I would point out to the Minister that you have a number of hotels in the South of Ireland bearing the Royal Automobile signs. These hotels were quite up to the mark <Col N="271" /> when the signs were first issued.  The Royal Automobile Club does not carry out inspections except at very long intervals.  Two hotels that I have in mind have become so dilapidated that I do not think anybody should be invited to go to them.  The Royal Automobile sign, where it is used in England, gives the visitor the impression that a certain standard is reached and maintained in that hotel.  In this country those people are allowed to use the Royal Automobile sign when the hotel has gone completely down.  I think some supervision should be exercised.  We discussed this at the Tourist Association Board meeting, and I think Deputy Mongan agreed that the present board should have some jurisdiction over the issue of signs, whether from across Channel or otherwise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to this matter there is another point which requires attention, and that is the fact that those bodies, be they motoring or cycling bodies, may view an hotel from a different aspect than the board In the case of a motoring body they may look for suitable garage facilities, and so forth, which the board may or may not consider.  Therefore, their grading may differ very much from that of the board.  That, of course, in a way does not arise here&mdash;it arose on an earlier amendment, for which I was not present&mdash;but at the same time an hotel should not thereby be debarred from showing those signs, so that a member of those bodies may refer to his book and find out what sort of hotel it is. With regard to the point mentioned by Deputy Crowley, I understand that those bodies inspect the hotels every year.  It is possible that they may still have the sign, but they may have been lowered in grade since the sign was originally given.  I doubt very much if any of those bodies has on its list hotels which do not conform to its minimum standard at all events.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I ask the Minister whether he will do in regard to this what he has done in connection with previous amendments, that is, give an assurance that he will go into the matter later on?  Will he give the <Col N="272" /> House an assurance that there will be no such thing as retrospective legislation; that the board will have no power to take away A.A. signs or R.I.A.C. signs from those who have already got them?  Why not allow the people who have already got those signs to continue to hold them, and at the same time put up the sign of the new tourist board?  If I were a visitor coming from any part of the Continent, and I saw an hotel displaying an A.A. or an R.I.A.C. sign, it would seem to me that it was a sort of security for me in going in there, but it would sound very peculiar to me if I heard that such and such a place had that sign but it was taken from them.  As a visitor, I would not quite follow that it had been done by legislation here in this House.  I think the Minister ought not to make the legislation retrospective.  I think that anybody who has had those hall-marks on his premises should be allowed to retain them, and that there should be no such thing as giving any board power to order hotel proprietors to take down those signs.  There may be power to give them the board's own sign, which I certainly should like to see, but, if the hotel is up to the standard necessary to get the sign of those two motoring bodies, one of them at least world famous, I think it should be allowed to continue to use those two signs and the new one as well.  That ought to meet with the tourist board's approval. I would put it to the Minister that, at this late hour, it seems an extraordinary thing to introduce legislation which will take from those hotels the signs which foreign visitors look on as a type of security.  I would ask the Minister to consider that matter.</P>

      <P>There is no reason why the Tourist Board should take any action in this matter at all except it had reason to believe that the interests of hotel proprietors and of the tourist business were being injured.  What we are proposing here in the Bill is that those signs cannot be displayed except with the consent of the board.  What the amendment seeks is that the board should have no function in regard to the signs of any of those organisations, but I think the matter must remain subject to the consent of the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  As the Bill stands, the board can decide when the sign of any one of those bodies should not be displayed.  They will not have power to take the sign from one hotel proprietor, or from two hotel proprietors. They will not have the power to take it from an individual here and there.  They will either withdraw their consent altogether in regard to those organisations, or continue it altogether. If they continue their consent, then the distribution of the signs will be a matter for those bodies and not for the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It still appears that you are making the legislation retrospective by giving the board the power to order hotels to take down a sign that is world famous and put up a new one. I would agree that the board should have the right to give those hotels their own approved sign, and that hotels which already have the A.A. and R.I.A.C. signs should then display all three of them as hall-marks of security.  One of them is better known to the Irish people who are seeing Ireland first.  One of these organisations is famous throughout Great Britain and Ireland, while the other is world-famous, and I think the hotels should be allowed to continue to display their signs.  I put it to the Minister that it is not an unreasonable suggestion to make.</P>

    <P>I do consider that the information on those signs issued by the board should be very simple.  In the first place, from the practical point of view, if you put a considerable amount of information on any sign you are going to confuse people.

      <P>There is no point in this amendment.  Earlier we discussed whether hotels should be required to display signs whether they liked it or not.  I undertook to reconsider that. It is surely right that the signs supplied by the board should contain such information as the board thinks proper. If we decide to leave it optional to hotel proprietors to display the sign or not, then they need not display it if they do not like; but if it is compulsory it must be a matter for the board to determine what is to be on the sign.</P>

      <P>Surely, we should at least allow the proprietor of an hotel to determine whether or not it is good for his business that those particulars should appear in a handbook? Surely, he should decide that? That is all we ask.  There are certain people who object, and who think it will damage their business.  The Minister may say: &ldquo;That is bad business&rdquo;, but there are certain types of hotels which run on that particular line.  They feel that if their names are inserted in a book of this kind it will interfere with the particular type of business they want to do.  All that is asked is to have something analogous, say, to a telephone directory.  There are a number of people who have telephones and who find them extremely useful and who get their names in the telephone book.  There are other people who find telephones a nuisance, and they have a telephone but the name does not appear in the book.  All that is asked is that the proprietor of a hotel might be able to say: &ldquo;I will register; you can grade me, but I do not want to appear in the book.  I do not want that type of publicity; it will damage my business.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>But this Bill is later than the other, and the Minister may confer those powers on the board. This is a statutory power, too, quite as much as the other.  I wonder what the <Col N="281" /> Minister has in mind in all this.  I am quite in favour of the board having extensive powers to preserve amenities, and in many cases there are no town planning committees, but I think where you have, they ought to work in harmony from every point of view.  I do not know whether the Minister can confer these powers.  Can he confer them, and must they be general powers or conferred in respect of a special area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider that point.  It might serve, to put into the section some phraseology whereby the Minister in exercising his powers would have regard to any town planning committee or any body that was doing work sanctioned by a town planning authority.</P>

      <P>In cases where there is a town planning committee, I think it is obvious that the board should be compelled to bow to that committee.  There are quite a number of other places where it is highly desirable that there should be power that no county council has at present, I am afraid, and that no town planning authority has, to preserve amenities. What I want to know is, could the Minister under the powers he has in this Bill mark out a certain district and say to the board: &ldquo;You have full power to do certain things in that particular district&rdquo;?  Can the Minister delimit the district or must he give general powers?</P>

In studying the Bill I cannot find any clear indication of what a guest house is intended to be.  There are two things which, to my mind, could come under that.  One is a boarding house, and the other is a guest house, which is really a more expensive and exclusive place than a hotel.  Could the Minister indicate what is covered by this?</P>

      <P>Go ndeontar suim Bhreise ná raghaidh thar £25,000 chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1940, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisí i dtaobh Iascach Mara agus Intíre, maraon le hIldeontaisí-i-gCabhair agus chun íocaíochta in aghaidh cúitimh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="285" /> That a Supplementary sum not exceeding £25,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1940, for Salaries and Expenses in connection with Sea and Inland Fisheries, including sundry Grants-in-Aid, and for a payment on account of compensation.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned on the Second Reading of the Fisheries Bill, after further consideration we have come to the conclusion that, although the late owners of the River Erne fishery had lost their case legally, it was considered that in equity something should be done by way of giving <i>ex gratia</i> compensation to them.  I also explained that it was rather difficult to know what the amount should be, because an arbitrator would be appointed to assess compensation for the owners of the fisheries dealt with in the Bill and we might at a later stage take a headline from the awards of that arbitrator and try to give something in line with his awards in the case of the River Erne fishery.  We do not want of course to prejudice him in any way.  Therefore the best we can do is to give an amount on account, it being understood that at a later time when the arbitrator has made some awards we might come back and say that something more will be given to the people concerned; but it will probably be ten or 12 years before any more can be given.</P>
    <P>Deputies may ask why we decided on this amount.  This fishery was purchased in 1869 for £45,000.  We have documentary evidence of that.  We also have documentary evidence that in 1926 a sixth portion of it was bought for £12,000.  On these figures one would be inclined to say that the fishery which was purchased in 1869 for £45,000 was worth about £70,000 in 1926&mdash;that, of course, was the whole fishery of the River Erne.  We are only concerned here with the tidal portion.  The fresh water portion still remains in the hands of the group. They state that the fresh water portion is of no value whatsoever.  That would be decided by the arbitrator. I think, taking all the circumstances into account, £25,000 is as much as we <Col N="286" /> could give at the moment.  At the same time, it will be admitted that we are not going too far.  In other words, the arbitrator will almost certainly award more than £25,000.  If the river came under his judisdiction, or came up to him for decision, he would almost certainly award that amount.  The freshwater weir portion will, of course, come under the arbitrator's decision at a later stage.  It will come up to him for decision.  When the ownership in the freshwater weir portion is being taken over, it will then be easier to decide what further amount should be paid by way of total compensation for the whole ownership of the River Erne.</P>

I suppose it is.  If anything happens in the meantime the arbitrator is not bound by the £25,000. If the Minister has any reason to revise his Estimate he can, but he cannot spend more than £25,000.  If there is any reason for it, he need not spend that amount.</P>

    <P>Go ndeontar suim ná raghaidh thar £32,081 chun slánuithe na suime is gá chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chum bheith iníoctha i rith na <Col N="287" /> bliana dar críoch an 31adh lá de Mhárta, 1940, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisí i dtaobh Iascach Mara agus Intíre, maraon le hIldeontaisí-i-gCabhair.</P>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £32,081 be granted to complete the sum necessary to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of March, 1940, for salaries and expenses in connection with sea and inland fisheries, including sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>The estimate as a whole shows an increase of £9,989 on the expenditure side and a decrease of £1,303 in Appropriations-in-Aid, making a net increase of £11,292 on the amount voted last year.  On sub-head A, salaries, wages and allowances, there is a reduction of £890 on last year's figure.  This reduction is mainly due to the permanent dropping of the two posts of fishery superintendents, one of the holders of these was seconded to the Sea Fisheries Association several years ago, and the other has died since last year.  There is no further necessity to replace these men in the Department of Fisheries.  Three junior posts on the administrative staff have lapsed through the discontinuance of bounties on fish exports.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head B a sum of £75 more than last year is provided to cover the anticipated increase in travelling expenses and subsistence payments.  Sub-heads C and D call for no comment. They are about the same as last year. I might say that no provision is made in this Estimate for any additions to the technical staff which may be found necessary, assuming that the Fisheries Bill at present before the House is enacted during the current financial year.  It is not likely, of course, that there will be any increase of staff until very near the end of the year in any case.  It is hoped to make the necessary orders to commence operations and take over those fisheries. That would mean the employment of a survey staff, but it is, as I say, very unlikely that we will commence operations before the end of the financial year.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="288" /> The E group of Sea Fisheries sub-heads comes next.  Sub-head E (1) shows just a slight reduction on last year's figures, and sub-head E (2) shows no change.  Sub-head E (5) has also been reduced a few pounds from the previous figures.  I am asking £3,400 more this year than last year for sub-head B in connection with the hire and running expenses of the second fishery cruiser, which is on charter since November, 1937.  Last year I was not so sure about the second cruiser.  She was on trial and charter.  Now that she has given a fair trial, we feel that she serves the purpose very well.  I am asking for the full amount for the entire financial year.  I would like to say that since the second cruiser has been taken on, the number of complaints with regard to poaching by foreign trawlers has very definitely decreased.  These cruisers have also helped to enforce the Act passed in 1937, the main purpose of which was to deter our fishermen as far as possible from landing immature fish.</P>
    <P>Sub-head E (4) is down by £515 on last year's figures.  This sub-head comprises the direct cost of administering the Whale Fisheries Act, 1937, under which we undertook certain international obligations with regard to whale fisheries.  If any whale catcher registers here, we must pay the officer on board the catcher in the Antarctic to see that the Act is carried out in every way.  The reduction this year in this sub-head is due to the post of assistant sea fisheries protection officer having been suppressed.  The assistant has now become an officer.  It was purely a training post last year.  There are three such officers employed on this job watching the whale fisheries in the Antarctic.</P>
    <P>These three officers are employed seasonally on whale factory ships which operate in the Antarctic and which are registered in this country. It is very hard to give an estimate of what we may spend on this sub-head this year, because we do not know whether any ships will register here. As against these charges we collect, if registered here, fees off these vessels. The fees collected are more than sufficient to pay the officers that are put on board, so that there is a slight <Col N="289" /> profit in watching the whalers in the Antarctic.  A factory ship is usually accompanied by seven or eight catchers.  The vessels that catch the whales do not do the factory portion. In some cases the catchers are registered in England, and the whale factory ship is registered here.  In such cases the British Government has, so far, remitted to us the greater portion of the licence fees collected by them from those whale catchers.  Otherwise we would have been paying the officer on the catcher and they would be collecting the fees without having to pay anything.  In these cases there has been an adjustment, and the British Government has paid a certain amount as a contribution towards our expenses. It is largely owing to that that we have been able to make a slight profit on the administration. The amount paid by the British Government is shown as an extra Exchequer receipt.  It amounts in the current financial year to £800.  The item will be found at the bottom of page 233 of the printed Estimates.</P>
    <P>As regards the F. group of sub-heads, which deals with inland fisheries, there was only one appreciable change as compared with last year's Vote.  Sub-head F (1) (4), which is up by £500, provides for payments to local authorities under Section 13 of the Fisheries Act, 1925.  The basis of these disbursements is somewhat complex.  It depends upon the inter-relation of the budgets of local authorities that formerly received as poor rate what is now the fishery rate. The total recoupment, which is determined by a Sealed Order of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, has shown a tendency to rise, and so an increased provision is being made this year.</P>
    <P>Now I come to Group G&mdash;the Sea Fisheries Association sub-heads.  As a whole the group shows an increase of £7,000 on last year's Vote.  Deputies may recollect that last year's provision was deliberately made a restricted figure, because I was not prepared to ask for larger provision until I had been satisfied as to the outcome of certain discussions then in progress with the directors of the association concerning future policy.  The association <Col N="290" /> has since furnished replies to the queries raised upon its working methods by the inter-departmental committee which had been examining that question, and I am hopeful that improved results may henceforth be expected.</P>
    <P>Sub-head G (3)&mdash;Advances for Boats and Gear&mdash;has been restored to the figure of £10,000, at which it had stood prior to the exceptional conditions of last year's Estimate.  As a matter of fact, we had to find £1,500 more than the £5,000 voted last year, towards the end of the financial year, for this purpose, and we got that from savings on other sub-heads.  It is by funds advanced out of the provision on sub-head G (3) that the fishermen are enabled to get boats and gear on the hire purchase.  Deputies who represent maritime counties are aware that the average inshore fisherman has little, if any, capital and, therefore, the association's purchase system has to be financed.  The figure for sub-head G (4)&mdash;Advances for General Development&mdash;has been cut down to £1,000. The money advanced under this sub-head is repayable on the principle that the work for which such advances are made are of a nature more or less permanent, as distinct from the experimental operations for which grants are provided under sub-head G (2).  At the present time the bulk of the works undertaken by the association under this sub-head are more or less experimental, and therefore it is natural that the provision under sub-head G (4) should be only a fraction of that under G (2).</P>
    <P>The Appropriations-in-Aid show an aggregate decrease of some £1,300 upon last year's figure, and £100 of this decrease is under Item 2&mdash;Repayment of Fishery Loans.  There are still heavy arrears outstanding on loans issued in the days before the Sea Fisheries Association was established. As the years go on we find it more difficult to retrieve anything on foot of these debts, and so we have to budget for less receipts from the debtors this year than last.</P>
    <P>Item 4 shows the expected proceeds of lettings of sporting rights in the hands of my Department, and of the <Col N="291" /> State fisheries whose upkeep is provided for under sub-head F (3).  This item is down by £200.  This is largely explained by the fact that one tenant, who recently was leased one of these properties, owned by the Department, has entered into a certain agreement to carry out extensive improvements in the shooting lodge in lieu of rent for the first year. We are budgeting under item 5 for an increase of £300 in repayments by the Sea Fisheries' Association of the advances made to them for boats and gear under Sub-head G (3) and for general development under Sub-head G (4).  There is a relatively big drop of nearly £300 in the figure for item 6, which represents what we expect to get in respect of special local licenses for netting in the Erne and the Owenea estuaries.  The salmon seasons of 1937 and 1938 were bad, not only in this country, but over the countries of north-west Europe generally.  Fewer licences, no doubt, will be applied for in 1939.  The receipts from special local licences are offset by payments amounting to £600 to boards of conservators which have been provided for in the 5th item of Sub-head F (1). As regards item (7) of Appropriations-in-Aid which has fallen by £150, I have already referred to this when dealing with the Whale Fisheries Sub-head&mdash; E (4).  The item&mdash;Repayment of Salaries of Officers seconded for service with the Sea Fisheries' Association&mdash;which has appeared for some years past, is no longer necessary for the reasons which I gave when speaking on sub-head A.</P>
    <P>It will be appropriate for me to say a few words with regard to the revival of deep-sea trawling by the company engaging in that business from the Port of Dublin.  It is true that the group of businessmen who undertook this revival last year have found themselves faced with many difficulties; but it looks as if they will eventually be justified of their enterprise.  While it is too early yet to make a definite pronouncement on the subject, I think the following few figures speak for themselves:&mdash;(a) our imports of fresh and frozen fish were for the first quarter, <Col N="292" /> 1938, 46,890 cwts; and for the first quarter, 1939, 24,499 cwts.  (b) The number of Dublin steam trawlers working in March/April, 1938, was two, and in March/April, 1939, was eight.  (c) Total landings by Dublin steam trawlers were in April, 1938, 555 cwts., and in April, 1939, 4,065 cwts.  It is true that in April, 1938, there were landings made at Dublin by foreign trawlers totalling 2,344 cwts.; but, adding that figure to the 555 cwts. then landed by the Dublin trawlers, we have a total of 2,899 cwts; and the present year's figure of 4,065 cwts. represents a very big increase on that basis.  I think that covers all the sub-heads.</P>

      <P>One would like to be able to compliment the Minister on a thriving industry, so far as fisheries are concerned, but I do not suppose that we can do that.  It would be too much to expect that we could.  I am afraid we were scarcely prepared for what appears to me to be rather a declining service more than anything else.  We have an Estimate introduced by the Minister, and he put the best colour that he could on it and yet it seems bad.  It seems a puzzle why we cannot do better with the fisheries.  I am not blaming the Minister or the Department, but there appears to be something radically wrong and nobody, so far, appears to have touched the right spot in order to put it going.  We are surrounded by the sea and we have a lot of people living by fishing one way or the other.  It seems the living they make out of fishing is very precarious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one hopeful thing I heard the Minister say was that since the chartering of a second ship for the protection of the fisheries the complaints have been lessened.  I wonder is the Minister still satisfied that he has checked poaching?  If he has not, would it not be good business to engage another, and yet another protection vessel&mdash;that is, if the foreign trawlers are still coming here and taking our fish?  On the whole, I do not think the Minister has impressed the House with his account of the Department's activities.  We find that it is a declining service, and it seems extraordinary that while we make provision for new boats and gear to the <Col N="293" /> extent of £10,000, we are estimating for a smaller sum in the repayment of fishery loans.</P>
    <P>I do not know exactly what he said by way of justification for that, but it does not appear to me to be a justification for the sum provided annually. I could understand that some of the old loans had got musty, and that he could not expect them to come in every year.  Perhaps the Minister is expecting less repayments every year.  Can the Minister account for that?</P>
    <P>With regard to the Sea Fisheries' Association, is the Minister satisfied that we are getting value for the money spent there?  There have been complaints with regard to the supply of fish.  I notice that £29,000 is being provided for the Association this year. I do not know what return will be got for that.  The Minister also stated that foreign trawlers are not allowed to land fish here.  Why?  I understand that we are importing a good deal of fish and that there are complaints about supplies.  Why are foreign trawlers not allowed to land fish here instead of getting supplies in in another way?  I am sure there is some reason for the present arrangement, but I would like to have the Minister's explanation.  The Minister stated that he is not making provision for the operation of the new Act.  I suppose the Department does not know what the Act will entail, but I hope its operations will not be delayed too long. Presumably, it will be impossible to have it in operation for the summer, but there should be no delay about putting it into operation.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with catches registered in England and catches registered here.  Is the Minister satisfied that we are getting a proper share from the British?  It appears from the Appropriations-In-Aid that the Minister is estimating for very much reduced sums next year.  I wonder why he is doing that.  I should like to hear his explanation.  On the whole, it is really depressing that we have not got further with our fisheries.  I do not know whether the position is as hopeless as it looks, but from the little information I have gathered from reading, it does not appear to be very <Col N="294" /> hopeful.  I shall be glad to hear from the Minister if he thinks the industry can be put on some sort of a decent footing, or whether he requires more assistance in the way of protection, or the chartering of another cruiser.  If so, I do not see why that should not be done, in case the fault may be there.  At any rate some effort should be made to put the industry on a sound footing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point to which I wish to call the Minister's attention, and that concerns the poor state of the inland fisheries.  I do not know if the Minister is aware of the fact that there is considerable agitation in the constituency I represent, North Cork, and complaints are made by the urban councils of Fermoy and Mallow that salmon fishing in the Blackwater has practically died out, to the great loss of the people in that area.  There is a loss in more than one direction, because people with fishing rights there got substantial sums in the past by letting these rights, but naturally visitors who took fishing there will not come again unless they can catch salmon.  A considerable amount of employment was given by visitors who leased fishery rights along the Blackwater. I want to bring it to the notice of the Minister and the Department that the belief in that area is that the decline of salmon fishing in the Blackwater is due to the operation of a weir at Lismore.  The urban councils of Mallow and Fermoy discussed the matter during the past week, and serious complaints were made regarding the losses that resulted by the condition of salmon fishing in the Blackwater.  They contend that it is due to a weir which is owned privately at Lismore, and that the salmon cannot get up the river.  I made inquires when I got these resolutions, and I am satisfied that there is some foundation for the complaints.  I understand the weir is owned by a private company, or by an estate, and that it is so narrow, and worked in such a way that the owners need only let up whatever fish they wish, and that as a result the upper reaches will be denuded of salmon if the weir continues to be operated as at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister at the first opportunity <Col N="295" /> to get the Department to look into the matter.  From inquiries I have made, I am satisfied that salmon fishing on the Blackwater during the past year was at a disgracefully low ebb, and that that has meant a loss to people who own fishery rights along the river and who got substantial sums for them.  When people who leased these rights caught scarcely any fish, it cannot be expected that they will come next year and pay the same rents, if they cannot catch salmon.  Those interested in fishing are absolutely satisfied that the denudation is caused by the operations of this weir.  I do not wish to press the matter further now, because I assume that it will be possible for the Minister, in the Bill which is to be introduced, to take power to deal with it.  Before any further complaints are made, I suggest that the Department should, at least, investigate the position of the weir at Lismore, in order to satisfy itself as to whether the allegations made by the urban councils in the area are true.</P>
    <P>I imagine that if the Department does that the Minister will be perfectly satisfied that the lack of salmon in the Blackwater is due to the operations of this weir.  My information is that a considerable amount of money is being made by the proprietors of the weir, and that it is operated in such a manner as to prevent fish reaching the western reaches of the river.  As a result, fishery rights which could be let for substantial sums may be valueless, because people who were in the habit of fishing there will not come back.  I had not time to look into the matter in detail but, from inquires, I am satisfied that there is a great amount of truth in the allegation that the shortage of fish is occasioned by the working of the weir.  In view of the loss occasioned to riparian owners and ordinary people fishing for salmon this season and last season, it should be investigated as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There were some points raised on this Estimate by Deputy Brennan and Deputy Linehan.  I think it can be definitely stated that poaching by foreign trawlers has been <Col N="296" /> reduced, I might say, to a minimum. No matter what protection there is, foreign trawlers will be able to make a run in now and again, take some fish, and get away.  Unless we went to the very great expense of having cruisers dotted around the coast, I do not think we could do much better in the way of stopping poaching by foreign trawlers.  There have been very little complaints during the last six or 12 months.  I think we have struck what I might call the optimum balance between the cost of stopping poaching, and the stage we have reached in stopping it, and I do not think we would be justified in getting another cruiser for that purpose.</P>
      <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy Brennan as to the repayment of loans, the Deputy will realise that where you are giving loans to fishermen on a capital basis and collecting the loans by instalments, even though you might be doing quite a good business, there might be less money coming back during the year than is going out; in other words, if the Sea Fisheries Association intends to expand somewhat during the coming year and to issue loans rather freely, they would naturally give out very much more than they would get back, so that it is very difficult to form any judgement on one year's figures.  It takes some time to find out exactly what is the real position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want any misunderstanding. Possibly I misunderstood the Minister.  Did we not make loans last year and the year before?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>My contention is that those loans are being paid in and we are still making loans.  I do not see any reason for assuming that we ought to be making any allowance for a further wastage every year in the amounts paid in, because we are increasing our loans every year.  I am not making a comparison between what we are giving out and what we are getting in this year, but I do not see the sense in trying to justify our getting in less this year than last year unless we are giving out less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="297" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am going to talk about these loans in a general way.  It is very hard to deal with them in a detailed way, or even to put them into classes but, generally speaking, I think it may be said that the loans we made more than ten years ago, that is, before the Sea Fisheries Association came into operation, are lying there. Something has been collected on them, but, naturally, the amount collected on them every year is less because some of them have become hopeless, and probably might be written off as bad debts.  We have not, however, come to the point of writing them off yet.  As Deputies are aware, the Minister has no right to do so.  He must come to the Dáil before he can write them off. The repayments of the loans made by the Association when it came into office first are also becoming less.  They were, perhaps, a little optimistic when they came in first and they gave loans rather more lavishly than they would give them now.  They are not getting the money back so well on these, but I think it could be said that the loans issued during the last three or four years, since they adopted a more conservative policy and where they have come to regard the issue of loans as a business proposition and not so much as a relief measure, are, on the whole, a sound proposition.  That is all I could say.  It is very difficult to draw any inference from the results of the collections for a year.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan referred to another question, a bigger question, if you like, as to whether we are getting value for the expenditure on the Sea Fisheries Association.  That, again, is a very difficult question to answer.  When I first took over fisheries, I was inclined, as anyone was likely to be, to be rather doubtful as to whether the thing was a good proposition or not, but it had reached a stage then at which I thought it better to give it a few more years' trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister was optimistic in those days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not about the Sea Fisheries Association, anyway.  I might have been optimistic enough to think that I could do better myself, but I <Col N="298" /> was not tempted to take over the fisheries from the Sea Fisheries Association. I thought it better to let them continue.  I think I can say that, for the last year, the Sea Fisheries Association are beginning to get the confidence of the fishermen to a greater extent than before.  The proportion of fish marketed through the Association is much higher now than it was, so that the fishermen are evidently beginning to think that the Association is a good organisation, so far as they are concerned.  They are, as I say, beginning to market their fish to a greater extent through the Association, and I think that is a good sign, because, after all, they are the best judges.  Secondly, for the last season, that is, the season starting last October, the prices realised for the fishermen through the Association are better than in previous years, and that, I suppose, is the reason they are marketing more of their fish through the Association.  On the whole, I think it would be a mistake to scrap the Sea Fisheries Association, because it looks as if it is doing a little better than it was doing before.  I was asked why foreign trawlers cannot land fish here. I may be wrong in making that statement, but no fish can be landed here without a licence to the importer, and, since that system came into operation, the foreign trawlers have not landed fish here, I suppose, because the traders who get the licences prefer to import their fish from one of the big centres in England, and not to take their fish from a foreign trawler.  The foreign trawlers can scarcely call in with fish because they would not be sure of having all their fish taken by those who hold licences, and they go elsewhere to land their fish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Did they not call previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They did, when they could land the whole catch on the Dublin market and have it auctioned.  They cannot do it now, because the people who hold licences for the import of fish would not guarantee to take the whole catch from them.  I presume that is the position.  If the Department were to issue licences to foreign <Col N="299" /> trawlers to land fish here they would come, but the licences are not issued in that way.  They are issued to the importers on the basis of their imports last year, and they evidently have not thought it wise to bring in a trawler with fish.  They think it better to send a wire, a telephone message or a letter to one of the big fish distributing centres in England and to ask for the exact amount of the various classes of fish they want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does it not seem to be a mistake that we should allow trawlers to go over to Grimsby and deliver their fish there, and that then they should be delivered back to us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe the fish trade is a very complex business, because there are so many classes of fish, and customers who want cheap fish and other customers who do not mind paying a little more.  A person trying to carry on the fish trade must be particular about the classes of fish he imports on his permit, and he cannot take a trawler's whole catch because he might not be able to dispose of it.  Deputy Brennan also hoped that the new Bill would come into operation without any great delay.  I presume that he had in mind the big principle of the new Bill, that is, the taking over of the fisheries.  Other sections of the Bill, which deal with the ordinary fishing legislation with regard to the regulation of fishing and so on, will come in immediately, and we hope to make some progress with the first stages of the taking-over of the fisheries this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as staff is concerned, that will only mean a staff for a survey of the fisheries and I have come to the conclusion that by the time we make the necessary Orders and ask the Civil Service Commissioners for this staff, we will have very little payments to make in the present financial year.  We may have some, but they will not be very much.  The system of registration of these whale-catchers and factories in England and here is, I think, on the whole, satisfactory.  In any case, I am afraid we have to put up with it, because we cannot compel a whale-catcher to register here on the plea <Col N="300" /> that the factory is also registered here. It is a matter for the owner of the ship.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we not refuse his registration here altogether?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We could do that indirectly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems to be a cost to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not, but if we were losing on it, we could do so.  We could say to the owner of a factory ship: &ldquo;We will refuse to licence your ship unless you bring your catchers over.&rdquo; We are making, if the factory ship comes along and registers here, because even if all the catchers register in England, we get about 80 per cent. of the amount which the British Government receives towards expenses and even on that basis, it would be a paying proposition.  It is not every Minister can boast of making a profit out of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brennan said that in the introduction of the Estimate we did not show any great hope as regards fisheries generally.  Perhaps not. Speaking generally, the first thing we ought to do, as far as our fishermen are concerned, is to see as far as possible that the fish are there.  The protection of our fisheries by utilising cruisers to keep foreign trawlers out is one thing.  I claim that we have reached as satisfactory a stage as we can in that matter.  Our second aim is to prevent our own fishermen within our territorial waters from catching immature fish.  We have taken steps towards that end by an Act passed recently.  It is only very recently that we have begun to administer that Act, and we hope to make further headway in that direction.  The next step, if the fish are there, is to equip our fishermen to catch them.  The Sea Fisheries Association was set up for that purpose, to provide boats and gear for those who are unable to purchase them.  The Sea Fisheries Association are doing that and, I think, under present circumstances, they are doing as well as they can so long as we regard them as a business concern.  Some Deputies might consider <Col N="301" /> that the Association should be regarded more as a relief agency.  If we have to give out anything in the way of relief, that is a different matter. The Sea Fisheries Association was set up as a business concern, and the association must act on that understanding. Our third aim, if the fish are there, is to help the fishermen to market them under the best conditions. I think the Sea Fisheries Association have improved conditions a good deal in that respect.  They have helped the fishermen.  Certainly the great majority of the fish caught by the inshore fishermen is now marketed through the Sea Fisheries Association.</P>
    <P>With regard to salmon, I explained here in bringing in the Estimate&mdash;and we also had some discussion on this matter on the Fisheries Bill&mdash;that last year was a bad year, not only in Ireland but in the whole of western Europe, for salmon fishing.  The year before was not too good, but the year before that was good.  The decline complained of in the case of the Blackwater is, therefore, only part of the general decline in salmon fishing. I have had, indeed, general complaints from several quarters that the decline is due to a certain weir on the Blackwater. I do not know how that complaint should have emanted so spontaneously from so many quarters. Many Deputies and many public bodies appear to realise that at the moment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister would allow me for a moment, I might explain that my information&mdash;and I cannot vouch for the accuracy of it&mdash;is that up to a recent period the weir was being operated by lessees from the proprietors and that since the proprietors have taken over the weir from the lessees they are working it on a more aggravated scale than the lessees were. As I say, I cannot vouch for the accuracy of that statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department would naturally keep itself informed as to whether these weirs were being worked properly or not.  I think the Deputy may take it for granted that salmon are getting past that weir in the ordinary way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>May I put this point to the Minister.  I do not want to make the matter contentious at all.  The suggestion that was made to me is that there is absolutely no free gap.  I think that is the situation as far as the Lismore weir is concerned.  The free gap was abolished some time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a fair amount of discussion on a certain section of the Fisheries Bill on that subject.  It was explained then that a number of these weirs were passed by a certain body that sat away back in the &ldquo;sixties&rdquo;. For the consolation of Deputies, I should like to state that they will become the property of the State before long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">

    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I fear is that, without any investigation, no more salmon will go up when the fisheries are brought under the Department than now under the Lismore estate. That is the danger, unless you are prepared to allow more of a free gap than the Lismore estate has given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the State owned the weir they would have to keep in mind the desirability of allowing sufficient salmon to pass the weir to produce a crop of salmon for the coming years. I think that will be attended to.  I should like to assure the Deputy from inquiries I have made&mdash;I do not say <Col N="303" /> that I got an exact official report&mdash;but as a result of the very scant inquiries I was able to make after certain representations had been made to me here on the Fisheries Bill, I think the salmon are able to get past that weir. I should not like to guarantee to the Deputy that things are altogether satisfactory, but I think the anxiety that was expressed is largely due to the fact that last year was a bad season, not only on the Blackwater, and not only in this country as a whole, but over the whole of Western Europe.</P>

      <P>Section 11.  At the end of the section two new sub-sections added as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(3) Any person aggrieved by a declaration made under Section 59 of the Principal Act or this section may appeal within the prescribed time to the Minister against such declaration, and thereupon the Minister shall either confirm or annul such declaration.</P>
      <P>(4) Section 59 of the Principal Act is hereby amended by the deletion therefrom of paragraph (g) of sub-section (1), and the said section shall be construed and have effect accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 11 of the Bill was introduced on the Report Stage in the Dáil.  It is intended to extend the powers contained in Section 58 of the principal Act to works, the carrying out of which may be undertaken without the consent of the local authority and the remedying of which, when the scheme comes into operation, would prove unduly costly or seriously injure the amenities of the area.  A planning authority will now have the power under that section to prohibit the doing of any work and if the prohibition <Col N="304" /> is not observed to declare its nonobservance illegal, subject to the penalties imposed by Section 58 of the Act.  Obviously, there must be an appeal from such a declaration.  Such an appeal was intended under the provisions of Section 59 of the principal Act but that provision is not considered altogether suitable because it makes the appeal from the declaraton part of an appeal against a special prohibition in respect of which the declaration was made.  The result might be that where a declaration is made some time after the making of a special prohibition there would be no right of appeal.  The amendment introduced in the Seanad provides for a separate and distinct appeal from any declaration made under Section 59 of the principal Act or Section 11 of this Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 8, line 2, Section 10 (1), to delete the words &ldquo;prescribed standard of quality&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;quality which such official contractor stated in his application for appointment that he was willing to supply.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>On the Committee Stage, I said that that was a drafting amendment, but it was questioned, and so I withdraw it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>But will the Minister explain the difference to us even now? I would be anxious to hear what is the difference between the two things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard to prescribe the standard quality for all articles.  This amendment was considered on the Committee Stage and it was thought that it would be inapplicable in the case of some of the methods adopted for fixing the quality of a commodity.  In Section 19 the Minister may make regulations for the procedure to be adopted and prescribing the method of fixing or determining the standard of quality of a commodity.  Now the quality may be stated in three different ways.  The first would be by a description included in the particulars and specification. That is one way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite.  That would be a standard quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The second would be by reference to an official sample provided <Col N="306" /> by the Minister.  That would be another way, and a third way would be by submission of his own sample by the applicant.  The official tender form which the applicant fills up shows, for each commodity, how the quality is to be dealt with.  The third method&mdash; that is, the submission by the applicant of his own sample&mdash;is used in cases of a commodity like tea, where the Minister fixes a price and a comparison between the applicants' samples determines the matter of acceptance.  He says that he wants tea at a certain price, invites contractors to submit samples, and decides between them.  In that way, it is considered better to put in here the words &ldquo;quality which such official contractor stated in his application for appointment that he was willing to supply.&rdquo; That would cover that third method. We think it is much better to have that, and that it makes it clearer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It certainly makes it clearer in so far as an article such as tea is concerned.  It makes it more flexible and more elastic for the Minister and all concerned.  But as far as an article, such as cloth, is concerned, you are possibly doing yourself and the local authorities an injury there.  My opinion is that the words &ldquo;prescribed standard of quality&rdquo; would be a much better expression than to have him supply something which he himself states he is going to supply.  Even so far as tea is concerned, you could have got over that by leaving in &ldquo;standard of quality&rdquo; I am afraid that you are doing a bigger wrong in the one way than in the other.  I see the Minister's point so far as tea is concerned; that is, where the Minister asks for tea at, say 1/6 per lb., or even for cloth at, say 2/6 per yard. Now, if you make a comparison between the two, the Minister and the local authorities might be injured in the one case but not in the other.  I think it is better to have there, &ldquo;prescribed standard of quality&rdquo;.  I would much prefer to see the words left in.  I can quite see the difficulty about tea or some other commodity of that kind, but so far as hardware or cloth is concerned, I would much prefer that the standard of quality should be prescribed <Col N="307" /> rather than have somebody supply something that he said was worth 2/3 per yard, or 4/5 per yard, or whatever it might be.  I am afraid you are going to do an injury to the Department and the local authorities by putting in that amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, it has been well considered.  I do not agree with the Deputy.  I think the amendment is an improvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarSeanDoyle" hpid="Mr. P.S. Doyle Mr. P.S. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister think it right to accept the words that a contractor &ldquo;was willing to supply&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That he has stated that he is willing to supply.  He undertakes to supply an article of the quality which he has submitted in his sample, at the price at which he is asked to supply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That has been agreed on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  He says that he will do that, and he will be held to it. That is the contract.  You cannot prescribe a standard of quality for an article that may vary very much, and this makes it more elastic, as Deputy Brennan says.  Where a standard can be laid down it will be laid down.  At any rate, after due consideration it is thought that this is a better form than the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid you are doing us an injustice.</P>

      <P>In page 9, section 12 (3), to delete in line 37 and in line 41 the word &ldquo;accepted&rdquo; and substitute in each case the words &ldquo;applied for.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a drafting amendment also, and I withdrew it on the Committee Stage for the same reason.  Is the Deputy accepting this amendment?</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2A on the Order Paper:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In page 11, line 18, to insert the word &ldquo;wilfully&rdquo; before the word &ldquo;orders.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

      <P>Before passing from that, Sir, I should like to ask the Minister a question.  On the Committee Stage I asked to have some consideration given to the substitution of the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; in Section 14.  It was with a view to making the case of the Dublin Corporation, which is the largest municipal authority, in the purchasing line in particular, and, having regard to their varied requirements, and the Minister promised to have something more definite to meet their particular case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The undertaking was that the Act would not be put into force until the regulations were drawn up and published, and we will see that that happens.  The regulations will be circulated before the Act will be put into force.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 2A agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <P>In page 13, Section 17 (2), lines 26 and 27 to delete the words &ldquo;in Saorstát Eireann&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We do not think that there is any need for these words.</P>
      <P>Amendment put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>Bill, as amended, received for final consideration.</P>

      <P>We had quite a lot to say on this Bill on the Committee Stage.  I must say that the Minister for Lands, who deputised for the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, did not go far to meet us.  I have very grave fears regarding many clauses in the Bill.</P>
