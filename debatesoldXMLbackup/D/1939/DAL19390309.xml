      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether Bunreacht na h…ireann was deposited and registered with the Secretariat of the League of Nations, and, if so, on what date, and whether, arising out of its enactment, he expressed to the Secretariat of the League any opinion as to whether it modifies the operations of previous instruments registered by the League on the initiative of the former Executive Council of Saorst·t Eireann.</P>

      <P>Article 18 of the Covenant of the League of Nations relates only to the registration of treaties and other international engagements.  There is no provision in the Covenant for the registration of Constitutions.  Accordingly, Bunreacht na h…ireann was not deposited or registered with the Secretariat of the League.</P>
      <P>In these circumstances, no occasion arose for any communication to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations in the matter.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, will he say whether it was thought necessary to intimate to the Secretariat of the League of Nations that the enactment of the new Constitution in any way interfered with the obligations which were imposed upon us by the Treaty which was previously registered by the League?</P>

(before adding excise duty) realised for sugar sold; (c) the quantity of sugar pulp and molasses produced; (d) the net price realised for sugar pulp and molasses sold, or in the alternative, the estimated value per cwt. of the pulp and molasses produced, and the date on which the production campaign opened and closed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Nos. 4 and 5 together.  The information sought by the Deputy is of a private commercial nature pertaining to the internal conduct of the business of Comhlucht Siuicre Eireann, Teo., and I am satisfied that it is not in the public interest that it should be disclosed. Moreover, its disclosure in the absence of detailed and protracted explanation might lead to misinterpretation of the information accorded and to the deduction of inaccurate conclusions, as well as tending to uninformed comparisons of efficiency as between factories, which would be unfair to the company and its staffs. Furthermore, the disclosure of such information might be utilised to the detriment of the company's relations with bodies and persons with whom it has commercial contact.  The company has complied with its statutory obligations under Section 15 of the Sugar Manufactures Act, 1933.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, how does the Minister contend that the information sought by the Deputy is of a private commercial nature or that Comhlucht Siuicre Eireann, Teoranta, is a private company inasmuch as it depends for its existence on its licence from the Government to charge what it likes for its sugar?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to extend by one year the period within which a new building must be begun and completed in order to obtain partial remission of rates under Section 12 of the Local Government Act, 1927.  That Act, which applied only to new buildings completed before 1st October, 1930, enabled a reduction of two-thirds to be made in any increased valuation for a period of five years from the date of the increase or until the next general revaluation became effective, whichever was the shorter period.  By amending Acts in 1930 and 1934 rate remission was allowed on new buildings completed before 1st October last.</P>
      <P>It is intended to provide later in the year a separate Bill for rate remissions on dwellinghouses completed after 1st October next.  Experience has revealed certain defects in the working of Section 12 of the Act of 1927, and it is considered that remissions of rates on dwellinghouses completed after next October can be more satisfactorily dealt with in a new Bill than by amending the Act of 1927.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister whether the extension for one year applies to buildings other than dwellinghouses?  I take it it applies to all new buildings being put up, but that it only applies to them when put up before 1st October next.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has specifically fixed on what he is going to do in respect of dwellinghouses after 1st October next.  I should like to ask him whether, in extending this principle after 1st October next in regard <Col N="1782" /> to dwellinghouses, he proposes to depart to any great extent from the amount of the concession that is being continued.  I should particularly like to ask him why he makes no reference to buildings other than dwellinghouses after 1st October next.  The whole building industry, as the Minister is aware, is very much confused with regard to the Government's policy.  It will not be very much clearer as regards the Government's policy in respect of buildings other than dwellinghouses after 1st October next in respect of rates remission except he can say something about that now. Does he intend completely to drop rates remission in respect of new buildings other than dwellinghouses after 1st October next?</P>

      <P>This Bill was brought in because I could not get as early as I had hoped the more complete Bill which has been in draft for some time.  I had, therefore, to bring in this Bill to extend the law as it stands at present until the 1st October next.  It extends that law <i>in toto</i> as it stands.  With regard to the new Bill, I think Deputies will have to wait until they see it.  If, as Deputy Mulcahy suggests, there is great confusion in the minds of builders, perhaps it would help them to some extent if I said that my present intention is to restrict the remission of rates to new dwellinghouses when the new Bill will be brought in.  As to the extension of the remission of rates to rural houses, which Deputy Corish asked about, this Bill does not interfere with the present arrangement.</P>

      <P>I should like to make the point that the Minister has intimated that he is not going to give any further remission of rates to buildings other than dwellinghouses after 1st October next.  That is a rather important disclosure of policy on the part of the Minister.  There is no real urgency in connection with the matter. There might be something that we would like to say on the Committee Stage for the purpose of elucidating what is in the Minister's mind, or giving the Minister a further chance of dealing with points that no doubt will arise in a number of persons' minds as a result of what he stated to-day. Perhaps the Minister would leave the Committee Stage over until next week and he can get the rest of the stages then.</P>

The amendment puts down a figure of 12 months, and in some small country towns that might be a reasonable figure but here in Dublin it is going to take something like seven years to produce our plan.  If this amendment were adopted, it would mean that we could never do anything with regard to planning in Dublin because every time we passed a resolution it would only run to 12 months and then we would lose our powers and, presumably, would have to pass another resolution.  As I say, I am in entire sympathy with the principle of the amendment, but I cannot see how it is possible to produce any wording that would suit every size of town.</P>

      <P>Before Section 9, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Section 45 of the Principal Act is hereby repealed, and the following provisions are substituted therefor:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  When a planning scheme contains a provision conferring on the responsible authority power to regulate and control (whether generally or in particular areas) the design, colour, or materials of structures, any person aggrieved by a decision of the responsible authority made in exercise of such power may appeal from such decision to a tribunal whose members shall be selected as hereinafter provided from a panel, prepared by the Minister, of architects of special knowledge or practical experience, and on such appeal such tribunal may affirm, vary, reverse, or annul such decision, and may direct any party to such appeal to pay to any other party to such appeal the whole or part of the costs and expenses incurred by such other party in relation to such appeal.</P>
      <P>(2)  Any sum which the tribunal under this section directs any party to an appeal under this section to pay to another party to such appeal shall be recoverable as if it were a simple contract debt owing by the party by whom the tribunal has directed such sum to be paid to the party to whom the tribunal has directed such sum to be paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  A planning scheme which contains any such provisions as are mentioned in the first sub-section of <Col N="1790" /> this section may contain provisions regulating the constitution of the tribunal mentioned in the said sub-section and the selection and appointment by the responsible authority of the members of the said tribunal.</P>
    <P>(4)  When a planning scheme contains any such provisions for the selection and appointment by the responsible authority of the members of the said tribunal as are mentioned in the next preceding sub-section of this section, it shall be the duty of the responsible authority to select and appoint such members in accordance with such provisions from the panel mentioned in the first sub-section of this section.</P>
    <P>(5)  When a planning scheme containing any such provisions as are mentioned in the first sub-section of this section contains no provisions regulating the constitution of the tribunal mentioned in the said sub-section, the Minister shall by order provide for the constitution of the said tribunal.</P>
    <P>(6)  When a planning scheme containing any such provisions as are mentioned in the first sub-section of this section contains no provisions regulating the selection and appointment by the responsible authority of the members of the tribunal mentioned in the said sub-section, the Minister shall by order select and appoint such members from the panel mentioned in the said sub-section.</P>
    <P>(7)  An appeal shall lie from every decision of any tribunal constituted under this section to the judge of the Circuit Court having jurisdiction in the circuit in which is situate the structure to which such decision relates, and the decision of such judge shall be final.</P>
    <P>(8)  The grounds on which an appeal under this section shall be brought shall include the ground that carrying into effect the decision the subject of such appeal would involve unreasonable expense having <Col N="1791" /> regard to the character of the locality in which is situate the structure to which such decision relates and to the character of the neighbouring structures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an amendment, Sir, which does not make a very material alteration in the provision at present contained in the Principal Act &mdash;not the Town and Regional Planning (Amendment) Bill at present under consideration, but in the one that went before, and it is broadly founded on these principles.  A variety of matters arise in connection with any town planning scheme, many of which intimately affect the contractors or the builders or the property owners in the area to be planned.  Some of these considerations give rise to the question of expenditure by the owner of the property or by the contractor who is doing work, but other considerations also enter in.  If a scheme is submitted to the planning authority which, from its engineering point of view and its social point of view, is quite acceptable, there may arise artistic considerations which persons responsible for the city, taking the long view, should be entitled to review.  That is amply instanced in the history of our own city.  But for the fact that we had the Wide Streets Commissioners 150 years ago, instead of having O'Connell Street and Westmoreland Street we might have streets like Trinity Street, and those commissioners were induced to require the property owners in that neighbourhood to construct their buildings, not primarily from the point of view of public convenience or utilitarianism, but in order to preserve the amenities of the city as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, in those days, things were very much simpler than they now are, and the result of it was that if you committed to a body of ordinary men, who were interested in a problem of this kind, the supervision of an entire scheme, they had a wide culture and ample leisure to approach it from every aspect.  Under modern conditions, affairs have become so complex that, if you set up any kind of commission to examine into a town planning scheme, in general, it must contain so <Col N="1792" /> high a proportion of experts in engineering, sewerage, traffic, and so forth, that the aesthetic angle of the problem is very liable to be lost sight of. Furthermore&mdash;and this has to be borne in mind&mdash;it is very easy to raise public opinion on any matter relating to the welfare of the people or the public convenience, but it is not so easy to appeal to the masses of the people, who are busy with other things, on aesthetic matters or grounds.</P>
    <P>The public are not so profoundly moved by the question of how a scheme is going to look, if they are satisfied it is going to be convenient, and generally healthy and helpful.  Furthermore, it is often extremely difficult for the unskilled man to foresee how a scheme is going to look.  We are all familiar with the charming picture that is drawn of how a country hospital is going to look when built, and appalled when we come to look at the hospital. It is extremely difficult to relate the resulting structure to the picture we were shown when the plans were first submitted; it requires the trained eye to see that.  For these reasons, I am suggesting in this amendment that the Minister should set up a body, to which reference might be made by any interested party, on the question only of good taste and the appearance of the structure under review.  I propose to put on that body nobody but architects, that is to say artists as opposed to technicians.  That proposal is open to this great objection, that while aesthetics are an excellent thing, a sense of proportion should be preserved, and artists, being essentially temperamental persons, are inclined to go off the deep end, so that if you were building a pig-sty, they would require you to build it in accordance with the plans of Sir Edward Lutyens, which might be a very good thing to do, but in ordinary circumstances is not practicable. Therefore, no sensible person would suggest that the body I have in mind should have the last word, and the amendment proposes that if a body of artistic persons, after reviewing a scheme which is, from the utilitarian and the engineering point of view, fine, say that the materials proposed to be used, or the grouping of the buildings <Col N="1793" /> are calculated to injure the amenities of the city as an artistic whole, therefore it must be altered.  If the interested parties, and parties affected by their decision, felt that the proposed alterations suggested by the artistic body would involve expense out of reason, they could go to the Minister and he could review the decision as a practical man.</P>
    <P>My proposal gives the Minister this immense advantage, that he is always in the position to lean a little on this body by saying to interested parties who wanted to put up a gasworks in an inappropriate place: &ldquo;You cannot ask me to override a body of architects and give you permission to do this thing. If I did, I would be held up to public ridicule all over the country, and, though in my heart I sympathise with you in the difficulty into which you have been put, it is one out of which I cannot take you in the circumstances.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have.  That is why I am quite clear that the final decision should be left in the hands of the Minister, so that if they run amok the Minister can bring them back to a sense of relationship and restore a reasonable compromise.  From experience of Lords Mayor, I know how soft are the hearts of men like the Lord Mayor of Cork and the Lord Mayor of Dublin.  They are so carried away with anxiety to bring immediate relief and comfort to those with whose interests they are primarily concerned, the poor of their cities, that their aesthetic sense is sometimes a little upset.  They are in this difficulty, too, that pressure is brought to bear upon them to do something that they believe will, as a matter of fact, disfigure their cities, and they do not know on whose back they can put the blame for holding up a scheme until something more in accordance with aesthetic demands of their cities is submitted.  If this body was in existence, I suggest it would be a most useful whipping-board for the Lords Mayor and the Minister on which to put the blame for the aesthetic considerations, <Col N="1794" /> with which those who are practical men have very little patience. It may be argued that under the Principal Act provision is made for a body of this kind, on which there would be engineers and technical experts.  I do not want a committee of that kind to be responsible for future aesthetics, and I think it is going to be an embarrassment to the Minister to have a committee of that kind responsible for purely aesthetic questions.</P>
      <P>I have the view that from the aesthetic point of view alone, the Minister's hands, and the hands of local authorities are greatly strengthened, because they can isolate that general question from a body that is congruous by insisting that any scheme for which their sanction is asked should conform, at least, to a measure of this kind, and they can put the blame on the committee I have in mind.  I cannot see that the proposal involves us in any danger, because there is always an appeal from it to the Minister who, with his advisers, can temper artistic ecstasy with commonsense.  I say to the Minister that inevitably he must find, when this proposal comes to be considered in the Department by the body of permanent officials, with which the principal anxiety is to see that everything will be done in the most efficient way, that they are going to lean against this proposal, because they apprehend the architect as an irresponsible kind of person, whose only object is to spend excessively.  I fully understand that point of view, but I think the Minister will agree it can be carried too far, where we are dealing with permanent structures meant for future generations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason, I am suggesting that in any case, for an experimental period, the scheme that I submit should be given a chance.  If the Minister finds that instead of being a help it is an embarrassment, he can easily come back to the House, and ask it to restore the <i>status quo ante</i>, saying that this thing has not worked. I do not believe the harshest critics of the plan would say any more about it than that it was hopelessly Utopian, that it was impossible in practice, to give such wide discretion. <Col N="1795" /> If that be true&mdash;and I do not think it is &mdash;the best way to prove it is to give this scheme a chance.  If it fails, and is found to be holding up necessary work, we can mend our hands in the knowledge that, at least, we gave it a chance.  I do not want to labour the matter further.  I think I have made my position clear, and with the object lesson we have before us of what can happen in a modern city after seeing the quadrant of Regent Street replaced by the monstrosity that has been erected there, and having seen the abominations that masquerade as architecture in New York and other cities, we ought to guard cities like this very beautiful city against irreparable damage.  We have seen in certain spots, not far from the city, some architectural monstrosities erected within the last 20 years, which a body of this kind would certainly have stopped, because it would have been there for interested parties to appeal to.</P>
    <P>The amendment is urged in the interests of perfection.  Surely in a matter of this kind, this is an experiment worth making, and I think the Minister will find the House reasonable if he comes back later to say that it will not work.  He will find the House perfectly reasonable and grateful that, at least, he tried, and that it was only when he found that it would not work he came back and asked it to change, and to restore something in the nature of what is at present in the Principal Act.</P>

      <P>As far as our desire for the ideal is concerned, I do not think there will be any difference between Deputy Dillon and myself.  I would like to see such provision made in the law as would enable the best possible advice to be available to everybody concerned with town planning and new buildings.  Deputy Dillon, like myself, is a native of the City of Dublin, and has a love for it. Probably the things that we both have in mind would, for some years at any rate, concern Dublin and maybe Cork and the buildings therein more than anywhere else in the country.  A good <Col N="1796" /> deal of beauty still remains in this city that should be preserved.  Deputy Dillon, like myself, is anxious to see that beauty preserved, and that anything in the nature of new buildings put up in this city, in Cork or elsewhere should at least be worthy of the best in Dublin or elsewhere.  But I am rather fearful that what the Deputy proposes might not have the effect that he desires and that I desire.  I think we should leave the section as it stands, a section which Deputy Dillon himself played a large part in forming.  It was his amendment that provided the tribunal that is in the Act as amended.  When we were discussing the Principal Act I thought that his amendment at the time was a very reasonable and proper one, but the unfortunate part of it is that we have not had an opportunity of trying it out.  No case has been given to us yet to enable us to try out the section.  When it is tried out I believe it will give us the opportunity for a tribunal of any kind that we wish to set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister desires to set up a tribunal such as Deputy Dillon proposes in this amendment, a tribunal of architects only, there is nothing in the Act as it stands to prevent his doing so.  But what the Deputy wants in this amendment is to tie the Minister's hands and say to him that the tribunal to be set up must be one composed solely of architects.  I know quite a number of architects and have the greatest possible respect for them.  I know them to be men of taste and culture, but I have had in my career, not necessarily as Minister, but in my association with public life, come across more than one gentleman in that profession whom I regarded as a crank.  It is, of course, possible that you would get cranks among ordinary laymen or among other classes of men not of the architects' profession&mdash;they might be lawyers, doctors or accountants or anything you like&mdash;but on the question of architecture they might be cranks. I think it would not be wise to accept the Deputy's proposal.  I am only giving the House my own view.  This is a matter on which I hope every <Col N="1797" /> Deputy is as free as I hope I am.  I am giving you my personal view. There is no question of Party, of interest or anything of that kind.  In this matter it is the general consensus of opinion that we would like to make the Bill as good as it should be and as useful an instrument as we can possibly make it.</P>
    <P>I am, as I have said, fearful of restricting the powers of the Minister in this matter.  I would like to leave his hands free.  I would not myself be against trying out a panel of architects as I can do under the Act as it stands. I would not at all object to trying that system out, and if I had a few instances of trials of that kind, and found it did not work, I would like to be free, as I am free under the Act as it stands, to put in somebody else besides architects: to put in, for instance, competent laymen.  I do not think the architects would be very fond of seeing a member of the brother profession of engineering being put on the panel, but I would like, and I think any Minister would like, to have a panel composed of persons of different kinds on whose taste and judgment he could rely.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that the Minister's amendment is an advance on the present Bill, but we have found in our efforts at town planning here in Dublin that there are cases where advertisements have been placed on buildings or structures, which in our view are objectionable and detract from the appearance of those structures.  The intention of my amendment is to ensure that we shall have power to control those particular objects which are affixed to structures. It is admitted that there are many railway bridges in Dublin which are not things of beauty in the first place, but at the same time the view is held by some that the affixing of advertisements to them makes them rather worse.  It draws attention to them, and makes them more objectionable.  Under the present Act and under the Bill there is no power to control those advertisements.  If the Minister will accept my amendment we will then have power to control advertisements or anything of that nature either posted on a structure or painted on it.</P>

      <P>When a scheme is formulated there is no doubt that the planning authority can take power to deal with signs such as Deputy Benson has in mind.  In this new section, we propose to give additional powers to <Col N="1801" /> the planning authority to make certain that obstructions or other things which would cause irreparable damage can be dealt with.  We thought we had sufficient power in the Principal Act, but, a case in regard to destruction of trees, which was mentioned by Deputy Mulcahy here on the last day, brought to our notice the fact that perhaps we did not have that power.  At any rate, this new section will deal with that matter.  There is no doubt that the planning authority, once the scheme is adopted, will have power to deal with it.</P>

      <P>I quite agree with the Minister that when a plan is passed, those powers which I am seeking are there, but the point is whether it is worth inserting those few words for an extra five or six or, possibly, seven years of freedom from that.  In the smaller towns, where a plan will possibly take only a year or 18 months, it is not a very important matter, but here, as I have said already, it is going to take seven years, of which I think a little over one has gone.  Is it not worth inserting those few words in the Bill to enable us here and now to have those advertisements removed, and the appearance of the town improved to that extent?  Otherwise, we have got to wait.  Those people will have a sort of vested interest, and it will be harder to persuade the local authority to incorporate an appropriate section in the plan because they will say: &ldquo;Those unfortunate people have been there all those years; let us leave them there.&rdquo; If the Minister will adopt the suggestion, then that gives us the power right away to have those things removed, instead of having them there for the period between now and the actual coming into existence of the plan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I state for the benefit of the Minister that we have adopted the Regional and Town Planning Act, and we have appointed our town planning expert.  We have endeavoured to get the Great Northern Railway Co to remove a very large <Col N="1803" /> number of those hoardings within the borough boundary.  We have even instructed our law agent to take steps to compel them to remove them.  We even went so far as to get counsel's opinion, which was to the effect that we have no power under the Bill to compel anyone to remove hoardings. We have them in the main street.  One particular house was derelict and it has been let for the erection of hoarding boards.  We have no power under the Bill as it stands at present to compel people to remove those boards.  I am not in agreement with Deputy Brennan when he says he wants something similar to what I want, for this reason, that we have adopted the Regional and Town Planning Act, as I say, and our town planning expert has drawn up a zones system within that plan.  The industrial portion is relegated to one zone, the commercial to another, the residential to another, and so on.  With us, it is not a question of seven years, I am sorry to say.  It might rather be a question of seventy years, but a beginning has to be made somewhere.  It is our duty now to safeguard ourselves.  It is our duty to ask the Minister to take power and transfer that power to the local authorities to prevent people from erecting hoardings, particularly on gable ends of houses.</P>

      <P>This section is meant to deal with matters that might be irreparable.  If once a structure were put up the matter might be irreparable hereafter.  It is not the intention, in this section, at any rate, to deal with matters, with all respect, of minor importance, such as these advertising signs and other kinds of signs that have been referred to by the Deputies who have spoken.  I am quite anxious and willing to see that powers should be got somewhere to control these signs, but I do not think we could introduce them into this section.  This has a definite, deliberate purpose, to deal with obstacles or buildings or structures put up in a place or the destruction of things, such as trees, that could not be replaced.  We could see if it would be possible in some other way to deal with the problem to which Deputy Benson <Col N="1804" /> and the Mayor of Drogheda have referred, but this would be a very drastic power to take; it would be like getting a steam hammer to kill a fly&mdash;that is what it amounts to, taking powers to deal with that problem under the section with which we are dealing here.  Of course, the power will be there once the planning scheme is arranged.  The intervening period is the difficulty.  I do not think we can deal with the matter in the way Deputy Benson suggests.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12b:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 10, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in sub-section (1) of Section 58 of the Principal Act where a planning authority has made a special prohibition in relation to any work such planning authority may declare at any time before such planning scheme comes into operation that any contravention of such special prohibition before such coming into operation shall be unlawful and sub-section (2) of the said <Col N="1805" /> Section 58 shall accordingly apply to this section.</P>
    <P>This is rather a difficult matter to explain, and I hope I shall succeed in doing so.  Section 58 of the Principal Act, which this amendment seeks to amend, states that:&mdash;</P>
    <P>When a planning authority has passed a resolution for the making of a planning scheme and has, before such planning scheme comes into operation, made a special prohibition in relation to any work, such planning authority may... declare, at any time before such planning scheme comes into operation, that any contravention of such special prohibition before such coming into operation shall be unlawful.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, that &ldquo;may&rdquo; is qualified in this way:&mdash;</P>
    <P>if they are of opinion that the prejudicial effect of proceeding with or doing the work to which such special prohibition relates would be of such nature as to be incapable of being remedied after the coming into operation of such planning scheme.</P>
    <P>It is on those words, inserted there, that my amendment is based.</P>
    <P>The point is this.  Under that sub-section a planning authority may prohibit something, but unless the something is that which cannot be remedied after the coming into operation of such planning scheme, that prohibition is to all intents and purposes so much wasted breath, because nothing further can happen until the planning scheme is passed and then the person who has put up the structure, or whatever it may be, can be called upon to remove it.  But suppose, for instance, that in this city a body may desire to erect a structure for their own particular purpose, the publicity value attached to it and so forth, they may decide that they want something ultra-modernistic. That building may possibly be placed in juxtaposition to a building which has certain architectural beauties, shall we say.  Under the existing scheme the planning authority may prohibit the erection of that building, but if the body decides <Col N="1806" /> to flaunt that and proceed to build, nothing further can be done until the scheme comes into operation, when the local authority can require that body to remove the building.</P>
    <P>The Minister probably has a much better acquaintance with local authorities than I have and he will know, I am perfectly sure, that if, in actual fact, that building was proceeded with the heart of the local authority would be so soft that when they came to producing the plan they would not insert the clause requiring that building to be razed.  That is one extreme. The other extreme is one which the Lord Mayor of Drogheda has been speaking about.  It is the advertisement hoarding, a structure that obviously is easily demolished.  Supposing that plans are submitted to the local authority for the erection of an advertisement hoarding and they prohibit it and the advertiser, whoever he may be, ignores the prohibition and erects his hoarding, and for four, five, six or seven years receives revenue from that hoarding which the planning authority, in its wisdom, has decided is not desirable for aesthetic, traffic or some other good reason.  Having secured the revenue for five, six or seven years, the advertiser, once the scheme is passed, is required to remove his hoarding, which he does very simply and economically and, in the meantime, he goes off with the swag from the advertisements, spread over those years.  If this amendment is accepted, if the local authority makes a prohibition order they then may declare that it shall be unlawful, and, if in spite of their prohibition, the person decides to go on with the job they can then be prosecuted and presumably the job can be stopped, because I think there is a continuing fine in sub-section (2) of Section 28.  It may be objected that this is extending the interim powers of the planning authority too much, and I appreciate that the Minister has an objection to extending the interim powers too much for fear that the actual plan will never be made.  I have every sympathy with that view but, at the same time, I think the Minister should give to the planning authority sufficient power to enable them to make a good job of it once they have set their <Col N="1807" /> hand to the plough.  I hope that he will be prepared to accept this amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot accept the Deputy's amendment. It might have the effect that the Deputy refers to&mdash;that the planning scheme would not be adopted.  After all, we want to get the local authorities sympathetic to town planning and planning schemes, but if they study this Act and see that there are so many obstacles put in the way and so many, might I call them crimes, or at any rate illegalities, that they and their friends who own property or who have land to develop would be likely to infringe, the chances of getting town planning adopted in a widespread fashion by local authorities would be still more remote.  I think that the powers that the Deputy asks for are, at the present time at any rate, too drastic.  In 10 or 20 years, when we have had longer knowledge and experience of town planning and of the willingness of the local authorities and of the people to abide by the laws relating to town planning, it might be possible to be more strict and to make such things as a contravention of a prohibition order an illegality for which heavy penalties might be incurred, but at the present time I am afraid we would be going too far and the result might be that local authorities, even those that I think are what might be called advanced local authorities, like Dublin or Cork, might hesitate before putting into operation the powers that would be given to them, in addition to what are there already, if an amendment such as this were included in the Act.</P>

It is now we want them to prevent anything being done which would void any portion of the plan.  I admit right away that when the plan is made these things can be removed.  My point is that if the thing is there and if it is substantial <Col N="1808" /> a local authority, certainly the only one I have any direct experience of, would be so soft-hearted as not to enforce it, and I think probably every Deputy who has any knowledge of local authorities would agree.</P>
      <P>There is another point, too, that arises on the Minister's reply.  Is it absolutely essential that the plan should ever be made?  It is possibly a new view point.  I do not know.  I did see an address delivered by somebody in England recently where it was suggested that it was not necessary that a planning authority should actually ever produce a plan.  It is obvious that they must have some plan to work to, but it was suggested that they need not ever produce the statutory plan. Whatever plan is made has got to be fluid.  It is impossible to produce a plan to-day and say that it has got to hold for the next ten or 15 years.  It cannot possibly.  There is, I believe, a body of opinion on this subject coming around to the view that the actual statutory plan should never actually be made.  Of course, the natural corollary to that is that powers should be increased, such as I have indicated here. Provided the local authority has some plan, as it must have some plan of its own, to work to, it is an arguable question as to whether the statutory plan should ever be produced.</P>

      <P>How the law would be interpreted by lawyers or by courts as to whether the plan should actually be published as a plan and as the last word on the subject, or not, I cannot say, but the law at present is that they must have a plan.  The local authority must have a plan before all these powers, prohibition powers and others, will operate.  The Deputy perhaps may not have as much experience of local authorities as I have had but, evidently, from what he says, he has a fair amount of experience of them. They generally are soft-hearted bodies, especially when dealing with enterprising people, who are developing land and putting up buildings.  What would happen if there was a prohibition order issued and that prohibition were disregarded? Possibly sufficient influence and power could be brought to bear on that local authority to develop in <Col N="1809" /> another way in order to avoid asking the property owner concerned to knock down his building.  It is true that any local authority would hesitate, if a man had built a house on a spot where they had intended a road to go, although he was warned and although he was prohibited.  He took a chance and built the house, and ten chances to one the local authority would go around the house and make their road somewhere else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>Possibly, but I am glad to say that the people I have come in contact with are extremely keen on town planning, and I am perfectly sure that if the town planning authority here in Dublin had this power and made a prohibition order they would see that no action was taken which would void it.  That is one thing, but it is quite another thing, as the Minister has admitted, expecting the local authority to have a building razed after it had been erected contrary to a prohibition order.  They would have no compunction, I am perfectly sure, about stopping a thing ever starting.  That is a different matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister very seriously to consider whether he cannot make this concession to meet cases of that sort.  I think his own statement <Col N="1810" /> just now shows that something of this sort is desirable, because I cannot conceive of any Minister with his eyes open allowing any body to be set up and having on the face of it certain powers and yet leaving a loophole such as is left here by which that body can be openly flouted and the person who does so get away with it, as they would; there is no doubt about it.</P>

      <P>I am as keen, I think, as anybody could be on getting the ideal town planning legislation available for this country and available for all the local authorities, but I would like to see it worked.  That is my difficulty.  Knowing human nature and knowing local authorities, knowing even Ministers, to be people that do not like to be too hard-hearted, I hesitate to put a clause of that kind into the Bill.  I am afraid it would not help to make the thing work at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister surely would admit that, if he put a clause of that description into the Bill, that clause would be more likely to be enforced than the one which is in the Principal Act, of destroying after the building is erected.  Obviously, if you prohibit a man from starting a thing at all, there may be a temporary hardship on him, but he can go somewhere else.  It is entirely different from asking him to pull his building down once he has built it.</P>

      <P>A planning authority may at any time revoke or amend a special prohibition previously made by such authority, but such revocation or amendment shall not prejudice or affect the operation of such special prohibition during any period prior to such revocation or amendment.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1811" /> Amendment No. 15.&mdash;Before Section 11, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  In this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;interim direction&rdquo; means a direction to do or refrain from doing any act given by a planning authority directly or by implication by refusing a special permission, by granting a special permission subject to conditions, or by making a special prohibition:</P>
    <P>the expression &ldquo;interim period&rdquo; means the period between the passing, by the planning authority who gave the interim direction in relation to which such expression is used, of the resolution for the making of the relevant planning scheme and the coming into operation of such planning scheme.</P>
    <P>(2)  Any person to whom an interim direction has been given may apply to the Minister within the prescribed time for an order declaring that compensation shall be payable in respect of such interim direction, and the Minister on such application may make the order so applied for if he is satisfied that compensation would be payable under the Principal Act in respect of such interim direction were it contained in a planning scheme and that undue hardship would result to such person from compliance with such interim direction during the interim period.</P>
    <P>(3)  Subject to the provisions of the next following sub-section of this section, an order under this section shall come into force on the expiration of six months from the making thereof.</P>
    <P>(4)  An order under this section shall not come into force and shall be void and of no effect if during six months from the making thereof the interim direction in respect of which such order was made either has not been complied with or has been revoked.</P>
    <P>(5)  Where an order under this section has come into force, the provisions of the interim direction in respect of which such order was made shall have effect and be <Col N="1812" /> enforceable during the interim period as if they were contained in the relevant planning scheme, as if such scheme were in operation, and as if, for the purposes of such provisions, the responsible authority were the planning authority who gave such interim direction and the relevant date were the date when such interim direction was given.</P>
    <P>(6)  Where an order under this section in respect of an interim direction is in force and the value of any property in respect of which such interim direction was given is reduced by the enforcement of such interim direction, any person having an estate or interest in or right over or in respect of such property shall, on making application therefor within (but not after) two months from the coming into force of such order, be entitled, subject to the provisions of the sections of the Principal Act applied by the next following sub-section of this section, to be paid by the planning authority who gave such interim direction by way of compensation the amount (if any) by which his estate or interest in or right over or in respect of such property is so reduced in value and, in the case of the occupier of such property, the damage (if any) to his trade, business, or profession occasioned by such enforcement.</P>
    <P>(7)  The provisions of Sections 67, 71, 75 and 76 of the Principal Act shall apply in relation to compensation under this section from a planning authority for injury caused by the enforcement of an interim direction and in relation to the assessment and recovery of such compensation in like manner as they would apply in relation to compensation under Section 61 of the Principal Act from the responsible authority in respect of the coming into operation on the date when such interim direction was given of a provision in a planning scheme to the same effect as such interim direction and in relation to the assessment and recovery of such compensation.</P>

    <P>(a)  an interim direction has been given, and</P>

    <P>(c)  the relevant planning scheme has come into operation,</P>
    <P>no compensation shall be payable under Part VIII of the Principal Act in respect of the reduction in value of any estate, interest or right or the damage suffered by any person by reason of the coming into operation of so much of any provision in such planning scheme as is identical or substantially identical with or to the same effect as such interim direction.</P>
    <P>(9)  Section 64 of the Principal Act shall not have effect in relation to an interim direction in respect of which an order under this section has come into force.</P>

      <P>Our experience so far has told us that a section of that kind is very necessary, but it would also require to have, to back it up, a further amendment such as we suggest in Section 11 in respect of compensation. This would allow compensation to be paid to persons who had, during the interim, done something such as putting up buildings or structures of one kind or another for which the law heretofore did not allow any compensation to be paid.

      <P>I think this new section is a valuable addition to the Bill because, apart from anything else, it enables a local authority, from my reading of it, to discover, as it goes along, what its compensation claims are likely to be, and gives it the opportunity of withdrawing, if it considers that the compensation will be more than the amenity is worth.  At the present moment, a plan would have to <Col N="1814" /> be passed and become a statutory plan before a local authority could discover what it had let itself in for.  Local authorities will now have a chance of finding out, as they go along, and withdrawing, if it is too expensive.</P>

      <P>To delete sub-section (1) and substitute a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(1)  A planning scheme may contain provisions (either in relation to roads generally or in relation to one or more specified roads) empowering the responsible authority to determine the frontage line of buildings and other structures adjoining a road in the area to which such planning scheme relates which is constructed, diverted or widened after the making of such planning scheme and for which a frontage line is not determined by such planning scheme or for which the existing frontage line has become obsolete and prescribing the notices to be given and the procedure to be followed in relation to the exercise of such power.</P>
      <P>The intention of this sub-section is to confer power on the responsible authority to determine the frontage line of structures on new or improved roads that are not specifically referred to in the scheme.  This is a very necessary power, as we have found.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>(2)  Whenever an appeal is made to the Minister under the Principal Act <Col N="1815" /> or this Act or under any provision of a planning scheme against a decision, requisition, determination, or other act of the responsible authority, the Minister, if he so thinks proper, may on deciding such appeal direct any party to such appeal to pay to any other party to such appeal such sum as the Minister shall, in his absolute discretion, specify as reasonable compensation to such other party for the expense occasioned to such other party in relation to such appeal.</P>
    <P>(3)  Any sum which the Minister under this section directs any party to an appeal to pay to another party to such appeal shall be recoverable as if it were a simple contract debt owing by the party by whom the Minister has directed such sum to be paid to the party to whom the Minister has directed such sum to be paid.</P>

      <P>In fact, it does.  The amendment seeks to substitute for the Minister the Circuit judge in the provision whereby the Minister may by order make regulations prescribing the time within which appeals may be made and may direct the making of certain payments.  That is what Deputy Costello was trying to get at.  He seeks to take from the Minister his absolute right to fix damages, compensation, or whatever moneys should be paid by a planning authority to an aggrieved person.  I understand that his intention was to leave the law as it stands, so that a person will have the right to bring his case into court where the matter will be properly determined.  So far as I can see, that is the root of his amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment suggests putting up a county court as against the Minister as the tribunal on planning schemes.  I do not think there is any doubt that in the working of the town planning legislation so far it has been demonstrated that it is wise to have the Minister as the deciding authority for appeals such as these. He has every facility.  He is in touch with all the details of the work; he has the staff to advise him; and he has competent people who are specialists in <Col N="1817" /> this subject that no judge could have. That has been our experience, and we strongly suggest to the D·il that it is wise to leave the appeal in these matters to the Minister.  There are in other sections appeals to Circuit Court judges on various matters, but in respect of this section it is thought wise to leave the decision to the Minister. I am sorry Deputy Costello is not here. I do not know that he is very serious in suggesting that that appeal to the Minister should be taken away.  What he was serious about was that the Minister should not have the right to impose costs, and we have amended that section.  Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Costello were both strong on that point, and I think Deputy Costello said it was a suggestion without any precedent that he knew of.  That, however, is not so, because Deputy Mulcahy himself was responsible for legislation in 1931 in connection with the Housing of the Working Classes Act which contained an exactly similar provision.</P>

I do not know what machinery the Minister will have to assess compensation if a big matter arises.  I do not think it was wise at all to leave to any Minister&mdash;I do not care who he is&mdash;the power of assessing compensation in his absolute right.  After all, the courts are there to determine those things.  The Minister may say, by way of reply, that delays may occur, and that some important things may be held up.  That may be, but we may not be assured of justice.  Possibly the local authority may feel aggrieved, and they should have the right to go into the court, and the court is there for them.

    <P>the word &ldquo;development&rdquo; when used without qualification means the <Col N="1823" /> development of land wholly or mainly by the erection of buildings of the class or of any one or more of the classes specified in the relevant restricted development provision.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill gives certain powers, between the coming into operation of a planning scheme and the coming into force of a road plan.  The amendment suggests that instead of these powers becoming operative at the date of the coming into operation of the planning scheme, they should become operative at the relevant date, that is the date of the passing of the resolution.  I am prepared to admit that that is possibly asking too much, but if the Minister would agree, instead of having the period fixed as the time of the coming into operation of a planning scheme, to fix the period as the date of the passing of this Act.  I think it would be a reasonable compromise.  I think this power should be given to the local authorities and that they should not be asked to wait for the coming into operation of the planning scheme. Many of the arguments I have used here have been already used and I do not think that the Minister would desire me to repeat them.  They have reference to the magnitude of the Dublin plans and so forth.  I think these arguments hold equally well on this section.  I think that having regard <Col N="1827" /> to the length of time it takes to prepare a planning scheme, even if this power were not to be exercised until after the passing of the Act, it would be some advantage to have that power, and not to have to wait until the planning scheme has come into operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a good deal of sympathy with what Deputy Benson has in mind, but I think he would agree himself that to make this law operative retrospectively might involve a grave injustice.  A man may have developed a road or part of a road, two three, four or five years before a plan becomes operative, and the local authority is to be given power to make that man, though the plan was not in existence, pay part of the expense of the development of that road, because it comes within the scheme of the plan.  It might in many cases mean a grave injustice to the individual.  That is the greatest objection I have to it. But the principal objection is that it would mean legislating retrospectively. I know what the Deputy has in mind, and we would like if possible to utilise his suggestion, but I think the best way to approach the matter would be to make the plan operative as soon as possible.  We have gone a long time in our cities and towns without any plans. We cannot go back on what has been done, and we cannot ask people who have put up roads or structures to go back and pay part of the cost of the development.  That is what would happen if we allowed the local authorities to compel an individual who has developed a road to pay part of the cost of development if the development took place five years, or even one year, before the plan came into operation. There seems to be an element of injustice in that, and I do not think that the D·il would readily agree that it would be a wise principle to put into our legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>The point surely is that the road will have been made in accordance with the plan, but before the plan becomes a statutory plan. That is the only difference.  It will, in fact, or should in fact, have been made <Col N="1828" /> in accordance with the plan, but owing to the delay in bringing the plan into operation, although it is made in accordance with the plan, the owner of the area developed may escape liability.</P>

      <P>I would hardly call it legislating retrospectively.  I have suggested a compromise between my amendment and the Bill as it stands, that is to say, that anybody engaged in development work will know that when the plan becomes statutory he may be called upon to make this contribution.  He will know that the road is being constructed in accordance with what the plan will be when it is eventually put into operation.</P>

    <P>(c)  until such notice is complied with or enforced under this sub-section, the beginning or continuation of the erection on the land to which the relevant road plan relates <Col N="1832" /> of any building of the class or of any of the classes specified in the relevant restricted development provision shall be a contravention of such provision;</P>
    <P>(d)  whenever the responsible authority in exercise of a power conferred by this sub-section has done any work or thing on or in respect of any structure or any land, the responsible authority shall be entitled to be paid by and to recover (as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction) from the developing owner all expenses reasonably incurred by the responsible authority in doing the said work or thing so done as aforesaid, and</P>
    <P>(e)  all moneys recoverable under this sub-section by the responsible authority in respect of expenses incurred by them shall, immediately upon completion of the work or thing in the doing of which such expenses were so incurred, become and be a charge on the estate of the developing owner on the land on which such work or thing was done or, in the case of any work or thing done on or to a structure, in such structure (if and so far as it still exists) and in the rateable hereditament or tenement consisting of or including such land or structure.</P>
    <P>On the Second Stage of the Bill, Deputy Benson suggested that some power might be taken under Section 16 of the Bill to allow the local authority to specify the order in which work in pursuance of a road plan is to be done. I am satisfied that such a power is necessary so as to facilitate proper development where the road plan would affect the interests of two or more developing owners.  The new section proposed includes a provision enabling a developing owner to appeal to the Minister against a notice requiring the carrying out of one or more specified provisions of the road plan, and the Minister may decide the appeal in either of the ways specified in sub-section (2).  Where a notice is enforced and is not complied with by the developing owner within the time allowed, the responsible authority may then carry out the work and for <Col N="1833" /> that purpose enter upon the land, the reasonable expenses of the responsible authority being recoverable from the developing owner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Vote on Account quite properly affords the House an opportunity of reviewing not merely the extent of Government expenditure during the year but the tendency of Government policy and enables us to take stock of the road on which the nation is travelling.  Some of the <Col N="1835" /> speeches made from the Government benches in this debate and in other debates would appear to indicate that everything in this country is satisfactory and that the country is on the high road to prosperity.  But, unfortunately, for that type of mental complacency, there are very disturbing factors which do not at all justify the claim either of prosperity or of economic stability.  There are many factors by which the prosperity of the nation can be judged.  Deputy T. Kelly speaking last night thought that farmers were necessarily prosperous because, on the occasion of an All-Ireland football final he saw a large number of provincial motor cars in town.  But history, and economic facts which are easily ascertainable, tell us that you can have in a country enormous wealth on the one hand and abyssmal poverty on the other.  The fact that there may be an increase in the use of motor cars is no indication in respect of masses of the people that they have attained either prosperity or economic security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasKelly" hpid="Mr. T. Kelly Mr. T. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave more reasons than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that the Deputy gave some very interesting and humorous reasons.  But we can advert to certain factors and test the tendency of the national barometer by them. We can refer to these factors and see to what extent they indicate either progression or retrocession.  If we take, for instance, the problem of unemployment, I think nobody will for one moment pretend to believe that the situation in this country to-day is comforting in any respect.  According to Department of Industry and Commerce figures, we had on the 13th of last month 105,000 persons registered as unemployed at the labour exchanges; and on the 14th January, the last date for which figures are available, we were informed by the Department that 38,000 persons were employed on relief schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of the 38,000 persons employed on relief schemes, I suggest that not less than 60 per cent. were employed on the notorious rotational schemes which enable them to obtain employment for <Col N="1836" /> three or four days per week and at a rate of wages only slightly in excess of what they would receive, if they were entirely idle, under the Unemployment Assistance Act.  So that in a small State such as this, with a dwindling population, we find 105,000 persons registered as unemployed at the labour exchanges, satisfying the rigorous tests imposed by the Unemployment Assistance Act that they are in fact unemployed and genuinely seeking work; and we have another 38,000 temporarily off the regular list of unemployed by resort to devices such as the rotational schemes of employment.  When we talk of prosperity and delude ourselves into believing that the country is on the high road to prosperity, we ought to try to leaven our enthusiasm by advertence to facts of that kind.</P>
    <P>Passing from that, we come to the question of home assistance; and here again, according to departmental figures, we have 80,000 persons in receipt of home assistance or outdoor relief.  If you survey the problem of unemployment and, at the same time, survey the extent to which it is necessary for persons to seek home assistance, you get a picture of a vast mass of poverty-stricken people in this country existing on standards to-day which do not enable them to provide themselves with an adequate livelihood. Every person in receipt of unemployment assistance benefit is in receipt of a scale of benefit much below the poverty level.  Nobody could pretend to believe that the inadequate rates of home assistance granted in this country are capable of providing even a poverty level of existence for those who are unfortunately compelled to resort to that method of sustaining themselves.</P>
    <P>The position, therefore, in respect of these two twin and inter-related problems is a deplorable one, and there is no evidence whatever that the magnitude of the problem tends to decrease in any respect.  But we need not test the tendency of our national march by advertence only to these factors.  Another, and perhaps a more illuminating field can be explored, and that is the field of emigration. Between the years 1936-7 and 1937-8 the population of this country went down <Col N="1837" /> by 30,000 people.  In the ten years from 1926 to 1936, according to official figures, 166,000 persons emigrated.  In other words, during that period, for every three persons who died one person emigrated.  Between the same years, 1926 to 1936, births exceeded deaths in this country by 163,000 persons.  Due, however, to the fact that emigration exacted from the nation a toll of 166,000 emigrants, we find that the nation has lost its entire natural increase in population within those years and, in addition, we have exported 3,000 other persons for the same period.  So that, what we are doing to-day as a nation is: we are losing entirely the natural increase in population in this country by emigration, and we are even going further: we are exporting even some of the residue of the population as well.  That toll of emigration is the most serious indication that the position of the nation is far from healthy.  Every progressive country in the world to-day&mdash; certainly every country where unnatural methods in the limitation of population are not encouraged&mdash;is showing a substantial increase in its population.  Here in this country our natural increase in population is being eaten up by emigration, and even the balance of the population is not kept at a stable level either.</P>
    <P>That represents the position of the nation as a whole, but the position in the rural areas, of course, is even worse.  The whole tendency, particularly in recent years, has been for people to leave the countryside and try to seek in the towns and cities the employment and the amusement and the excitement which are lacking in the countryside.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce recently indicated that that was not an unhealthy tendency and that, in fact, there was nothing to worry about in a continuance of that movement.  The Minister may express these views, and he may find comfort and solace in them, but everybody who has surveyed the same problem in every country in the world has come to an entirely different view, and that is that it is unhealthy to see the agricultural population leaving the land, going into the overcrowded towns <Col N="1838" /> and cities, going in to compete for employment in an already overcrowded labour market and adding, in these towns and cities, to the grave problems which go hand in hand with huge aggregations of population.</P>
    <P>In this country the tendency to drift from the rural areas into the urban areas has continued on a scale that ought to excite the grave concern of every person charged with the problem of distributing our population in the manner best calculated to promote the maximum productivity.  If we examine the position in rural areas we find a very disconsolate picture confronting us.  I have examined the picture in respect of certain counties which have a substantial rural population.  During the ten years from 1926 to 1936, the County of Leitrim has lost 9 per cent. of its population; Roscommon has lost 7 per cent. of its population; Cavan has lost 7 per cent. of its population; Donegal had lost 7 per cent. of its population; Mayo has lost 6.6 per cent. of its population; Kerry has lost 6 per cent. of its population, and Clare has lost 5.5 per cent. of its population.  That is a tendency which clearly indicates that there is a considerable exodus from the land and that the inevitable development, unless we take steps to arrest it, will be to denude the rural areas of population and to intensify the social, economic and industrial problems as they exist in the towns to-day.</P>
    <P>If we pass from emigration and come to another factor which can be examined in respect of our national tendency&mdash;the question of the marriage rate in this country&mdash;a picture presents itself to us which is anything but comforting. Official statistics show that of 460,000 males between 25 and 50 years of age, no less than 250,000 of them are single: equivalent, therefore, to a population of single males, between those ages, of 54 per cent.  There are in the country 200,000 males between 25 and 35 years of age.  Of that number only 56,000, or 28 per cent., are married or are widowers.  Of that enormous and virile population, not less than 72 per cent. are single.  The position, of course, is bad when you take a national figure, but it is even worse when you advert to the position in agriculture.  Of all the <Col N="1839" /> males between 25 and 35 years of age who are employed in or associated with agriculture, not less than 82 per cent. are unmarried.</P>
    <P>These statistics show that the nation is in a dangerous and in an unhealthy condition.  They show that, so far as the population is concerned, &ldquo;The Celt,&rdquo; as the London <i>Times</i> stated on one occasion, &ldquo;is rapidly going.&rdquo;  There is no other end for a nation except extinction, where you have emigration on the gigantic scale that exists to-day, and such an inordinately large number of the male population unmarried.  It is not from choice that the males elect to remain unmarried. The low marriage rate is merely an outward symptom of a very dangerous inward disease.  It is a kind of external sore, indicating that the patient is in a very serious condition, and that position will tend to get worse, and the evils less easy to grapple with, the longer we delay applying the obvious solution which it calls for.  If we advert to such factors as the low marriage rate, the gigantic scale at which emigration is taking place, the large number of persons in receipt of unemployment assistance benefit, or registered as unemployed at the employment exchanges, or to the home assistance figures, we will get, conjointly, a picture which ought to cause considerable perturbation in the minds of the Government.  When we remember that we are a small country territorially, and small from the point of view of population, the extent of the problem, under the four heads to which I have referred, must inevitably demonstrate that courageous handling of the situation is called for, if it is not to get very much worse.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the point of asking whether the Government has any plans for dealing with a situation of that kind, whether the Government proposes to take any steps to deal with it under these heads, or whether we are, merely, to have a continuance of the policy of drift that we have seen in operation so long, with all the appalling consequences that inevitably go with that policy.  In the industrial sphere there is no indication whatever that any phase of the Government's <Col N="1840" /> present programme is calculated to absorb the unemployed people into productive employment.  The London Agreement, especially Section 8, has caused considerable uneasiness amongst industrialists.  Wherever industrialists have gathered at banquets or conferences, there has been a general complaint by them, that they have reason to fear the effect on Irish industry of implementing that section, which provides for a review of tariffs which were imposed on imported commodities.</P>
    <P>If you talk to any industrialist whose business is being supported by the continuance of the tariff policy you will find that he has grave fears as to his ability to compete against foreign products, if there is a review, in the interests of British manufacturers, of tariffs which were imposed on imports. I do not think it can be denied that since the London Agreement, not only has there been a slowing down of production here, but there has been a considerable contraction in the number of persons finding employment in industries.</P>
    <P>Industrialists are uneasy as to the results which are going to flow from the London Agreement, and such reviews as have taken place by the Prices Commission all indicate that their fears in that respect are well founded.  There have been reductions of tariffs under the Agreement, and also since it was made, on certain commodities. Industrialists fear that other reductions are about to come about. The reductions are not being imposed for the purpose of protecting Irish consumers, but, in each case, are the result of applications by British manufacturers, to have existing tariffs reviewed.  Judging by the decisions of the Prices Commission, the English manufacturers have no reason to complain about the sympathetic manner in which their applications are being considered. The Agreement had a very disconcerting effect upon Irish industry and Irish industrialists.  Those who had their cases heard before the Prices Commission, on applications made by British manufacturers, even though the decisions involved reductions in the tariffs on goods, are in a much more satisfactory position than those whose <Col N="1841" /> cases have not yet been reviewed.  At least, in cases in which decisions have been given, it is possible to know what the difficulty in future will be, and to try to plan to meet it, but in the other cases, where the results are still unknown, there is considerable uneasiness. By the time their cases come up for review, they fear that the existing uncertainty and uneasiness will give way to the very definite fear that it is not possible to compete advantageously with British imports.</P>
    <P>I remember reading the buoyant Government advertisement that was issued during the last election, promising all milk and honey, and an abundance of factories.  I think we were told in one advertisement that 300 more new factories would be established.  I have been watching patiently to see a substantial instalment of these factories established.  How many new factories and how many new industries have been established since the London Agreement?  Far from the possibility of having new industries established, there has been no real industrial development since the London Agreement.</P>
    <P>I know of two groups who were in terested in putting up new industries, who inspected sites, discussed the question of getting local capital, and arranged to make deposits of capital on their own behalf and who took steps to advance the establishment of the industries.  Then the London Agreement came along, and they said it was too risky to put money into industry now, so long as British manufacturers could, on application to the Prices Commission, manage to secure a review of the tariffs which had been imposed, and, in that way, make it a highly risky and speculative undertaking, to try to compete in a small country, with a limited market, with goods from highly developed, highly rationalised, and highly capitalised undertakings, on the other side of the Channel, with a long tradition of craftsmanship to support them.  There is no sign of the 300 factories.  If there is, I am entitled to ask the Government where they are, and what employment they are providing.  If they are not there, I am entitled to ask when we <Col N="1842" /> may expect them, seeing that that was part of the covenant on which the Government asked for votes at the last general election.</P>
    <P>At one time the Government believed that it had a very easy solution of the unemployment problem.  We had rosy pictures about the solution of unemployment in this House from members of the Government when they were in opposition.  One might refer, without wanting to be merely ironically humorous, to the prophecy of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, that he was afraid it would not be possible to get all the people required in this country to do the work the Government was going to make available, and that it would be necessary to comb out the cities of America in order to bring back the exiles.</P>
    <P>One may also refer to the speech made by the present Minister for Defence, who, when told that there were 70,000 unemployed said &ldquo;Ah, well, should we not be glad to have them to do all the work that the Government is going to make available for them.&rdquo;  These speeches have an ironic ring about them to-day.  They only indicate either how little the present Government then knew about the problem of unemployment or how weak and inept they are to-day in trying to grapple with that problem.  But one expects that a person like the Taoiseach, when speaking on the subject of unemployment, would at least use words which he felt represented a solution of the problem on responsible lines.  Let us take some of the Taoiseach's speeches as indicating what his policy in respect to unemployment was then, and see what has been done in the meantime to implement the promises which he then made or to give effect to the views which he then uttered.  Speaking in this House on the 2nd December, 1931&mdash;volume 40, col. 2362&mdash;the Taoiseach said that the problem of unemployment</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Is not a new problem; it has been there for a considerable time. ...  We have partially solved it by emigrating people from this country who could not get employment in it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1843" /> That was two months before the Taoiseach took office.  Later he said:</P>
    <P>`The cure for unemployment in this country lies in supplying ourselves with the manufactured goods which at the present moment we needlessly import....  The solution of unemployment is easier to find in this country at the present moment than it is in any other country facing that problem....  We will find that there are over 55,000 unemployed. ... I feel certain that a figure like 60,000 is a minimum figure for the number of people who are unemployed at the present moment.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On that occasion the Taoiseach felt that we had a problem which we partially solved by emigration, but that it was a problem which was easier of solution here than in any other country in the world.  After seven years of government by the same Taoiseach we have, according to the latest figures from his Department of Industry and Commerce, 105,000 persons registered as unemployed at the employment exchanges, and over 20,000 of them working on minor relief schemes, getting low wages for three or four days' work per week.  The Taoiseach then realised realistically that there was considerable waste involved in having a large number of persons unemployed.  Addressing the House in the same debate, he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;These 60,000 people, if they were employed and distributed even in the present proportions between the agricultural and the manufacturing industries, would produce yearly something like £6,750,000 worth of wealth.  So that ... the gross economic loss, the loss to the community in deprivation of wealth is something like £6,750,000 per year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So that our 60,000 unemployed people at that time, by being unemployed, were losing by their inactivity the nation wealth to the value of £6,750,000 per year.  Since then the number of our unemployed has increased from 60,000 to 105,000, and the cost of living has increased in the meantime by 14Ω per cent., so that if we take the Taoiseach's valuation at that time and apply it to the higher number of unemployed, and to the increase in commodity <Col N="1844" /> prices, we find that under that test the loss to the nation to-day is approximately £13,500,000.  The Taoiseach was very gravely concerned at that time when he was told that the nation was losing through its unemployed people £6,750,000 per annum. The nation is losing to-day more than twice that figure, according to the Taoiseach's own calculation, and the Government, of which he is the leader, has no plan whatever for putting into productive employment the 105,000 persons who are unemployed to-day: no plan whatever for avoiding the loss of wealth which concerned him so much on that occasion.</P>
    <P>The present Minister for Industry and Commerce also had optimistic views as to the solution of the unemployment problem.  Speaking in the same debate&mdash;column 2378&mdash;he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This year, in addition to the continual worsening of the unemployment problem, which has been going on for a number of years, we have the fact that due to the economic conditions in the United States and in Great Britain emigration has ceased, so that 25,000 or 30,000 young people who would normally emigrate are at home and remain idle.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Under the same Minister for Industry and Commerce there is one aspect of our relations which has now become normal again and that is emigration. The trade in emigration is normal to-day.  If anything, it is abnormal.  It is one of the flourishing industries in this country, taking men and boys, girls and young women out of the country to compete in Britain with a swollen unemployed labour market, for the employment which they cannot get here.  The crowning declaration by the present Minister for Industry and Commerce on that occasion is one well worthy of quotation.  Speaking in the same debate he said that</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Deputy de Valera showed and showed fairly convincingly to anyone open to conviction that unemployment need not exist here, that it exists very largely because of the lack of directive ability on the part of the Government.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That was when we had 60,000 persons <Col N="1845" /> unemployed in the country.  Unemployment then existed because of &ldquo;the lack of directive ability on the part of the Government.&rdquo;  Now we have 105,000 persons registered as unemployed. What can one think in these circumstances of &ldquo;the lack of directive ability&rdquo; in a Government which allows the problem to grow from the figure then quoted to the figure which exists to-day.  The Government appears to have had an abundance of plans and an abundance of schemes for dealing with the unemployment problem before it assumed office, but once it assumed office it had no plan whatever.  It is merely kicking the industrial football all round the field and it has not a notion as to where the goalposts are.</P>
    <P>We had a most enlightening declaration from Deputy Hugo Flinn, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance, in a debate in this House a fortnight ago.  The problem of unemployment, he said, was not a problem of money.  It was a problem of getting work to do.  Outside a lunatice asylum, did anybody ever hear of a worse declaration than that?  In this undeveloped country, where social and human amenities are conspicuous by their absence, and where the standard of living is so low for a large number of our people, to tell us that the problem to-day is not a problem of money, but a problem of getting work, is just the economics of a mad house.  There is an abundance of work to be done in this country to-day.  There is an abundance of work to be done in lifting the country, and the rural areas in particular, out of the deplorably bleak and miserable position into which they have been allowed to get through generations of neglect and generations of alien misrule. We ought to-day to be harnessing all our efforts to improving the amenities of life, particularly in the rural areas, but, according to the man charged with dealing with the unemployment problem, the real problem is to find work for the people to do.  It is in the hands of a man with vision of that kind that our unemployment problem is to-day.</P>
    <P>The most disquieting thing in connection with any review of our economic and industrial position is the complete absence of any plan on the part of the <Col N="1846" /> Government.  One could understand unemployment continuing for a while; one could understand suffering; one could understand some kind of industrial dislocation causing unemployment, if one could see that there was some plan at work which in the course of time would enable that problem to be dealt with.  But here we have to-day an army of unemployed people within a small State, and a Government drifting helplessly and hopelessly with no plan whatever for dealing with that unemployment problem.  In the discussion on the Defence Estimate it was made clear that this year we are raising an extra £5,500,000 for armaments&mdash; most of which will be obsolete in five, and certainly in ten years, at the outside&mdash;apart from the normal expenditure of approximately £3,000,000 on the Army as well.  We can raise that gigantic sum of money in this small country for an armaments programme, which I do not think, even when it is in full swing, would keep out of this country an invasion of bees.  When it comes to a question of raising money for armaments we can raise all the money that is necessary.</P>
    <P>We can talk in the language, if not actually in the figures of some of the Continental dictators, of some of the countries immensely more wealthy, immensely greater from a territorial and a population point of view than we are, and with interests very different from ours, and far more widespread than ours&mdash;interests in defending ill-gotten gains in other portions of the world.  But £5,500,000, plus another £3,000,000 are going on armaments this year.  We are spending that, mind you, in the same year as we are giving a maximum unemployment assistance benefit of 14/- per week to a man with a wife and six children in the small towns and the rural areas throughout the country; an allowance equivalent to 2/- per day for eight people; an allowance which enables that family to spend only 1d. on every meal which each member of the family eats.  We can see millions being raised and spent on armaments. The Government is doing Brewster when it comes to spending money on armaments, but their policy in regard to the unemployed is the policy which <Col N="1847" /> Mother Hubbard used so successfully on the dog.  Millions for armaments; pennies for meals for the unemployed people&mdash;that is the policy we are backing and enshrining in this Vote on Account.</P>
    <P>There is one statement by the Minister for Industry and Commerce with which I agree, and that is his statement that in this country a lack of directive ability is at the root, to a considerable extent, of our unemployment problem. We have in this country a relatively undeveloped nation.  We have here brains and brawn capable of being utilised in the development of the nation, but, for some extraordinary reason, whatever other way we can apply our talents and apply our credit facilities, we are failing lamentably to apply them to a solution of the unemployment problem.  The only policy of the Government to-day in regard to unemployment is that worthless one that Micawber practised with such catastrophic results&mdash;waiting for something to turn up; just letting things drift along to see whether anything will turn up.  Then, when it does not turn up, they say: &ldquo;In any case the other people were really worse.  We are doing things better than the other people.&rdquo;  It does not matter to the unemployed people whether there is less employment than in the days of the Fine Gael Government.  So far as the unemployed man is concerned, unemployment under any Government is a detestable evil which he wants to get rid of.  If I were to make one suggestion to the Government, it would be to cease making comparisons of that kind as affording any solace to him, but to endeavour to get to the roots of a problem which, if not completely soluble in the circumstances of this country, can at least be brought down to very manageable proportions.</P>
    <P>Just before we entered on this discussion this evening we spent time dealing with the Town and Regional Planning Bill.  We spent time dealing with the Town and Regional Planning Bill when we ought to be spending our time and energies not on planning houses or mansions or castles in towns but on planning a national life for our people, a national life which will succour <Col N="1848" /> our people from the dread misery and terrifying insecurity which go hand in hand with long continued unemployment. It would pay the House and pay the country better if, instead of wasting time on some of the legislation we are asked to pass here, we were concentrating our endeavours on dealing with the greatest problem in this or any other country, the problem of unemployment.  A visitor to this country will not be so much impressed &mdash;unless he is merely a &ldquo;main-roader&rdquo;&mdash;with what some of our towns and villages look like; he will be concerned with the standard of comfort, the standard of living, the standard of social security which each and every one of our citizens possesses.  I think we can give our people that security. I think we can provide employment for our people.  I think the resources of this country, the confidence and the capacity of our people, and the credit position of the nation, are such as to encourage us to apply a radical solution to the unemployment problem. We were told by the present Taoiseach that if he could not find a solution within the present system he would go outside the system.  The Taoiseach is still within the system, and a painful monument to that fact is the existence of over 100,000 unemployed people in the country to-day.  Are we always going to accept the philosophy that we must have a vast army of unemployed people here?  Does this Government accept the philosophy that it is the right or the destiny of over 100,000 Irish men and women always to be idle, or does it conceive that it is for them a national and a moral responsibility not merely to save them from the cancerous influences which go hand in hand with unemployment but to harness their efforts to the creation of more wealth for a nation that badly needs the creation of more wealth?  I believe that we can find a solution of our unemployment problem if we face up to that problem on the lines of spending nationally, thinking nationally and acting nationally, allowing no precedents in other periods to deter us from facing up to whatever is involved in finding a solution of a problem which threatens the very existence of the nation itself.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1849" /> We could, in this country to-day, survey its resources and ascertain its needs.  We could mobilise the manhood of the country, arrest emigration, and utilise the credit resources of the nation to ensure that every man and woman able and willing to work, in a country where there is an abundance of work available, would be guaranteed work at rates of wages capable of sustaining them in decency and comfort. It is along lines such as these that the industrial and the social rot which is eating into the vitals of the nation to-day can be stopped.  It is only by tackling the problem along these lines that the decay of the Celt as a race can be avoided.  I know, of course, that to suggest a solution of the problem along these lines to minds which are saturated with the file mentality, and whose outlook is conditioned by precedents and by minutes, is to suggest a solution which will be bitterly and vigorously opposed.  The country has got to choose whether it is going to have the existing personnel at headquarters dealing with routine matters, or whether it is going to build up a directive organisation there which will allow nothing to stand in the way of applying to the unemployment and emigration problems the radical solution which these problems need so much to-day.</P>
    <P>I think the Government must by now, after eight years of office, have realised that all its past tinkering with the problem has been a gigantic failure; that tens of thousands of people are losing heart and faith in the Government's policy to solve the unemployment problem.  In every city and large town in England, tens of thousands of our people are living, having escaped from the misery and poverty that they were enduring in this country.  If the Government are wise and prudent, they will face up to their responsibilities on this unemployment problem with more enthusiasm than they put into the armament problem, and with as much determination to tackle the problem in the same vigorous way as apparently we are going to find money for armaments.</P>
    <P>If the Government have the courage and the vision to do that, we might see <Col N="1850" /> the end of the problem, but if they drift as they are drifting to-day, then we can only visualise a continuance of the same miseries, the same widespread poverty and suffering, and emigration on a large scale, with tens of thousands of people enduring an inordinately low standard of life, all because we are legislatively too lazy to organise the nation and to give them a better standard of living.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult in a country that has had the hand of Government so hard down on its industry, including its agriculture, for the last six years, suddenly to become normal. But with the improved position in which our agricultural industry is, as a result of the Agreement that gives it back, to some extent, the export market that it had, we may expect to see some natural improvement in the economic situation here.  As far as realising what the unemployment situation in the country is, or as far as indicating how it can be stopped or improved in any way, nothing that we have been told in this House since we turned the present year gives us any light or comfort. The Minister for Agriculture intervened in this discussion, and he told us that, outside the £2,000,000 additional that we will spend out of the revenue on defence this year, they are spending £7,600,000 more than the Government they superseded in 1932. He indicated the lines upon which the additional expenditure of £7,600,000 would go.  When we add the £2,000,000 for defence, the additional expenditure reaches £9,600,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us see how that is being spent. Additional old age pensions and widows' pensions will account for £1,225,000; on employment schemes we will spend £1,340,000&mdash;that is, relief schemes organised and set going by the Government.  The Minister tells us that unemployment assistance will represent an expenditure of £1,300,000.  There is additional building work, which will cost £1,620,000.  The Land Commission and the Department of Agriculture are going to spend £2,000,000.  Most of the expenditure that is there is simply patching a situation.  There is no constructive application of a plan there. There is nothing organic in the rehabilitation <Col N="1851" /> of the country economically, and there is nothing there that is going to create a natural situation in which men are going to find employment.</P>
    <P>It has to be done, and it can only be done as far as I can see by getting the real facts of the situation in front of us.  We have to get down to where the real fundamental things in the economic situation are, and we have to face the facts, and it is in a modest way, seeking to get one or two things done, that I intervene in this debate at this stage.  I am encouraged to do so by recent reference in the Press to the points I speak about.  There are three matters I would like to deal with here One of them is dealt with in a leading article in the <i>Irish Times</i> this morning; another is dealt with in a letter to the <i>Irish Press</i> by Miss Louie Bennett, of the Irish Women Workers' Union; and the third is dealing with a parliamentary phenomenon, by the <i>Cork Examiner.</i>  The Minister for Finance can be satisfied that, as we are keeping the <i>Irish Independent</i> out of the discussion, there is probably something worth talking about.</P>
    <P>The first point concerns the position existing in the City of Dublin with regard to young people leaving school. I speak particularly of boys, and I want to speak particularly of the problem that exists in the case of boys from the age of 16 to the age of 20.  Something over 5,000 boys leave our primary schools alone, in Dublin, every year, and there is nobody who had had any experience of city life and who knows the conditions, not only of workers and of what would be called working-class families, but of the middle-class families and every class of family in the city, who does not realise that there is no connection between the school as an educational institution and employment in the industrial world outside.  These two things are broken by an absolute gap, and any boy leaving school, particularly the primary school, and I could say the secondary school too, in the City of Dublin, goes out into, I might say, a blank wilderness so far as hope is concerned.  As the leading article in the <i>Irish Times</i> pointed out this morning, there is no machinery in the city that can serve them.  A <Col N="1852" /> number of boys go to the Juvenile Employment Committee, but only a very small number, and numbers of those that go there are not really catered for.</P>
    <P>What I plead for at this stage is not a plan for putting boys of that particular kind into work, because I think that a plan of setting out definitely to put boys like that into work would lead nowhere but would lead simply to an extension of the relief scheme and an extension of the public works scheme that, I believe, have no real sound organic growth in them at all.  What I do plead for is immediate investigation this year of what the circumstances are.  I suggest that a census should be taken of boys between 16 and 20 years of age, in the City of Dublin, who are looking for employment at the present time.  It will take a month or two to see on what lines that census should be planned and to get the machinery going for taking that census, but it should be quite possible to plan a census of that particular kind and put it into operation in the autumn, so that you would not only have a clear, scientifically set out examination of the position that exists at the present moment but you would see the position as it will be after the usual annual influx has taken place from the schools this summer.  I believe that an examination of that situation would put in a perspective that has not been seen before the unemployment situation in the City of Dublin.  It is fundamental to the whole situation here, and unless that position is reviewed and examined and looked at, then there is going to be no definite plan and there is going to be no definite appreciation of what the economic position in the city is. That can be done simply, and it can be done thoroughly and scientifically for the City of Dublin, and I suggest that it should be done at once.</P>
    <P>The second point I want to refer to is a thing that, if done, would create in a good and economic way additional employment in the City of Dublin and would do for the building industry a thing that is very necessary at the present time, that is, give it something of a clear, definite outlook.  Just take a letter like this:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I am married two years, with one <Col N="1853" /> child; at present living in a basement flat in such-and-such a street, paying 15/- per week for two rooms. The accommodation here is very bad. My wife is at present under the doctor's care.  There are a number of steps down to our flat, and having to lift the pram, etc., down the same is causing great injury to my wife.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This man is paying 15/- a week for two rooms.  He is employed in permanent employment as a fitter and his wages are £3 16s. a week.  Here you have a person who is one of the stable, employed workers in the City of Dublin, who is in permanent employment and has a wage of £3 16s. a week and, as Miss Bennett points out, is prepared to sacrifice a certain fair amount of that money to get a decent house.  He cannot get it.  That is typical of hundreds, if not thousands, of cases in the City of Dublin.  I suggest that, if a census were taken&mdash;and it could be conveniently and rapidly done&mdash;of the number of persons in fair employment in the City of Dublin, let us say permanent employment at, say, this man's wages of £3 16s. or £3 a week, who wanted a house to rent, then you would have information that would be a foundation-stone for a real economic and progressive piece of building work in the city here.</P>
    <P>As long ago as 1931, I pointed out that that class had to be catered for and was not being catered for.  When the Minister for Local Government introduced his 1932 Bill, we warned him that he was leaving that class completely out of his calculations, and I understand that, yesterday, in the Seanad, he admitted that what we warned him against then had actually come about.  Whether he admitted it or not, the fact is that there are thousands of fairly economically-paid workers in the City of Dublin ready to pay a reasonable and economic rent for a house and cannot get a house.  In the meantime, you have a building industry in which there is a very considerable amount of unemployment and which is absolutely bewildered in its outlook.  So that in the circumstances in which we are spending £9,000,000 odd more than the pre-Fianna F·il Government was spending, and spending it in the most wasteful way, a way <Col N="1854" /> in which it is simply spent and gone, without building up anything with organic, economic growth from it, in a year in which we are proposing to do that, I ask that an examination be made of the juvenile unemployment situation in the City of Dublin in regard to boys from 15 to 20 years, and that an examination be made of the number of people who can pay for a house, who are in stable, satisfactory work in the City of Dublin, who can pay rent for a house and who cannot possibly get a house.  Why?  Because that situation is not definitely examined.  I believe that, if it were definitely examined, there would be a resurrection of the building industry in the City of Dublin and that the very fact that the building industry in the City of Dublin was founding a considerable section of its work on a substantial basis like that would strengthen it and enable it to give greater assistance in the direction of building houses for those people who are not able to pay an economic rent at the present time and who have to be assisted by the Corporation and the State.</P>
    <P>Unless focal points like that are taken in the unemployment situation and unless focal points in the economic situation are concentrated on, the facts clearly brought out, and the logical deductions made from these facts towards Government action, then you are going to be spending £9,000,000 this year and £10,000,000 the next, and £11,000,000 the next and the story of emigration and unemployment and general demand for Government assistance, which Deputy Norton has spoken about, is going to continue.</P>
    <P>The next point that I would refer to, and my last, is a point that arises out of the intervention in this discussion by the Minister for Agriculture the other day.  In its editorial page, yesterday, the <i>Cork Examiner</i> has an article headed &ldquo;The Silent Voice&rdquo;, which indicates that democracy in this country is seriously threatened by the Party system, which muzzles a whole body of representatives of this country behind a front bench group of Ministers. No matter what members do, and no matter what they say, and no matter what is the likely effect on the country <Col N="1855" /> of their actions and legislation, not a word of criticism, not a piece of expression of opinion that might be regarded as the real expression of the opinion of their constituents, is heard.  To my mind there is a bigger danger than that and it is a danger that increasingly in this House we are being confronted with, that is, that you cannot get the truth out of Ministers.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not accusing Ministers of telling lies, Sir, but I am saying that, as far as this House is concerned in debate, as far as the facts of the situation in this country are concerned, we cannot get the facts out of them.  I will call it by any other name that parliamentary procedure or even politeness suggests but I mean that we cannot get the truth out of Ministers here.  Now, how can we be a Parliament, in the accepted sense of the word, if, when we are discussing legislation and plans for economic improvement, we cannot at least be satisfied that what will be stated here by Ministers and by Deputies from every side will be, so far as they can state them, the facts of the situation? At any rate, can we get this, that we will all try to get what are the facts of this case, and that if Ministers are challenged, and if it can be shown that they tell us things which are incorrect, not only will they accept correction, but, in the interests of this institution as a democratic institution, and in the interests of the well-being of the country they will do their part in helping to get before this House information which is correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take the Minister for Agriculture. One of the danger-signals in the figures that we have for employment are the figures that come from the equation of the contribution fund of national health insurance to full-time employment. The Minister referred to employment in column 1257 of the Official Reports of 1st March last.  Professor O'Sullivan had been saying that we should not rely too much on some of the figures with regard to employment and unemployment <Col N="1856" /> that were bandied about, and the Minister for Agriculture was prepared to agree with him.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There is one case where we have correct figures, and where there is no possibility of an error being made. That is as regards the number employed, according to the Insurance Acts, the National Health and the Unemployment Insurance Acts.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He then went on to say that, according to the national health insurance contribution fund, between December 31st, 1931, and December 31st, 1937, employment had gone up by 130,000. &ldquo;It was a very big increase, an increase of over 30 per cent. over those years,&rdquo; he said.  Well, it is not true. That is the first thing to say about that.  The second thing to say about it is that if he is taking the employment position as shown by the figures of the national health insurance contribution fund, the position is that full-time employment, in 1931, was 342,000 persons and, in 1938, 416,000 persons, that is, there was an increase of 74,000, which is about half the figure the Minister gave us.  This, however, is where I come to what disturbs me about the position disclosed by the national health insurance fund figures.  The publications that have been issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce on the trend of employment have concentrated, and rightly, on the figures for the National Health Insurance Fund and the Unemployment Insurance Fund as real things that show the amount of employment in the country, and in the accounts that have been issued, they have made a thorough use of these figures.  They show that between 1926 and 1931, five years, full-time employment, as measured by the national health insurance calculation, rose by 57,000 persons, or by an average of 11,400 a year.  Between 1931 and 1938, they show that, in those seven years, the increase in full-time employment was 74,000 persons, or an average of 10,571 a year.  I take the national health insurance figures because they are more embracing than the unemployment insurance figures, in that, as well as including the unemployment insurance people, they include agricultural <Col N="1857" /> workers, domestic workers and others not included in the other figure.</P>
    <P>One would have imagined by all the great propaganda there has been about the increase of employment in the country that the rate at which people were being put into employment during the last seven years would have been greater than that of the years before. We find that it was, in fact, 829 persons per annum less.  There would not be much to complain about in that if we had not to take into consideration that when you figure out the increased number of houses built during the last seven years and express it in terms of increased employment in the ordinary way which is accepted, that is, that the building of one house, every aspect of it, gives employment to one and a half men for a whole year, you find that the excess number of houses during the last seven years over the number of houses built yearly in the previous five years accounts for an increase in employment, in connection with house-building, of 8,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>Then we go to relief schemes.  The figures given in the publications with regard to the trend of employment, and the figures given in reply to Parliamentary Questions, show that last year, 1938, there was an average of 19,000 men employed on relief schemes in every month of the year, and that there was an average of 22,000 men employed for every month of the year in 1937, so that when we take the increased employment, as a result of increased house building, and of relief schemes, leaving out entirely the point made by Deputy Davin that a full-time week on a relief scheme may mean two stamps because of the broken time, the rate of increase in employed persons under the National Health Insurance contribution scheme for the last seven years is about 4,700 a year less than the rate of increase in the five years before Fianna F·il came into office.  Now, when you consider the large number of people who have been put into employment requiring unemployment insurance, we have disclosed to us that a very remarkable change has taken place in the position of employment and that while people have been added in the new industries, in agriculture, in commercial <Col N="1858" /> life and in domestic service, there has been, at the same time, a tremendous weakening of the employment situation here.</P>
    <P>Doubt has been expressed as to whether the number of persons that are now in industrial employment are going to be able to continue there.  We hope they are and we hope that nothing will be done, in any kind of hurried or thoughtless way, that would jeopardise their continued employment, but the facts that are before us show that there has been a very serious weakening in the economic situation among those classes that are outside the unemployment insurance scheme.  I think that that is one of the serious things in the situation that is going to react on us particularly in the near future, after the present situation has had a little more time to develop.  As I say, here we have the Minister for Agriculture getting up to persuade the House by a statement to which I suppose, naturally, being the statement of a Minister, a certain amount of authority attaches, that in the first place the number put into employment requiring national health insurance is twice as great as it actually was, and, in the second place, hiding up the situation that abnormal things did go to raise that figure in relief schemes, in the doubling effect of the way relief schemes have been worked, in the way in which national insurance is paid and in the increased number of persons employed in the building of houses.  That is entirely obscured.  Give us a chance in our discussions here by putting the correct facts in front of us, and by presenting the facts in such clearness here that none of us will be tempted to misrepresent them.</P>
    <P>That is not the only way in which the Minister for Agriculture misrepresented the situation.  To take the trade situation, he said, as reported in column 1257, &ldquo;that taking imports less exports, there was no great difference between 1938 and 1931.&rdquo;  There is this much difference, that we got £12,000,000 less for what we sent out of the country, and that our adverse trade balance was increased by £3,000,000. I do not mind back benchers getting up and saying, as was said, that our trade position has been <Col N="1859" /> improved by £20,000,000 when, as a matter of fact, last year our total trade was down by £1,500,000.  I do not mind that, but I do mind the Minister hanging on to a statement like that and attempting to gloss over it, to show that, as far as trade position is concerned to-day, it is as good as in 1931.</P>
    <P>Then, speaking of the moneys that have been spent by the Government, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Surely to goodness, all these moneys spent by people drawing these benefits must have made a very considerable change in the consumption of goods in this country in 1937 as compared with 1933...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He says that because they are getting more revenue from tobacco, and that people are smoking more tobacco, it is a good sign.  He says also that taking tea and sugar together, they collected about £500,000 less than Fine Gael or Cumann na nGaedheal collected in 1931-32 and, generally, that the moneys they took from the people were taken in respect of things that were not necessaries of life.  I would not be allowed to describe here the Minister's statements in the only words that could really describe them.  There must be more consumption in the country! People are taxed less! Just let us see. We have had the experience for a long time past that when we drew attention from these benches to these things&mdash; that is, the falling power of the people to purchase these things, and the falling consumption&mdash;we had simply spat back at us the statement that we did not know how to read things.  Let us take for one thing the Bacon Report published the other day.  The Bacon Report published the other day shows that the consumption of bacon which was in 1931 828,000 cwts. has been reduced to 572,000 cwts. in 1937&mdash;a fall of 31 per cent.  What is the real position with regard to bacon?  We were invited by the Minister for Agriculture to go to the Statistical Abstract for 1938 if we wanted to see the facts of the situation.  The Statistical Abstract for 1938, in regard to consumption at any rate, only brings up to the year 1936.  I shall just take three items <Col N="1860" /> here, as regards the increased consumption alleged by the Minister for Agriculture on the one hand, and the way in which taxation has been shifting on the necessaries of life on the other. When we take the bacon position from 1931 to 1936, the Statistical Abstract shows that, instead of eating 812,891 cwts., as we ate in 1931, in 1936 we ate 201,371 cwts. less.  Did we pay less for it?  No.  We paid £220,887 more.</P>

      <P>For 613,520 cwts. we paid £220,887 more than we paid for 812,000 cwts. five years before that. Now, in regard to flour, what is the position?  Again, from the statistical abstract that we were coming to, our consumption of flour in 1931 was a little over 7,000,000 cwts.  We paid for that £3,474,213.  We eat 253,398 cwts. less flour in 1936 than we did in 1931.  Did we pay less for it?  I said that, for the bigger quantity in 1931, we paid £3,474,213; for the smaller quantity we eat in 1936 we paid £1,710,907 more than we paid for the bigger quantity eaten in 1931.  That did not appear as taxation.  When the assistance to the flour position was being given, out of revenue, in the earlier years it reached £300,000.  Then, when it was getting a run, it was shifted out of the taxation accounts, and this additional £1,710,907 is unnecessarily paid for flour in 1936. That was continued in 1937; it was continued in 1938, and it will be all read when the statistical abstract for the time brings these things up to date. That was paid, as well as the additional taxation, but it does not appear in the accounts.</P>
      <P>Now, as regards sugar in 1931, we consumed 2,091,260 cwts. of sugar and the charge for that, without talking of taxation&mdash;I shall talk of taxation afterwards &mdash; and without counting the customs duty or excise, was £1,236,454.  Then, in 1936, we ate a little more&mdash;2,279,422 cwts.&mdash; but it cost us £2,269,309.</P>

      <P>I am quite sure Deputy Hughes is capable of taking it in and I hope that the Minister and Deputy Hughes are going to allow us, when discussing these matters here, to have the facts in front of us and not to think that it is advisable in any interest, economic or Party, that facts should be left unbrought-out here.  It is right that we should see them in their proper perspective.  The cost of the sugar that we ate in 1936 and the same presumably applies to the years 1937 and 1938 was £919,000 more than it would have been if there had not been Governmental tampering with it.</P>
      <P>Now, the Minister wants me to talk about the taxation.  The Minister for Agriculture talked about taxation.  He said that, taking sugar, in 1937 and 1938 they collected about £500,000 less than the Cumann na nGaedheal Government collected in 1931-2.  That is £500,000 less across the public taxation counter.  But across the shop counters in terms of wholesale prices, £900,000 more was paid.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like that Deputy O Briain would take some day off and look at the figures and see how much of that money went to the farmers; how much went to the agricultural labourers and how much went to the sugar company.  Because is it not right that these facts should be available to him and that he should have them?  Why cannot we get them?  It is because the last things Ministers want to face at the present moment are facts.  The only thing that will bring back to Ministers any intelligence they had is to be brought into the presence <Col N="1862" /> of facts.  As long as they shirk the facts, they are going to come in here and they are going to tell us that they are spending so much on relief schemes, and so much on public works, so much on widows' and orphans' pensions and so much on defence.</P>
      <P>They tell us they are going to defend this country.  When Ministers really settle down to face facts and not run away from them and when they come in here to meet representatives from one end of the country to the other&mdash; people who have come here to face facts and help by their actions to make facts less troublesome and more promising for the people of the country&mdash;it will be better for the Government, who ought to help to put the facts in front of us.</P>
      <P>We have seen the position with regard to flour, with regard to sugar and with regard to bacon.  I know that the Minister for Agriculture says that it is not essential to the poor man rearing a family to have tobacco or beer or petrol.  But the Minister boasts of the fact, as indicating that the situation is excellent, that the people are getting more tobacco.  There is not more tobacco being used in the country to-day than in 1931-32.  If the Minister will look at the position, the tobacco that is used in this country is manufactured in this country and there is a small number of persons less employed in the tobacco business than was employed in 1931-32.  At least, the last available figures of the Census of Production of 1937 show that there was a smaller number of people employed in the tobacco industry in 1937 than there was in 1931.  I think the wages paid in the tobacco industry in 1937 were £21,000 less than they were in 1931.  We are not using more tobacco but we are paying more taxation on it and very much more taxation.  In the year ending March, 31, 1938, tobacco smokers paid £933,000 more on the tobacco they smoked than was paid in 1931-32 because the Government had increased the taxation on it.</P>

      <P>The Minister also spoke about the agricultural index figure, and, as reported in column 1264 of the Official Report, implied that all the commission would do was to tell us that the farmer's position is at least no worse to-day than it was then.  What better index figure for agriculture can you have than the figure showing the number of men engaged in agriculture?  What does that show?  In reply to a Parliamentary question on Tuesday, official figures were given showing under various headings the number of men employed in agriculture.  As compared with 1931, there were 25,351 less men engaged in agriculture in 1938.  That is the index figure that I like to look for annually to see what the position is in the country.  But we had the Minister for Agriculture pointing out to us that 1934 was an important year, and we had Deputy Childers asking us to realise that 1935 was an important year, that that was the real trough of the economic war depression, and we should measure ourselves against 1935. If we are going to measure ourselves against 1935 as to the position of employment in agriculture, what do we find?  We find that between June, 1935, and June, 1938, the number of men employed in agriculture fell by 36,309. But I should like to think of the year 1934, when Fianna F·il plans for resurrecting the farmer and subsidising him in every possible way had got some kind of a chance to get under way. Between 1934 and 1938, the number of men employed on agriculture fell by 42,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I bring these facts to the notice of the House, and I ask them to look back at the speech made by the Minister for Agriculture on the 1st March, and ask themselves how long can this Parliament function as a democratic institution, hoping by our discussions here to do good for the country, if Ministers, from their authoritative seats in the House, are going to come out with the dope given out by the Minister for Agriculture.  Why is it necessary to tell us things that are not true about the most fundamental facts of our economic and social situation?  I reply to the <i>Cork Examiner</i> in this matter <Col N="1864" /> that I quite agree that the silence which has been so conspicuous behind the Front Bench of Fianna F·il during the last couple of months is a silence that threatens democratic institutions here. But I add that what threatens it more is the persistent line of misrepresentation and mis-statement of some of the most important facts in this country that come from the Government Front Bench.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister for Finance, facing his financial year with this Vote on Account will realise what it means to the country, and to the discussions here and their bearing on the country, that we be allowed to see what the facts are, and that such facts as are in the hands of the Ministry to be published in official statistics will be allowed to stand for what they are before the country or anybody who cares to examine them, and that the Government's concern will be to get these understood and not to misrepresent and abuse them.  In every single thing that the Minister for Agriculture touched upon in his speech on the 1st March, the position with regard to trade, the position with regard to the consuming capacity of our people, the position with regard to employment as represented by the national health insurance figures, the position with regard to the way in which taxation falls upon the people, even the position with regard to the way in which rates fall on the agricultural community has been worsened, because as well as increasing the normal taxation of this country by £4,000,000, plus the hidden taxation that has fallen on the agricultural community, the Minister for Agriculture says that in the year 1936-37 their rates were £460,000 more than in 1931-32.  In the current year, they are £850,000 more than they were; they have gone up by 34 per cent.  The rates for the country as a whole have gone up by £1,170,000.</P>
    <P>Let us get away from the misrepresentations of such facts as are obvious and must be seen in their proper perspective and faced up to if we are going to do anything for the country, and take things that are definite and important and examine them in a scientific way.  Dealing in a scientific way with small problems here and there, we can gradually extend that technique. <Col N="1865" /> Again, I want to emphasise two things that require to be examined at once in the City of Dublin: (1) the lack of hope of employment facing young men coming out of our primary and secondary schools and the necessity for having a census taken in the autumn of this year of that position as regards youths from 16 to 20 years of age; (2) an immediate census of those people who are in fairly stable employment, who have fairly good wages, who can pay a reasonable rent for a house, so that a new housing movement can be begun on some kind of a solid basis here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one thing about the debate that, I think, shows some healthy omens.  There was a tone from the back benches of Fianna F·il, from Deputy Childers, Deputy Corry and Deputy Kennedy, and, in a way, from Deputy Harris, which was altogether different from the tone and attitude of 12 months ago and of the debates previous to that.  There was more of an understanding and more of a clear admission of the facts than there had been previously.  The speeches of 12 months ago and the speeches of former years from those benches were a denial of the position, whereas the speeches of yesterday and the previous days were a frank admission of the position.  Before I go any further, I might say also that Deputy Corry threw out one suggestion that has been received very favourably by the agricultural portion of this Party, and that was when he asked that the farming Deputies should come together and try to solve this problem.  In reply, I say that we are ready to try to see what can be done in that direction.</P>
      <P>I shall begin with Deputy Childers. Deputy Childers made what, in my opinion, is&mdash;if you will allow for a little Party colouring&mdash;a very fair statement of the position.  I am not going to deal with the conclusion that might be drawn, but I do say that in most of the things he said he made a very fair statement of the position for a Deputy on the Fianna F·il Benches, considering his Party affiliations. Speaking on this Vote on the 1st March&mdash;volume 74, column 1234, he said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;For farmers of every size, of every acreage, in every part of my <Col N="1868" /> constituency, the position is, I feel, a complicated one.  There are people who have obviously survived very successfully, and many others who are obviously in a very difficult position.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He goes on further to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I feel more intensely every time I visit my constituency and become acquainted with conditions there that it is not a simple problem.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He admits the problem, and he says that he feels more intensely every time he visits his constituency that it is not a simple problem, and says that there are many other people who are obviously in a very difficult position. Now I should like the Minister to follow in that line and try not to misrepresent the position.  The economic war is over now, and there is no use in trying to deceive the people.  A case could have been made 12 months ago for trying to deceive the British with regard to the position here.  One could understand that there was some excuse for that from the national point of view, but there is no excuse to-day for that.  There is no excuse for trying to deceive us, to deceive the public representatives of the people here and to deceive the country.  Deputy Childers, in column 1235 of the same date, says:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;we shall never be able to continue to pay for the very heavy social services for which the people are now taxed.  I admit that is a very serious problem and will require, not one month nor six months, not one year, but a number of years of research before the matter is finally put right.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Now, Deputy Childers, evidently, at that stage, decided to leave his constituency, which is a sample of the other constituencies&mdash;to leave that constituency of which he certainly has knowledge for the last six or seven or eight months&mdash;and began to talk about the part of the country that he knew. He goes on to say, in column 1236 of the same date:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Coming to the general position of the country, I say unequivocally that, without any question, the people of this country are better off than they <Col N="1869" /> were before this Government entered into office, that the people have a better appearance, have a better life, and, in the vast majority of cases, have more money to spend.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is quite clear there what Deputy Childers meant to convey.  He talked, not of the constituency that he knew for six or seven or eight months, but of the city that he has known for years. He did not know the country in 1931, but he knew Dublin in 1931, and when he talks about coming to the general position of the country he is talking about that portion of the country of which he had experience and which he was able to judge and make comparisons about.  He says that the people have a better appearance, have a better life and, in the vast majority of cases, have more money to spend.  He says, unequivocally, that without any question, the people of this country are better off than before this Government entered into office.</P>
    <P>Now, that is my own impression as far as this city is concerned.  When I came up to Dublin in 1937, after an absence of a few years, I was struck by the change here, by the display of wealth and by the beautiful and well-fed appearance of the people here. That struck everybody who came to Dublin after an absence of some time, and I agree with Deputy Childers that his description is true so far as Dublin is concerned.  He gave a true pen picture of the position in the city, and it would be interesting to know what conclusions he came to as a result of the fact, that there was more money to spend here in the vast majority of cases, and that the people had a better appearance and a better life.  At any rate, that will be refreshing and welcome news to the people of my constituency, and, I am sure, to the people of Deputy Childers's constituency, as well as to the people of every other rural constituency in the State.</P>
    <P>I think I might leave Deputy Childers's statement now.  There is nothing in Deputy Corry's statement to quarrel about, I think.  As I say, I welcome the feeler that Deputy Corry threw out; but to come to other matters, I think Deputy Corry gave one valuable piece of information.  He said <Col N="1870" /> that when we made this claim for derating, and when we put down that motion here, asking that a commission should be set up, and supported it, we walked into it.  He said that the other day, and he also said it to me in private, that we walked into it.  I am beginning to agree with the Deputy that we walked into it in so far as we agreed to the setting up of the present kind of commission, and the making of a packed jury of it, so to speak&mdash;so much so that I have no intention of attending it or giving evidence there, and intend to ignore it utterly.  That is my attitude.  There is no doubt about it: that commission is set up in order to say &ldquo;No&rdquo; to the derating claim.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gorey</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming back to the question of derating, the ordinary land of this country can be called good and fairly good land&mdash;corn land.  Every three acres based on the valuation that these acres carry, are bearing at the present time a load in rates equal to the interest on £100 borrowed from the Credit Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1871" /> County Dublin, County Cork and several other counties are highly rated. Kilkenny is not quite so highly rated, the rates there being about 9/4 in the £.  Based on valuation the rates to-day are so high that three acres are bearing a load equal to the interest on £100 borrowed from the Credit Corporation. I want the House to understand that this issue about rates has been played with by this Government.  They have played one class of farmer against another, evidently ignoring the fact that the larger farmers, with valuations from £40 to £50, are the only employers of agricultural labour in the Twenty-Six Counties.  They play the small farmers against the large farmers, by offering them better terms, and reductions on loans, knowing that they may get a considerable amount of votes in that way, and that they cannot lose the votes of agricultural labourers working for these large farmers.</P>
    <P>It is the large farmers are paying all the agricultural wages, yet, in face of that, an Agricultural Wages Board was set up recently, and it fixed wages with an utter disregard as to whether farmers were able to pay them or not. We know that a considerable number of labourers were let go by their employers during the past year and a half, owing to the operations of the Agricultural Wages Board, principally because the farmers could not pay them.  There was utter inability to pay. If the present load was taken off the farmers' backs, the amount of money that could be saved to those who employ agricultural labourers would almost equal the amount they have to pay under the Agricultural Wages Board.  That load should never have been put there.  In the early days we know that there was little or no rating, and that revenue was made from farming. That was the only source of revenue then in the country, and it was also the landlords' income.  Rating then represented only 4d. in the £.  There were very little social services then compared to the services there are now.  With new developments and the introduction of new ideas, the whole <Col N="1872" /> load has been placed on the agricultural community.  They have to supply services that they have to do without themselves, or, if they have them, they have to provide them at then own expense.  They cannot in most cases provide them at their own expense because they have not the means. Farmers are without social services to-day, and are almost without any of the comforts of modern life; yet they have to pay for the provision of these services for every other section of the community.</P>
    <P>I have personal experience of another important aspect of agriculture&mdash;pig production.  I stated here some months ago that, to my knowledge, the great reason for the falling off in the production of pigs and fowl was the fact that the producers had neither the means nor the credit to buy food, so as to keep up production.  I know from the operations of some concerns that a big feature of their business, during the last five or six months, has been the fact that large feeders, notably millers and maize meal merchants, have gone in for pig production increasingly, while small feeders are responsible for the grave reduction that has taken place in pig production during the same period.  That is further proof that farmers have neither the means nor the credit to continue production.</P>
    <P>There is no question about that.  I know many suppliers and I know the number of pigs they sent in.  Anyone who wishes can see the weekly supply book at the factory.  Big feeders, notably millers and maize merchants, have increased production, while ordinary farmers have considerably reduced production.  Another feature in connection with pig production is this, that ordinary farmers are taking their pigs to the scales, although they need a further month or six weeks' feeding before reaching the proper weight.  Jobbers are also coming along and buying these pigs, keeping them for a month, and turning them into the factory as the finished article.  Is not that further evidence of the position in the country?  I could give other proofs.</P>
    <P>I have made it my business to go into <Col N="1873" /> the offices of several creameries to ask how the sales of butter to shareholders and suppliers compared with sales five or six years ago.  In the case of a creamery I know, I learned that for four years butter has not gone into the houses of some suppliers, many of whom have 40 or 50 acres of land.  I am not saying that is the  in every case, but I say that butter has not gone into some homes within a mile of my house for four years.  I think it was Deputy Harris asked if wheat was not a profitable crop.  I agree that it is.  So could grapes and so could oranges be a profitable crop if the subsidy was sufficient.  It would be the same in the case of any other crop that we cannot grow at present without a subsidy.  Standing on its own, and having to meet the competition that other farm produce has to meet, there is no hope whatever for wheat as a profitable crop.  Wheat is profitable on the basis that everything could be a profitable crop if it was subsidised.</P>

      <P>There has been an appeal made to forget the economic war, and all the losses and destitution that it brought on the country.  It is easy for people on whom the economic war left no trace to offer that advice, but the people who bore the brunt, whose doors it did not pass, whose pockets it emptied, and whose families it left in destitution cannot take such advice. Those who grew crops on which there were no tariffs, or that were not shipped across the water by means of a subsidy, bore very little of the brunt of the economic war.  Those who had to send their produce out of the country had all the load placed on their backs, and that load amounted to at least £15,000,000 a year during the period of the economic war, according to statements made in this House that were not contradicted.  Deputy Corry said a good deal about the dropping of the admixture scheme.  It has been dropped.</P>

      <P>It is an amazing thing that people who grow corn are the people who are going to provide manure to feed the land that grows it. The extraordinary thing about that scheme is this: that the people who grow that corn feed less of it than any other class in the community.  They want somebody else in the State to produce beef and bacon and to pay a price to them for the corn that they will not use themselves.  As I have said, that is a question that could be settled by Deputy Corry and some of us across a table.  If the decrease in our poultry and pig population can be traced in any way to that scheme making it unprofitable for our people to produce fowl and bacon and all the rest, well then I say, taking it all in all, it is more a curse than a blessing to subsidise it.  Cheap money has been advocated here as a cure for all our ills.  If loans were guaranteed we were told that the people would be able to pay their rates and annuities. If that is to be made a condition for a loan, then I hope we will never get one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I say is, remove the rates and remove the annuities, but certainly <Col N="1875" /> remove the rates.  If you do the people will get a chance to recover.  If not, they will have no chance.  If you do not remove them the time will come when they will be removed, and make no mistake about it.  The politicians are not going to continue to rule, because the country is wakening up. There is no question about that.  I am not a politician.  I have taken sides, it is true, but I am not a politician of the type that gets into loggerheads here about 1922.</P>

I hope that day will come soon.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture made some extraordinary statements in the course of his speech.  He says that the position in the country is better: that Fine Gael claim it is worse, and that Fianna F·il claim it is better.  I do not know if it is worth wasting time making comments on that kind of speech.  As Deputy Mulcahy remarked, the man who said that must have imagined himself still in the period of the economic war.  My opinion of the Minister's speech is that he was simply putting up a case to cod the people: a case that has no relation to the facts and no relation to the actual position. I do not want to use harsh words, but I regret that that class of speech should be made by a responsible Minister: that he should say a thing that is not&mdash; I will not say it is a lie&mdash;but it certainly is not true.  There is no foundation for it in the official statistics or anywhere else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not surprising, I think, that all who live by agriculture in this country should be in their present deplorable position.  The Government came into office with a policy which, whether they believed it was the right one or not, has since been <Col N="1876" /> proved to be entirely wrong.  It would be a good thing for the country if they admitted that right away&mdash;that their agricultural policy is entirely wrong. If they did, I think there is not a Party in the House but would try to help them out, in order to restore agriculture to the position in which it should be.</P>
      <P>I am primarily concerned with the position of the farmers and their losses over the past 12 months.  It may be all right, or it may be all wrong to set up this agricultural commission, but I am convinced that unless something is done in the meantime, the findings of that commission will come too late to save the agricultural community. The Government, as far as I can see, have a Dublin idea.  It is a Dublin Government.  But if the members of the Government were to consult the members of their own Party who represent rural constituencies, they should become convinced of the serious position to which agriculture is drifting. In the last 12 months the farmers suffered very heavy losses.  Apart from everything else the season was a very unfavourable one.  The Government, of course, is not responsible for the weather, but I want to urge on them that if agriculture is to be saved it must get help immediately.  The Deputy representing a rural constituency needs to have some courage at the present time to go through the country to meet his constituents.</P>
      <P>Travelling up from the West of Ireland to Dublin one sees nothing but sheets of water.  This morning I observed that the whole country from Ballinasloe into Athlone was a sheet of water.  I know people down in the South East part of that constituency who have lost all their hay, lost their corn and lost at least 50 per cent of the 1938 potato crop.  I saw in the newspapers the other day where a complaint was made at a meeting of the Clare County Council that in that county calves four and five months old were dying at an alarming rate.  These are the problems that we should be dealing with, while the agricultural commission is sitting, and trying to find a remedy for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1877" /> I propose to give the House some figures to indicate the losses that farmers throughout the West of Ireland engaged in tillage have suffered.  I have been supplied with the names of 12 men who grow potatoes for export. Their names have been taken at random.  They live seven and eight miles apart.  These 12 men do mixed farming.  In 1937 they grew 35 acres of potatoes for export, and out of that acreage they got 231 tons 14 cwts. of potatoes.  The same 12 farmers grew 35Ω acres of potatoes for export in 1938, but the produce of that area was only 58 tons 6 cwt.  You had there a reduction from 231 tons 14 cwts. to 58 tons 6 cwts. although the acreage was the same in each year.  If that is not taken as proof that something needs to be done, I think it is going to be disastrous for the country.</P>
    <P>Taking the question of the unemployed, we were told here years ago that there would be very little unemployed in this country in a short time. We had the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance here a few nights ago stating that he had no trouble from the West&mdash;from Galway. Later, he mentioned West Galway.  He said there were 3,000 people at work there in the constituency of West Galway.  Imagine a man boasting that the people were well-to-do where, out of a register of 45,000 people, 3,000 people are getting work at 14/- per week.  Is that prosperity?  He said he had no bad report from the West. That was only West Galway.  What about East Galway, where the farmers' sons were asked why they did not register as unemployed?  There is no reason why they should register as unemployed, because no work will turn up.  We will be asked what useful work can be carried out, or how the unemployed can be absorbed.  First of all, the Government itself, by some of its legislation, has created a good deal of unemployment in this country.  They are the culprits.  I believe that, were it not for Government policy, you would not have 105,000 unemployed here at the present time, although 40,000 or 50,000 have gone to another country.  I am now referring to the building trade, of which I have some <Col N="1878" /> knowledge.  There were two pieces of legislation here, one was the introduction of tariffs, the other was the Conditions of Employment Act, and between them they have increased the cost of building in this country by at least 35 per cent.  As soon as that was done, people were put out of employment, because there was no money to be got for building.</P>
    <P>There is also another matter to which I should like to refer.  We have a Drainage Commission.  But what is to be done until that commission reports? We should like to know what progress it is making, when we may expect a report, and when we may expect legislation by the Government to deal with that big problem in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is not taking it seriously.  They will talk about afforestation.  We will be told by the Minister for Lands about the number of acres secured for planting purposes.  Why then is planting not going on?  That land for afforestation does not cost much.  The highest price paid by the Government for land for afforestation purposes is £2 10s. per acre.  This is work which will give plenty of employment in this country, and work which will serve the country well.  I do not wish to go any further into this matter, except to say that it is very hard for the people to exist in this country.  Down in Galway ten or 12 years ago the county rate was 8/6 in the £; to-day it is 15/-.  What is the cause of that?  I think Deputy Moore said it was because of an increase in the social services.  But are we getting the benefit out of that increase? I say that we are not.  We have at the present time throughout the country a high number of inspectors, <Col N="1879" /> toppling over each other, and doing nothing but harassing the people.  The Civil Service has increased by thousands since the present Government came into office.  The Estimates are creeping up year by year.  I appeal to the Government to take the matter seriously.  If they would even consider the opinions expressed by the members of their own Party, I am sure that, whilst we are waiting for the reports of those commissions that are sitting and about to sit, they could help the people of this country, both the agricultural community and the unemployed. If that is not done, and done quickly, then, no matter what report the Agricultural Commission or the Drainage Commission brings in, it will be no use to this country.</P>

      <P>A Chinn Comhairle: This debate, according to the statement which you have made from the Chair, was to deal with the subject of unemployment, with particular reference to agriculture. But the debate has not confined itself within those limits, and, in so far as it has dealt with the problem agreed upon, anything of substance that has been said by the speakers either from the Labour Benches or the Opposition Benches has been dealt with, and dealt with very satisfactorily, by the Minister for Agriculture, and by Deputy Moore, Deputy Harris and the other Deputies who have spoken from these benches.  Accordingly, Sir, I do not propose to traverse the whole ground in this debate, but only to deal with perhaps one particular aspect of it. A number of Deputies who spoke here made the assertion that the farmers were in great difficulties, largely by reason of the fact that they cannot get reasonable credit facilities, and that in consequence of that there was much rural unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Belton referred to the position of the building trade in the City of Dublin, and, in that connection, alleged that one of the reasons for the present unemployment in that sphere of activity was the fact that the Dublin Corporation had been hampered in its <Col N="1880" /> endeavours to provide the necessary finance for its housing programme by the issue of the Financial Agreement Loan which was floated last year.  I would like to say that there is no truth whatever in that statement.  It is true, as the Deputy stated, that the Dublin Corporation, about April or May last, had made arrangements to float a loan of, I think, about £1,500,000, for the purpose of carrying through its housing programme.  It was pointed out to the Corporation at the time that, as the State was about to raise this loan of £10,000,000, it would be desirable that the Dublin Corporation should not make a public issue at or about the same time, because one issue was bound, with the very limited resources, at the disposal of our community, to react adversely upon the other. Accordingly, the Dublin Corporation did not make the intended public issue. But, since May of 1938, the Dublin Corporation has succeeded in raising a sum of over £1,500,000 for the purpose of housing and for the purpose of the water supply, and it has succeeded in raising that through the good offices of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health and myself.</P>
    <P>It is quite true that recently the Corporation has been experiencing difficulties in financing its proposals. Indeed, I am bound to say that so long as a man with the irresponsibility and the temperament of Deputy Belton has anything to do with the finances of the Corporation of the City of Dublin, I am afraid that it is going to have difficulties so long as a Deputy occupying a position which Deputy Belton does in relation to the finances of this city, comes into the D·il and states that the Government is going to spend a sum of £9,000,000 upon defence in this year, and when it is pointed out to him that he is quite inaccurate in that statement, that, according to the information which was given to the House during the debate upon the Supplementary Estimate for Defence, the amount of capital expenditure upon the Army equipment is going to be £5,500,000, and that it is to be spent over a period of three years, and the Deputy's response to that is: &ldquo;A few millions one way or the other does not matter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1881" /> What are responsible business men to think of that mentality when you have a gentleman in charge of the finances of the City of Dublin who thinks that, where public money is concerned, a few millions one way or the other does not matter?  It is very easy to understand why there should be a certain amount of hesitation upon the part of those who are responsible to their depositors for the safety of the moneys which have been entrusted to them, in dealing with him, a certain desire to see in connection with the question of Dublin housing finance that there will be a more responsible attitude than that towards the expenditure of public moneys.  Accordingly, I am bound to say this, that so far as employment can be increased by the execution of public works, and so far as unemployment is caused by the fact that public works are held up because the necessary funds are not forthcoming from the private investor and the private lender in this country, Deputy Belton's speech in this debate is not going to have a good influence, and is not going to have a good effect.  So much for the effect of this debate upon the unemployment position in our towns, and particularly the unemployment position in regard to the building industry.</P>
    <P>We had the same sort of ill-advised assertion and injudicious statement in regard to some aspects of the agricultural industry.  One of the great agencies for employment in certain agricultural areas is the beet-growing industry.  There are, I think, almost 30,000 growers employed in that industry, and when the factories are in full operation, there are, I think, about 2,500 people employed in them during the period of the campaign, and there are between 600 and 700 people &mdash;talking in round numbers&mdash;employed there all the year round.  Yet we have had speeches in this debate which, I think, are calculated to make the position of that industry a very precarious one.  We had Deputy Belton, who admits that he has not any interest in the industry, getting up here and trying to deter farmers from growing beet.  We had a number of other statements from Deputy Hughes and certain other Deputies, all to the same <Col N="1882" /> effect, all calculated, as Deputy Harris said, to give farmers the impression that the price which was being offered for beet during the present year was not sufficiently remunerative and was not a fair one.</P>
    <P>Now, if the factories do not get the beet, naturally the factories will have to close down and the whole position of that industry is going to be put in jeopardy, and I do not see how the speeches of these gentlemen, the speeches of Deputies like Deputy Belton, who have no interest at all in the beet, as he said&mdash;I do not see how such speeches are going to encourage farmers to grow beet, and I do not see how speeches of that sort, which are going to discourage farmers from growing beet, are going to help to provide employment for the agricultural labourers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me develop. Now, this industry is a very peculiar one.  One might say there are three interests involved in it.  There is the interest of the consumer which, I would say, bearing in mind the present price of sugar here, and bearing in mind the cost of other necessaries of life, is the paramount interest, because it affects, not 30,000 beet growers, but it affects 3,000,000 people in this country, and, accordingly, that interest has to be very carefully looked after.  We were told by Deputy Mulcahy to-day that the wholesale price of sugar, ex-duty, was £919,000 higher than it was in 1931&mdash;a very considerable factor in every family budget in this country, and therefore one which has to be very carefully considered by those who have an interest in putting this industry in a sound position, and in maintaining it here in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position of the consumer fixes a limit to the cost of the sugar.  If the position were to develop that the 3,000,000 consumers of sugar believed that they were being unduly exploited by any section of the community, in their hands is the political power to close down every one of those factories <Col N="1883" /> to-morrow.  And make no mistake about it, the price of sugar is something which is very carefully considered in every household in this country.  It is one of the things that the farmer's wife, just as the wife of the workingman in the town and the wife of the middle-class man in the town, looks at twice, because it is a figure that in this country has been stabilised within certain limits for many generations. There is no use talking of sugar here and looking at sugar here as a commodity that can be priced as it is priced in Czecho-Slovakia or in some other countries.  It cannot.  On the other side of the Border there is a standard of comparison to which every consumer in this country is going to look, in order to find out for himself whether the maintenance of this industry is worth the candle or not.  If the bulk of the consumers of this country come to the conclusion that they are being unduly exploited by that section of the community which is participating in the benefits of this industry, then the position of the industry becomes, as I say, very precarious, and its future very uncertain.</P>
    <P>It is with a full appreciation of that fact that Deputies like Deputy Belton, who has loudly proclaimed that he has no interest whatsoever in sugar-beet growing and who would not be affected by it if the factories closed down to-morrow, endeavour to induce these farmers, who do grow beet, and who would be affected if the factories closed down, to believe that they are not getting a fair price for their sugar.</P>

      <P>Whether I do or do not, I know that in regard to the price for sugar beet a very competent board considered that matter and gave their verdict as to what was or what was not a fair price.  Notwithstanding the unstinted admiration that Deputy Belton has for his own abilities and the unmeasured praise which he showers upon himself as a farmer or businessman, I do think in regard to <Col N="1884" /> this question of the price of beet, that most people in this country and most farmers are prepared to take the decision and abide by the decision and accept the decision of the board which the Government set up to investigate that matter and to report upon it.</P>

      <P>I have dealt with the position of the consumer, and, to some extent, with the position of the grower.  There is another point to be considered in relation to this matter and that is the position of the investor, the individual investor, who has provided the money for building these factories. The Government has gone to the private investor and, by means of public loans, has raised £500,000, among other sums, which it has invested in these factories.  The Government and the Deputies in this House and the Minister for Finance are all responsible to those who subscribed to our Fourth National Loan, in connection with which, when it was floated, it was stated that some part of those moneys would be used for the purpose of building and financing the new sugar factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government which has made that issue is, in my view, responsible to the people at large, who have entrusted the management of its concerns to it, to see that the money which is so invested receives a fair commercial return&mdash;a moderate one, if you like, judged by any standards&mdash;but receives, at any rate, such a return that the community as a whole is not going to be at undue loss by reason of the fact that the company is not able to earn normal profits and to meet all the charges that would be normal charges upon its capital and upon those profits.  But, apart altogether from the £500,000 which the Government itself, on behalf of the community as a whole, has invested in this industry, £1,500,000 has been directly invested in shares and in debentures of the company by private individuals in this country, and invested by individuals who have been <Col N="1885" /> prepared to risk their savings in order that the industrial policy of this Government, which was the industrial policy of Arthur Griffith, might be given effect to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

      <P>I read the <i>United Irishman</i> perhaps as long ago as Deputy Belton, and I remember that one of the projects Arthur Griffith used to advocate most strongly, week after week, was the growing of sugar beet in this country and the manufacture of our own sugar.  In article after article he described the development of the industry on the Continent under Napoleon, and then he used to enforce the lesson and say that we ought to do the same thing here because that particular industry was well suited to Irish agricultural conditions.</P>
      <P>As I was saying, however, most of this £1,500,000 which has been invested in this Sugar Company by private individuals has been invested in it by private individuals who learned their national economics from Arthur Griffith.  They are not rich and wealthy men who have entrusted that £1,500,000 to this Irish industry.  This £1,500,000 was money which they had saved, and which they could have put perhaps into rearmament shares or some of the ordinary English industrial stocks, and have made a very high profit out of the capital appreciation which has occurred during the past three or four years on the British Stock Exchange. But they are, as I say, small men in the main and because they were patriotic Irishmen they put their capital into this company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company issued £1,000,000 of debentures and £500,000 of 6 per cent. preference shares.  The preference shares were issued at a premium of 2/6.  The £1 preference shares were offered at 22/6, and they were fully subscribed, mainly by small investors. What is the position of that industry and of that company in the eyes of the small investor who put his money into that concern in the hope that, not merely would he help Irish industry but would get a reasonable return when he made that investment?  How <Col N="1886" /> are they looking at that concern to-day?</P>

      <P>Here is a letter that I have received.  I am going to read only a portion of it, if I may:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dear Mr. MacEntee,</P>
      <P>&ldquo;I have a rather good share of my money invested in the Irish Sugar Company, Limited, and, from what I hear, it seems that my shares are not of the value that I thought when investing.  The Preference Shares are now down to 19/9.  I cannot afford to run any risks either to my principal or dividends as I have nothing to live on except the interest on money like this, all of which is invested in Irish stocks and shares.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I happen to know that man personally. He is asking me what he would do with his shares, whether he would sell or hold.  He is a man who is well on in life, I would say, going on to 70.  He has lived a very active life, worked very hard, saved a little money.  Unfortunately, he has had in recent years a considerable amount of illness and he is no longer able to work.  He is looking to me to advise him what he is going to do in relation to the money which he has put, at the instance of the Irish Government and of this D·il, into this Irish industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He is wondering what he is going to do with it because he says that if the sort of speeches we have been listening to are going to be allowed to continue, &ldquo;I cannot see any future for that company.&rdquo; When we are told, as we have <Col N="1887" /> been told now&mdash;and it is better to be frank about this because it is an aspect of the matter that is very often overlooked&mdash;that it is up to the farmers on one side or the other, the beet growers on one side or the other, to let those who put their money into this industry go hang&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If any people are getting their 6 per cent. in this industry, it is because they have sunk their money in it, and they are entitled to get that 6 per cent.  That is the condition upon which the shares were issued, that they would carry a 6 per cent. dividend, and if that dividend of 6 per cent. was not offered at the time, we could not have got the money and there would have been no factories and no market for sugar beet, whether at 35/-, 49/6, or 55/-.  Deputies know as well as I do the fable of the man who had the goose which laid the golden eggs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been asked by Deputy Cogan, by Deputy Bennett and by every other Deputy on the opposite benches who thinks that the farmers of Ireland are mendicants, that we should provide them with £7,000,000, £10,000,000, £30,000,000.  There is no limit to the amount we have to sink in Irish agriculture.  Where are we going to get that money?  If money is going to be provided for agricultural credit, it can only be got by going to those people in this country who have saved money, those people who have pinched themselves and deprived themselves of many enjoyments in order that they might make provision for the end of their lives when they would not be able to maintain themselves, and asking them to lend us their money and telling them that we will see that once they have entrusted that money to us, the capital will be safe and they will get a reasonable interest in respect of <Col N="1888" /> it.  Now we are told that people who, at our instance, in the years 1933 and 1934, entrusted us with £1,500,000 to put into a certain industry can go and whistle for their dividends.</P>

      <P>With that, I do not intend to delay the House much further. <Col N="1889" /> I said at the beginning that it had been represented that the root cause of such unemployment as exists in this country is the fact that credit facilities are not available for agriculture, and that credit facilities are not available for house building.  I pointed out one of the factors which have contributed to make it difficult to finance house building in Dublin City, and I have pointed out that some of the speeches that have been made in this House during this debate, in regard to credit for agriculture, would have the effect of destroying such credit as the Irish farmer has, if people were to believe that those speeches truly represent the Irish farmer's point of view. They do not represent the Irish farmer's point of view.  They represent the point of view of a few politicians who would like to exploit the Irish farmer for their own ends, but, as was said by a Deputy on the other side, when the Irish farmer does enter into an obligation, he is prepared to honour it, even at great cost to himself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that this is generally recognised by those who have money to invest has enabled the Irish farmer to provide himself with a considerable amount of capital.  Deputy Bennett spoke in terms of £7,000,000, £10,000,000 and £30,000,000, but the Irish farmer has already in the Irish banks, and available for him, if he wants it, £35,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>How?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>£35,000,000 of the deposits in the Irish banks belong to Irish farmers and, to my mind, the fact that that money is there is a clear indication that the general mass of the farmers, the general body of the farmers, do not want to be spoon-fed in the way in which Deputy Bennett would ask the House to believe.  The money is there.  It is theirs, and they can use it if they are in want of capital, and any of them who feel that they can profitably employ capital will take it out and put it into their land, and into <Col N="1890" /> their industry.  Apart altogether from that, there is a number of unfortunate farmers, a small percentage of them, not representative of the general mass of the farming community who are in difficulties, but, mind you, the way to help them out of their difficulties at present is not to make credit too easy for them.</P>
      <P>We were told about the disappointment that followed the settlement of the annuities dispute.  We were told how people had bought cattle in the expectation that prices were going to rise, but that so far from prices rising after the dispute, there was a tendency for prices to drop.  Now, let anybody who thinks that the agricultural future is rosy and that all the farmer wants at the moment is to get additional capital in order that he may stock up his land, look at the course of agricultural prices in the world to-day.  In regard to a considerable number of commodities which do fix the price of our produce in the English market, there is a pronounced tendency to slump, and I think that, in view of that situation, you would be doing a poor kindness to the struggling farmer to give him easy money and to encourage him to launch out now into what might be a speculation that would be very uncertain of a return.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be far better for the farmer to work with his limited resources, even though the times are hard, and, mind you, they are hard, due to an act of God, and not due to any economic factor.  The past year, as we have heard, has been one of the worst for a generation from a climatic point of view.  In so far as helping the farmer with seeds and manures and that sort of thing to enable him to get his land back to good heart, everything possible should be done, in order to remedy the position which the bad weather of last year has created.  But so far as encouraging any small farmer with limited capital, or with no capital, to launch out now into live stock, or any thing like that, is concerned, I certainly, looking at the world as a whole and the position which at the moment is developing, do not think that such a thing should be encouraged by providing <Col N="1891" /> him with cheap money at this moment.</P>
    <P>It would be much better for the farmer to work away within his limited resources until there is a definite change for the better and world prices for agriculture tend to rise.  At the present moment, as I have said, there is a slump in certain commodities which is bound to react here.  It would be better for us that the farmers should work prudently and cautiously within the means which they have at their disposal for the time being and, if the present international situation clears up and if employment conditions elsewhere improve, then there might be something to be said for encouraging our farmers to go further; but I would not force the pace now, particularly on those who have no resources to stand losses if losses should occur.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That the D·il disapproves of Defence Force Regulation 69 of 1938.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I should like, before going into details, to point out that, quite obviously, this is a non-political motion.  It is a motion that does not apply to, or emanate from, one political Party any more than another.  It is a motion dealing with the rates of pay for certain professional officers in the Army. The Army is the Army of the Parliament, not the Army of either one Party or the other, not even the Army of the Government.  The officers and soldiers of the Army are prohibited from making their case or ventilating their grievances in the public Press. They are prohibited from approaching Deputies.  They are prohibited from taking any normal steps to have grievances or injustices, real or imaginary, brought to the attention of the general public or Deputies in the D·il.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That being so I should like to ask the Minister, before we proceed further, if <Col N="1893" /> he would allow this question to be decided on its merits and to be adjudicated upon by a free D·il, if he will leave the particular point at issue to be decided by a D·il without shackles, by Deputies without any Whip, in other words, if he will leave it to a free vote.  May I take his silence as an affirmative or a negative answer?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister cannot make up his mind whether it is fair, just and reasonable to have the pay of officers in the Army decided by a free vote of the D·il or whether it is preferable, in the interests of silent gagged services, to have a regulation, which affects them adversely, decided by a shackled D·il, with an assured majority and that majority not allowed the right to decide between right and wrong.  There are some occasions when a Parliament that claims to be a free Parliament of a free people, should, in fact, be a free Parliament and if ever there is an occasion when Parliament should be free, it is when we are discussing the conditions of service of officers and men who are prohibited from calling any attention to their grievances.  I think it is asking nothing unreasonable to suggest that the case, such as it is, should be decided on its merits and not decided by the crack of Deputy Briscoe's whip or the whip of anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This particular regulation adversely affecting the interests of every professional officer in the Army was put through with the most remarkable secrecy of any regulation from any Governmental Department I ever heard of.  This particular regulation cutting the pay of medical officers, dental officers, legal officers and other officers by amounts varying from £2 to £9 a week was issued like a bolt from the blue on the 1st of December last.  A month or six weeks subsequent to that date no member of the public and no Deputy of D·il Eireann could succeed in procuring a copy of that regulation. The Government Publicity Department were, day after day, asked in vain for a copy of this regulation.  Government publications are supposed to be available <Col N="1894" /> and for sale to the public, but the public could not get a copy of that regulation.  The officers here in D·il Eireann could not procure a copy of it up to a fortnight ago.</P>
    <P>When an organisation of professional men, representing the interests of the affected officers, tried to procure copies of the regulations and put up a question requiring answers as to how these regulations affected the officers in the various ranks, even the Department of Defence itself could not produce a copy of the parent regulation and wrote as late as yesterday to say that it was out of print and that it would take some months before a copy would be available.  The regulation itself was put through in such haste, with such a lack of consideration and in such a petty pique that you have the extraordinary state of affairs that if an officer is promoted from the rank of second lieutenant to first lieutenant his pay is actually reduced.  That in itself is evidence of the amount of departmental consideration this regulation got.  It is a regulation which was considered in a rage and conceived in pique.  That is sufficient evidence of the consideration this regulation received from the Minister or his staff or any responsible civil servant in the Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister's attention has not perhaps already been called to it, but he will find if he looks at the rate of pay of a second lieutenant five years in that rank, that that man, after two years' promotion to the rank of first lieutenant, actually has his pay reduced. Is there any further evidence required as to the hasty, ill-considered way in which this regulation was drawn up?  Why this hasty decision, this dishonouring of contracts, interfering with the published conditions of service? The first thing, on the face of it shows a lack of consideration for the years of service.  Next to that is the lack of consideration for human beings who have got to suffer under this petty tyranny.</P>
    <P>What does it all amount to?  I guarantee that there are not two Deputies in D·il Eireann who understand what is the meaning of these regulations, because every precaution was taken to ensure that neither <Col N="1895" /> Deputies nor the public could by any process become aware of the injustice that was being carried out.  It was because the executive of the Medical Union happened not to see eye to eye with the Minister when he was considering that regulation.  Here, in a word, is what the regulation amounts to: The pay of Army medical officers, legal officers, and other professional men entering the Army was fixed many years ago, not by the Department of Defence, not by men in uniform, not by the chiefs of this particular service, but by what was called an Army Pay Commission, with two representatives of the Department of Finance, the Army Finance Officer, the Minister for Defence, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence, and three military members of the Army Council. By that mixed body, fairly representative of the Department of Finance, the civilian side of the Department of Defence, and the military commanders of the Army, the rates of pay for all ranks, including the ranks referred to in this particular order, were fixed. Those rates of pay were advertised and published in the medical colleges, in the law schools, and in the dental hospitals. Parents with sons qualified or about to become qualified saw there, in black and white, what the rates of pay for a doctor entering the Army would be, and what the rates of pay would be after two years or after five years&mdash; promotion to the rank of captain, or to the rank of commandant, and so on. There was a definite contract between the State and the citizen that these were to be the conditions in that service. Those were the rates that that man could look forward to if he made good and secured promotion.  Those rates held there through one, two, three, four, five and six Governments. They were approved of by this Parliament year after year for nearly 20 years.  They were approved of by the Minister for Defence for seven long years, year after year.</P>
    <P>Then, what happened to make those rates unjust, to make them unfair? Merely that there was another scheme governing the pensions introduced by the Minister.  The conditions of that scheme, in so far as they affected the <Col N="1896" /> doctors, were adversely criticised by the leaders of the medical profession. The answer to that adverse criticism was the answer of a bully who went to his office, disembowelled the medical rates of pay in the Army, and issued his ukase like a bombshell to decent young and middle-aged officers who had given 20 years of unequalled service to a half-dozen Governments of different political hues.</P>
    <P>This regulation was issued to these officers and the result of the regulation was as follows: the rate of pay for a lieutenant is reduced by £1 11s. 6d. a week.  The maximum rate of pay for a lieutenant when read as against the new rate after five years' service in that rank shows a reduction of £1 11s. 6d. per week.  At a time when it is generally admitted that the cost of living is going up, and the cost of rearing a family is going up, the most junior rank, the lowest officer rank in the service, is reduced by that much per week, not per month or per year, but per week.  The rate of pay of the next rank of junior officer is reduced by £3 13s. 6d. per week.  The commandant is reduced by £5 15s. 6d. per week.  In the next rank, the highest rank in the Army Medical Service, that of major, the rate of pay is reduced by £7 1s. 6d. a week, or more than £1 per day.  The rate of pay for the major holding the rank of D.M.S., the dream of every young doctor joining the Army, is reduced by no less a sum than £9 1s. 6d. per week.</P>
    <P>Is it unreasonable, when that is being done to people who served us only too well, to ask that if that is to be done under Parliament, that it will be a free Parliament will decide on its justice or injustice, a free Parliament, a Parliament without shackles, a Parliament not just voting like cattle driven through a gate; but a Parliament of human beings voting on conditions that affect fellow-human beings with the same rights as you and I have?  Is it fair that these conditions should be imposed on officers in our Army when a neighbouring army, the army of Great Britain, is increasing its inducements day after day and, even as things were, getting the cream of the medical profession and our Army getting the next best; when their inducements were <Col N="1897" /> going up so much that in a matter of ten years the rates of pay for every medical rank doubled?  Not being satisfied with having doubled the rates of pay there was a new inducement introduced&mdash;that after five years' service a doctor would get a lump sum of £1,000, whether he stayed or left, just a refresher, a sweetener, an extra inducement to get Irish doctors.  There are also communications here at the moment in every Irish medical school to know what extra inducements they can offer in order to get the cream of the young medical men of this country.</P>
    <P>The man responsible for the efficiency and for the type and quality that constitute the Irish Army can do nothing better to induce the cream of the professional men of this country into his Army than this insulting regulation, a regulation offering lower terms for professional men and lower ranks for professional men than any white army in the world.  Is it not a proud thing for the nation that used to be called a nation of scholars that the value we place on our scholars is the lowest standard in any white country in the world?  That is the mentality behind the £10,000,000 demand&mdash;a £10,000,000 demand and a tuppeny-ha'penny mentality; that is the mentality that is to handle the £10,000,000&mdash;that kind of mentality which is aimed at recruiting the worst.</P>
    <P>At the new rates of pay I have no doubt that the Ministers will get doctors.  He will get the dregs and the duds of the medical profession, and only the dregs and the duds, the men who have sunk so low that they do not mind being professional blacklegs, being regarded as blacklegs inside and outside the Irish Army.  He will get them.  He will get the witless loon who, through accident, got qualified and could not earn a living outside the institution created by our Minister for Defence.  He will get that type without a doubt.  That is the type of professional man that is going to treat the sick and wounded Irish heroes. That is the type of professional man who is going to treat the poor soldier when he is sick, the soldier's family, and the officer and the soldier when injured and wounded.  That is the <Col N="1898" /> highest we can aim at, the standard of the Crimea, the standard of every army up to 20 or 25 years ago, a medical standard under which in every war more people went down with dirt, lice, and disease than went down through enemy action.  That is where we are going to begin in this country &mdash;where other armies gave up 50 years ago.</P>
    <P>If the Minister has no experience, no knowledge, no insight of his own, can he not learn the lesson that every army in the world has learned, that in peace or war, if you are to think of the comfort and welfare of the soldier, the first way to think of the welfare and comfort of the soldier is to give the soldier confidence in the man who treats him when sick and wounded, and to get the best.  All modern armies are competing for the best, and we, who produce and export more doctors even than the mighty country beside us, are making a present of the best.  Any man who wants a service life has either to accept the despicable treatment of a bully and to brand himself as a blackleg, or go to serve in a foreign army.  This comes from the Minister who boasted that under his rÈgime he would attract back to Erin the exiled sons from abroad. He is the greatest exporter of flesh and blood that this country has seen in our time.  As I say, the one thing that is inexcusable about it is that it is done out of pique against men he cannot hit. But he hits their professional brethren, men who by law must remain silent, men who by law must continue to serve under those conditions.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that these are the rates for the new entrants, that these are the rates for the men coming in afterwards, and that he is not interfering with the rates of men already serving.  The men already serving were induced to serve and have served for 15 years at a certain rate. We will say a lieutenant had served at a certain rate with a maximum pay of 25/- per day, and that after 17 years' service he was entitled to hope that some day he would be a captain, and that the rate of pay for the captain would be as it was&mdash;35/- per day.  If that man is promoted to-morrow after 17 years in the rank of lieutenant, and <Col N="1899" /> takes the new rate of pay, he will actually draw less than he is drawing at the moment.</P>
    <P>If the captain serving at the moment &mdash;the most highly efficient man, we will say, that any Army ever saw&mdash;is promoted, not only to commandant, but over the rank of commandant to major, and he accepts the new rates of pay, the reward for being so efficient that he is being promoted two ranks up is that his pay is reduced.  Men and their wives and their families do not live on the pips on an officer's shoulder; they live on his earnings; and with regard to serving officers, this Order has ensured that, no matter what promotion they get, even to the very highest rank in the service, they cannot increase their bank accounts by one ha'penny a year.  That is the justice and those are the standards of 1939.  That is the act of a Christian Government in a Christian country&mdash; that frothy hypocrisy that was poured over this country by the biggest humbug of all.  Let men's Christianity be judged by their acts.  Any non-Christian, any two-legged human barbarian, would be ashamed to be guilty of what the Minister is guilty in this Order.</P>
    <P>I had occasion to ask the Minister within the last few months&mdash;never anticipating anything of this kind&mdash;how many promotions were made from the rank of captain to higher rank in the Army Medical Service in the last 14 years, and the answer was &ldquo;Nil.&rdquo;  I asked him how many promotions from lieutenant up in the ranks of Army dentists had been made in the last 14 years, and the answer was &ldquo;Nil.&rdquo; There were no promotions, from junior rank up, for either doctors or dentists for a span of 14 years, and those men were entitled to live in hopes that some day, in some way, they would be promoted.</P>
    <P>Now, after those 14 years of the most excmplary service, an Order is brought in to ensure that if they do get promotion, no matter how much, or no matter how rapid, or no matter how high, they cannot earn an extra ha'penny for their families.  And those men are to go through their service, like professional men, doomed for all time, no matter how excellent they <Col N="1900" /> are, to a rate of 25/- a day.  Those men were foolish enough to trust in a Minister.  They were foolish enough to have faith in the honour of a contract. They were foolish enough to marry and to take on added responsibilities, saying to themselves: &ldquo;We are in Government service; the conditions of service will not be altered for us.&rdquo;  What do they find?  They find that their confidence was misplaced, that their trust was trampled on, that their efficient service was ignored&mdash; that there was a bully in the saddle who, because their professional colleagues outside happened to give offence, could say that he had his heel on their necks and that they were going to suffer for the acts of others. And we have that from a Christian Government for a Christian country!</P>
    <P>Imagine in any walk of life&mdash;whether the Civil Service, the postal service, or any big industry&mdash;if people were attracted into that business or into that service because of certain conditions and certain rates of pay published and advertised, and as soon as they were in for 15 years, a manager would be in a position to say: &ldquo;You cannot go except I let you go; you cannot get out even if you want to.&rdquo;  Imagine that happening after 15 years&mdash;the whole conditions knocked sky-high by an act of the manager, the whole basis undermined and conditions laid down so that, if the humblest man were promoted to the highest position, he could not get an increase of pay&mdash;would not an act such as that breed, produce, and command revolution in any country?  Yet, that is the headline that is set here in Ireland's Army, and that is the headline and that is the conduct that the Parliament of this country is asked to approve of.</P>
    <P>It may not be popular, in the broad sense, to be talking of the salaries of professional men.  Professional men, however, are entitled to a fair deal. They are entitled to have their contract honoured and to have the conditions that induced them in retained, just as much as anybody else, and the fact that there are only 30 or 36 of them should not matter to Parliament.  It should be equal in our eyes if there were only four of them; but the policy there is <Col N="1901" /> to count heads, and if there are few heads, hit them&mdash;they are not dangerous&mdash;but if there are many heads, be nice to them.  That is the policy.  That is the policy we are asked to approve of.  I say this, and I say it with knowledge, that when we are talking about these men we are not just talking about ordinary doctors.  Once upon a time, as a result of a debate in this House, as a result of some criticisms in this House, I had occasion to ask for the academic distinctions and degrees held by the doctors and dentists of the Army Medical Service.  At that time there were some 70 in the service, and I found that, with three exceptions, 67 of those men were first class exhibitionists, gold medallists, and men with post-graduate degrees.  You had a class of men there of a quality unequalled in this country congregated together in that service, and you had it so because men entering that service were sent into the service by representatives of the different medical schools and hospitals, and they would only put forward the best man for the one vacancy.  You had doctors and dentists of unequalled merit and exceptional ability, with a record of success and achievement behind them.  The Minister, out of that 70, passed what I would not hesitate to call the best 28&mdash;the best 28 of an excellent 70&mdash;and those men, I know, have done their work as well and as excellently, under this Minister, as under any predecessor.  And the gratitude they get, and the return they get, is that an order comes now that says: &ldquo;Thus far shall you go and no further.  No matter what promotion you get, there will be no extra pay; no matter how difficult you are finding it to live with a family growing up, no extra pay; no matter how exceptional or meritorious your service may have been, you can never, while you remain in this Army, get any increase in your pay, notwithstanding how much your rank has been increased, and you cannot get out until I am pleased to let you out.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister when moving this motion if he would leave this particular matter to be decided by a free vote of the Parliament, seeing that the Army cannot engage in propaganda, <Col N="1902" /> cannot ventilate their case, cannot approach Deputies, and is the Army of the whole Parliament.  The Minister would not make up his mind then, but he made it up quick enough when it was a case of striking a blow. He cannot make it up equally quickly to meet a just case, and to give fair play.  Perhaps, now that the Minister has had some time to consider, not as to what is the best course&mdash;because that will not weigh with the Minister&mdash; but as to what is the wisest course politically, he will give a reply.  I am anxious to hear from the Minister what consideration this Order got, or how he expects to get efficient doctors, dentists and legal men under these conditions?  How does he expect to compete with any other army, or with the attractions of civilian life under these conditions, except to accept what is staring him in the face under the new conditions, that he is going to get, if he gets any, only the very worst.  Is it fair play to Irish officers, to Irish soldiers, and to the families of Irish officers and Irish soldiers, that when they are ill, or when they are wounded, they will be treated professionally only by the very worst elements of the Irish medical profession?</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Higgins, in the course of his eloquent remarks, said that I brought in this regulation fixing the scales of pay for professional men in the Army in a fit of pique, and out of hatred for certain members of the medical profession who claimed to represent that profession. I want to make it quite clear, at the beginning, that I have the greatest admiration and every respect for men who take up the care of the sick as a vocation.  I have the greatest possible respect for the present officers of the Army Medical Service.  As to the profession generally, a very big number of my best personal friends belong to that honourable profession, and a very big number of my own personal relations as well, and, far from having any hatred of the medical profession, <Col N="1903" /> I have the greatest regard in the world for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question I should like to put to Deputy O'Higgins, or to any other Deputy, is this: If the rates for medical and other professional men in the Army are not fair, having regard to the other rates of pay within the Army, and the general scales of pay and allowances throughout the country, I would like to know what are fair rates of pay? I did not go to the trouble of taking down all Deputy O'Higgins's adjectives or the terms in which he compared the new rates of pay, but he called it an insulting regulation.  I think that was about the mildest adjective used by the Deputy, and we will take it at that&mdash;<Col N="1904" /> that it is an insulting regulation.  For the information of Deputies who may not have read this insulting regulation, I have a number of copies of a document here, in which, first of all, we set out the rates of pay that existed heretofore for medical members of the Defence forces, and for engineering members of the Defence forces.  The second table is a statement showing the present rates in the British Army for infantry, medical and engineering officers, and the third table shows the present rates of pay.  I will ask the usher to give copies of this table to Deputies, and I will give a copy for insertion in the Official Debates.</P>

    <P>Hence, after three years' satisfactory service, a medical officer even under the revised rates, will be entitled to emoluments in cash or in kind to the extent of, approximately, £519 a year. Taking the old rates of pay in the Defence forces, and taking one rank right through for the sake of convenience, if Deputies compare the position of a captain in our infantry, medical service, and engineers, under the old rates, they will find that a medical captain got twice as much pay as a captain in the infantry, that, in fact, he got practically as much or more pay than a colonel in the infantry, and that he was 67 per cent. in excess of the pay given to an engineer.  An engineering officer has also to go through the university for a number of years, yet under the old rates of pay, the medical officer got 67 per cent. more than his brother, the engineering officer.  If you look at the British Army, and take their present rates, it will be found that a medical captain only got 25 per cent. of an addition more than the infantry captain, whereas in our Army <Col N="1906" /> the medical captain got twice as much as the infantry captain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>We will come to all that. If you compare the British medical captain with the engineering captain, he only gets 12 per cent. more than the engineering captain, as against 67 per cent. that our medical captain gets above the engineering captain.  I have only given here the British rates.  If Deputies want them I can get the rates of pay in other armies.</P>

      <P>That is in the table I gave the Deputy.  In Table II he will see that a medical captain in the British Army only gets 25 per cent. above what an infantry captain gets, whereas our medical captain, under the old rates of pay, got twice as much as an infantry captain, and got more than an infantry colonel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Deputies will look at Table III they will see set out there the &ldquo;insulting&rdquo; rates of pay&mdash;what Deputy O'Higgins calls &ldquo;insulting&rdquo;&mdash;that we are offering to professional men in the Army.  When a young man leaves the university, having taken a degree in medicine, he will come in at £296 a year.  For some reason or another the increments per year were carried on as if a man would remain a second lieutenant in the medical service for a number of years.  As a matter of fact it is agreed that in future in the case of anybody joining as a doctor&mdash;this has been in practice in the case of the engineers for a long time&mdash;his tenure of office as a second lieutenant will not be longer than a year.  After the first year, a year of probation, he gets £296, plus certain allowances.  If you add those allowances to his pay it brings him up to £412 per year for the first year of service.  If you follow him on, you find that in the second year of his service he gets £429 per year.  I would ask <Col N="1907" /> Deputies to remember that these officers, if they have to travel, get travelling allowances, and if they have to leave a hospital to which they are attached and stay away for a night, they get a living out allowance, and, generally speaking, they have fairly regular hours.  If a man marries&mdash;a professional officer can get married after three years, and some in special circumstances have been allowed to go on the marriage strength at an earlier date&mdash;if he gets married after three years satisfactory service, he will get allowances up to £179 which, with his pay of £340, will bring him up to £519 a year.</P>
    <P>Apart from pay, take the case of a married officer after three years' service in the rank of lieutenant, what has he to look forward to?  He can remain in the Army for a big number of years, probably about 30 years.  If he wants to leave it after 20 years, he will be entitled to the maximum of his pension, if his pension is based in the same way as the pensions of the infantry officers are based.  That pension is also something to look forward to, in addition to the £519 per year to which he is entitled if he is a married officer. If he is a married officer he has this also to look forward to: that in addition to his own pension, if he dies after ten years in the service his wife is entitled to a pension and his children, if there are children, to allowances until they reach the age of 18 or 20 years.  So that you have this position, taking it at the lowest, that the average man coming in and only getting to the rank of lieutenant, after three years will have £519 a year without any expenses.  If there are any expenses in relation to his duty he will be paid them.  He will have £519 a year plus a pension for himself, plus a pension for his wife, and plus allowances for his children in case he dies after a certain period of years.  I would like to ask Deputies here who know the medical profession throughout the country and what dispensary doctors get, who know, generally speaking, what standard of life the medical people have who set up in private practice, would they be insulted if they got such a job?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1908" /> I have got a paper here which is the official organ of an organisation calling itself &ldquo;The Irish Free State Medical Union.&rdquo;  I think that Deputy O'Higgins should tell them that that animal does not any longer exist: that there &ldquo;ain't&rdquo; any such animal as &ldquo;the Irish Free State.&rdquo;  In the issue of that paper for February of this year they give me &ldquo;down the banks&rdquo; for the regulations.  I read their article carefully.  I actually read the paper all through.  Generally speaking, it seems to me to be an organ that is defending the medical interests, trying to keep up their fees, and keep up their status. With that I have no reason to growl at all.  I am glad to see that they have an organisation, and I hope it will be successful in keeping up the status of the medical profession, and that those who treat the sick will be able to get a decent living so that they can continue-their good work.  I read and I looked through the paper, seeing that it was condemning me for the rates of pay, the &ldquo;insulting&rdquo; rates of pay, that we are offering.  I said to myself that these people must be well on the road to being millionaires: that, if there is any job going, they must be all getting thousands a year.  I looked through the whole paper, from front to back, and I found one advertisement for medical officers.  It was put in under the official aegis of this &ldquo;Irish Free State Medical Union.&rdquo;  What do Deputies think were the rates of pay offered for the two jobs advertised in it?  Not £519 a year plus a pension for the man himself, plus a pension for his wife if he dies after a certain number of years' service, and plus allowances for his children, but £200 a year and £150 a year, for the only two jobs that were offered in the paper.  That is what I found in the paper that condemned me for the &ldquo;insulting&rdquo; regulations under which we are giving three and four times more, and ten times the security.</P>

      <P>The Deputy made one allegation that I want to deal with.  He said that the regulations which I issued adversely affected every professional officer in the Army.  Well, that is one of Deputy O'Higgins' usual exaggerations, because it improved the rate of pay of the engineers, who are professional men, and who are entitled to live as well as the doctors.  I found existing in the Army a situation in regard to the rates of pay that I could not stand over.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>In the retired pay scheme that was being drafted for a number of years we laid down a certain scale of pensions for the officers of the various services and corps. <Col N="1910" /> Roughly, we gave doctors 25 per cent. more than the officers of the infantry or the officers of the artillery or other corps.  By that, I indicated what I thought roughly should be the difference in their rate of pay.  Deputy O'Higgins attacked me here because we were giving only 25 per cent. more to a medical captain than to an infantry captain, when in fact his pay was twice as much.  As far as I remember, I countered that by saying that that was what I thought was fair. When my attention was called to it I went into the matter and tried to see how best I could draw up a scale of pay that would be fair to all the officers in the Army.  Looking at the engineers' rate of pay, compared with the doctors and compared with the infantry men, I thought it was too low.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>So that is what the dishonouring of the contract boils down to; that is what the statement that the pay of every professional officer was adversely affected boils down to&mdash;that certain of them were going to get their pay and allowances raised, and the others were not going to have them lowered.  Deputy O'Higgins allowed himself great latitude in his language, and I do not propose to follow him because this is a rather serious subject and I do not want to be misunderstood in the matter.  He said that for the future we would get nothing but the &ldquo;dregs&rdquo; and &ldquo;duds&rdquo; of the medical profession, the &ldquo;blacklegs&rdquo;, the &ldquo;witless loons&rdquo;; and used other terms belittling the capabilities and the brains of the people we were likely to get.  I hold, first of all, that as Minister <Col N="1913" /> for Defence, I must have regard to the rates of pay in all branches of the Army, and that I cannot pay the medical people or any pets of mine twice as much as another corps.  Whatever the historical reasons may be, the medical rates of pay here were fixed much higher than the British rates, or even than the American rates, as far as I remember, while the infantry officers' rates were fixed much lower.  I have tried to get a fair relationship between the pay of the artillery man and the medical man, between that of the infantry man and the engineer.  I looked at the whole problem and said: &ldquo;The medical man or other professional man, who educated himself at his own or at his parents' expense, is undoubtedly entitled to a bit more than the man who did not spend so long at school or college.  If we want to get the benefit of their extended course of studies we have to pay for it, and we will have to pay fairly for it.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I arrived at this basis of differentiation, that for the first year we will give to every professional officer who comes into the Army, and has the qualifications that we require, £25 per year for each year he attended the university. Taking the average attendance at the university for the doctor at six years, we are giving him £150 a year more than a lieutenant, say, in the artillery or infantry.  As regards the engineer doing an average of four years in the university, to him we are giving £100 a year more than his brother infantry officer.  The infantry officer, of course, remains sometimes for quite a number of years as a second lieutenant.  The professional man will go up to first lieutenant, with an increase of pay at the end of a probationary single year of service.  In addition, the professional man is allowed to get married at the end of three years; the ordinary infantry man at the end of five years, so far as I remember.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to hear from any Deputy on what fairer basis I could fix the scales for the future.  It is always very hard, indeed, to interfere with this question of pay.  It is very easy to give increases; it is very hard to make reductions.  I do not want to see the status of the professional people of this <Col N="1914" /> country lowered in any way, but I think the rest of the community have the right to see that all their wealth is not going to support the professional classes.  Give them a fair do&mdash;I am all in favour of it&mdash;but we must not favour any section of the community who might have power to influence the scale of income of themselves more than certain other sections of the community; we certainly must not, in the public service, give countenance to an inordinate rate of pay for professional men beyond that of people who might not have had the opportunity to go forward into the professions.  By all manner of means we must treat our professional people decently.  We must give them a fair rate of pay.</P>
    <P>What I want to know from any Deputy is that if he thinks what I have tried to arrange is not a fair rate of pay for both the medical and the engineering officers, bearing in mind what the infantry and the artillery officers have, then what, in his opinion, is a fair rate, and how much per university year are we to give?  Are we to take into account in any way the number of years the engineer serves as against a doctor, and the number of years a doctor serves in the university as against, say, a dentist?  I will put these questions.  If these are not fair rates, what are fair rates, how are we to arrive at them, and how are we to make any difference between one professional man and another, whose university careers differ in length?  How are we to arrive at that basis?  If some of the Fine Gael Deputies do not address themselves to those questions here, I would like them to do so outside the House, to think over them and to tell Deputy O'Higgins privately whether they think that the present rates of pay are fair for the medical people, having regard to the rate of pay for the engineers, having regard to the infantry man's rate of pay, and having regard to the general interests of the community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has submitted a table in which he marks down the percentage of the medical rate above the infantry rate and above the engineering rate.  The Minister will observe that there are two figures in <Col N="1915" /> both of the columns, infantry and medical, and also in respect of engineers.  He confines himself to one figure in the percentage and does not take the average of either.  Why does he not give the two figures in each case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not possibly undertake to deal with all the figures in that table under two hours.  I have given one set of figures.  I have given all Deputies copies of the tables, and I have made one thing out of the figures.  If anybody else can make anything to the contrary, or contradict my argument in any way, for goodness sake let him do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will admit the figures are set up to prove what he wants to prove to the House?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>No figure is correct which is misleading.  Figures must always be referred to something definite.  For example, here we have an infantry officer having £183 to £256, and a medical man with £219 to £456. The Minister selects the £256 and the £456 and makes the percentage on that. What is the objection to doing it in the other case?  The other case, the Minister will observe, will be about 20 per cent., and it would not be such an attractive figure at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole case is based upon that, and I suggest that when we get figures, at least they ought to be complete and not misleading.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Official figures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, official figures. I think there was a weakness in the Minister's case in which he set out to appraise the value of university years. If the circumstances are the same there might be something to be said for them. As regards the case made by Deputy O'Higgins, which I am taking as correct, that you have in the medical <Col N="1916" /> service specially qualified medical men as distinct from men being qualified, the Defence forces are partaking of what might be called the cream of the profession.  If that is required, if we want efficient service, if we want men that the Army can rely upon when it calls upon their services, when it knows that they are the most efficient, the best qualified, I suggest to the Minister that he has got to pay for that.  If the Minister goes around town he will find it is possible to buy a suit of clothes for something like 50/-, but if he goes to a first-class tailor he will pay ten guineas.  There is a very considerable difference between the two and very different value between the two.  And if we require expert services from the best qualified men, then it is not a question of simply totting up how many pounds a year one will allow for the period a man served in the university. I wonder if, in connection with his calculations for the university careers of these men, he made any extra provision for a post-graduate course, or if he made any allowance for being an exhibitioner?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comparing the two sets of tables, on the British rates, a captain starts at £447 a year and goes up to £535.  Under the new rates here a captain is going to get £376 and go up to £449.  If we are to take the Minister's statement at its true value, is there not a greater attraction in the pay that is going to be offered in the British Army than that which is offered here for a medical officer who considers that particular scale and who has to look after his prospects in the world?  Are our soldiers not entitled to get the best service that it is possible to get for them?  Are we, for the sake of a few pounds a year, going to mark the difference between a first class medical man and a pass man?  It was not for that purpose that we introduced in this State the Local Appointments Commission. It was not for that purpose that we hear day after day from medical men the desirability and the necessity of having post-graduate courses.  This table and this scheme appear to me to characterise, if it were necessary to characterise still more clearly, the <Col N="1917" /> mediocrity of the Government&mdash;their hopeless, soulless mediocrity.  They are dragging everything in the country, or trying to drag it down to their own level.  Our soldiers are entitled to better treatment than that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>One would imagine that when, I will not say a responsible person, but a person holding a responsible post, presumes to give official figures to Parliament, the true figures would be given and that they would not be presented in a thoroughly misleading way, particularly when we are dealing with conditions in another army and in another State.  That kind of misleading presentation of conditions could easily lead to international unpleasantness.  We had a table issued by the Minister, and I would ask every Deputy to retain his copy, of what he alleges to be the rates of pay for medical officers in another army, and it gives the rate of pay, rank by rank. The deduction that a Deputy is to draw from that and the case made by the Minister over those figures is that the lieutenant medical officers and junior medical officers in our Army are paid higher rates than in the British Army.  Did the Minister tell any Deputy in D·il Eireann that when a man joined the Army Medical Service of the British Services he was guaranteed automatic promotion with time; that he could look forward after six months to being a captain or out of the army; that after so many years he would be a major or out of the army; that after 20 years he would have to be a lieutenant-colonel or out of the army; and that, in fact, what the British guarantee is that the man who is there for ten years is drawing something in the neighbourhood of £1,000 a year and that the man who is there for 19 or 20 years is drawing practically £2,000 a year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is that what is shown there?  I have the official rates here, if the Minister would like to be educated in the affairs and the business of the Department of Defence by an Opposition Deputy.  Did the Minister tell you, when he was giving <Col N="1918" /> those British rates of pay, that officers in the British Army were paid, in addition to the rates there, from 5/- to £1 a day command pay and charge pay?  Do you think, if my statements are true, that we listened to a truthful, honourable presentation of a case by a person holding a responsible office? The bench the Minister is speaking from is degraded by his activities here this evening, and the Parliament that would take it meekly and patiently would deserve to be degraded.</P>
    <P>Figures issued from a Government Front Bench by a responsible Minister, whether they suit his case or not, should at least be honestly presented, and all the facts associated with those figures should be stated, not withheld because the case would not sound as good if the truth were given.</P>
    <P>The Minister contrasts the junior officer in our Army with the junior officer in the British Army, and he withholds the fact that the junior officer in the British Army is guaranteed promotion every few years, so that, if he serves his 20 years, he must be at least a major and, if he is continued in that army, a lieutenant-colonel. In our Army, what are they guaranteed?  They are guaranteed, as far as experience shows, that they remain at the one rank for 15 or 20 years.</P>
    <P>They are guaranteed, further, that, if they get promotion, there will be no increase in pay.  If the rates in our Army were as good as rates elsewhere do you think that we would have all the trouble about it?  Do you think we would have the executive notices? Do you think the leaders of the profession, if rates were as good here as elsewhere, would be warning young doctors and warning their parents not to touch service in the Irish Army without consulting with an official of their association?  The fact was mentioned here on a previous occasion, and I want to call the attention of the D·il to it, that one of the things we claim here with pride is that we are not just a little State, but that we are a motherland, and that we have our sons and daughters outside our shores all over this great world, and that our responsibility to sons abroad is equal <Col N="1919" /> to our responsibility to sons at home; and that when the profession think it necessary to safeguard parents and young doctors here at home from going under a service that has the brand of tyranny, from entering a cul-de-sac, with no future, that we have a similar obligation on us to warn those of our sons who are in exile.  That is the explanation for having published that notice abroad, and instead of apologising for it, one should refer to it with pride that we do not forget.  It is not &ldquo;out of sight out of mind.&rdquo;  We have as much care for the son or the brother that is gone abroad as for the son or the brother that remains at home.</P>
    <P>As far as the Minister attempted to make any case inside the Irish Army for the reduction in the rates of medical pay, his case was based on the difference between pre-existing medical pay and rank and the pay for other officers of the same rank.  That case was as misleading and as dishonestly put as the case that was put in the parallel with the British Army.  If the Minister will not learn from his own experience, cannot he learn from the experience of others?  Does he not know that inside the Army, of which he is the Minister now, originally medical officers and others were on the same rate of pay; that the highest grade of medical officer was major general and the lowest commandant; and that that meant that the commandant received pay of £1 per day, but they were paid exactly the same rates as regimental officers.  The lowest rank was commandant and the highest major-general and any doctor entering the Army could then have as his ambition that he would ultimately become a major-general. Then, it was decided that, in order to keep the line of command down along, it would be advisable to telescope the ranks in the medical service, to push everybody down three ranks, and so the major became a lieutenant, the major-general became a major and the colonel became a commandant, but the assurance and the guarantee given was that there would be no interference with the rates of pay for the individual.  Having telescoped everybody <Col N="1920" /> down three ranks, you arrived at a position at which the pay of the medical officer, as against the pay of another officer, was considerably higher.</P>
    <P>Did the Minister tell the D·il that? I want to drive it into the minds of every Deputy, irrespective of Party, to make up his mind whether he has got an honest case over there, or whether he has got a case where it is necessary to withhold the facts and to mislead the Deputies.  The Minister knows better than I do, if he is attending to his job, that the pay of medical people per rank was the same as other officers originally, and that then they were telescoped down, by arrangement, but without interfering with pay.  Did the Minister tell the House that if an officer joins the Army Medical Service, the highest rank he can ever obtain is that of major, and that the highest rate of pay he can ever obtain is as laid down here, something in the neighbourhood of £500 a year, and that if he is in any other service of the Army, if he is a regimental officer, he can aim at being a lieutenant-general with a salary of £1,200 a year?  In other words, far from the medical professional officers, the doctors, the dentists and the lawyers, getting rates of pay higher than others, the position is that the man who enters without any profession, without any diploma, without any qualifications for the job, the man who is going to be trained at the expense of the State, if he is an ambitious man, and if he is the best in his unit, can aim at ultimately reaching a rate of pay of £1,200 a year, while the highest rate which the man who comes in trained and qualified at his own expense, or at the expense of his parents, the man who obviously comes in more advanced in years, because he has gone through a lengthy university course, and the man who obviously must look forward to a much shorter service life, can reach is half the rate that can be reached by the untrained man.</P>
    <P>The Minister appealed to the sense of justice of Deputies on the ground that we cannot pay extravagant rates of pay; that we cannot pay people extravagant rates and have others paid low rates.  He did not tell the House that the man outside the medical service <Col N="1921" /> who comes to the top can reach a rate of pay in this Army twice the rate that can be reached by the highest doctor in the Army.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;misleading statements and reluctance to tell the truth because it does not suit the case.  The fact of the matter is, and we will leave aside comparative rates, old rates or new rates, that there is one admirable precedent in this and every other country, that, when a person enters State employment, there is an honourable obligation, an honourable contract, between the State and that individual, and that, even in times when <Col N="1922" /> ruthless economy is required, if it is necessary to cut, to lop, to chop, personal holders of office are exempt. They remain to serve on the conditions under which they joined and the rates are altered for the newcomer, for the man who joins under the new rate. So far as I know, for the first time in this State and by this Parliament, that honourable understanding, that honouring of a contract between the State and the individual, is trampled in the mud.  A new precedent is being established, the precedent that we are to put up the State as an example to all employers, and that example is that, any time it suits them, they will break any contract entered into, and we are to do that, and I repeat it, because of pique between an individual Minister and a group of people outside the Army.</P>
      <P>These officers, having given 15, 16 and 17 years' service, are to find themselves in the position that no matter what promotion they get, they can never increase their income.  The Minister talks about rates inside and rates outside.  Who would send a son for medicine, who would send a son for dentistry, who would send a son for law, if the position was that, if he got to the very top of his profession, the highest rate he could ever earn was something in the neighbourhood of 31/- a day, and that if he came to the very top, after, let us say, 20 or 25 years, the highest rate would be 34/6 a day? But yet the standard we are to establish here is that if a doctor joins the Army, if a dentist joins the Army, if a lawyer joins the Army, and if he pulls out from all his colleagues, if he secures the highest position in the Army, a position that in other armies would carry a salary of £3,000 or £4,000 a year, his pay will be at the generous rate of 34/6 a day.</P>
