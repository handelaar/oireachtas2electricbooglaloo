	<P>Yesterday, the House supported a motion in respect of the incident that occurred on the international seas when a vessel was boarded and lives were lost as a result of actions by the Israeli Government and commandos.  The international community has made a clear call for the ending of the blockade of Gaza, a call the Israeli Government continues to ignore.  In respect of the Irish citizens who are currently detained, what assurances has the Taoiseach sought and been given in respect of the timetable and schedule for their safe return and repatriation?  Is the Taoiseach able to give these details to the House?</P>
        <P>In respect of the <i>MV Rachel Corrie</i>, an Irish registered ship which is in international waters and heading for Gaza, what assurances has the Taoiseach sought and been given in respect of the vessel being allowed to enter Gazan waters and discharge its cargo of humanitarian aid, as has been the wish of the Government?  If the <i>MV Rachel Corrie</i> is prevented from entering Gazan waters, what action does the Government propose to take?  Has the Taoiseach been given a specific and clear assurance that there will be no repetition of the recent violent action which resulted in death?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish ambassador and deputy head of mission visited and spoke to each detainee yesterday.  Shane Dillon has returned to Ireland and there are six citizens remaining.  It has been widely stated that it is the intention of the Israeli Government to release all detainees some time today.  I urge the Israeli Government to immediately release the Irish and other detainees.  It is understood that arrangements will be made for their departure from the airport which is two hours from the prison.  The Spanish and European Union ambassadors are in Israel pressing for immediate confirmation that all detainees will be immediately released.  The Spanish ambassador is in Israel because Spain holds the rotating Presidency of the European Union.  The Irish ambassador is in contact with all of the families involved and will inform them the minute the release is official.</P>
        <P>Regarding the <i>MV Rachel Corrie</i>, this is an Irish owned vessel which is not registered in Ireland but in Cambodia.  There are Irish people on board and the ship, as Deputy Kenny noted, is heading towards Gaza and is still in international waters.  We are in constant contact with the Israeli Government on this matter, advising absolute restraint in relation to the vessel as it goes about its humanitarian purpose.  Cement, which is on board the vessel, is not regarded by the Israelis as a product that is simply humanitarian.  We await what emerges from the <Col N="330" />definition Israel has put forward.  We are in constant contact with the Israeli Government on this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for that clarification.  Strong words demand strong action.  Has the Taoiseach been given any assurances in respect of the fact that the <i>MV Rachel Corrie </i>may well be prevented from entering Gazan waters to discharge its cargo?  What action does the Government propose to take if that possibility becomes a reality?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The report into the use of Irish passports by those involved in a murder in Dubai earlier this year has been leaked to the media.  This has potentially serious consequences for relations between Ireland and Israel in view of the fact that the Israeli ambassador, Mr. Evrony, when contacted by the Government, stated he had no knowledge of these matters.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that the report leaked to the media states clearly that a security official in the Israeli Embassy was involved in this incident, particularly in regard to sourcing numbers for the illegal use of Irish passports, which have a high standing and reputation internationally?  Will he confirm that this information is contained in the report and that it recommends the expulsion of a security officer from the Israeli embassy?  Is it the intention of the Government to act swiftly in this matter?  Will the Taoiseach state what are the Government&rsquo;s intentions in this regard?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the second matter the Deputy raised, as my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, reported to the House, the Government will soon decide what action to take on the issue of the use of forged Irish passports in the assassination of Mr. al-Mabhouh in Dubai.  The Government is anxious that this important matter be given the attention and focus it merits and does not become mixed up with events off the coast of Gaza.  It remains the Minister&rsquo;s intention to shortly propose to the Government the action he believes appropriate in this case.  The Government is on record about the gravity with which it views the fraudulent use of Irish passports or passport details.  I do not wish to anticipate the proposal by the Minister to the Government or the Government&rsquo;s consideration of such a proposal.  I cannot comment on reports.</P>
        <P>On the other matter, the Israeli Government maintains its position regarding what it regards as humanitarian aid.  We are in constant contact with it and with those on board the <i>MV Rachel Corrie</i>.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Just two months ago on 30 March, the Minister for Finance came to the House to announce that the Government was providing &euro;8.3 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money to recapitalise Anglo Irish Bank.  That was in addition to the &euro;4 billion that had already been committed to that bank in 2009.  This week, just two months on, the Minister for Finance announced yet another &euro;2 billion of taxpayers&rsquo; money for Anglo Irish Bank, bringing to &euro;14.3 billion the total amount of taxpayers&rsquo; money that has now been committed to Anglo Irish Bank.</P>
        <P>On the day of the bank guarantee the Taoiseach came to the House and assured us that nothing of that kind was likely to happen.  I remind him that he said:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">With regard to the guarantee there have been what I regard as misleading indications as to the exposure being placed on the taxpayer. . .  The banking system in Ireland has assets which exceed its liabilities...  It is important to make the point that in the event of any further call, it is my intention to ensure the Irish taxpayer will not be held liable in any way for any deficit that might occur in the event of there being a problem in the future.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Does the Taoiseach now acknowledge that he was wrong when he said that and that there has, in fact, been a very substantial call on the Irish taxpayer for Anglo Irish Bank in particular?  I <Col N="331" />am just concentrating on that bank today.  What is the bottom of the pit as far as Anglo Irish Bank is concerned?  Taxpayers&rsquo; money has not been committed to the tune of &euro;14.3 billion.  How much more will be paid over or committed to this bank?  What is the bottom line?</P>
        <P>I ask the Taoiseach to clarify for the House a statement made by the Minister for Finance when he announced the &euro;2 billion this week, in which he stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Anglo&rsquo;s restructuring plan is being submitted to the European Commission today.  Discussions between the Commission, the Department and the Bank on the restructuring plan will continue and the future of the bank will be determined by those discussions.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">What is meant by the future of the bank in that context?  Will the Taoiseach tell the House if the Government is now considering an orderly wind-down of that bank?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding statements made on the first matter raised by the Deputy, clearly what has emerged since then, in terms of the governance issues that relate to the bank and obviously the subsequent establishment of NAMA and the subsequent writing down of assets to the tune of 55%, has meant that the capital requirements for that bank have greatly increased.  Regarding the &euro;2 billion, we would also make the point that the guarantee in itself had provided us with ability to fund the banking system and indeed banks have been paying for that guarantee, which was set out for a two-year period.</P>
        <P>The issue of the &euro;2 billion injection on 31 May is part of that additional capital required to ensure that the bank continues to meet its regulatory capital requirements in the context of the losses the bank experiences from the transfer of its loans into NAMA.  As indicated in the statement of the Minister for Finance to the D&aacute;il at the end of March, further capital, estimated to amount to up to &euro;10 billion, will be needed for Anglo Irish Bank to fully secure its capital position based on the information available to us at this point.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The &euro;2 billion capital injection is in line with what was expected might arise from the transfer of the first tranche of Anglo Irish Bank&rsquo;s loans into NAMA and was approved by the European Commission on that basis at the end of March.  Without this capital injection, Anglo Irish Bank would not meet its regulatory capital requirements and would need to be immediately wound down.  That would mean a fire sale of assets and capital losses of at least &euro;40 billion to the State.  In addition, in liquidation the State would have to provide of the order of &euro;70 billion of cash up front to meet the deposits, bond holders and liabilities due to the euro system.  Of course, a portion could eventually be mitigated by asset sales.</P>
        <P>The availability of the contingency provision was made clear in the Commission&rsquo;s press statement at the end of March providing state aid approval for the provision of additional capital support for Anglo Irish Bank.  The &euro;2 billion contingency provision, provided alongside the &euro;8.3 billion capital support for Anglo Irish Bank at the end of March is being activated following the NAMA transfers earlier this month.</P>
        <P>The discount on the loans transferred from Anglo Irish Bank into NAMA was 55%, which was in excess of the 38% discount the bank was applying to these loans on its books at the end of March.  The total amount of capital provided to Anglo Irish Bank to date is &euro;14.3 billion.  Some &euro;4 billion in capital was provided to Anglo Irish Bank in 2009, &euro;8.3 billion in March 2010 by way of a promissory note and &euro;2 billion further capital is now being provided to Anglo Irish Bank by way an addition to the promissory note.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>What is it doing with it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is taking place by way of an adjustment to the existing promissory note, which issued to the bank on 31 March 2010.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="332" />
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>Did Alan Dukes write that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It brings the total value of the promissory note to &euro;10.3 billion.  It is expected that additional capital will be provided to the bank in the course of the year by increasing the value of the promissory note.  The current estimate is that the overall capital requirement could be of the order of a further &euro;8 billion, that is the &euro;10 billion estimate less the &euro;2 billion provided on 31 May.  At this stage it is not possible to quantify the scale of the capital requirement for the bank which will depend on such factors as the final discount on the assets transferred to NAMA which depends on the loan-by-loan valuation process carried out by NAMA, the scale of the losses arising on the remainder of Anglo Irish Bank&rsquo;s loan book and any capital costs arising under restructuring of the bank.  EU state aid will of course be required as appropriate for any amount above that approved by the European Commission thus far.</P>
        <P>Regarding the question on the restructuring plan, this was submitted to the European Commission on 31 May.  A detailed evaluation of Anglo Irish Bank&rsquo;s restructuring plan will commence immediately and will involve extensive consultation and dialogue between the Commission, the Irish authorities and the bank.  The restructuring analyses a number of options, including winding up the institution over different time periods.  In each case these are very expensive options giving rise to major capital and funding costs to the taxpayer in line with the estimates set out by the Minister in his statement on banking on 30 March.</P>

	<P>The bank has proposed splitting the bank into two elements, an asset management company to run down some of its loan book&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>For the purpose of putting the facts on the record, while work remains to be done on the precise details of the restructuring plan and its implementation, it is seen to provide a superior outcome for the State and the taxpayer and in particular avoids significant additional losses and funding costs that would arise for the State under other scenarios.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>It is extraordinary that we seem to have two different types of language when we talk about taxpayers&rsquo; money.  When we talk about money needed for schools, special needs assistants, pensioners, those on social welfare and pay for employees of the State, <Col N="333" />the country is broke and there is no money for them.  When we come to talk about the money that is going into Anglo Irish Bank, we talk about billions as if it were Monopoly money and did not matter.  To cut to the chase with regard to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s response to my questions, is he now telling us that on the day he and the Minister for Finance came into the House and asked us to guarantee this bank, that bank was bust?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>It was bust.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Taoiseach saying about the bottom line?  He has said that &euro;14.3 billion has already gone into the bank and that it may need another &euro;8 billion.  Is he saying it might even need more than that, because there was uncertainty around what he said?  What exactly is the Taoiseach saying about the future of this bank now?  I heard him say that one of the options now being considered is a winding up of the bank over different timescales and scenarios.  When the Minister for Finance was talking to us here on 30 March said: &ldquo;Winding up the bank is not and was never a viable option.&rdquo;  Is it now a viable option, albeit in a timescale that must be determined with the Commission and discussed with the bank?</P>
        <P>People whose taxes and money are being poured into this bank and who are likely to be saddled with the cost of that for years to come need to hear with some degree of certainty what exactly is happening with this bank.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Where is Se&aacute;nie now?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>While the Taoiseach is explaining that, will he also explain how the Government ended up appointing three more insiders as non-executive directors of this bank, one of them a former finance director of AIB and another a former Fianna F&aacute;il Senator?  Lest the Taoiseach think I am making this as a political charge, I am using the term &ldquo;insider&rdquo;, which was used in one of the national newspapers commenting on the situation this week.  It described it as the Government&rsquo;s &ldquo;obsession with insiders&rdquo; and as the Government not having learned anything from the way in which corporate governance of the banks has been handled in years past.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is asking what was the situation with regard to this bank at the time of the provision of the guarantee.  The situation concerned the whole banking system and the Deputy&rsquo;s continued position that no guarantee should have been given on 29 September would have meant the collapse of the Irish banking system.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not my position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>The position was there should be no blanket guarantee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy opposed the imposition of the guarantee and voted against it.  The next position taken by the Deputy, which is shared by Fine Gael, as expressed by Deputy Reilly in an interview during the week, was that the Anglo Irish Bank should be wound down immediately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I said there should be an orderly wind down.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will get to that point in a minute.  The Deputy should not move his ground all the time.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="334" />
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I have not moved my ground.  I said there should be an orderly wind down.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>First, the Deputy said there should be no guarantee and he voted against it.  Without a guarantee, the whole banking system implodes and we no longer have an economy.  The Deputy&rsquo;s second position is that we should wind up the bank immediately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I never said that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have explained that would involve a fire sale of assets, &euro;40 billion losses and would also mean &euro;70 billion having to be found immediately to fund deposits, bond holders and those moneys that have come from the euro system.  That is the second option.  The third issue that is being dealt with here is one about which the Minister for Finance, the Department of Finance and the Government must deal with the EU Commission, because these are issues for which we must get its approval and confirmation.  First we needed its agreement that this, unfortunately, was a bank of systemic importance. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Fianna F&aacute;il said that.  Nobody else in their right mind would say that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what the EU Commission says.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach, without interruption, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s leader has asked the questions and I would like to provide the answers he seeks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>That is a Fianna F&aacute;il story.  The Taoiseach sounds like the Israeli Defence Minister now, defending the indefensible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the bank being of systemic importance, even if it was not, we should recall that Lehman Brothers, a much smaller bank in the US system than this bank is in the Irish system &mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Now the Taoiseach is talking total rubbish.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P><i>(Interruptions).</i></P>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will suspend the House if Deputies do not refrain from interrupting.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Why does the Taoiseach not answer the questions I asked him?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am answering the questions.  With regard to the restructuring plan the Deputy asked about, what is being put forward is the proposal by the bank to split the bank into two elements, an asset management company to run down some of its loan book and a bank which could continue to operate as a viable going concern.  Work remains to be done on that and there have been queries from the European Commission in that regard.  This work is continuing and the queries must be resolved for the agreement and approval of the European Commission.  That will determine how the bank will be wound down and dealt with.  The fundamental point is that we are seeking to minimise the exposure of the taxpayer, considerable as it is, to the greatest extent possible.  The proposals that have been put forward by the Opposition have consistently been far more expensive options than what we are trying to achieve.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>I attended the sixth European Union and Latin American Caribbean Summit in Madrid on 18 May.  This summit takes place every two years so that the two regions can discuss important and pressing global issues and strengthen their strategic relationship.  It brings together Heads of State and Government from 60 countries, representing over 700 million people with a combined trade close to &euro;100 billion annually.  I would like to congratulate Prime Minister Zapatero of Spain and President Fernandez Kirchner of Argentina for successfully co-chairing the summit.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Over the past decade the EU-LAC summits have developed an increasingly closer relationship on both sides of the Atlantic.  This progression was reflected in the overall theme of the 2010 summit:  &ldquo;Towards a new phase of the bi-regional association: innovation and technology for sustainable development and social inclusion&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In our discussions, we also focused on two of the biggest international issues of our time &mdash; the global financial crisis and climate change. During the discussion on the financial crisis, I intervened to stress the need for globally agreed action and re-affirmed Europe&rsquo;s commitment to protecting the euro.  I also took the opportunity to outline the steps we have been taking in Ireland to reform the banks, to correct our public finances and improve our competitiveness.  The Prime Minister of Haiti also addressed the summit on developments there after the tragic earthquake and how the Haitian people are rebuilding their lives with the help of the international community, including Ireland.  During the course of the summit there were many parallel meetings between the European Union and specific Latin American and Caribbean countries or regional groupings, including the Andean and Central Americas countries.</P>
        <P>As expected the European Commission also used the occasion to re-launch the EU-Mercosur trade negotiations.  While recognising the need to progress regional trade, Ireland along with other member states continues to have concerns about the prospects of a fair and balanced outcome to these negotiations.  The summit was also a good forum for advancing Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral relations and I met with a number of leaders from the Latin American and Caribbean countries, including President Fernandez Kirchner of Argentina and President Pi&ntilde;era of Chile.  These meetings were very constructive and it was particularly useful to get their perspective on key global issues and how we can develop closer bilateral and trade relations.</P><Col N="336" />
        <P>While in Madrid I also took the opportunity to meet formally with Spanish Prime Minister Zapatero.  We had a thorough and positive meeting covering a range of issues, including the financial crisis and preparation of the European Council in June.  We also discussed the excellent bilateral relations between our two countries and improving economic relations.</P>
        <P>I met with President Dalia Grybauskaite of Lithuania in Government Buildings on Monday, 10 May.  The President was making an official visit to Ireland.  At the meeting we discussed a wide range of issues, including the package of measures agreed in pursuit of stabilising the euro, the Europe 2020 strategy, our forthcoming Presidencies of the EU and the OSCE, EU external relations, bilateral relations between our countries and the sizeable Lithuanian community in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The agenda for the June European Council has not yet been formally finalised.</P>
      
        <P>I informed the House last week about the draft annotated agenda, which signals that discussions are expected to focus on the EU2020 strategy, the G20 Toronto summit, the UN millennium development goals and climate change.  I also expect that President Van Rompuy will brief us on the ongoing work of the task force dealing with budgetary discipline.</P>

	<P>As the Taoiseach will be aware, the reopening of trade negotiations with Mercosur has given rise to concerns with regard to the impact that imports of Brazilian beef could have on Ireland and other EU countries.  What concerns did he raise about the possibility of the opening of the EU market to Brazilian beef while the food quality and safety standards that apply in Brazil are below those which normally obtain in the Union?</P>
        <P>What response has been given by the European Union to the statement by the Prime Minister of Haiti on the recovery operation in that country?  I accept that an immediate response was made at the time of the disaster but will the Taoiseach indicate the follow-up actions that have been taken and the contribution of Ireland thereto?</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P Just="Left">Did the Taoiseach or any of the other Irish representatives who were present in Madrid raise with the Bolivian authorities the case of the man from Tipperary, Mr. Michael Dwyer, who was shot dead in controversial circumstances in Santa Cruz in April 2009?  Since that date, members of the Dwyer family have been trying to establish the circumstances of his death.  At the time of Mr. Dwyer&rsquo;s death, the Bolivian President said he had no objection to an independent international inquiry.  However, that offer appears to have been withdrawn.  Was the matter raised with Bolivian representatives on the margins of the meeting that took place?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We have serious reservations regarding the decision to re-engage in negotiations with the Mercosur countries &mdash; Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay.  While it is the European Commission&rsquo;s decision to relaunch the negotiations, we note that there are major differences between the expectations of both sides.  We are, therefore, doubtful that there is a sound basis for a positive engagement or outcome.  At the time of the suspension of the previous talks in 2004, Ireland had difficulties with the substance of the negotiations, particularly in regard to market access for beef.  I am also concerned that the relaunch could have a very negative impact on the Doha round and could leave the EU with little negotiating capital in that round.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, has been very active in respect of this matter and succeeded in having it fully discussed at the Agricultural Council meeting on 17 May.  Ireland, France, Austria, Finland, Greece, Hungary and Poland voiced their shared concerns regarding the potential impact of this matter on the EU agricultural sector, particularly the beef market.  We asked the Commission to provide a detailed analysis <Col N="337" />of the impact of the negotiations and to clarify the terms and conditions under which they are being relaunched.  Commissioner Ciolos has reassured member states that he is well aware of their concerns and will be vigilant in ensuring that EU agriculture will be properly protected.  The relaunch of the EU-Mercosur trade talks could jeopardise a successful outcome to the stalled WTO negotiations because it reduces the incentive for Mercosur to commit to the conclusion of the Doha development round.</P>
        <P>I do not have any detailed information regarding the statement by the President of Haiti or on the EU&rsquo;s follow-up actions regarding the disaster in that country.  However, I will pursue the matter and communicate further with the Deputy on it.  I recall that the Haitian delegation issued a message of thanks to the European Union on the work it is doing.  The delegation also provided a report on the progress that has been made.  As the Deputy is aware, the Haitian people still face a considerable challenge and there is a need for continuing and effective support for the rehabilitation of their country.  I will check what additional initiatives have been put in place to augment the EU&rsquo;s initial response and revert to the Deputy on the matter.</P>
        <P>I did not have an opportunity to raise with the Bolivian President the other matter to which Deputy Gilmore referred.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>If, as a result of the EU-Mercosur negotiations, Brazilian beef is traded into Europe, Ireland must insist that the regulations and traceability requirements that obtain in respect of Irish farmers and their European counterparts must also apply in respect of imports from Brazil.  This is a critical issue.  The Government and those of other EU member states must make that fact crystal clear.  In the past, delegations of Irish farmers and politicians visited Brazil and were able to demonstrate that what was being exported here was not, in certain circumstances, compatible with the regulations and traceability requirements with which Irish farmers must comply.  I am seeking an absolute assurance from the Taoiseach that compliance by Brazilian producers with the relevant regulations and requirements that apply in Europe will be insisted upon.  This matter is of particular importance to the agri-economy in this country.</P>
        <P>On Israel&rsquo;s blockade of Gaza, the UN Security Council has stated that there is a need for a prompt, impartial, credible and transparent investigation into the events of recent days.  Does the Taoiseach consider that the European Union would be a suitable and objective third party capable of carrying out such an investigation?  Has he contacted any of his European counterparts in respect of this matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, has been very prominent in setting out Ireland&rsquo;s position in respect of the relaunching of the Mercosur talks.  The Minister obtained a commitment from the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr. Dacian Ciolos, to the effect that he will be vigilant in the context of carefully monitoring the situation.  In addition, we want to obtain an impact analysis from the Commission in order that EU agriculture will be properly protected.  There are different expectations on both sides with regard to the negotiations and some doubt remains as to whether there is a sound basis for a positive engagement or outcome.  At the time of the suspension of the previous talks in 2004, Ireland had difficulties with the substance of the negotiations, particularly in regard to market access for beef.  We will continue to voice those concerns in the context of influencing the issues under discussion, which are of importance to us.</P>
        <P>On the Deputy&rsquo;s second question, the primary objective is to ensure that an international inquiry will take place.  We would prefer such an inquiry to take place under UN auspices.  We will consider the suitability of the persons or institutions which might be tasked with carrying out such an inquiry if approval for it to proceed is obtained.  We are of the view that it is <Col N="338" />imperative that the inquiry should proceed.  It must be a transparent and professionally-conducted inquiry in order that we can ensure that we get to the bottom of all aspects of this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for providing that clarification in respect of Mercosur.  He will have the full support of this side of the House in insisting that if agreement is reached in the Mercosur talks, the traceability requirements which apply to European producers will also apply to their Brazilian counterparts.</P>
        <P>Did the Taoiseach and his colleagues at the Council meeting discuss the necessity to return to the Lisbon Agenda, as distinct from the Lisbon treaty?  The Lisbon Agenda was established in order that the EU might compete with the United States in respect of job creation.  I note the Taoiseach&rsquo;s most recent 7,000-word tome reflecting on costs, competitiveness and credit.  Governments across Europe are now focusing on reducing their deficits.  That matter is critical to each of them.  It must be stressed that, parallel to this, there is a need to put in place programmes that will make member states, including Ireland, attractive in terms of national and international investment.  The latter will give rise to serious potential for job creation.</P>
        <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the Lisbon Agenda, which had the potential to allow Europe to compete with the United States, has not functioned in the way it should because of the lack of commitment of governments to funding that agenda?  Does he believe it still holds real value in terms of job creation across the Union, including our own country where job opportunities, for young people in particular, are so important for the future?  Can he confirm whether there was any discussion about this among the Heads of Government given that it is of equal importance in terms of the future economic growth of individual countries as distinct from the efforts currently going solely into deficit reduction?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The EU-Latin American and Caribbean Summit had its own agenda and the issue specifically of competitiveness of the European economy comes up in the context of Question No. 2 where the Deputy asked whether the agenda for the European Council meeting has yet been finalised.  As I said, the EU 2020 strategy is being brought forward for further discussion at the Council meeting.  The question of trying to make the European Union economy more competitive is a very challenging one for Europe because of its demographics, because of the competitiveness of other parts of the world with which we trade and because the international investment patterns are such that Europe is getting a decreasing amount of investment compared to the position in the past as a consequence of the rise of the BRIC countries, Brazil, Russia India and China.  The 2020 strategy is about seeing how we can improve security of energy supply and use the environmental sustainability arguments for new goods and services and products in the future.  It is very important that the research and development issue is dealt with effectively because research and development inputs into European industry have been much less than those, for example, in United States industry.  To regain competitiveness here requires a step change in approach.</P>
        <P>Regarding the idea of further fiscal stimulus, the European Central Bank has been adamant in this regard.  In the aftermath of the financial and economic crisis in 2008 there were countries which provided a domestic fiscal stimulus and which must now devise exit strategies for those stimuli.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I am referring to investment programmes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In many cases the fiscal stimuli that are being provided were in the productive sector, in the capital area.  The average capital investment in EU countries is some 2% to 2.5% of GNP, but in Ireland it is twice that.  Different countries are at different stages of development <Col N="339" />in terms of how their infrastructure matches their requirements.  We still have some way to go but have made a huge investment in that area which has made the economy more resilient and offered the prospect of us being more competitive as a result.</P>
        <P>In terms of monetary policy and macro-economic policy, there is a very strong, unanimous call for fiscal consolidation.  Deficits must be reduced.  If deficits are not reduced, interest rates rise.  If interest rates rise, there is less income for productive services and less possibility of creating jobs.  It is a question of having to consolidate and also a question of bringing forward policies and initiatives in a co-ordinated fashion more successfully than was the case under the Lisbon strategy in order to have the European economy invest in those areas of research and development that would enable us to identify and then obtain competitive advantage in the areas where the 2020 strategy sets out that Europe has the prospect of competing into the future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to go back to the replies the Taoiseach has given to Deputy Kenny and to me in regard to the Mercosur talks.  What I interpret from what the Taoiseach is saying is that the reopening of those talks may bring the possibility of Irish farmers being faced with unfair competition from imports of Brazilian beef.  The European Union has rightly put in place a regime of food safety, traceability and high standards in regard to beef.  I appreciate that the Taoiseach has referred to the work being done by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, but it is simply not acceptable that Irish farmers should be exposed to unfair competition from imports from a country where the same standards do not apply as in the European Union.  There is also the knock-on consequence for the wider beef industry.</P>
        <P>The motion that was passed in the House yesterday evening regarding the attack on the flotilla and the response of the Israeli Government included three provisions.  First, that there would be safe passage for the Irish owned vessel and for all of the vessels; second, that those who had been detained would be released; and, third, that there should be an independent international investigation into what happened on Monday morning, particularly the killings that took place on the Turkish ship.  I listened this morning on radio to a representative of the Israeli Government who seemed to be saying that Israel would fast-track some type of deportation process for those who had been detained.  He seemed to be saying there would not be safe passage or free passage for the Irish vessel.  He talked about the option being there for that vessel to go to a port in Israel or in Egypt and, by implication, seemed to be saying that if it did not take either of those options&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is straying from the subject material.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The representative absolutely rejected the idea of an independent international investigation into what happened on Monday morning.  It is important that this position is simply not accepted.  If it turns out that Israel persists in rejecting an independent international investigation into the events of last Monday morning, is it the Taoiseach&rsquo;s intention to pursue with other European Union leaders at the upcoming summit some effective response to that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to the Mercosur talks, Ireland led the food safety agenda on the last occasion when these discussions were taking place and we have continued to make the point that for European farmers to compete we must obtain a  level playing field.  Ireland has been to the fore in these matters.  It is not just about putting forward, as has been suggested, some type of protectionist measure; it is about the European model of agriculture providing the best possible guarantee to EU consumers as to the safety and healthiness of our food.  We <Col N="340" />saw last year with the pig scare the impact of sectoral events on consumer trends almost overnight if sufficient and corrective and remedial action is not taken to re-establish confidence in the sector so as to regain commercial outlets and be in a position to continue to sell into markets both domestic and international.  We have been very much of the view that health and safety issues are fundamental to ensuring EU consumers can be reassured that in a free trade situation, these types of matters are attended to adequately in the negotiations.  We will continue to make these points as we have in the past.</P>
        <P>The Deputy&rsquo;s second point is what happens in the event of our not getting an international inquiry.  The Security Council called for it yesterday.  The Israelis have in the past &mdash; I do not believe there was then or is now any basis for this &mdash; tried to suggest they will conduct an inquiry and that this will satisfy international opinion as to its objectivity and transparency, which is absurd.  That will not suffice.  What Israel must consider, as it has had to do in regard to its original ideas in regard to putting people into detention and engaging in a domestic deportation process, is its response to international pressure that this was not a runner because these people had been brought forcibly to Israel.  The idea that one needs to be deported from a country to which one has been forcibly brought is absurd.  We must maintain pressure on all aspects of the motion as passed here and by the Security Council of the United Nations.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On the basis that this incident took place in international waters, Israel&rsquo;s contention that its action was justified as it constituted an act of self defence must be rigorously and independently tested and examined.  I am confident, based on the facts as they are emerging, that this was a totally disproportionate act and was, in my opinion, an illegal act.  The defence which Israel seeks to suggest to legitimise what it did does not in my opinion hold water.  We must find a means by which this can be established and verified internationally so that international law is seen to be respected.</P>
        <P>I note what the Deputy has said in terms of the predictable initial response from the Israeli Government that it will not agree to an international inquiry.  We must maintain pressure on it to ensure its standing in the international community is in no way enhanced or maintained by the taking of that position.  It needs to consider carefully how, if that is to be the position it is to maintain into the future on this, this will play to its interests.  I do not accept that this should be regarded as its final position although I note that is what it has said.</P>
        <P Just="Left">International fora will have to consider its response in terms of what we regard as appropriate if the Israeli Government is not prepared to co-operate in any way with an international inquiry to ascertain the facts of these matters.  That is a matter for future discussion.  This does not suggest that there is no action that can be taken, rather it suggests we must first press to the fullest possible extent for the various aspects of the motion passed here, which reflects similar motions passed and presidential statements made in the UN Security Council.  We must not take Israel&rsquo;s first answer as being its final answer on this matter.  Further diplomatic pressure needs to be applied.  Arising out of this, what further action is deemed necessary, collectively working with others, is a matter for consideration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise to the Taoiseach for missing for first part of his response to these questions.  I was tied up in business elsewhere in the House.  </P>
        <P>Will the Taoiseach seek to put the episode of recent times and the need for an international inquiry on the agenda of the European Council meeting later this month to ensure the events of Monday morning and previous to it and since, are exposed internationally?  Will he also seek to put on the agenda the notion of an Irish-led EU flotilla of humanitarian aid for the people of Gaza?  I watched from the harbour in Dundalk the loading onto the ship of wheelchairs and many other items, some cement but mainly children&rsquo;s toys, books and education equipment. <Col N="341" /> Will the Taoiseach seek to ensure such a flotilla is organised at an official level within the EU to ensure Israel is not permitted to isolate the people of Gaza in the manner it has been doing?  Such action should not be left to a few individuals but should be dealt with at official level.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I outlined the agenda for the European Council meeting in my primary reply.  There have been occasions when issues that have arisen between the setting of the agenda and holding of the meeting have been discussed.  It is a matter for the President of the Council, Mr. Von Rompuy, to assess the position.  Also, the General Affairs Council of Foreign Ministers will be meeting on these matters on an ongoing basis and will reflect the views of their Governments.  EU Common Foreign and Security Policy requires the agreement of all for statements to appear.  There are unfortunately different nuances which appear from time to time among members states when this issue arises generally.  </P>
        <P>In regard to what has happened in this case, I find it hard to understand the reason any member state of the European Union would be in any way reticent about the type of motion passed here yesterday evening.  If we set international law as being that which should be respected &mdash; I believe that is a good basis on which to proceed in this case &mdash; then there are certain actions that need to be taken and be seen to be taken.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>I have one or two questions for the Taoiseach in regard to the Latin American meeting and the forthcoming June summit.  I met last week with a delegation from the Colombian trade union.  The delegation met immediately afterwards with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and was hosted by Mr. David Begg and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The delegation had a specific request which it wished the Taoiseach to put to the European Union summit meeting in June, namely, that Ireland would not sign up to a proposed trade agreement with Colombia on the basis that 27 Colombian trade union leaders had been in recent times slaughtered by death squads and the Colombian Government&rsquo;s intention to use that trade agreement to ensure its re-election in the upcoming elections towards the end of this year.  What position will Ireland be taking in regard to this request?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The 2020 document and the plans therein for the next ten years will be, as I understand it, the main thrust of discussion at the summit in terms of the decisions to be made with regard to the strategies.  There has been a strong request from NGOs and organisations dealing with poverty issues that Ireland support a fixed target of 25% reduction in overall poverty levels within the European Union during that ten year period, which would result in almost 20,000 people being removed from poverty or the risk of poverty and in strategies being agreed to ensure this.  Given our proud record in terms of combating poverty, dating back to our joining the European Union and which has informed all European Union decisions to date, will the Taoiseach take the initiative on this issue to ensure that target is agreed?</P>
        <P>I agree with Deputies Kenny, Gilmore and Morgan that we should be taking the initiative at the June meeting in regard to the piracy on the high seas by Israel.  This is almost the same as what has been happening on the Horn of Africa with Somalia.  There should not be less than an international investigation into this matter.  The incident happened in international waters.  The lives of Irish citizens have been put at risk.</P>
        <P>The European Union should have a plan to deal with this matter by the time the summit takes place.  If the Israelis continue with the approach as they have stated to date and have merely an internal Israeli investigation, the European Union must take the initiative and conduct an international investigation.</P>
        <P>Ireland agreed last week to support Israel&rsquo;s application for membership of the OECD.  The Taoiseach should seriously consider rescinding such support.  Effectively, our support means that we support Israel as an agreed colleague among the 13 members of the OECD when Israel <Col N="342" />has put itself outside the bounds of normal human rights and trading arrangements with regard to other counties in the international community.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the question of what poverty or reduction targets will be involved in the strategy, we welcome the promotion of greater social inclusion, including a target to measure progress in reducing poverty in Ireland and in a number of other member states.  I voiced certain concerns about the indicator proposed by the European Commission.  We have all agreed that further work needs to be done and this is happening at present.  We are working on that.  </P>
        <P>I do not have any details on what is the issue regarding the trade agreement with Colombia.  As the Deputy will be aware, the question of competence in this area for the conducting of the finalisation of trade agreements lies with the Commission in many of these matters.  I will ask the Department to revert to the Deputy as to what is the situation in that regard.</P>
        <P>On the question of international inquires and how that will be done, we have to concentrate on obtaining the release of citizens, the people who have been held, and to see if we can arrange for an international inquiry.  It is certainly what we are pressing for and what we want to see happen.  In terms of under what guise we would like this to happen, our preference remains that it would be under UN auspices but we have to wait and see what the formal response to the presidential statement of the Security Council by Israel will be.  The initial reaction seems to be predictable but it needs to be further considered and pressure needs to continue to be brought to bear on Israel that this is an issue that will affect its standing internationally should it take a certain course of action.</P>
        <P>On the question of Israel&rsquo;s accession to the OECD, it has always been Ireland&rsquo;s view that to try to influence issues and to be seen as a country that can in some way make a constructive contribution to the resolution of this problem, and to avoid issues of boycott etc., we would try to engage with people.  Obviously, they cannot act with impunity, they have to take the consequences for the actions which have emerged here.  They must take on those responsibilities.  What the relationship with Israel will be in the future, based on its response to this particular action, is something that will have to be discussed collectively and carefully and considered in fora such as the EU and the UN in the future.  We need to focus on what the short-term objective is in terms of free passage, safety of individuals and the establishment of an inquiry.  The wider impact that this will have on relations with Israel in the international area will have to be considered very carefully based on how it responds to these issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s statement in recent days that the blockade of Gaza was illegal in itself was very welcome.  Therefore, I presume all the actions that have been evaluated in the past three days are illegal acts in international waters in support of an illegal position.  The agreed motion between Government and Opposition yesterday had an important paragraph to the effect of conditionalities laid down such as an independent, international and transparent examination of events, safe passage and so on.  That should be followed up by further diplomatic initiatives.  It is important that the Taoiseach would agree that these initiatives be taken as quickly as possible to implement the spirit of the motion we agreed yesterday.</P>
        <P>On the matter of the diplomacy involved, when the United Nations Relief and Works Agency school was bombed in January 2009 the European Union split in that Holland, Germany, Italy and Romania refused to even issue any condemnation whereas a group of five countries, including Ireland, Greece and others, took a very strong position.  Does the Taoiseach envisage there being a significant shift in the European position in defining the Common Position and will that Common Position emphasise the importance of compliance with international law?</P><Col N="343" />
        <P>During the talks at the EU-Latin American and Caribbean meeting, the issue of trade arose.  The issue that arose in regard to Colombia was that the Commission suggested it would not delay even a single paragraph of the draft agreement but it was open to the Council, and representation on it, to put human rights conditionalities back into consideration for the text.  Therefore, there will be an opportunity at the meeting for those conditionalities to be recovered.  Does the Taoiseach support that?  That is a request that was made by the international trade union movement and by David Begg in the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the matter of the common foreign and security policy position on the Middle East, the Deputy, as a close observer of these matters, will be aware that regarding the position of the European Union, any movement in position towards what we would regard as our national position has been slow in the extreme.  This incident, if not properly responded to, very much weakens the view of those who suggest that not taking a more robust position&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;does not exactly increase influence.  There is a need for people to look rigorously at what is happening here and as a chain of events, as the Minister for Foreign Affairs has said, to indicate that a position has been taken here which seems to suggest that people can act with impunity or that one nation&rsquo;s or one government&rsquo;s particular definition of events is the one that should dictate international responses.  I do not think that is a position that stands up to rigorous scrutiny.</P>
        <P>On the question of the trade deal with Colombia, I will have the matter further inquired into and will come back to the Deputy in due course.</P>

Private Members&rsquo; business shall be No. 35, Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill 2010 &mdash; Second Stage (resumed), the proceedings of which, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m. tonight.</P>

	<P>There are no proposals to be put to the House.  I call Deputy Kenny.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="344" />
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I have a number of questions for the Taoiseach.  The Government has decided that the VHI should be sold.  This will require European approval in respect of recapitalisation and a community weighting system.  Is the Government engaged in preparatory work to connect with the Europe in this regard?</P>
        <P>During the course of his speech on the setting up of NAMA, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, said the Government would introduce legislation on banking resolution, legislation that would give the ability to wind down a bank.  What is the position on that?</P>
        <P>It is fair to say that over the years the Committee of Public Accounts has been recognised as being one of the foremost committees of the D&aacute;il.  It has always been commended for its non-partisan examination of Government expenditure in the interests of seeking efficiency and value for money.  The Chairman of the committee, Deputy Bernard Allen, has pointed out that under its current structure, the committee is strangled and powerless, unable to do the work it wants to do.  The Government has said, and it is indicated by the absence again of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, that the Comptroller and Auditor General would be enabled to carry out an audit in respect of activities at the Dublin Docklands Development Authority, to be followed by an examination by the Committee of Public Accounts.  The Chairman of the committee has pointed out that the committee has less authority than a citizen in respect of the Freedom of Information Act and the Data Protection Act.  In the light of the Chairman&rsquo;s comment and given the impartiality of the committee and its record over the years, I ask the Taoiseach whether the Government is giving any consideration to amending the Freedom of Information Act 1997-2003 and an exemption from the Data Protection Act 1988-2003?  In other words to give the Committee of Public Accounts the opportunity and capacity to do its work as the Oireachtas originally envisaged.</P>
        <P>According to the renewed programme for Government it is the intention of the Government to seek the approval of the Oireachtas to amend Article 41.2 of the Constitution, namely, to broaden the reference &ldquo;woman in the home&rdquo; to the important &ldquo;parent in the home&rdquo;.  Has any work been done on giving effect to that commitment in the programme for Government?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not aware that any work has been done in respect of the Committee of Public Accounts issue.  The question there is of enabling the Comptroller and Auditor General to conduct a report which report is then considered by the committee in the normal way.  It is an important committee and conducts its&mdash;&mdash; </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>There is a stranglehold.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>In fairness to Deputy Allen, I have never known him to be a person who has succumbed to strangulation in any of the activities in which he has been engaged in any committees of this House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The committee was caught before with F&Aacute;S.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>His ability to widen his shoulders and pull up his sleeves is well-known to everybody, even&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>It was caught on the issue of the redacted information.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not a matter I can deal with off the top of my head.  The matter the Deputy referred to was that the Comptroller and Auditor General would produce a report and the Committee for Public Accounts would consider it in the normal way.</P>
        <P>I apologise.  Deputy Kenny&rsquo;s first question related to a referendum on the issue of Article 41.  As he knows, the concentration at present has been on dealing with the report submitted <Col N="345" />in recent months by the all-party committee relating to children&rsquo;s rights.  I will let the Deputy know whether any work has been done on the commitment in the programme for Government.  These matters are usually taken very carefully and steadily.</P>
        <P>In regard to&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The banking resolution and the VHI.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Having made the Government decision and having announced it last week work will now proceed in engaging with the European Commission and within that Department and the Department of Finance, to get the necessary financial advice as to how to proceed with the various decisions that have been taken.  The Deputy can take it that this work can begin now, based on the Government&rsquo;s decision.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>What about the banking resolution?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Central Bank (No. 2) Bill is due before the end of this year.  The Minister has indicated that will deal with other matters over and above what has been dealt with in the Bill before the Oireachtas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to ask the Taoiseach about three matters.  I refer to a debate on the continuing banking crisis, in particular, the Taoiseach&rsquo;s confirmation that he anticipates a further &euro;8 billion going into Anglo Irish Bank.  Earlier this week I asked the Taoiseach whether the Government would provide, between now and the recess, time for a debate on the position regarding the banks, particularly those such as Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide which are such an enormous cost to the Irish taxpayer.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In regard to the banking reports by Messrs. Regling and Watson and by the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Honohan, which are now with the Government for two days,  will the Taoiseach clarify the timetable?  The net point is that the terms of reference of the scoping reports do not refer to this and exclude the period of, for example, the first capital injections into AIB and Bank of Ireland and the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank.  What is the timeframe?  Can the Taoiseach confirm when these reports will be released?  What good reason is there for not releasing these reports this week so that the Opposition parties, in particular, would have an opportunity to study them and the D&aacute;il could come up with terms of reference that would allow all the events involved in the banking crisis, including the vast sums of money going into Anglo Irish Bank, the night of the guarantee and its aftermath to be discussed?</P>
        <P>Can we have a specific debate on Anglo Irish Bank?  Will the Taoiseach elaborate on when, exactly, the banking reports will be published and whether there will be an opportunity to discuss the scope of the terms of reference of the banking inquiry?</P>
        <P>There are two other related matters about which I wish to ask the Taoiseach.  I am sure the Taoiseach and everybody else is aware that arising from the construction and property crash there are very many sub-contractors around the country who have been left bankrupt, in some cases as a consequence of not being paid for jobs they had completed.  These are mostly the small and medium sized people in the construction industry who, if they had not had this bust in regard to debts owed to them by bigger developers and contractors, would be able to pick themselves up and motor on and stay viable, albeit with some difficulty.</P>
        <P>A Private Members&rsquo; Bill has been presented to the Seanad that tries to make tight arrangements to ensure that subcontractors get some payment and are not left, as is happening at the moment,  holding the baby for the bigger developers who blew the house on the boom.  The entrepreneur Se&aacute;n Gallagher from &ldquo;Dragons&rsquo; Den&rdquo; is on the public record as saying that he <Col N="346" />has spoken with both the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Lenihan, about legislation to improve&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Please, we are frittering away.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;the position of subcontractors.  Does the Government propose to support the Private Members&rsquo; Bill before the Seanad or does it propose to introduce its own legislation?</P>
        <P>On a related matter concerning the property bust, the situation&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be very brief.  I refer to the situation in respect of people in management companies.  For many of those in management company situations or in estates that are only partially completed, a coterie of people who, because they cannot pay are not paying the management fees.  Management companies are in an extraordinary mess.  I raised this&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, you really must this bring this matter up directly with the line Minister, not with the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I have raised this on a number of occasions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>It is too much to expect on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I shall finish now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, I shall allow the Deputy to finish.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I would have finished in any case.  The problem is that by the end of this year there will be another dimension to the entire area of property problems in the economy that relate to the lack of legislation and the non-provision for management companies.In constituencies such as mine, there are tens of thousands of people in managed estates and&mdash;&mdash;  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, we cannot have this detailed submission on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;there is no legislation.  Will the Taoiseach say whether his Government proposes to deal with the problems of subcontractors and whether he proposes to legislate on this?  When will the management company legislation be concluded?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have a mini-Question Time now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The management company issue was finalised in the Seanad yesterday and can come back to the House in due course.  The Deputy may speak to the Whips about when that can be achieved, as it is an important issue for the House to consider.</P>
        <P>On the banking inquiry, the Minister for Finance will bring the reports that come to hand this week to Government next week for its consideration.  Following that the Minister proposes to lay both reports before the Houses of the Oireachtas and they can be circulated to all Deputies and Senators.</P><Col N="347" />
        <P>The Minister for Finance also proposes to invite the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service to consider the reports and I understand the committee intends to invite the authors of both reports to appear before it.  It should be emphasised that these are preliminary scoping reports intended to point the way to more detailed examination by a commission of investigation.  The Minister for Finance will prepare terms of reference and a draft Government order to establish a statutory commission of investigation and the draft order will be put to both Houses of the Oireachtas for a vote in due course.  The Minister previously indicated that the Government envisages that the commission of investigation will be established by the end of June 2010.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy mentioned, the legislation on subcontractors was debated in the Seanad and the Minister indicated at the time that he would incorporate some of the points made, come forward with legislation and work to get a full and comprehensive response to the question.  We are working on the matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the timeframe?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have a mini-Question Time on the Order of Business.  I have allowed the Deputy considerable latitude as she is the acting party leader this morning.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there a timeframe on the subcontractors legislation?  With regard to the debate on Anglo Irish Bank&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should submit a parliamentary question to the line Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;will the scoping inquiry include the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and matters up to that point?  The Regling and Watson report, along with the Honohan report, are merely scoping inquiries.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We need to move on as there is a list of people wishing to contribute.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>They are limited and do not go beyond the bank guarantee.  The inquiry will be of very little use if it does not go into all the events around the bank guarantee and its aftermath.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should bring this up with the line Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>It should include events up to the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank.  Is the Taoiseach proposing to keep the same timeframe in the inquiry?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are on the Order of Business, not Question Time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Will it be extended to include all events?</P>

	<P>I refer the Taoiseach to the speech he made in UCD on 20 May regarding a decade of commemorations.  Will the Taoiseach facilitate a debate in the House before the summer recess on the subject because there are serious issues to be addressed, particularly with regard to two national monuments?  These are the GPO, which is in public hands, and the Moore Street location, which is the subject of a major private development of approximately &euro;2 billion, where the principal investor is in talks with NAMA.  There is also the issue of the military archives.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is an important issue, as Deputy Bruton knows.  Legislation is being prepared and will be brought to the House in the next session.  We hope to have that legislation before the end of the year.  With regard to Deputy Costello&rsquo;s comments, I thank him for referring to the speech I made in UCD, which set out the idea of commemoration over the next decade.  Given the amount of legislation we have to discuss between now and the end of the session, we will not have the time for a full debate on the issue in plenary session.  It may be open to some committee to discuss the matter.  This is about ensuring we have as inclusive and comprehensive a set of commemorations as possible across the island.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>When will we see the White Paper which has been promised in respect of the new social levy and other tax measures planned by the Government?  In the context of the 2011 budget, will we have a similar assessment of options like those in the McCarthy report so the Oireachtas can have a genuine debate on alternatives?  Is the Taoiseach considering changing the format of the budget presentation so the Oireachtas can have more meaningful engagement in a year that will be particularly difficult but important?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="350" />
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The question of the work undertaken by the Minister regarding social contributions and how to look at the number of levies in place in order to pull together a more coherent system will be considered in the budgetary context.  The Deputy would perhaps be best advised to address a parliamentary question directly to the Minister for Finance on the mechanics of the preparation and what way he intends to deal with this.  It is a budgetary matter so I do not know the extent to which he can lay out the detail the Deputy might like sooner rather than later.</P>
        <P>On the budgetary preparations, the McCarthy report came forward last year with a set of options which continue to form the basis for Government consideration on an ongoing basis.  Some were taken in respect of the last budget and others will be considered in the context of continued rationalisation in the organisation of Government and the delivery of services.  There is also a review of the local authority system, which will inform budgetary consideration as well.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>As to the issue of a set of options being made available for consideration by various committees or, indeed, the House itself, these are matters that can be looked at for the purposes of having a debate that helps to facilitate a recognition of what exactly is the situation in this country.  Despite good progress being made and deficits being stabilised, we now have to pursue a reduction policy that involves further decisions being considered.  Once the choices are understood, perhaps the decisions can be better facilitated by Government in due course.  I know there is an issue the Deputy raised, but a direct discussion between himself and the Minister for Finance would be more opportune.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RichardBruton"><NameTxt>Deputy Richard Bruton</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a matter of the ordering of the business of the House.  It is a legitimate question to be answered on the floor.  The Minister has promised a White Paper or its equivalent on the social levy, so we should have an engagement in the Chamber as to how we organise business.  I will pursue the matter with the Minister, but I will also pursue it with the Taoiseach occasionally.  It is legitimate for him to order the way we deal with matters like the budget.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">This is a complicated situation where we effectively have a new Bill inserted into the middle of an existing Bill.  In this section, I have been asking the Minister to extend the new rules so that they refer to any ship travelling or berthed in Irish waters.

	<P>The proposed amendment would enable the Minister to make rules and regulations to prescribe the requirements for Irish nuclear carriers and the survey requirements that must be carried out in respect of those ships.  We have had this discussion before and I have already indicated that the Minister has no power to prescribe survey requirements, as proposed by the Deputy, in respect of all ships travelling or berthed in Irish waters.  Other ships must be surveyed and given certification in their own State.  Our surveyors of ships can board and inspect any of these ships when berthed in a port here to check for certification and compliance.  Ships that are not compliant may be detained until the matters are rectified.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 56:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In subsection (1)(<i>b</i>), to delete &ldquo;&euro;100,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;ten per cent of annual turnover&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Given that there might be nuclear carriage on some ships, very significant offences could be involved here.  Would the Minister be interested in going for 10% of turnover with the company in section 41?  I would like him to up the fines on indictment to 10% of turnover as a major deterrent to companies.</P>
        <P>Since we were last debating this Bill, we have seen the BP disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, which has turned into a national calamity for the US and for President Obama.  We saw the value of the BP company collapse on stock markets yesterday, because people are estimating the fines and compensation that it will have to pay.  The situation in the Gulf of Mexico is turning out to be the biggest environmental disaster at sea.  This disaster reiterates how important it is for us to cover every conceivable angle in respect of major vessels bringing dangerous cargoes through our waters.  There should be very significant consequences for the oil industry and related energy industries if they get it wrong, as BP clearly did.</P>
        <P>Everybody hopes that something like this will never happen in Irish waters, but we have to be aware of it, hence this Bill.  Perhaps the Minister should take fairly draconian powers to ensure that vessels and companies operating in our waters will comply with our environmental standards and with this Bill.  I urge the Minister to go for the greater penalty of 10% of turnover.  People might say that even that is very little.  I noticed that President Obama and his agencies have begun criminal investigations into the behaviour of BP in the gulf, and its impact on the southern states of the United States.  Will the Minister re-examine this for a final time and include strong measures in the legislation?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>We discussed this on a number of occasions and I indicated previously to the Deputy that this is not the type of amendment I would like to make on the hoof to a Bill such as this.  I gave a commitment to the Deputy and I will reiterate it here that we need to do further policy analysis on this and decide, if we go down this particular route, how we might make the type of decisions he is discussing on income and turnover without placing the courts in a position where they are trying to figure it out.  I indicated to the Deputy that between now and when the consolidation of merchant shipping legislation is undertaken I will have considered it to see if it is a route we can take.</P>
        <P>I take the Deputy&rsquo;s point on the pollution occurring in the Gulf of Mexico, which is not ship borne but due to drilling operations.  In similar circumstances here the EPA would have power to levy huge fines and rightly so.  I call on the Deputy to withdraw the amendment on the basis that I will consider it for inclusion in the consolidation of the merchant shipping legislation.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="360" />
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s comments.  We are trying to create a deterrent of which people would be aware whereby very stern measures would be taken if a company engaged in practices which led to an environmental disaster in our waters.  My amendment would change the wording to provide for up to 10% of turnover so it is not as precise as the Minister suggests.  It would give the courts discretion.  I look forward to the forthcoming consolidating legislation.  The Minister told us this morning about other legislation in the marine area.  On that basis, I withdraw my amendment to the amendment.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">These amendments deal with a new Chapter 4 on high-speed craft.  Amendment No. 57 inserts Chapter 4 to provide for the regulation under the Saving of Life at Sea, SOLAS, Convention of certain high-speed craft.  The purpose of this chapter is to set out the separate standards and regulatory measures that are appropriate for high-speed craft.  Ireland has no applicable high-speed craft on its flag at present.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 57 provides for section 42 to set definitions for terms used in Chapter 4.  Amendment No. 58 provides section 43 to set out the application of Chapter 4.  Amendment No. 59 provides section 44, which is a key enabling provision to allow the Minister for Transport to make high-speed craft rules.  Amendment No. 60 provides section 45 for the certification and endorsement of continued compliance with standards for operation of high-speed craft.  Provision is also made for the issue of permits to operate as a safety and regulatory control for safe operation to carry passengers and cargo.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 61 provides section 46 to impose duties on owners and masters to have high-speed craft comply with statutory requirements.  Amendment No. 62 provides section 47 for continued compliance with standards and prohibits unauthorised changes to the structures and equipment of high-speed craft.  Amendment No. 63 provides section 48 to confer enforcement powers for surveyors of ships to check for compliance with this chapter, the high-speed craft rules on permits to operate through inspection of vessels and the issue of notices of non-compliance.  Amendment No. 64 provides section 49 to set out the maximum monetary fines that the master or owner of a high-speed craft vessel is liable for if convicted in court of breach of the provisions of this chapter.</P>

	<P>The Minister can address them now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy proposes to amend amendment No. 59 so that the flag under which a vessel is registered be inserted as one of the matters that regard be had to when categorising high-speed craft into classes for the purposes of making regulations and rules under section 18.  We already discussed this and I indicated that I will not make a distinction on the basis of the flag of the vessel.  The same requirement will apply to all vessels to which <Col N="362" />the relevant section applies.  His amendment would have the opposite effect to the one he wants it to have.  It could restrict us whereas as it is all of the rules apply to all craft.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 60 will enable the Minister to make rules and regulations to prescribe requirements for Irish high-speed craft and the survey requirements that must be carried out in respect of those ships.  I already indicated that the Minister has no power to prescribe survey requirements as proposed by the Deputy in respect of all ships travelling or berthed in Irish waters.  Other ships have to be surveyed and given certification in their own state and our surveyors of ships can board and inspect any of these ships when berthed in a port here to check for certification and compliance.  Ships that are not compliant can be detained so the provisions of the amendment tabled by the Deputy are already covered by the section.</P>
        <P>We have just discussed amendment No. 64 and for the reasons outlined I do not intend to accept the amendments to it that have been tabled except in the sense of considering them for consolidated merchant shipping legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>We have discussed the flag issue on other sections and I propose to insert it again.  The Minister is making a strong case with regard to it.  Past experience has not vindicated what the Minister stated on the extent to which we could monitor or invigilate all ships travelling on Irish waters.  There is responsibility for the flag state and those ships which joined our register in recent years, and we are in a position to invigilate them.  However, there is still a problem with ships travelling through our waters.  I know we are discussing high-speed craft.</P>
        <P>On Committee Stage we discussed accessibility.  It is a separate issue but I wonder whether the Minister has done anything on it.  I may have included it in Committee Stage amendments.  Was the matter of accessibility in catamarans which may be used for ferry travel addressed in the changes made by the Minister?</P>
        <P>I have already discussed this point and do so for the last time today.  I do not think the Minister takes the flag issue seriously enough.  The Acting Chairman is a former distinguished chairman of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and is aware of some of the issues raised and brought to our attention during the 29th D&aacute;il.  It is still unsatisfactory and an area in which we need legislation.  We should move on this and not let the good name of Ireland ever be sullied through ships adopting flags of convenience simply to get rid of their workforce and put them on wages below the minimum wage with very bad working conditions.  Again, I am not quite happy with the Minister in this regard.  I would like to hear him again on it.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel O&rsquo;Flynn</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>I want him to speak again on the flag and disability aspect.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>We recently published, for the first time ever, guidelines for accessible maritime passenger transport.  Those rules and guidelines apply now.  They were issued under the Disability Act to provide practical advice and information for those involved in the provision of maritime passenger transport services and cover all aspects of maritime passenger journeys.  For example, they provide advice on providing accessibility information for the planning of a journey, improvements to shore side facilities in ports, harbours and piers, improving access on board vessels, disability awareness training for staff, emergency planning and improving customer relations for mobility impaired passengers.  </P><Col N="363" />
        <P>We did that because we obviously support and encourage the continued improvements, as does the Deputy, in accessible maritime passenger transport services because it gives people with disabilities the chance to avail of those facilities.  From the point of view of accessibility they have been catered for, not just in this section.  An earlier section, the number of which I cannot recall, deals with accessibility.  We have the guidelines in place.  That point is addressed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The point I am making about the flag ship is that it would be impossible for Ireland to have to clear every vessel which comes into our waters.  It is a flag state responsibility, except when they dock in Ireland.  We the have the power to board and detain, which is sufficient for the concerns which the Deputy has.</P><P Just="Left">Amendment agreed to.</P>

        <P LI="3" el="5" FLI="0">&ldquo;accepted minimum safe manning document&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it by <i>section 60(4)**</i>; &ldquo;approved ship&rsquo;s security plan&rdquo; means the security plan for the ship approved by the Minister under Regulation (EC) No. 725/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on enhancing ship and port security2; &ldquo;IMO number&rdquo; means the identification number which conforms to the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) ship identification number scheme adopted by the IMO under regulation 3.2 of chapter XI-I of the Safety Convention; &ldquo;IMO principles of safe manning&rdquo; means the principles of safe manning adopted on 25 November 1999 by Resolution A.890(21) of the Conference of Contracting Governments to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea 1974, as amended by Resolution A.955(23) adopted by such Conference on 5 December 2003; &ldquo;minimum safe manning document&rdquo; means, in relation to a ship to which this Chapter applies, a document issued by or on behalf of the Minister under <i>section 60 (1)**</i>; &ldquo;passenger ship&rdquo; has the meaning assigned to it in section 2(1) of the Act of 1992; &ldquo;safe manning regulations&rdquo; means regulations made under <i>section 59***</i>.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The purpose of this amendment is to insert Chapter 6 to put enabling provisions in place for the regulation of safe manning on solace ships.  Amendment No. 72 provides section 57 to give definitions of the terms used in Chapter 6.  Amendment No. 73 provides section 58 to set out the application of Chapter 6.  Amendment No. 74 provides section 59, which is a key enabling provision to allow the Minister for Transport to make safe manning regulations to prescribe <Col N="377" />requirements for the appropriate minimum safe manning of solace ships.  There is separate legislation under domestic and European Community law to regulate the safe manning and safety management of other vessels.</P>
        <P>I understand amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 74 in respect of section 59, which was tabled by Deputy Broughan, was ruled out of order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister can discuss it anyway.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>If it was ruled out of order I had better not.  We can return to the amendments to the amendments.  I will continue to speak to my amendments.  Amendment No. 75 provides section 60 to prescribe a procedure for the submission of proposals to the Minister for transport by the owner of an Irish ship on international voyages for safe manning and the issue of safe manning documents.  No unauthorised change can be made in the minimum safe manning of the ship.  A ship is prohibited from going to sea without having a minimum safe manning document in force.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 76 provides section 61 to impose duties on owners and masters of ships, to which this Chapter applies, to comply with safe manning requirements.  Amendment No. 77 provides 62 which provides enforcement powers for surveyors of ships to check for compliance with this Chapter through the inspection and issue of notices of non-compliance.  Amendment No. 78 provides section 63 to set out the maximum monetary fines that the master or owner of a ship are liable for if convicted in court of the breach of minimum safe manning requirements.</P>
        <P>The two amendments to amendment No. 78 address the 10% annual turnover.  We have had a full discussion on those and have reached an agreement as to how we will approach that in the future.</P>

	<P>I am advised that one of Deputy Broughan&rsquo;s amendments to the amendment is out of order as it is outside the scope of the Bill.  It could relate to labour laws, entitlements and workers&rsquo; terms and conditions, and these factors are not comprehended within this Bill.  The Deputy can speak on the second amendment to the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>The second amendment to the amendment refers to a ship berthed in Irish waters.  Can I speak to the third amendment to the amendment?  It refers to salaries and fiscal entitlements of mariners.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelOFlynn"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel O&rsquo;Flynn</NameTxt>
	<P>The third amendment to the amendment is out of order as it is also outside the scope of the Bill.  The Deputy can discuss amendments Nos. 2 and 4 to amendment No. 73.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan"><NameTxt>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 2 to amendment No. 73 has been discussed a number of times.  The Minister has referred to it; it concerns other ships in Irish waters.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 4 deals with double hulls, an issue which arose in the context of previous maritime legislation.  The amendment would require double hulls in chemical and oil tankers.  In light of the ongoing disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, this should be set out in legislation as a mandatory requirement.</P>
        <P>The issues of safe manning levels and the regulations that the Minister will introduce are closely related to wages and conditions for mariners.  Unsafe manning levels in commercial fleets often result from decisions to save money on wages.  The minimal rights granted to workers are also related.  The Bill refers to the international convention on the rights of mariners.  This House and the Minister need to support the campaign being pursued by the Inter<Col N="378" />national Transport Federation and SIPTU, as well as my colleague, Ken Fleming.  This particularly important given that we are an island nation and 99% of our goods are transported by sea.  We do not want the ignominy of having these goods transported by what is in effect slave labour.  There is no reason this issue cannot be addressed in the Bill.</P>

Amendment No. 79 inserts new section 64, which specifies that the deterrent and enforcement measures to detain an unsafe ship apply in respect of the proposed SOLAS and safety regulations in the aforementioned Chapters 1 to 6, inclusive.  The power to detain an unsafe ship in other circumstances is provided for in existing merchant shipping legislation and this amendment ensures the corresponding provision is put in place in respect of the new measures.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 80 inserts new section 65 to provide that a ship or boat may be detained by a surveyor of ships in a port in this State on the grounds of being regarded as an unsafe vessel until the relevant certificate or permit is issued.  This power to detain gives teeth to the enforcement of the mandatory certification permits and documentation processes that have been put in place to ensure safe operations.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Minister has addressed the substance of my amendment, which attempts to create a formula that allows as much accessibility as possible.  Perhaps the Bill as it stands addresses the issue, however.  Much depends on the regulations that the Minister introduces because certain vessels present bigger challenges than others for people with reduced mobility.  We have to enable people with disabilities to fully enjoy ships and boats.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy quite rightly raised this issue on Committee Stage on 4 March and we have since published guidelines on my Department&rsquo;s website and in hard copy.  From my recollection of our previous discussion, the guidelines will meet the concerns raised.  A range of improvements which can be made to existing vessels to increase their accessibility in regard to signage, lighting, handrails and tactile surfaces are set out in the guidelines.</P>
        <P>Unlike other modes of transport, however, vessels have long life spans of 30 years and more.  The existing stock of vessels includes a large number of older ships and the scope for alterations is therefore limited.</P><Col N="386" />
        <P Just="Left">While I recognise what the Deputy is attempting, the form of words used in the amendment may have a contrary effect.  An argument could be made that the words &ldquo;as fully accessible as practicable&rdquo; may be restrictive.  I ask the Deputy to accept the section as it stands on the basis that it is the most all-encompassing version.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The provisions of the reduced mobility regulations will apply nationally, having regard to the specifics of the classes of vessels.

        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 25, to delete lines 42 and 43 and in page 26, to delete lines 1 to 3.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">The purpose of the amendment is to remove subsection (12) which provides that the Minister &ldquo;may exempt from all or any of the provisions of reduced mobility regulations, on such terms and conditions as he or she sees fit, any passenger vessel or any class or classes of passenger vessel, having regard to the nature of the vessel and the use to which it is put.&rdquo;  This is a wide-ranging power which appears to remove the safeguards being inserted for citizens with reduced mobility.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I realise that a literal interpretation of the subsection could give the impression that the Minister may ignore the system of improved accessibility and safety being introduced elsewhere in the legislation.  This is not the intent of the subsection, which is necessary because it may be desirable in the case of certain vessels to provide an exemption from reduced mobility regulations.  While it is intended that practically all vessels will comply with the higher safety standards, it may be necessary to exempt particular vessels from some or all of the provisions.  The subsection is useful for existing vessels with limited capacity for major physical alterations.  The vessels in question are most likely to be vintage or heritage type vessels on which alterations would not be feasible for reasons of space or heritage.

	<P>I move amendment No. 86:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 26, line 13, after &ldquo;representations&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5" FLI="0">&ldquo;and after the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The amendment reflects the view that Oireachtas approval should be secured in the case of much secondary legislation.  Given the importance of reduced mobility regulations, it is proposed that such regulations be placed before the Houses for approval.  Amendment No. 87 makes a similar provision.  The amendments are in accordance with provisions in similar legislation introduced in recent years which required that secondary legislation be laid before the Houses.  Given the critical importance of disability regulations, all such secondary legislation should be placed before the Oireachtas.  To reflect the key role of the committees in this regard, it is proposed that the Committee on Transport be the relevant committee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The amendment proposes that the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas be obtained after representations have been received under the consultation process on reduced mobility regulations and before the regulations are made.  It is not normal practice to have to obtain approval prior to the making of regulations and I do not propose to introduce such a requirement in this legislation.</P>
        <P>Section 17(13) already imposes a requirement for the mandatory publication of a draft of any proposed reduced mobility regulations to afford any person, including an Oireachtas committee, an opportunity to make written representations on the draft regulations.  The provisions for prior consultation are adequate and Members have an opportunity to engage in the consultation process.  It would be perfectly in order for the Committee on Transport to discuss the regulations and make suggestions on them once they are published.</P>
        <P>On amendment No. 87, section 18(1) on codes of practice for reduced mobility provides that the Minister may prepare and publish codes of practice or approved codes of practice following consultations as he or she considers relevant.  While I anticipate that the Committee on Transport will seek to be involved in this process, this does not need to be expressly stated.  Under section 18(1), the Minister may engage in consultations with such persons as he or she considers relevant.  Clearly Ministers will not disagree with the notion that the Committee on Transport is a relevant body for this purpose.</P>
        <P>I am providing, in amendment No. 88, that a committee of one or both Houses of the Oireachtas be consulted on the draft code of practice prior to its publication.  This step has been taken following our previous discussion of this matter.  It is open to the Houses and the Committee on Transport to engage fully in the consultation process before regulations are finalised.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">The amendment arose as a result of the Committee Stage debate on this matter during which I undertook to examine section 18.  The amendment provides that a draft code for reduced mobility be forwarded to the clerk of the committee of one or both Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; to all intents and purposes the Committee on Transport &mdash; for the purposes of the consultation process.  This provision is being made in direct response to the case made by Deputy Broughan for having the Committee on Transport involved in this matter.  I hope it meets his requirements and on that basis, I ask him to withdraw amendments Nos. 89 and 90.</P>

      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>We sometimes feel that we do not get important information on issues we need to discuss or are discussing.  Issues seem to arise at 6 p.m. on a Friday.  We have been through that before, as the Acting Chairman will remember, with other issues in the maritime area.  We tend to hear at 6 p.m. on a Friday of some major change or that major documents have been received.  The Oireachtas often seems to be the last body to get a look at that.  In some of the controversies we have discussed at the Joint Committee on Transport there was a strong feeling among members that important documentation could have been brought to our attention at an earlier time when the Minister had reports in the area of aviation and other areas that would have been the entitlement of the Joint Committee on Transport.  I welcome that the Minister has moved in that regard in this area of disability and accessibility.  However, we need to address the wider problem.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">This amendment would change the wording to &ldquo;ensuring the safety of vessels or their crews or for environmental protection&rdquo;.  This relates to powers regarding the raising of sunken vessels.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 92 proposes to insert &ldquo;salvaging a vessel of special cultural and historic importance&rdquo;.  I was thinking, obviously, about the <i>Asgard</i> in that regard.  The amendment would give the Minister powers in that area.  The former Minister for Defence was addressing that issue and many people were disappointed that he decided not to salvage the vessel given the insurance situation etc.  My amendment seeks to protect our maritime heritage by giving the Minister powers regarding a vessel of special cultural and historic importance, of which, thankfully, we have several.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>As we have strayed into amendment No. 92 as well as 91, I will deal with both of them with your permission, a Chathaoirligh.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 91 seeks to include environmental protection as a ground on which the Minister for Transport might cause a sunken vessel to be raised under Part 4 of the Bill.  It is not necessary because it is already catered for.  Legislation exists for that purpose.  The Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wreck) Act 1993 brought the International Convention on Salvage 1989 into national law.  The focus of that Act is on marine environmental protection and pro<Col N="389" />vides that wrecks that are sunken or partially sunken in harbours or near coasts of the State can be required to be removed at the expense of the owner for marine environmental protection.  I believe it has been invoked on one or two occasions.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Transport may also take measures under that 1993 Act and the Sea Pollution Act 1991 to protect the coastline from pollution or the threat of pollution following a maritime casualty &mdash; that term includes a sunken or partially sunken vessel &mdash; and to give direction regarding salvage operations.  The Deputy&rsquo;s good intent in that matter is already covered in legislation and it would not be wise to have two different sets of legislation covering the same matter because it could give people an escape hatch.</P>
        <P>With the indulgence of the Chair I will deal with amendment No. 92, which proposes to insert &ldquo;salvaging a vessel of special cultural and historic importance&rdquo;.  That matter is and can be covered in legislation under national monuments or preservation of heritage legislation.  It is not necessary to include it here and on that basis I ask the Deputy to withdraw those two amendments.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">Section 33(6)(<i>b</i>)(iii) states &ldquo;the protection of vehicle decks on the ship&rdquo;.  To make the provision more complete the section should also address the management and operation of vehicle decks on the ship.  In other words all aspects of the management and operation of a ferry would be within these requirements.  Although thankfully not in recent times, there have been a number of ferry disasters in Europe in the past.  The Minister&rsquo;s powers should extend to all aspects of the ongoing management of a vehicle deck.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Section 33 of the Bill provides for fire protection rules and the provision in section 33(6)(<i>b</i>)(iii) relates to the protection from fire of vehicles on vehicle decks of ships.  That would entail, for example, the provision of fire prevention and fire fighting measures.  The Deputy wants the management and operation of vehicle decks to become a criterion for which fire protection rules may provide.  However, operational functions of this nature are governed by safety management codes.  My advice is that it is not necessary to include these functions in the subsection that deals specifically with the fire protection of vehicle decks.  On that basis, I ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 97:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 39, lines 2 and 3, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;, or&rdquo; in line 2 down to and including &ldquo;kept,&rdquo; in line 3.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Section 34(1) contains the phrase &ldquo;or if there is no official log-book, cause other record to be kept&rdquo;, which is an extraordinary cop out or opt out for operators.  Clearly in every case there should be a logbook.  We discussed all this regarding modern technology, video, cameras and so forth.  I wanted to get the Minister to extend it as widely as possible.  It could be envisaged that companies could have ongoing contacts with their operations.  Even in the recent disaster <Col N="390" />in the Gulf of Mexico, it was noticeable that the company, BP, seemed to be very anxious to try to control video and other reports from the undersea location of the disaster.  We should incorporate modern technology into this in the era of iPhones, iPads, video links, video conferencing and so on.</P>
        <P>Maritime legislation seems to be more 19th century legislation than 21st century legislation.  Why, therefore, does the Minister not just make the deletion?  There should be an official log.  That should be a requirement</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision in section 34 provides that if there is not an official log, a record must be kept of every boat and fire drill and of the checks made on life-saving appliances.  That is a mandatory provision.  Therefore, a record must be kept, whether it is in a log-book, a written record or recorded on computer.  This is the case, even when there is no official log book.  The Deputy&rsquo;s point is that the log book should be mandatory, but that is arguable.  Irrespective of whether it is mandatory, a record must be kept of every boat and fire drill.  That is the effect of section 34 and it covers the point made by the Deputy.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">I would like to hear the Minister&rsquo;s response on this amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s amendment reflects the blood, breath and urine threshold levels for alcohol concentrations that are being proposed for motorists under the new Road Traffic Bill.  As I indicated on Committee Stage, policy on the control of drug and alcohol use in respect of seafarers is being developed in the forum of the International Maritime Organisation, IMO.  It has undertaken a comprehensive review of safety training and certification for watchkeepers, the Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping, STCW, convention and code.  As part of the review, at the 40th session of the group, Germany presented a proposal which relates to the prevention of drug and alcohol abuse.  That proposal recommends the following: the implementation of a mandatory alcohol limit on board seagoing ships of 0.05% blood alcohol level; the prohibition to consume alcohol within four hours prior to serving as a member of the watch or being on call; and provision for adequate random tests on board ships, under the responsibility of the master, by means of devices for estimating blood alcohol content from a breath sample.</P>
        <P>Ireland supported the proposal at the STCW 40th session and expects it may be endorsed at the diplomatic conference in Manila in June 2010.  If endorsed, it will be brought before the next meeting of the IMO assembly.  After Committee Stage, I considered whether an enabling provision could be included in the Bill to follow through on whatever policy will emerge from the deliberations taking place in the IMO.  The drafting of a provision was discussed with the Parliamentary Counsel and my Department was advised that a general, open enabling measure as proposed could have <i>vires</i> problems if sufficient policies and principles were not being provided in the enabling primary legislative measure.  It would not be appropriate to try to anticipate and second guess principles and policies emerging from the type of provision that would be pursued by the IMO.  The prudent course of action is to follow closely and await the details of the policy that emerges from the IMO and to legislate accordingly as a follow-up to agreed international practice.  Currently, in the Maritime Safety Act 2005, a range of offences are provided for master or crew of an Irish ship who operate vessels in Irish waters or operate an Irish ship in waters anywhere if impaired by being under the influence of alcohol or drugs or a combination of these intoxicating substances.</P>
        <P>We have considered this issue.  Work is progressing at the IMO and we support that work.  The legal advice is that unless we had significantly more work done with regard to the principles and policies before putting this section into the Bill, we could have difficulties with it in the future.  Rather than delay the Bill, we have decided to go ahead with it as it is.  However, as soon as the IMO convention is finalised, we will bring the necessary legislation before the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept the Minister&rsquo;s bona fides with regard to the abuse of drugs and alcohol and as far as I am concerned, that is not at issue.  However, this proposal is a recommendation of the Marine Casualty Investigation Board in one of its recent reports.  With respect, I do not accept the points made by the Minister.  There is no reason he cannot incorporate the same basic regime as will be incorporated tomorrow with regard to road safety.  Members on all sides of the House are agreed on the charter to which we will sign up in that regard.</P>
        <P>I am trying to get to the nub of the Minister&rsquo;s point.  He is suggesting that what is being done internationally must become part of the international system before he will be happy to include it in his legislation.  What we are saying is that the limits that apply in the road traffic legislation should apply on all of our mercantile ships.  Can the Minister clarify why those provisions should not be included now?  The Minister&rsquo;s argument relates to policies and primary legislation.  It is clear where the Minister stands on the issue and I have no doubt of his stance.  However, the proposal is a recommendation of the investigation unit that examines these issues.  This is <Col N="392" />clearly an issue with regard to people in charge of ships or on watch who may have taken alcohol and be unfit to do the job they are doing and who put themselves and others at risk as a result.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand this is a matter of concern for the Deputy and I share his impatience.  However, it is not a case of nothing being in place to provide for these matters.  People cannot be half drunk or half drugged and be involved in seafaring.  That is not the case currently.  We have a number of rules, regulations and laws in this area.  International trading ships are required to comply with the International Maritime Organisation&rsquo;s international safety management, ISM, code.  That requires a shipping company to identify all hazards and to manage the associated risks.  Most companies assess risks and develop company specific drug and alcohol policies.  In addition, domestic passenger ships proceeding to sea and domestic cargo ships in excess of 500 gross tonnes are also subject to safety management requirements.  These require that the company identify all the hazards and manage the associated risks, including drink and drugs. </P>
        <P Just="Left">The merchant shipping medical examinations&rsquo; regulations 2005 require seafarers employed or engaged in any capacity on board every seagoing ship, whether publicly or privately owned, to hold a valid certificate attesting to their medical fitness for the work in which they are employed.  Those medical fitness standards applying in Ireland include comprehensive physical and mental fitness standards and may include addiction disorders.  The revised medical standards provide for an updated and more comprehensive medical assessment with improvements in the standards relating to a number of conditions.  The Department relies on the work of a panel of approved doctors located throughout Ireland to carry out medical assessments of seafarers.</P>
        <P>As already stated, the approach taken in Ireland was to make provision in the Maritime Safety Act 2005 to prohibit the operation of vessels by a master or crew of a vessel in Irish waters or of an Irish ship in waters anywhere if they are impaired by being under the influence of alcohol or drugs or a combination of these intoxicating substances.  Section 28(1) of that Act contains a prohibition on operating vessels while under the influence of alcohol or drugs and states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">A person being in command or in charge or another member of the crew of a vessel in Irish waters or an Irish ship in waters anywhere shall not operate or control or attempt to operate or control the vessel or carry out any task or duty in relation to such operation or control while he or she or the other is under the influence of alcohol or a drug or any combination of drugs...</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Section 29 of the Maritime Safety Act 2005 addresses drunkenness among members of a crew.  Section 30 imposes a duty on the person in command of a vessel in Irish waters to control the consumption of alcohol or drugs on board that vessel.  Section 32 prohibits any person on board a vessel in Irish waters or on board an Irish ship in waters anywhere from endangering other vessels or persons on board by reason of being under the influence of alcohol or a drug or any combination of drugs.</P>
        <P>I accept the Deputy&rsquo;s bona fides in respect of this matter.  I share the view that we need to tighten up the position as much as possible.  However, the advice available to me indicates that we would either need to develop the relevant provisions to a much greater degree than originally anticipated or that we should wait and continue to use the existing provisions until the IMO finalises its position on the matter.  When the latter occurs, we could then put in place new provisions as swiftly as possible.  This is the route we intend to take.</P>

	<P>So it is a subjective measurement.  In other words, there are no regulations which apply at present.  In such circumstances, a person who has imbibed three or four pints of beer could decide that he or she is competent and qualified to be in charge of a ship.  Who decides whether that is the case?  A serious issue, which is of some concern to me, arises in this regard.</P>
        <P>The Minister stated that as soon as the IMO decides on the standards that shall apply, these will be the subject of legislative provision.  How soon will the relevant legislation be introduced following the IMO&rsquo;s decision?  Everyone is agreed that legislation of this nature is required and I am not happy that provision relating to this matter is not being made in the Bill before us.  Will the Minister indicate when the relevant legislation will be introduced, particularly in light of the serious safety issues that have arisen?</P>

If the IMO has finalised the standards it intends to introduce or if we have a good idea of the direction it intends to take in this regard, I will include the relevant provisions in the Bill to which I refer.</P>
        <P>In some senses the Deputy is correct to state that the judgment that will have to be made with regard to whether a person is under the influence of alcohol or drugs initially will be subjective in nature and will be made by the senior officer present.  I presume that the final decision will eventually be made by the master of the ship.  As the Deputy stated, there is no measurement in place at present but we would like to see the 50 mg measurement being introduced.  We will support the introduction of such a measurement.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
        <Quest>   if any contact has been received from the United Nations or other bodies regarding proposed Irish participation in peace support missions; if he had indicated to the UN and other bodies that Ireland is interested in participation in peace support missions in the immediate future; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland has offered, through the UN standby arrangements system, UNSAS, to provide up to 850 military personnel for overseas service at any one time.  This figure equates to some 10% of our standing Army, excluding reserves, and demonstrates Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the cause of international peace.  This is the maximum sustainable commitment we can make to overseas peacekeeping operations.  Following the recent withdrawal of the Irish battalion from the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad, MINURCAT, Ireland is currently, as of 21 May 2010, contributing 167 Defence Forces personnel to 12 different missions throughout the world.</P>
        <P>With regard to future deployments, Ireland receives requests, from time to time, in regard to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis.  When considering any particular request, the existence of realistic objectives and a clear mandate, which has the potential to contribute to a political solution, consideration of how the mission relates to the priorities of Irish foreign policy and the degree of risk involved are among the factors considered.</P>
        <P>Apart from a recent European Union request to despatch members of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, military mission to contribute to the training of Somali security forces, EUTM Somalia, being carried out in Uganda, no other deployments are planned or envisaged at this time.  Five Irish personnel took up duty with the mission at the end of April 2010.  No requests have been received from the UN for deployment of personnel to other UN missions.</P>
        <P>Following the recent withdrawal of the MINURCAT contingent, the Defence Forces are undertaking the essential and extensive maintenance of equipment.  We have also begun the <Col N="398" />process of examining further options for Defence Forces overseas operations and this examination is ongoing.  Participation in overseas operations over the years has given Defence Forces personnel the opportunity to develop skills and competencies through practice in operational situations.  Ireland has built up a fine reputation in the field of international peacekeeping and a considerable volume of international goodwill has resulted.  The Government is committed to the continued participation by the Defence Forces in international peacekeeping, in particular on UN blue hat operations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In January we had 758 military personnel serving overseas, but the Minister tells us that number is now reduced to 167.  Our international credibility with the United Nations and with our fellow European Union member states is at stake.  Our involvement in UN and EUFOR missions gives us a special footprint and a certain amount of authority as an international player.  This international reputation will be damaged unless we have more involvement abroad, and that involvement should be at battalion level rather than sending out small numbers of personnel to various places.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy have a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>How can the Defence Forces keep training personnel at a certain intensity with no mission?  That is surely not sustainable.  The Minister made a commitment in the House that he would increase the number of those serving in Kosovo, for example.  Can he confirm whether he intends to increase those numbers further?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I agree that the posting of Irish troops overseas has contributed very positively to our international credibility.  We have a standing commitment to have 850 personnel overseas, and that would best be served by having a detachment at battalion level, as the Deputy proposes.  At this point no mission has been mentioned in terms of an Irish involvement.  As I said in my reply, we require a period to deal with issues that have arisen in regard to equipment, as well as issues such as leave and so on that arise after a long and intensive mission.  We will look at any proposal put to us by the United Nations.  Our dealings with that body suggest it is likely to ask us to partake in missions.  When and if that arises, we will consider the proposal on the basis of the considerations we have always taken, including the type of impact the mission is likely to have.</P>
        <P>In regard to his question on Kosovo, I assume the Deputy meant to refer to Bosnia and Herzegovina where we are, upon request, retaining our troops until the end of the year.  We were pleased to be in a position to accede to that request.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree that missions abroad, including that in Bosnia and Herzegovina, are important in terms of our foreign policy and, by making us players at the United Nations, afford us greater influence abroad?  Will the Minister confirm that he has made direct contact with the UN regarding the possibility of future missions?  Has he confirmed to the UN that we have a contingent available should it be required in the immediate future?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>We are members of the UN standby arrangement system and our deployment of 850 personnel is available for call-down, as the UN is aware.  When I was having discussions with UN representatives with regard to the mission in Chad, I made clear we would be available for future missions.  I have no doubt that proposals will be put to us in the not too distant future at which point we will consider them according to the criteria I outlined in my reply.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
        <Quest>   his views on whether the Irish Red Cross Society should be fully independent of Government; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[23666/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Irish Red Cross Society is an autonomous body, established by the Irish Red Cross Society Order 1939 pursuant to the Red Cross Act 1938.  The society is an independent charitable organisation with full powers to manage and administer its affairs through its governing body, the central council.  Membership of the council is by way of appointment by the Government or by election in accordance with the rules of the society.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The order establishing the society sets out its primary objects and powers which include acting as a voluntary aid society in times of war or peace.  The Act of 1938 permits payment to the society of funds by way of grant.  The society has certain rights arising from the Geneva Convention.  Under the convention, the Government is required to discharge certain obligations to the society including: ensuring the independence of the society; protecting the emblem; and allowing it access to prisoners of war.  The Geneva Convention is given effect in Irish law through the Red Cross Act 1954, the Prisoners of War and Enemy Aliens Act 1956 and the Geneva Conventions Act 1962, as amended in 1998.  National societies, while auxiliaries in the humanitarian services of their Government and subject to the laws of their respective countries, must always maintain their autonomy so that they may be able at all times to act in accordance with the principles of the international Red Cross movement.</P>
        <P>On 18 May 2010 I met with the vice chairman and secretary general of the society who explained to me the intended changes to the manner in which it is organised.  The changes are intended to implement a better governance structure and confirm the society&rsquo;s independence from Government.  I support its aims in this regard as set out in the report of the working group on governance.  This will require substantial amendments to the Irish Red Cross Society Order 1939.  Officials from the Department of Defence and the society are due to meet shortly to agree the specific changes required to the 1939 order.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  I am pleased to hear of his recent meeting with the Irish Red Cross Society.  Does he not agree that the primary legislation was introduced in a period when war was imminent and there were different forces at play in terms of the role the society might play?  This was a time when there was a general concern about invasions, bombings and so on.  In regard to independence, the council of the Irish Red Cross has 42 members, 16 of whom are nominated by the Minister.  The chairman is also nominated by the Minister and the fact that there has been no chairman in place since December is causing major problems.  What concerns me is the adverse publicity that continues to emanate, albeit the most recent I saw was on a blog.  There is a need for this to cease and for nomination of the 16 members and chairman of the council to pass from the Minister.  I would like if the Minister could elaborate on the proposals put to him by the members of the Irish Red Cross with whom he met on 18 May.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Deputy O&rsquo;Shea stated that primary legislation may be required.  While this may be the case at some point in the future, particularly bearing in mind the Deputy&rsquo;s points regarding adverse publicity in respect of the Irish Red Cross and the impact this is likely to have, which cannot be positive, I am disposed to making the changes that can be made fairly quickly.  Following my meeting with the vice-chairman and acting chief executive officer, I believe that the commitment of the Irish Red Cross is beyond question in terms of delivering on its mandate.  I believe the obligation on Government to allow the Irish Red Cross to operate independently is a major consideration and must be respected.  Notwithstanding this, as the <Col N="400" />Deputy stated, the Government has the right to nominate approximately one third of the members of the council, namely, 14 of the 42 members.  Often, the number of appointments exceeds 14.  The Deputy also referred to the need to appoint a chairman, a matter I hope to dispose of in the next few weeks.  This will be an important element in moving the Irish Red Cross forward.  We all share the aspiration that it be allowed to operate with the maximum possible level of credibility.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>Can I take it that the Minister has in mind a definite person for the position of chairman, the urgency of which appointment the Minister obviously accepts?  The Minister has not dealt with the issue of whether it serves the independence of the Irish Red Cross that 16 of the 42 members on the council are appointed by Government.  Perhaps also he will address my question in regard to the proposals put to him from the acting chief executive officer and vice-president.  What will be the composition of the council under those proposals?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not recollect any issue being raised or any difficulty being expressed in regard to the composition of the board and the fact that the Government nominates one third of its members.  There are a number of recommendations, one of which pertains to the manner, for example, in which the chairman will be appointed.  This process is likely to take some time and is one of the reasons for the delay in replacing the former chairman.  It may well be that the appropriate way to deal with this would be to appoint an interim chairman pending completion of at least the first phase of what is required in terms of allowing the Irish Red Cross to move towards independence.  </P>
        <P>I am aware of the adverse publicity which the Irish Red Cross has unfortunately attracted.  We need to take action but to do so carefully to ensure we overcome that difficulty.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
        <Quest>   the proposals he had made to ensure the deterrent impact in having ships on the ocean waves is maximised, in view of the reduction in the Naval Service patrol days; if he believes, that in view of the threat posed by drugs importation, and the costs it imposes on the health and justice budgets, that additional expenditure in preventing the importation of drugs would offer value for money and enable savings in Justice and Health; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[23668/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Naval Service operates eight general purpose ships.  All eight ships are involved in coastal and offshore patrolling and surveillance for the State in that part of the seas where State jurisdiction applies.  The current exclusive fishery limits extend to 200 miles offshore and cover an area of 132,000 nautical square miles.  The Naval Service currently patrols the entire 200 mile limit and periodically patrols beyond these limits to protect specific fisheries.  These patrols are carried out on a regular basis and are directed to all areas of Irish waters as necessary.  The number of patrol vessels on patrol in Irish waters at any one time varies between three and eight.  The Naval Service is committed to having at least three vessels on patrol within the Irish exclusive economic zone at any one time.  All vessels are multi-tasked in the sense that they also undertake general surveillance, security and other duties while on patrol.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the prevention of drug trafficking rests primarily with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Revenue Commissioners.  However, the White Paper on Defence provides for a security role for the Naval Service to assist and support the civil authorities in this important work.  Naval Service patrols at sea undoubtedly act as a deterrent in the fight against drug trafficking.  However, increasingly this role is governed by intelligence-led operations and greater co-operation between national and international agencies.</P><Col N="401" />
        <P>Government measures to improve law enforcement in regard to drugs, including the establishment in 1993 of a joint task force involving the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Customs Service and Naval Service, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combatting drug trafficking.  There is close co-operation between the civil authorities and Naval Service in discharging this important mission.</P>
        <P>Internationally, the establishment in 2007 of the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre &mdash; Narcotics, MAOC-N, has led to a greater focus on intelligence exchange among countries in tackling large drug shipments by sea.  MACO-N was set up by seven European countries and is designed as an international co-ordination force with access to national tasking agencies and requires participation and resources from all active members.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and Customs Service have full time officers based at the centre in Lisbon.  Irish Naval Service personnel travel to the centre when requested by the joint task force.</P>
        <P>Intelligence sharing and international surveillance capabilities played key roles in Ireland&rsquo;s largest drug seizure.  In 2008, the Naval Service intercepted a yacht off the coast of west Cork and seized cocaine with an approximate value of &euro;675 million.  I am, therefore, confident that the current level of naval patrols, in conjunction with the intelligence initiatives, are effective in preventing drug importation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>While I agree with the Minister that intelligence-led operations are very much the norm now, surely he will agree, as mentioned in his reply and previously on Question Time, that one must have a constant presence of naval vessels in our territorial waters to act as a real deterrent to people intent on smuggling drugs into the country.  The reduction in patrol days in 2010 sends out the wrong message.  We are down almost 200 patrol days since 2009.  In 2005, there were 1,681 patrol days.  Despite the large number of drugs which are obviously coming into this country from South America and other parts of the world, as evidenced in operation Seabight, the number of patrol days has been reduced to 1,480.  </P>
        <P>I met recently with members of the Naval Service who are concerned about recruitment to the service to ensure it has the personnel to fulfil its commitment and the Government&rsquo;s commitment to ship replacement.  The Minister will be aware that the <i>Emer, Aoife and Aisling</i> are past their natural usage.  Perhaps he will give a commitment in regard to the patrol days at sea and the replacement of the aforementioned vessels.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>While patrol days are an important element of surveillance, they are increasingly less so in the context of the type of monitoring possible, in particular when one takes account of the work of the Lisbon centre, the co-operation between the relevant countries and the advanced co-operation between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Customs Service and Naval Service.  Surveillance in this regard is much improved, which is a factor in it being possible to operate with enhanced levels of capability even in the context of reduced patrol days, which arise from the strictures set by the economic situation we are in.  The Naval Service, no more than any other element of Irish public service, is impacted on by this.  Nevertheless, it is possible in the current climate to provide much enhanced levels of surveillance because of international co-operation and automatic identification systems on vessels, which means that it is possible to track from Haulbowline, which I visited last week or the previous week, the movement of all vessels in Irish waters and even prior to their reaching Irish waters.  The level of intelligence available to the Navy makes the importance of patrolling considerably less than it would have been in the previous era.  Nevertheless, we all acknowledge that the Navy has an important role to play and patrolling is an important element of that.  </P>
        <P>As Deputy Deenihan said, there is an issue regarding the replacement of the vessels.  The economic situation has had an impact on this issue and it is being kept under review.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="402" />
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Have the plans to replace the three vessels been shelved?  Am I correct in understanding that is the case?  The Minister&rsquo;s predecessor told us that the plans were at an advanced stage.  Will the Minister clarify this and state if these plans have been put on the back burner and that the vessels will not be replaced in the immediate future?  Will he give a commitment on a timeline for their replacement?  </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Detailed and extensive contract negotiations are close to conclusion and at that point a decision will have to be made on the timing of the purchase of vessels and no more than any other element of public service that will have to be considered in the context of the current budgetary constraints.  A considerable amount of work has been done on foot of the tender competition.  I am not in a position to say at this point when a final decision will be made but it is clear that the question of replacing naval vessels is one that must be kept under review.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
        <Quest>   if he will appoint a Brigadier General Director of the Reserve Defence Forces in order that the Reserve Defence Forces have a meaningful voice at general staff level  </Quest>
        <QRef>[23665/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>In accordance with the Reserve Defence Forces Review Implementation Plan, the Reserve Defence Forces was re-organised along similar lines to the Permanent Defence Force in October 2005.  The reserve now mirrors the Permanent Defence Force with the Army Reserve organised within a three brigade structure and a Reserve Defence Forces Training Authority.  In addition there is a Naval Service Reserve. </P>
        <P>General officers commanding and the flag officer commanding the Naval Service are brigadier generals and a commodore, respectively.  They are in command of both permanent and reserve units within their particular formation.  Consequently, all units within formations, both permanent and reserve, are represented at general level and there are no plans to appoint an additional brigadier general specifically for the Reserve Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>The strength of the Army and Naval Service Reserve at end April 2010 was 6,304.  Recruitment to the reserve recommenced in May 2009 after a temporary suspension.  Recruitment is ongoing, subject to an overall strength of 7,671 not being exceeded.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As at 30 April 2010, the strength of the Permanent Defence Force was 9,856.  Within the available resources, the Government is committed to maintaining the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at a level of 10,000 all ranks, for which Government approval has been secured in the context of budget 2010.  This reflects the reductions in personnel recommended in the report of the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes.  This reduced strength requires a flexible and adaptive response in order to maintain the delivery of defence services.</P>
        <P>The prevailing economic environment and the associated resource constraints have impacted on the entire defence organisation.  The financial situation is such that it is not possible to provide the level of resourcing that was available in recent years.  Within the reduced resource envelope, the Department and the Defence Forces are working closely to prioritise the operational requirements of the Defence Forces and I fully support this approach.</P>
        <P>The Department and the Defence Forces are currently examining options, including re-organisation, to ensure the continued delivery of defence services to the greatest extent possible.  At this stage I have received no recommendation regarding the future of the appointment of the director of reserve forces, or any other appointment.  I would expect, however, that any <Col N="403" />recommendation I receive will take account of the current and future requirements of the Reserve Defence Forces.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>I am disappointed with the Minister&rsquo;s reply.  The Reserve Defence Forces is aggrieved that it does not have an adequate dispute resolution mechanism similar to that in place in PDFORRA and RACO in terms of the Permanent Defence Force.  The reserve is also of the view, rightly or wrongly, that its director should be a member of RACO in that if a brigadier general was to be appointed director, a brigadier general would not be a member of RACO but would be a member of the general staff.  </P>
        <P>There are major concerns among the members of the Defence Forces Reserve.  The recommendations in the McCarthy report to reduce by two thirds its resources and size has not been implemented.  The strength of Defence Forces Reserve is now 6,394 compared to 23,000 in 1960.  I am sure the Minister will agree that in the context of its strength members of the reserve are concerned that the reserve is under threat and that we are moving towards a point where its viability could be very much in question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am aware of the points made by Deputy O&rsquo;Shea regarding concerns the reserve and its representatives have.  I had a meeting with them and attended its annual general meeting in the Curragh some weeks back.  These issues are ongoing and can be addressed over a period of time.  </P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>If I were to look back at the recommendations in the White Paper, produced almost ten years ago, and the plan that was implemented in 2005, it seems that all the key components have been acted on and at this point perhaps we need to look to the future of the reserve in the context of a new White Paper.  It seems open to the interpretation that the plan that was implemented and agreed has not been as successful as one might have hoped.  That is something we want to resolve.  The position of the Reserve Defence Forces is important and one to which we are committed.  We want to have the best possible outcomes in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Can the Minister assure us that the issue of the appointment of a director of the Reserve Defence Forces will be part of the discussions on the White Paper, which is in preparation, and the value for money review?  In the context of achieving value for money, it could best be achieved if members of the reserve were happy in terms of from where the director of the reserve is appointed, which would improve morale.  It is now very low, if not at an all time low.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will know, in many respects tensions are not always negative.  If the effect of them is to impact negatively on morale, that is something worth considering.  Work on the White Paper is not yet under way.  There will be an opportunity for the reserve and its representatives to have a positive impact in that respect.  I have undertaken that account will be taken of its concerns and recommendations prior to the finalisation of the value for money report.  There is an acknowledgement that they have concerns and that account will be taken of them.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
        <Quest>   the progress made on agreeing an employment control framework for the Defence Forces that would enable some recruiting and promotions to resume; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      </Qst><Col N="404" />
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Within the available resources, the Government is committed to maintaining the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at a level of 10,000, all ranks, for which Government approval has been secured in the context of budget 2010.  This reflects the reductions in personnel recommended in the report of the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the military authorities that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force as at 30 April 2010, the latest date for which figures are available, was 9,856 broken down as follows: 797 for the Air Corps, 1,023 for the Naval Service and 8,036 for the Army.</P>
        <P>Officials from the Department together with the military authorities are currently engaged in a review of the structures and posts required to meet the operational requirements of the Permanent Defence Force within the reduced numbers.  Following on from this review, discussions will commence with the Department of Finance to agree an employment control framework for the Defence Forces, which is sustainable within a figure of 10,000 serving personnel in the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
        <P>The position with regard to promotion is that once the employment control framework has been agreed with the Department of Finance, sanction for promotion will be delegated to the Department of Defence, with ongoing control monitoring by the Department of Finance on a monthly basis, to ensure ongoing compliance with the overall parameters and controls set by Government for each sector.</P>
        <P>With regard to recruitment, as the Deputy will be aware, I have recently approved the recruitment of 40 recruits to the Naval Service.  In addition, the military authorities will shortly advertise for some limited recruitment to the Army.  While these are challenging times, my priority is to ensure that the  Defence Forces are organised, equipped and staffed in a manner which will ensure that they can continue to deliver the services required of them by Government.</P>
        <P>I am advised that at this time the Defence Forces retain the capacity to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and overseas.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister aware that a commitment was given that the employment control framework would be agreed and presented to the Department of Finance by the end of April?</P>
     
        <P Just="Left">It is now a month since that date and this has not happened.  My understanding is that it has been sat upon or, some would say, is now suppressed or bogged down in the Department of Defence.  Will the Minister take a hands on approach here?  It is critical that the employment control framework gets to the Department of Finance as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>I remind the Minister that the Defence Forces, perhaps more than any other Department, have complied with everything asked of them.  They responded to all requests concerning reduction in numbers, from 15,000 not so long ago to 10,000 now.  They have been held up as a flagship for other civil servants and Departments and are now being treated very unfairly because of  non-movement due to the employment control framework.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I assure Deputy Deenihan and the House that the delays from the original date mentioned by the Deputy in regard to the employment control framework have arisen because of the additional work required.  I can assure him absolutely there is no foot dragging on the part of the Department or the military authorities.  It is a very important exercise and one which must be dealt with subsequently with the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>I agree strongly with the point made by Deputy Deenihan in regard to the progress made by the Department of Defence.  It is incumbent on all of us who have a role to ensure the <Col N="405" />Department does not suffer on foot of that when across the board cuts are made.  Sub-departments are in a better position to absorb them because they have not been to the fore in addressing this situation to the extent mentioned by Deputy Deenihan.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to stress the urgency of agreeing the framework on which, at this moment, 200 jobs are hanging.  If 200 jobs were created in this country tomorrow morning, there would be major announcements about it.  There are 200 people waiting to take up employment when this is agreed and surely that is enough of a reason to expedite the measure.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister also confirm that the mentioned figure of 10,000 is both a maximum and a minimum figure, and not a ceiling?  Is he aware that 200 jobs are dependent on the employment control framework which deals with the strength and structure of our Defence Forces?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no doubt progress will be made within the figure of 10,000 personnel agreed for 2010 and also within whatever may arise from the employment control framework proposals which, in any event, must be agreed subsequently with the Department of Finance.  The figure of 10,000 is the employment number agreed for 2010 and, as I stated, we have already commenced the process of recruiting to the Naval Service.  When I was answering questions last month I made the point that we needed to fill the posts in a targeted way to ensure we would have the capacity in each individual area to make sure that the services which are required of the military, the Naval Service and the Air Corps authorities can be fulfilled.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>Would the Minister not agree that a reduction of 400 in Army personnel, from 8,433 to 8,036 from March 2009 to the end of April 2010, is worrying?  Can he provide a reason for this major reduction?  Is he aware that foreign military authorities, especially those in the Middle East, are now advertising in this country for aircraft expert technicians and army personnel?  I understand this could be considered illegal.  I was in contact with the Minister because I received a number of complaints about advertising.  Is he aware of any of our personnel being lost to other countries, whether from the Middle East or elsewhere?  Some of our national newspapers may not be aware that this is considered illegal under the 1954 Act.  Has the Minister informed the editors of the various national newspapers this might be illegal?  That would be very important.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not helpful or positive to have a fixation on numbers regarding the strength of the Defence Forces.  It would be far better for the Defence Forces and their capability if we were to concentrate on that capability to do the job effectively.  One factor that must be acknowledged is that with smaller numbers both the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces have a considerably greater output than was the case heretofore.  That said, the sensible way to approach the issue of recruitment is to look very carefully at all the various sectors and target recruitment to those areas where it is immediately required.</P>
        <P>The drop in numbers was driven to a large extent by the economic situation, in the first instance, and also by the recommendations of the McCarthy report which recommended a particular reduction in numbers.  I have seen no evidence that the reduction in numbers has been impacted on in any way by former Army, Navy or Air Corps personnel being recruited by other armies.  I can have that checked out further but am not aware of it at this point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>Go raibh maith agat.  I note that the last time we were here for Question Time, the Minister indicated that we were 123 below 10,000, a number that has increased by 21 in the interim, a figure that is less than I had expected.  Obviously, this has another impact in terms of positions that will become available for recruitment.  The question posed asked about rank, brigade, age and so on.  In terms of the people who are leaving the forces is there any direction the Minister can give us as to what level they are leaving at, whether officer, NCO or private level, and from where are those who are leaving coming?  </P>
        <P Just="Left">Is there any breakdown of the people making up the increase in numbers of 21 since last month?  From which branch of the services do they come and what rank do they have?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy O&rsquo;Shea raises a very important question.  It impacts on the kind of recruitment campaign one might carry out, especially if there was an indication that people were leaving in large numbers from a particular segment and one would have to try to replace them in that area.  One factor that has become apparent &mdash; I am not clear whether it is a trend &mdash; is that the figure of 21 is considerably less than one would have expected in a month.</P>
        <P Just="Left">One might expect two or three times that amount.  At this point I do not know if the trend will be continued, as the numbers leaving per month would have an obvious effect on the rate of recruitment in trying to get to and maintain the number at around 10,000.  This is particularly true in the context of trying to ensure the capability of each individual sector in the Army.</P>
        <P>The only trend I have noticed, which may be more anecdotal than evidence-based, is that it appears to be difficult to retain women in the armed services.  That is not an experience solely confined to this country and it may have to be addressed.  Our experience does not appear to <Col N="417" />be different from those elsewhere.  I have not noticed any other trends with regard to people leaving at officer level, etc.</P>
        <P>It must be borne in mind that in some instances of a particular year, it may be the anniversary &mdash; if that is the right term &mdash; of a particularly big recruitment and in that case there may be a large number of retirees.  We are trying to consider at what point that may have an input.  The number of 21 in the past month is one of the smallest changes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In my question I mentioned gender.  Will the Minister give an indication of the number of women leaving the service and the overall percentage of women in the Defence Forces?  The Minister indicated that recruitment will be targeted, so does it follow that preferential treatment will be given in the recruitment of women?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>That would be very difficult.  The problem I mentioned is not really a question of recruitment but retention in certain areas, which is very difficult to address and needs to be considered in detail.  On the question of rank and numbers, we would ideally need to look at a very large number of pages, and it would defy the patience level of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle if I tried to read them out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for the consideration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister should ensure the employment control framework can be agreed as soon as possible.  That is the Minister&rsquo;s task for the next week in his hands-on approach.  The other issue regards gender, which I continually pursued with the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor.  Consideration should be given to the Curragh, where there is the highest concentration of women officers involved in the forces at all levels.  There was a proposal for a cr&egrave;che in the Curragh but has it been shelved or is it still under active consideration?  Women are leaving the Defence Forces for some reason and they may not be getting the supports most young married women would get.  If they did, it might encourage such women to remain in the Defence Forces.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>It may well be that the question of retention is more appropriate for direct attention than recruitment, and a raft of ideas has been aired.  In some respects it might be reasonable to indicate that the White Paper will be very important in setting the medium-term goals for the Defence Forces.  I would like to be in a position to get into that consideration as quickly as possible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister did not address the cr&egrave;che issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I will have to get back to the Deputy on that.  I have heard the issue mentioned but I do not have the required detail today.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister will make it a priority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is providing many difficult tasks and not much time to complete them.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
        <Quest>   if he will make a statement on his address to the Annual Delegate Conference of the Reserve Defence Forces Representative Association; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[23364/10]</QRef>
      </Qst><Col N="418" />
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>On 15 May 2010 I addressed the 16th delegate conference of the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association, RDFRA.  In my  address I dealt with a range of issues, including the current challenging economic circumstances, which have required the Government to take tough and decisive action and which has won international respect.  I made the point that whereas some of the necessary measures have been unpalatable, the Government is determined to do what it takes to put Ireland back on the road to sustainable economic recovery and growth.</P>
        <P>Other issues I addressed related to recruitment and promotion, and the value for money review of the Reserve Defence Forces, RDF.  The position on recruitment and promotion is that, as with the broader public service, the defence organisation is required to operate with reduced funding in 2010.  Limited recruitment in order to replace existing members who leave the RDF was sanctioned last May.  This is subject to the overall strength figure that existed at 1 January 2009, which was 7,671, not being exceeded.  This ongoing limited recruitment is being closely monitored and will be kept under review in the light of the future budgetary provision available to the Department of Defence.</P>
        <P>I outlined the position on the value for money review of the Reserve Defence Force being carried out under the Government&rsquo;s 2009 to 2011 programme of value for money and policy reviews on which work has recently commenced.  I confirmed that RDFRA, as a key stakeholder, would be consulted during the course of the review.  I informed the conference that it is envisaged that the review will be completed by the end of 2010.  It is planned that the findings of the review, together with the lessons learned from the Reserve Defence Force review implementation plan, will assist in informing decisions regarding the future development of the Reserve Defence Force.  I look forward to receiving the steering committee&rsquo;s recommendations in this regard.</P>
        <P>I also updated delegates on a number of specific issues which had been raised by the RDFRA general secretary and executive members when I met them on 28 April 2010.  The issues included the post of the director of the Reserve Defence Forces and the position of paid training.  With regard to the director appointment, I advised that this is being dealt with in the context of the review of structures and posts in the Permanent Defence Force.  With regard to training I confirmed my commitment to ensure that in 2010, reservists who complete specified voluntary unpaid training will be afforded the opportunity to avail of a minimum of seven days paid training.  I complimented the reserve on the time and commitment that members of the Reserve Defence Force have voluntarily given since the formation of the State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the paid training was reduced by approximately two thirds, which would be in line with the McCarthy recommendation.  Will the Minister confirm if that is the case?  In regard to recruitment, replacement recruitment up to a certain level was sanctioned by the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor in May last year.  The level of recruitment into the Reserve Defence Forces has been nowhere near what is desirable for quite some time.</P>
        <P>In the current position, where men and women under 25 are unemployed, is there not a very strong case for opening recruitment in the RDF?  As the Minister knows, one of the suggestions from the RDFRA was that people be given six weeks of training and introduction into the Reserve Defence Forces in the leaving certificate year.  In general terms, there is much concern among the Reserve Defence Forces about the length of the recruitment process.  It has been suggested that this extends to more than six months but there does not seem to be a particular justification for that.  Will the Minister consider the process from application to recruitment, as the period involved should be greatly reduced?  There is a grave concern that people lose interest because this process drags on for so long.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="419" />
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The 2010 provision under subhead D is &euro;4.7 million and this will provide approximately 31,000 paid man days.  That will allow 3,500 members to undertake seven paid training days each with the provision for career courses and so on.  The provision for 2009 was &euro;8.9 million, of which &euro;6.651 million was utilised.  The number of training days utilised in 2009 was approximately 54,190.  On that occasion, 3,565 reservists availed of paid training compared to the likely number of 3,500 this year.</P>
        <P>Deputy O&rsquo;Shea mentioned that the slow progress in recruitment was due to the slow process.  It may well be a valid point and it has been mentioned by members of the reserves.  There are probably other factors which may be more fundamental, as I commented in an earlier reply.  We must consider the matter.  We will have an opportunity to undertake some of this in the context of the value for money report, which we will receive and consider.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister might provide the House with some of his thoughts on the integrated Reserve Defence Force and the First Line Reserve.  Does he still plan on going ahead with both?  Will the reserves form part of future UN missions in which we are involved?  At the conference, it was strongly conveyed that, to provide motivation, the integrated reserve would be the way forward, but that plan seems to have been abandoned by the Department.</P>
        <P>It is alarming that, whereas there were 24,000 people in the RDF not too many years ago, the current number is approximately 6,000, which the Minister confirmed.  Will he clarify his position on the integrated reserve and the First Line Reserve?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputies will be aware, considerable progress was made on the inclusion of RDF members in a UN mission.  This plan did not proceed for a number of reasons.  Until a new mission becomes available, progressing this element will not be possible, but it is held to be a matter of considerable importance by the representative association at the reserve level.  The association has raised this matter with me at the conference and in my meeting with it.  I would like to see the integration of reserve members in a mission developed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>Apart from training <i>ad nauseam</i>, what else does the reserve do?  What is its role and function?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>As set out, its role and function are to support the Permanent Defence Force in a number of operations.  As I stated in connection with the Red Cross, some of this was envisaged in a period when the opportunities and threats presenting differed from those currently at play.  I strongly suspect that the recommendation of a particular report to cut the numbers in the RDF to one third was driven by this view of the world and would reduce the potential and role of the reserve.  It is not something to which I subscribe and I will deal with the matter as time allows.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will only allow a brief supplementary, as we are over time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>An issue arose at the conference, namely, delays in gaining medical and security clearances were holding up recruitment.  Can the Minister do anything to accelerate the process?  For example, one could enter the reserve defence force of our neighbouring jurisdiction more quickly than one could enter ours.  Gaining medical and security clearances for the reserve in the UK is also faster.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s point is made.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="420" />
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context of the Defence Forces and the RDF, everyone would accept that security clearances are important.  Given the nature of the role, medical clearances are also an issue.  As we all know, some delays have occurred partly because of the requirement for people in many service areas to have security and Garda clearances for certain activities and professions where such requirements did not apply previously.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 28, 29 and 34 together.</P>
        <P>Within the available resources, the Government is committed to maintaining the strength of the PDF, at a level of 10,000 all ranks, for which Government approval has been secured in the context of budget 2010.  This reflects the reductions in personnel recommended in the report of the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes.  I have outlined the current strength, but targeted recruitment will be carried out in 2010 to maintain the operational capability of the Defence Forces.  We have approved the recruitment of 40 people to the Naval Service and further recruitment will occur.</P>
        <P>In light of the reduced budgetary provision available for 2009, all recruitment to the RDF was suspended.  Following a subsequent review and examination of RDF personnel numbers and budgets for 2009, limited recruitment to fill vacancies arising due to existing reserve members resigning or being discharged in the normal manner resumed.  The numbers recruited will depend on the numbers leaving.  This limited recruitment is continuing subject to the overall strength level that existed at 1 January 2009 not being exceeded.  This recruitment is being monitored and kept under review in the light of the uptake of paid training within the RDF and the future budgetary considerations.  I will take account of the points made by Deputies in today&rsquo;s debate.</P>
        <P>I have outlined the review that is under way on structures and posts in the PDF.  Following this, discussions will start with the Department of Finance on the employment control framework, which we have discussed.</P>
        <P>Once the employment control framework has been agreed with the Department of Finance, sanction for promotion will be delegated to the Department of Defence with ongoing control monitoring by the former on a monthly basis to ensure compliance.  With the support of the military authorities and within the resources available, I intend to retain the capacity of the organisation to operate effectively.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="421" />
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>The shortfall in the PDF numbers 144 people.  While 40 people are being recruited into the Naval Service, the numbers are not large.  It is striking that, although the McCarthy target of reducing the number in the PDF to 10,000 from 10,500 was to be achieved in a two to three-year period, it was achieved before the end of last year.</P>
        <P>Given the fact that many young people would like to be recruited into the Defence Forces, is there a case to be made for reverting to the Department of Finance to seek a more graduated approach to reducing the numbers?  If an additional 200 people were recruited in 2010, further recruitment could occur and the target set by McCarthy could still be reached.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>There may well be a case for approaching the Department of Finance on foot of Deputy O&rsquo;Shea&rsquo;s general point, but I would be more comfortable doing so in the context of arguing that the operational capability of the Defence Forces was being negatively impacted by certain numbers instead of by adhering to a rounded figure like 10,000, which seems a somewhat suspicious target.  Instead of referring to a particular number, it would be better for the operational capability of the Army, navy and air force were we to examine what deficiencies or requirements there might be in numbers at all ranks, particularly at recruitment stage, and made a case on foot of that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I gather from the Minister&rsquo;s comments that there is no requirement for 10,000 people.  Instead, it is a question of how efficient the numbers are.  Will the Minister be specific and tell us whether the 10,000 figure is the accepted strength, the maximum or the minimum?</P>
        <P>I welcome the recruitment to the navy, but will the Minister make use of the Naval Service Reserve and focus on recruitment to it?  There seems to be a specific problem with the Naval Service as regards personnel.  Will he respond to these two questions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Historically, new recruits to the navy in particular have tended to come from the reserve.  It is how many recruits enter the PDF.  It is hardly surprising and will be likely to feature.  I have not examined the recruitment numbers over the years.  I understand there is a trend for younger members of the reserve to apply to be permanent members when the opportunity arises.  That is to be welcomed.</P>
        <P>I think it is dangerous to engage in a debate on whether the figure of 10,000 is a ceiling or a floor, as this Department has a mission to fulfil.  I would be far more comfortable presenting the numbers and the capabilities, which include equipment and other considerations.  We have to face the fact that this must be done within financial parameters that are very difficult at the moment.  We are on far stronger ground when we say that this is what the State expects of its armed forces and this is what we need in order to do it.  We are on weak ground when we cling to a magical and somewhat artificial number.  Contrary to what Deputy Deenihan may be thinking, it may well transpire that the number might not be a magical 10,000, but it could well be higher rather than lower.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>I take the Minister&rsquo;s point that 10,000 is an arbitrary figure and the real issue is that the Defence Forces are a credible organisation.  Is he satisfied that the current strength of the Permanent Defence Force means he has a credible organisation in all its aspects?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no doubt at all about that.  Having spoken to the military authorities, I am satisfied that we have extremely credible Defence Forces.  The credibility of the forces with our people was greatly enhanced last winter during the flood crisis and the <Col N="422" />snow and ice crisis.  We often tend to overlook the value of their contribution and in some areas, there is a tendency to denigrate that contribution, something we should carefully guard against.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Question Nos. 26, 27, 37, 46 and 54 together.  </P>
	<P Just="Left">The Reserve Defence Force review implementation plan has provided the framework for the development of the reserve over recent years.  The plan outlined a series of steps which were designed to significantly enhance the quality of training within the Reserve Defence Force.  These steps, together with re-organisation, enhanced working relationships with Permanent Defence Force units and improved equipment were intended to enhance the capability of the Reserve Defence Force and improve interoperability with the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
        <P>Over the period of the plan, training syllabi have been reviewed and reformed, new training introduced and there have been improvements to the equipment for use by members of the reserve.  A revised training strategy is now in place.  This is supported by new syllabi and includes training delivery through distance learning and the affiliation of RDF units with PDF units.</P>
        <P>The plan also provided for the development of an integrated element of the reserve.  This element of the reserve was to integrate and train with the Permanent Defence Force.  The integrated element of the reserve was to receive additional training to the non-integrated element with members undertaking a minimum of 21 days paid training, in addition to unpaid training.  A pilot integration programme was introduced in 2007 and extended into 2008.  The numbers participating in the pilots were lower than anticipated, at just over 300 reservists over the two-year period.  Although the uptake of this training was disappointing, valuable lessons have been learned.</P><Col N="423" />
        <P>I am aware that there is a wide variety of views on how best to develop the reserve.  A value for money review of the Reserve Defence Force has begun.  The steering committee overseeing this review has recently met and has discussed possible approaches to stakeholder consultation.  I have been informed that it will be commencing this consultation on a phased basis over the coming weeks and months.</P>
        <P>As of 30 April 2010, there were 6,304 reservists, with 6,035 in the Army reserve and 269 in the Naval Service reserve.  Recruitment is ongoing at the moment.  The provision in 2010 for Reserve Defence Force training, including paid training and gratuities, is &euro;4.7 million.  Members of the Reserve undertake both paid and unpaid training.  This will provide in 2010 for approximately 31,000 man days of paid training.  Having regard to the number of reservists availing of paid training over recent years, this should provide reservists with seven days paid training and allow for certain career courses in line with reserve priorities.  There will also be an increased reliance on unpaid training.</P>
        <P>The bulk of reserve expenditure occurs over the summer months and gratuities are paid at year-end.  Approximately &euro;550,000 of that has been utilised to date.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The number of the Reserve Defence Force has been reduced from 24,000 a few years ago to just over 6,000.  However, the international trend has been to increase the size of reserve defence forces.  For example, many British army personnel in Afghanistan are from its reserve defence forces.  We seem to be going the opposite way in Ireland and there seems to be a deliberate policy to reduce the numbers and to make the Reserve Defence Force irrelevant.  I see huge opportunities for a vibrant reserve defence force in this country.</P>
        <P>Why was the Reserve Defence Force not used during the recent &ldquo;big freeze&rdquo; and flooding?  It was not used and its members were not asked, which is something that came up at their conference.  It strikes me that we are going against the international trend, and the Government is not asking the reserves to be a necessary aid to the civil power, which is something they are supposed to do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>An element of the international trend in many countries has been that the numbers in permanent defence forces have been dramatically reduced and replaced by similar numbers in the reserve defence forces.  I would not be happy to go down that path.  There is a requirement for a particular level.  We have been discussing that in terms of numbers, but I think we should be discussing it in terms of capabilities of the Permanent Defence Force, especially in respect of its interoperability requirements, such as when members of the Permanent Defence Force are operating with Finnish troops on foreign missions, as we were in Chad, and in other UN and EU sponsored missions.  In some cases, troops from other countries tend to have a substantial number of reserves, which is something that appears to work quite well.  Nevertheless, we need to maintain the basic requirement for the Permanent Defence Force and then examine what we need from the reserve.</P>
        <P>The question tabled by Deputy Stanton encapsulates the nature of the challenge, which is to figure out exactly the nature of what we require from the Reserve Defence Force.  We may require three or four things or more.  The pilot programme was entered into quite properly, and we have major lessons to learn from that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianOShea"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian O&rsquo;Shea</NameTxt>
	<P>The Reserve Defence Force representative organisation pointed out that the quality of training for reservists is not consistent throughout the country.  Would the Minister like to comment on that?</P>
        <P>There is a number of reasons the recruitment of more people into the Reserve Defence Force is socially desirable.  Organisations such as the Reserve Defence Force, the Irish Red <Col N="424" />Cross, the Knights of Malta and the Civil Defence actually add to the capacity of the community in terms of skills, leadership quality and so on.  With such high levels of unemployment, there is a great need to get young people involved in the Reserve Defence Force in order to give them something useful to do.  It will enhance their employability but I believe it will also contribute in large degree to making our community a more skilled place by having people available who have the type of skills that can support the community when in need, whether required by particular individuals or because of disasters.  Broadening the role of the Reserve Defence Force and giving it a more relevant and meaningful role in the context of today&rsquo;s needs in our country requires urgent attention.  I very much encourage the Minister to take it as a real priority.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise to Deputy Deenihan as I missed an important element of his previous question relating to the involvement of the Reserve Defence Force in instances such as the snow and ice.  We need to learn from that for the future because the Permanent Defence Force personnel involved did an outstanding job and the public appreciated it, particularly in the areas where it was really needed.  It seems a role for the Reserve Defence Force can be examined.  The Civil Defence was very much to the fore, particularly during the flooding.</P>
        <P>The point made by Deputy O&rsquo;Shea on it being socially desirable is very important and I fully agree with him on it.  Unfortunately, there are economic constraints and sometimes no matter how much one wants to avoid it one is forced to pick priorities and deal with them.  It is something I want to examine in the context of where we see the future of the Reserve Defence Force.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to take supplementary questions and time is short so if the Minister bears with me I will take the supplementary questions and the Minister might give an expanded response.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I missed the point about training, which I will deal with.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DavidStanton"><NameTxt>Deputy David Stanton</NameTxt>
	<P>Do the numbers mentioned by the Minister include the non-effective list where the Reserve Defence Force is concerned, and if not will he at some stage, if he does not have the information to hand, let us know what is the up-to-date non-effective list versus the effective list?  Will the Minister agree that some young people are attracted to things military and the Reserve Defence Force met that need at a relatively low cost regarding discipline, fitness and career preparation?  Is it necessary to pay reservists the same amount as regular soldiers?  Could more be included if that was looked at?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>In any future recruitment to the Reserve Defence Force will the Minister put emphasis on the recruitment of women?  Will he give us an indication on what proportion of the current Reserve Defence Force is made up of women?  I am sure it would be a way of encouraging women to get more involved with the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I will have to come back to Deputy Deenihan on the number of women because I do not have the information with me.  I think I know the numbers with regard to effective and non-effective but I will send them on to Deputy Stanton.  It is also important.  I agree with his point on military discipline and all of the other elements which are quite attractive to young people and have positive potential.  The question of costs, which he raised, is one which we will not be able to dodge if we want to have a meaningful role for the Reserve Defence Force in the future, which I strongly believe we must.</P>

	<P>In my address on the Adjournment of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on Tuesday, 11 May 2010 relating to the roll-out of the BreastCheck programme in County Clare, I made a statement on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, in good faith based on information provided to my officials by the National Cancer Screening Service, which manages BreastCheck.  The information provided suggested that Clare County Council required planning permission for the location of a mobile digital screening unit in Ennis, County Clare.  This was incorrect.  As a result, the impression was given that Clare County Council had been responsible for the delays in the provision of breast screening in County Clare.  The National Cancer Screening Service has confirmed that planning permission was not required at any time by Clare County Council and the county council is providing a site at its offices in Ennis for the mobile unit.  It has been in contact with the Clare county manager to express its regrets for any offence or embarrassment caused.  The National Cancer Screening Service and Clare County Council look forward to working together to ensure the provision of the BreastCheck service as now scheduled for autumn 2010.</P>

	<P>Amendment No. 4 arises out of Committee proceedings.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 15, line 12, after &ldquo;years&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5" FLI="0">&ldquo;and over 18 years who was in the care of a person or persons other than his or her biological parent or parents for a period of three years or more prior to attaining the age of 18 years&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This deals with the reference to the term &ldquo;child&rdquo; and defines a &ldquo;child&rdquo; as any person under the age of 18 years.  The relevance of the reference is that under the adoption legislation it is only a child who can be adopted.  In the context of this amendment, I am proposing that there be added &ldquo;and over 18 years who was in the care of a person or persons other than his or her biological parent or parents for a period of three years or more prior to attaining the age of 18 years&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>There is a large number of children in foster care and a number of them who, having been in foster care for what was thought to be a period of short duration, have ended up in foster care of a long-term nature all the way up to attaining the age of 18 years and who would like to be legally recognised as part of their foster family.  This amendment is designed to facilitate the making of an adoption order in respect of someone over 18 years who for a minimum of three years prior to attaining the age of 18 was in the care of persons other than their biological parents.</P><Col N="427" />
        <P>This is an issue that has been given very little attention in this State.  It is an issue about which some people outside this House feel very strongly, including former foster parents of people in their early twenties and people older than that who have ultimately been, for all practical terms, a child of a foster family for the greater part of their childhood.  One of the difficulties is that when, in years gone by, children were placed in fosterage even in circumstances where there was a possibility of adoption and the use of the Adoption Act 1988, it was not always brought to the attention of foster parents in the context of their circumstances by the HSE or social workers attached to the former health boards.  This is designed to address that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">One of the criteria regarding eligibility for adoption is that the person to be adopted must be under 18 years of age.  The issue of the adoption of persons aged over 18 years of age originally arose in the context of children who remain in long-term foster care, as the Deputy has said, with the same family for a considerable period of time but who, for one reason or another, are not eligible to be adopted.  As the Deputy will know, the Childcare (Amendment) Act 2007 provides additional rights to parents who foster on a long-term basis.  The referendum wording, as proposed and agreed unanimously by the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children, will allow liberalisation of the kind of restrictions which are causing people to be in foster care for long periods of time when adoption might be a more appropriate answer for them.  For that reason, I will not accept the amendment.  It would be more appropriate to deal with it in the context of the referendum proposal which will be put before the people in due course.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>To briefly respond to that, there is a policy issue in relation to this matter which is do we, as a matter of policy in all circumstances forevermore, confine adoption to persons under 18 years of age or is the Government open to considering, for the type of individual I have described, the possibility of extending of adoption to them?  It is not necessarily an issue which is going to be resolved by the wording proposed by the all-party committee for a children&rsquo;s rights referendum, which includes addressing certain adoption issues, though the provision proposed contained within that may more readily facilitate this.</P>
        <P>I want to say that I recognise in the context of this amendment that if this amendment were to be made, I think there are other changes which would be required in our adoption legislation.  I think if one had a 25 or 30 year old who had been in long-term fosterage and wished to be adopted, for example, by the foster parents it would be a little odd to go looking for the consent or agreement of the original biological mother when this was a decision made by an adult.  I think there is a very fundamental decision to be made, which is whether adult individuals who had been in long-term fosterage should be given the legal autonomy to be able to make this type of decision without reverting to the biological parents.</P>
        <P>I essentially raise this issue to try to generate some discussion and consideration of this which has really not been the subject of any detailed public debate.  I welcome the fact that the Minister of State said that when we come back, hopefully we will have the children&rsquo;s rights referendum this year and, quite clearly, further adoption legislation would then be required.  In that context, it is my intention to withdraw this amendment and not press it.</P>
        <P>I merely ask the Minister of State a question, in the context of his reply.  We are aware that the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children recommended that new draft proposals for adoption legislation should be published before we have the children&rsquo;s rights amendment.  I want to ask the Minister of State if there has been any progress made in that <Col N="428" />regard because I am concerned that it does not become an obstacle to the time line of holding a referendum in 2010.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Deputy is right that we are dealing with a blockage in regard to children who would be otherwise adoptable but are in long-term foster care.  The categories for which the Deputy is seeking to provide additional rights would normally be adoptable but for the 1988 interpretation.  I remember the Deputy raising this issue at the all-party meetings of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children where his view was that there was a very narrow interpretation abroad about how that could be relied on by people in long-term foster care.  I am absolutely sympathetic to what the Deputy is trying to do but the relaxation of the point will bring the issue more into the categories of long-term foster care children under 18 years of age. That issue would be more appropriately dealt with for children rather than for adults.</P></Speaker>

	<P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 16, between lines 1 and 2, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(iii) is appointed to be a guardian of the child in accordance with the provisions of this Act,&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">There is a reference to the definition of &ldquo;guardian&rdquo; in relation to a child which appears on page 15.  It states that:</P>

The additional amendments that are referred to which we are taking in conjunction with this are amendments Nos. 40 and 99.  I will briefly refer to those.  Amendment No. 40 seeks: &ldquo;In page 26, line 2, after &ldquo;order&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or guardianship order made by it&rdquo;.&rdquo;  The &ldquo;it&rdquo; in that context would be the adoption authority.  Amendment No. 99 which, from what I can recollect, is the more substantive amendment, states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 99, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;163.&mdash;Section 11B(1) of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 is amended by the insertion of the following:</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">&ldquo;(<i>c</i>) is a spouse of a parent of the child,&rdquo;.&rdquo;.</P><Col N="429" />
        <P FLI="0" el="5">What this is all about, if I can put it in non-legal language, is dealing with the issue of family adoptions and, as we know from the information documentation made available by the Adoption Board at present, a substantial number, indeed the majority, of adoption orders made at present by the Adoption Board are essentially family adoptions.  The majority of family adoptions are adoptions by a biological mother who has married someone who is not the biological father of her child and who wishes that her husband adopt the child and assume parental rights identical to those that normally would vest in a biological father where a child is born to a married couple and the husband wishes also to have the entitlement of adopting the child.</P>
        <P>In the context of adoptions, from the Adoption Board annual report 2008 &mdash; I do not think we have the 2009 report &mdash; during that year there was a total of 49 applications for non-family adoptions and there were total applications for what are known as family adoptions of 224 and 217 out of the 224, that is, 79% of the total domestic adoption applications received by the Adoption Board in 2008 were received from birth mothers and their husbands who were trying to jointly adopt the birth mothers&rsquo; children.  Curiously, there was only one from a birth father and his wife seeking to jointly adopt.</P>
        <P>In the same year in 2008 &mdash; some of the applications received in 2008 would not result in orders being made until 2009 &mdash; in the context of adoption orders made, a total of 200 adoption orders were made in that year and 128 of them, that is, 64%, were in favour of the birth mother and her husband.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>Two were in favour of the birth father and his wife.  Therefore, 130 out of 200 orders were in respect of the original biological parent plus a spouse.</P>
        <P>A series of reports published by the Adoption Board over the past 20 years &mdash; I will not delay the House with a recital of quotations &mdash; have recommended alternative procedures.  The 1984 review report of adoption services recommended that where a biological parent marries a person who is not the other parent, an alternative procedure should be put in place to grant parental rights to the latter.  To use the example represented by 99% of cases, it is extremely artificial to require a biological mother to jointly adopt her own child with her husband.  My proposed amendment will allow the new adoption authority to make what is known as a guardianship order as an alternative to an adoption order.  This would confer rights on the husband to be the child&rsquo;s guardian without creating an artificial arrangement whereby the mother has to adopt her own child.  A later amendment proposes, as an alternative to requiring the biological mother and husband or, in the aforementioned three instances, the biological father and wife jointly adopting the biological parent&rsquo;s child, to allow the non-parental spouse to have an adoption order made in his or her favour in circumstances where the legislation expressly preserves the rights of the biological parent.</P>

        <P>It is a bizarre system.  In 2009, 79% of applications derived from biological mothers and their husbands.  Biological mothers undergo an assessment process to determine whether they should be allowed to adopt their own children.  They are then put in the anomalous position whereby they must produce an adoption version of the birth certificate if they are asked to demonstrate they are the child&rsquo;s parents.  How many teenagers will as a result wonder whether their biological parents are in fact their real parents?  How much confusion is created by a bizarre law which requires a mother to adopt her own child in order to confer legal rights and responsibilities in respect of that child on her husband in circumstances where the latter wants to acquire them?  In the vast majority of these cases, the biological father played little or no role in the life of the child.</P><Col N="430" />
        <P>Given the Adoption Board&rsquo;s repeated appeals in its annual reports over a period of two decades for changes to the law, I do not understand why the issue is not being addressed in this Bill.  This is a fundamental amendment because it is not right that doubts should be sown in the minds of persons who were adopted using this system as they head into their teens and twenties.  We have heard numerous stories of adopters failing to tell children that they were adopted and we know the difficulties that ensued.</P>
        <P>This is an antediluvian and anachronistic provision based on legislation which dates back to 1952.  It is extraordinary that we are re-enacting this anachronism 58 years later despite all the recommendations from the Adoption Board.  I raised this issue on Committee Stage in the hope that the Minister of State would reflect further on it before Report Stage.  I urge him now to accept Amendment No. 5 and the subsequent amendments to which I referred.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I support Deputy Shatter&rsquo;s argument.  This Bill is supposed to be in the best interests of the child but serious confusion still arises in regard to children who are being adopted by their natural mothers and their relationship with their adoptive and natural fathers.  In many ways society is ahead of the proposals in this legislation.  We must be frank and honest in giving information to children on these matters.  By accepting the amendments proposed by Deputy Shatter the Minister of State would offer more clarity to young people in regard to the identity of their natural parents and their relationships to subsequent partners.</P>
        <P>I am reminded of a recent article by John Waters in <i>The Irish Times </i>which told the story of a young couple.  The girl&rsquo;s mother became extremely shocked when told the identity of the boy.  It turned out that the boy&rsquo;s father was probably also the girl&rsquo;s natural father.  We must face up to these realities with this Bill.  The amendments I have tabled on the natural father of children in the adoption process are also relevant to this issue.</P>
        <P>We probably will not be revisiting these issues for quite some time, even though the Minister of State has indicated his intention to introduce another Bill to deal with post-adoption information, tracing and birth certificates.  In my opinion these matters should be provided for in the Bill before us because it is important that we get clarity on them in the context of modern society as opposed to the past when all these stories were hidden and families did not speak to their children about them.  It is important that we reflect the fact that we live in a different world when we pass legislation in this House.  In that context I ask the Minister of State to take Deputy Shatter&rsquo;s amendments seriously.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The adoption authority will not be involved in the appointment of guardians and this Bill does not provide for the appointment of a guardian to a child.  Section 17, which deals with placement, provides that the appointment of a guardian is done by way of an application under section 6A or section 11(4) of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964.  Otherwise, as set out in section 3 of this Bill, a guardian may be appointed by deed or will or by order of a court in this State.  As such, the appointment of a guardian is outside the scope of the Bill.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 99 is a matter for the 1964 act, which is under the aegis of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  Guardianship in the Adoption Bill arises in the context of consent required for adoption.  If the natural father is a guardian, his consent is required before a child can be placed for adoption or an adoption order can be made.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I regret the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply.  He did not address the issues I raised.  As the Minister of State with responsibility for children, he has given us a sort of mechanical reply that the Bill does not deal with guardianship, this is a matter for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, ergo he will not deal with the matter.  That is the explanation he gave.</P>
        <P>The Bill does not deal with guardianship because it does not address this issue.  It will deal with guardianship if this amendment and the other two amendments I proposed to the House are made.  Here again, we have what I would describe as piecemeal thinking, that is, making a pretence at addressing issues from a child&rsquo;s perspective, but in fact offering the excuse that the Department does not deal with the issue.  That is essentially what the Minister of State is saying.  He is the Minister with responsibility for children across the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Health and Children and Education and Skills.  I presume that if a guardianship Bill were introduced in the House, he would deal with it under the guise of Minister of State in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I cannot take seriously his response.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State also failed to state the reason successive reports of the Adoption Board are being ignored.  I indicated already that I do not propose to read all the reports into the record of the House.</P>
        <P>To return to the comments made by Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan, apart from not confusing the child&rsquo;s background genealogy, giving rise to doubts about the position of the biological mother, there is another reason for providing the type of alternative structure I am proposing.  Incidentally, there is no reason the adoption authority should not be given the entitlement to make such orders.  A constitutional amendment we made to our legislation some years ago to protect the position of the Adoption Board will equally apply to the adoption authority and creates no difficulty in making this sort of order.  The other reason for providing an alternative structure is to protect the role, in certain circumstances, of natural fathers.  Natural fathers may not have difficulty with a husband of a biological mother acquiring rights to a child in circumstances in which the natural father has maintained contact with and has some access to the child, provided his identity as biological and legal father is not extinguished.  By being able to make a guardianship order, one preserves the identity of the biological father as the father of the child while conferring rights on the husband that are to the benefit of the child in a parenting context.  For this to happen, the same structure as applies with regard to seeking consents from the natural father would apply and if there was a dispute about this, ultimately it may well be that the District Court could otherwise have to deal with the matter.</P>
        <P>I make no excuse for quoting from the most recent annual report of the Adoption Board, which is from 2008.  I made mention of the report a moment ago.  The issue comes back to the statistics to which I referred.  Paragraph 1.2 states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The Board received 224 family adoption applications in 2008 compared to 229 such applications in 2007.  Most family adoption applications are made in step-parent situations where a natural mother has a child outside of marriage and she subsequently marries a man who is not the natural father of the child.  The natural mother and her husband apply jointly to adopt the child into their marriage. In such circumstances, the natural mother gives up her sole legal rights and responsibilities in respect of her child and both she and her husband take on joint legal rights and responsibilities in respect of the child.</P><Col N="432" />
        <P LI="1" el="5">As noted in previous Annual Reports, it remains the Board&rsquo;s view that the procedure outlined above is not always ideal in step-parent situations.  The Board considers that some other legal means should be devised to establish the rights and responsibilities of a natural mother&rsquo;s husband without extinguishing the rights and responsibilities of the natural father.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="0">Twenty years of reports have said this.  During that period, we have had six or seven Ministers with responsibility for children in different administrations.  This is the first so-called comprehensive Adoption Bill we have had in 20 years, as opposed to Bills tinkering with issues the Government of the day has been forced to address as a consequence of court decisions or the 1991 Private Members&rsquo; Bill that I sponsored which, for the first time, prescribed rules for the recognition of foreign adoptions.  This is the first Bill dealing in a comprehensive way with domestic adoption issues.</P>
        <P>I do not understand the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply.  It is disingenuous and I intend to press the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The circumstance Deputy Shatter has raised is not adoption.  It is described in the various annual reports of the Adoption Board and is a situation in which the rights of the natural father are not extinguished, which is how we understand adoption in this country.  The Deputy is seeking another legal mechanism and while I do not disagree with the view of the Adoption Board in this matter, this is not appropriate legislation for introducing such a mechanism.  This Bill relates to adoption, which is understood in Ireland to be the extinguishment of the legal rights of natural parents in circumstances in which adoption is effected.  While I agree with the Deputy&rsquo;s general sentiments, it is wrong to assume that this legislation is the correct vehicle to make the proposed change.</P>

The related amendment, amendment No. 8, proposes to insert in page 16, line 26, after &ldquo;1991&rdquo; the following : &ldquo;by a person or couple habitually resident or domiciled in the State where the adoption was effected&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>These two technical amendments try to ensure that adoptions effected outside the State by persons who are properly resident outside the State are registered and recognised in the State and that no difficulty arises under this legislation.  We discussed this issue at some length on Committee Stage.  I note the Minister of State has some related amendments and do not intend to talk at any great length about these two but would like to hear what he has to say about the amendments he has tabled.</P>

	<P>Amendment No. 31 in this grouping is in my name and seeks to deal with the same issue.  Many people live outside the State for a number of years.  They settle down and decide they want to have children and may subsequently adopt.  When they come back to Ireland they want to have their family appropriately recognised.  I believe the Minister of State has accepted the intention behind my amendment and that he covers it adequately in amendment No. 70.  However, I would still like to move my amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Amendment No. 7, if included in the Bill, would exclude applicants who are resident in Ireland who have effected an adoption order in another jurisdiction before the establishment day which may be recognised by the Adoption Authority.  The amendment merely makes specific provision with regard to persons who at the time of the making of the adoption order were ordinarily resident, domiciled or habitually resident in the state where the adoption was effected.  The definition of intercountry adoption effected outside the State at (<i>a</i>) in that definition in the Bill as drafted covers all categories of adoption in respect of which <Col N="435" />applications to the authority can be made and adoptions recognised by the authority in accordance with section 57 of the Bill, provided the adoption conformed with the definition of foreign adoption in section 1 of the 1991 Act, as amended, and is certified by a certificate issued by the competent authority of the state of adoption as having been effected under and in accordance with the law of that state and is not contrary to our public policy.</P>
        <P>On amendment No. 8, the definition with regard to paragraph (<i>b</i>) of the definition of intercountry adoptions effected outside the State covers, as drafted, domestic adoptions, as it were, effected in other jurisdictions following the establishment day.  These adoptions, in accordance with section 57, may be recognised by the Adoption Authority.  Amendment No. 70 in this grouping is a Government amendment to section 57.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 31 is in the name of Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan.  Section 20 of the Bill includes provision for the Adoption Authority to recognise an intercountry adoption effected outside the State.  The definition provided in section 3(1) of the Bill covers the circumstances set out in the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment.</P>
        <P>I have also brought forward a Government amendment to section 57(<i>b</i>)(i) which clarifies that in the case of an intercountry adoption effected outside the State, as referred to in paragraph (<i>b</i>) of the definition in section 3, the adopter or adopters must be habitually resident in the State, &ldquo;habitually resident&rdquo; being the crucial term.  I have introduced amendment No. 52 to ensure consistency with the definition of intercountry adoption in section 3 and with article 23 of the Hague Convention, which provides that an adoption certified by the competent authority of the state of adoption, as having been made in accordance with the convention, shall be recognised by another contracting state.  Section 33(5) should only refer to adoption orders made by the Adoption Authority and I have brought forward this amendment to delete the reference to intercountry adoption in this subsection.</P>
        <P>The purpose of amendment No. 70 is to make it clear that in the case referred to in paragraph (<i>b</i>) again, parents must be habitually resident in the state in which the adoption is effected at the time the adoption order is made.</P>
        <P>For clarity, the Attorney General has given specific advice on the question of habitual residence.  It is his considered view that it is the term that is most commonly used and is the matter for the authority to consider from time to time.  It is analogous to the concept of domicile and will be for the authority to determine according to public policy.</P>

	<P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 17, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5" FLI="0">&ldquo;&ldquo;welfare&rdquo; means the physical, emotional, social, intellectual, moral and religious welfare of the child.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">There is a strange anomaly in the Bill.  We discussed this amendment on Committee Stage, but the Minister opposed it, although I cannot understand why.  There is reference to the welfare of the child in various parts of the legislation.  In the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 there is also a reference to the welfare of the child as being the first and paramount consideration in dealing with issues relating to children.  Section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 imposes an obligation on the courts to regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration in resolving various issues relating to the guardianship and custody of children and the definition section of that Act contains a definition of the concept of welfare.  That definition is just applicable to the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964.</P>
        <P>This Adoption Bill refers to &ldquo;welfare&rdquo; but does not define it.</P>
        <P>The only change that has occurred since 1964 came about during the debate on what became the Child Care Act 1991, when I proposed that the definition of welfare should include a reference to emotional welfare.  In the 1964 Act, welfare is said to mean physical, social, intellectual, moral and religious welfare.  I recall that I proposed the amendment of the 1991 legislation to include the word &ldquo;emotional&rdquo;.  My recollection is that my proposal was accepted.  If it was not included in the 1991 Act, then it was accepted in the context of the Committee Stage debate on some later item of children&rsquo;s legislation in which I was involved.</P>
        <P>Amendment No. 10 proposes that we should define welfare, in the definitions section of the Bill before the House, as referring to the physical, emotional, social, intellectual, moral and religious welfare of the child.  When one is referring to the concept of welfare in legislation, one must define what one means by that concept.  We cannot leave it to the courts to state that the legislation before us, which will become the Adoption Act 2010, does not define the concept.  At some point, a judge may state that the concept of child welfare is not defined in this legislation and that, therefore, the definition contained in the 1964 Act should be assumed to apply.  Alternatively, he or she might decide to take the definition as being contained in the corpus of child care legislation at the point where the word &ldquo;emotional&rdquo; is used.</P>
        <P>I do not understand why the Minister of State opposed this amendment on Committee Stage.  If I am wrong in my recollection that emotional welfare is not yet referred to in statute, that is fine.  However, it should be so referred to.  In 1964, people tended to regard the religious welfare of children as being somewhat more important than their emotional welfare.  It has now been established that a failure to protect a child&rsquo;s emotional welfare is likely to cause greater damage than a failure to ensure his or her religious observance.</P>
        <P>I propose that the amendment be accepted.  I would have thought that out of all the amendments tabled in respect of the Bill, the Minister of State would have acceded to this one.  I cannot understand why he would oppose it.  I hope the matter has been given further consideration since Committee Stage.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 25 states, &ldquo;it shall be presumed, unless the contrary is shown that the welfare of the child is best promoted in the society of either or both of the child&rsquo;s natural parents, if either or both of them wish to exercise that role&rdquo;.  There should be an assumption in the Bill that a child would be better off with his or her natural parents, unless there are reasons this should not be the case.  This matter was discussed on Committee Stage <Col N="437" />and the amendment in my name allows for an assumption to be made that a child&rsquo;s natural parents are the best people to rear him or her.  However, the amendment would still leave open the possibility to argue that this might not be best for the child.</P>
        <P>If provision can be so made, it is best that children be raised by their natural parents.  Issues such as money, etc., should not be given priority over the fact that his or her parents actually brought him or her into the world.  This is an important principle and it should be contemplated in the Bill.  As already stated, it could be overridden if there is a good argument in favour of deciding otherwise.  I urge the Minister to consider the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>In respect of amendment No. 10 in the name of Deputy Shatter, section 3 was brought forward from the 1952 Act, in which welfare was not defined.  Thus, in the Bill before the House welfare will be interpreted in accordance with precedent and the rules of statutory interpretation.  By not defining it, we are giving the term its ordinary and broadest meaning, which encompasses all aspects of the welfare of a child.  Welfare is not defined in the Child Care Act 1991 or the Children Act 2001.  It is, however, defined in the Guardianship of Infants Act.</P>
        <P>I reiterate the point I made on Committee Stage in respect of Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s amendment, namely, that section 19 relates to making arrangements for the adoption of a child or for the recognition of an inter-country adoption outside the State after the decision has been taken by the child&rsquo;s birth parent or guardian that he or she is to be adopted so the placement has occurred and the adoption is now being sought.  In these circumstances, a child&rsquo;s parent or guardian will have already made the decision that his or her best interests are served by his or her being placed for adoption.  For that reason, the amendment cannot be accepted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I suspect that we should bring this procedure to an end by accepting the Government&rsquo;s amendments.  We could then all go home and not waste the public&rsquo;s time or our time for that matter.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State&rsquo;s explanation is that because it never occurred to anyone to define, in the 1952 Act, the concept of welfare, we will not define it in 2010.  That is the totality of his explanation.  Somebody thought of doing it in 1964, some 12 years after the original legislation was enacted.  Whomever was responsible for drafting what became the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964 could have stated that the concept of welfare was not defined in 1952 and asked if there was really a need to bother framing such a definition at that point.  It was important that someone bothered to arrive at a definition because the Circuit Court, the High Court and the Supreme Court handed down a series of judgments on how the concept of welfare should be applied under the 1964 Act.</P>
        <P>Section 19 states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In any matter, application or proceedings before&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(<i>a</i>) the Authority, or</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(<i>b</i>) any court,</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5" FLI="0">relating to the question of the arrangements for the adoption of a child, for the making of an adoption order or for the recognition of an intercountry adoption outside the State, the Authority or the court, in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Minister of State indicated that welfare has not been defined because it is a broad concept and that the matter will be left to the courts to decide according to case law.  I challenge him <Col N="438" />to supply the definition the courts have attached in case law to the concept of welfare under adoption legislation.  Is it any different to that provided under the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964?  Has some unique, broader concept been invented by a judge?  That would be an interesting explanation to receive.</P>
        <P>The concept of welfare that I propose to be included in the Bill is consistent with our existing statutory provisions.  In addition, it gives a recognition to the emotional welfare of a child.  That is important in the context of determining issues&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 18, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not rise to the Deputy&rsquo;s provocation.  The purpose of sections 4 and 5 of the Bill is to ensure that agencies involved in the making of arrangements for <Col N="439" />adoption are registered in the register of accredited bodies.  Deputy Shatter put down an amendment in regard to section 5 on Committee Stage and I acknowledged the point he made, namely, that there is a risk that simply providing legal advice in regard to adoption may result in the commission of an offence.  The same might apply in regard to transferring a child to the State which is not the intent of these provisions, as explained on Committee Stage.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the amendment to section 5 is to make certain that perfectly legitimate activities are not caught by the definition, rendering those activities unlawful.  The purpose of the amendment to section 147 is to clarify that only accredited bodies may make arrangements for the adoption of a child and that the courts shall have regard to the carrying out of those activities which are being deleted from section 5 and brought into section 147.  These are the matters set out in sections 4 and 5 for the purpose of determining whether a person or body has contravened the Act by making arrangements for the adoption of a child.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not fully understand amendment No. 97 which relates to section 147 and deals with the prosecution of offences.  Subsection 147(1) provides that an accredited body will be guilty of offences if it contravenes provisions under various sections of the Bill, while subsection (2) deals with further offences that a person may commit.  I pointed out on Committee Stage that given the way the Bill is drafted, there may be a liability for anybody giving legal advice to a person seeking to find out the legal background position with a view to effecting an inter-country adoption.  This means that a solicitor giving legal advice in good faith or an airline or travel agency that sells a ticket to a person intent on inter-country adoption could be prosecuted.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State seems to have taken on board that the provisions in this area were poorly drafted and created various perils that should not exist.  I am not really sure how amendment No. 97 works.  I welcome the deletion of certain provisions, which clearly takes account of what was said on Committee Stage.  However, amendment No. 97 is a strange provision, providing that in determining whether somebody can be prosecuted for a particular offence, the court shall have regard to a whole series of matters which appear no longer to make them liable to a criminal offence.  I do not understand how that will work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 97 refers to section 147, which states that in determining for the purposes of subsection (2) whether a person has contravened section 125, the court shall have regard to the matters set out in sections 4 and 5, and also to whether the person did any or all of the following, namely, prepared documentation to assist any prospective adopter habitually resident in the State, or provided assistance to any prospective adopter habitually resident in the State in relation to any legal matter.  It determines some of the criteria that were raised as issues of concern.  The purpose of the amendment is to clarify that only accredited bodies may make arrangement for the adoption of a child and to clarify that the court shall have regard to the carrying out of those activities which are being deleted in section 5 and brought into section 147.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendment No. 97 refers to the determination of the courts as to whether a person &ldquo;provided assistance to any prospective adopter habitually resident in the State in relation to any legal matter that arose in the state of origin of the child concerned and relates to the effecting of the adoption in that state&rdquo;.  Does this not again suggest that if a person is effecting an adoption outside the State and he or she seeks legal assistance in regard to any matter relating to it, then the person who provides that legal assistance will be criminalised?  I am sorry if I do not understand it but this provision seems merely to be inserting the existing provision in a different place.  It does not specify that giving legal advice will not be an offence.  Rather, it seems to suggest that in determining whether one is guilty of an <Col N="440" />offence or not, the courts will have regard to whether one was giving legal assistance.  By implication, giving legal assistance is an offence or is not an offence; I do not know what the intent is but I can certainly see this provision producing substantial litigation if anybody is ever prosecuted under it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>To clarify, I mentioned that this section is to be read with section 125.  Subsection 125(1) states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">A person shall not&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(<i>a</i>) make or attempt to make an arrangement for the adoption of a child,</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(<i>b</i>) for the purpose of having a child adopted&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">(i) retain the child in the person&rsquo;s custody, or</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">(ii) arrange to have the child retained in the custody of another person, or</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(<i>c</i>) take part in the management or control of a body of persons which exists wholly or partly for the purpose of making arrangements for adoption.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In other words, it lists the criteria to which the court shall have regard in the case of offences under section 125.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">We addressed this issue on Committee Stage.  There is a definition of &ldquo;father&rdquo; in different places in the Bill but this section has a particularly odd definition, namely, that for the purposes of this Part, &ldquo;&rdquo;father&rdquo;, in relation to a child, includes a person who believes himself to be the father of the child&rdquo;.  There could be three or four people all believing themselves to be the father of a child under this provision.  The definition of &ldquo;father&rdquo; contained elsewhere in the legislation, which refers essentially to the biological father of the child, is an adequate definition for the purpose of the Bill.  This is a bizarre, esoteric definition that is liable to give rise to all types of problems and difficulties and should be deleted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Several of these amendments are in my name.  Amendment No. 17 proposes that the birth should be registered prior to placement for adoption.  That is in some way a separate issue to that addressed in the other amendments which deal with the father.  It is an extraordinary omission that the birth does not have to be registered before the placement for adoption.  Deputy Shatter&rsquo;s amendment seeks to address the definition in the Bill of &ldquo;father&rdquo; as a person who believes himself to be the father.  What I am trying to achieve in my amendments is that the father&rsquo;s name be registered.</P>
      
        <P>The only time a father would not be registered is when the mother has completed a statutory declaration to the effect that the father is unknown, missing or cannot be traced.  The related amendments also deal with this issue.  I do not believe we should write out of history fathers of children who are being put up for adoption as if they do not matter because there are consequences to doing so.  The consequences of this are that fathers believe they do not matter, as is the case in many other situations.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I have been a feminist for a long time and I believe in women&rsquo;s rights.  However, fathers&rsquo; rights are being consistently walked on in this State.  This legislation virtually ignores the rights of the natural father.  It states that a father can be consulted but that he does not have any real say whatsoever in his own child being put up for adoption, which I believe is wrong.  In the same way as we look back now and wonder how 30 or 40 years ago we in this society allowed women to be walked on, we will look back in years to come and wonder how we ignored fatherhood or considered it to be unimportant.  These amendments are about valuing fatherhood.  While a father might not want to know or be interested in his child&rsquo;s adoption, that fact should be at least recorded and considered to be important.  Where a father wants to be involved, that, too, should be considered important.  This should be facilitated in this legislation.</P>
        <P>These amendments are about challenging the type of assumptions we make.  I am often visited in my clinic by people who have written out fathers from the lives of their children.  Often these are fathers who have fathered many children with different mothers.  We are in this legislation seeking to be child centred.  A child has a right to a natural father and natural mother.  We will not achieve all of these cultural changes of which I speak in one piece of legislation.  However, we need to acknowledge this issue in this legislation and to begin to redress the balance so that we consider fatherhood to be important, not alone well-heeled middle class educated fathers but all fathers.  Unfortunately, this is not the reality.</P>
        <P>I referred earlier to an article by Mr. John Waters in last week&rsquo;s <i>The Irish Times</i> in which he describes a situation in which two people meet and discover they have the same natural <Col N="442" />father and the huge dilemmas this causes.  The reality is that in Irish society this could happen relatively easily.  While I accept this legislation will not address all of those issues, it needs to acknowledge that a natural father is not someone that can be ignored.  As Deputy Shatter stated in regard to his amendment anybody can claim to be the natural father of a child and be given some kind of credence.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>On the first amendment from Deputy Shatter to delete the words &ldquo;a person who believes himself to be the father&rdquo;, the section is designed to allow for a situation where a dispute arises in regard to paternity, which is not unusual in certain circumstances, so that every person who believes himself to be the father can involve himself in the process.  On amendment No. 17, the Civil Registration Act requires the parents to give to the Registrar of Births the particulars of the birth and to sign the register of births not later than three months following the birth.  The accredited bodies ensure as far as possible that the child&rsquo;s birth is registered prior to adoption.  It is an offence not to register the birth within the required timeframe.  </P>
        <P>In general, the Bill is designed to strengthen rather than weaken fathers&rsquo; rights.  For the first time, the authority will be required to obtain the approval of the High Court before authorising an accredited body to place a child for adoption or to allow an adoption order without consulting the father.  Similarly, where the mother states that she is unable to identify the child&rsquo;s father, the High Court&rsquo;s approval is required before the child is placed.  This puts the father in a much stronger position than heretofore.</P>
        <P>Section 30 provides that if the authority is satisfied that it would be inappropriate for the father to be consulted, the High Court&rsquo;s approval is required before the adoption order can be made.  These provisions are included in recognition of fathers&rsquo; rights in the adoption process.  They reflect more recent judgments in the European Court of Human Rights and of the High Court on related issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Amendments Nos. 22, 23 and 24 which are being taken in conjunction with amendment No. 16 relate to a different issue in terms of the definition of father.  The Minister appears to believe that in interposing the High Court into all of this he is giving additional protection to fathers.  This legislation seeks to ensure, in compliance with our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights and basic human values, that where fathers are involved with their children, they should be notified.  Even where they are not involved with their children they should be notified and should be given an opportunity to be heard.  </P>
        <P>There are certain special circumstances &mdash; the Bill uses the words &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo; &mdash; where fathers may not be notified, for example, a biological father may not be notified where a child has been conceived as a consequence of rape.  There may be other circumstances such as the whereabouts of the father not being known and as such he cannot be notified.  I do not understand, in circumstances where we have had an adoption board for many years, a system that is entirely different from the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland systems, why, when we are to have an adoption authority dealing uniquely with adoption, we are superimposing the High Court into all of this in the manner the Minister now proposes through this legislation.  I do not see this as providing additional protection for fathers&rsquo; rights.  I believe it will prolong unnecessarily the process because the adoption authority, as a body with limited judicial functions, can address that issue quite properly.  It appears to me that it will now have to deal with the issue on a preliminary basis following which the High Court will be asked to deal with it.  I do not see the purpose in this duplication.  At a time when we are <Col N="443" />trying to focus resources to the benefit of children in terms of protection and when the HSE is in large parts of the country incapable of processing adoption assessments within a reasonable period, we are going to divert public expenditure to create problems in a large number of cases in respect of which currently no High Court applications are required.  Essentially, these will be family adoptions.  In the majority of domestic adoptions, to which I made reference previously, we are not alone going to superimpose the High Court but the Chief State Solicitor&rsquo;s Office, junior counsel and, possibly, senior counsel will be involved.  This will create a money trail all the way to the Bar, the Law Library, for no reason.  I do not say this to be in any way critical of anybody in the Bar.  There are occasions when adoption matters do come before the courts.  It is often necessary for them to come before the courts and they can be difficult, contentious and distressing.</P>
        <P>This provision is bringing into the courts an area of adoption that has not up to now required the involvement of the court system.  As I pointed out, 64% of adoptions that took place in 2008 were family adoptions and 79% of applications received in 2008 were in respect of family applicants.  Those statistics involved families where, in all but three instances, it was the biological mother adopting with a husband.  In the other three instances, it was the biological father adopting with a wife, the husband and wife in each example not being the biological parent.</P>
        <P>In the context of many family adoptions, this provision will automatically create a trail of 50 or 100 cases being brought to the High Court.  Based on the information available to him in the Adoption Board, has the Minister of State assessed, for example, that if this provision was in place in 2008, how many of the adoptions of this nature effected in 2008 would have first required an application to the High Court?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not suggesting that a father has any particular rights in the case of rape or in the case where he went out of the mother&rsquo;s life the day after conception.  The balance of the rights in this section and in later sections, to which my further amendments relate, treat a child&rsquo;s right to have a father as something trivial and that is not available to all children.  That is fundamentally wrong.  I am aware Deputy Lynch is neutral in this respect in the context of her role as Acting Chairman but she produced a Bill on a related matter.</P>
        <P>I repeat my earlier point that in 20 years time we will probably look back and ask ourselves what were we doing when we ignored fatherhood to the extent that we have did in practices at this time .  That is very much the case in this Bill.  I would like the Minister of State to take this point seriously.</P>
        <P>Having listened to Deputy Shatter and having regard to the issues we have been teasing out this afternoon and that we teased out in committee, this Bill on coming into law will have to be reviewed in the not too distant future to assess how it is working.  There are a number of areas of serious concern that may well cause difficulty.  I ask the Minister of State to consider that point.  The first of my amendments in this grouping deals with the fact that a birth does not have to be registered in advance of adoption.  Am I correct in that?  If I am, that seems to be a serious omission in the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">These matters are already before the court.  What generally happens, as the Deputies will be aware, is that the father will have to seek an order quashing an adoption order to enable him to be properly consulted if the adoption authority has dispensed with the right of the father to be consulted, which is a rare enough occurrence.  If we leave matters as they are under the old system an applicant would have to go to the High Court and an applicant might decide to challenge a case, say, two or three years following a step-parent adoption.  It will be rare that this would happen, but is it not better to have these matters properly thrashed out at the earliest possible occasion?  Is it not better to put the child at the centre of the issue?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="444" />
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>That will mean that every one of those cases will be brought to court.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There will not be that many of them.  It is a fairly simple exercise for the authority to consider.  In the vast majority of cases there will not be an issue.  As long as we leave matters are they are under the old system, where a real substantive issue arises, it will be dealt with in a certain way, as occurred in a case of a man who was in jail for two or three years but he had known his children at a very early part of their lives and the adoption order has already been effected.  If one were to put the child at the centre of that equation, one would say that the better solution would have been to require the Adoption Board to refer the matter to the High Court for the issue to be properly assessed as early as possible in the life of the child to ensure that the child&rsquo;s best interests would be served in the process rather than any considerations about resource implications.</P>
        <P>With regard to the point raised by Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan regarding a birth certificate, section 22 of the Civil Registration Act provides that the father of a child who was not married to the mother of the child at the date of his or her birth or at any time during the period of ten months before such birth shall not be required to give information about the birth.  The registrar shall enter the father&rsquo;s details in the register if the mother and father jointly request this or on the production to the registrar of a court order or statutory declaration naming the father of the child.  No legal rights accrue to the father by being named in the birth certificate.  The father has to apply for and be granted guardianship under the Act in order for his consent to an adoption to be required.  We do not wish to do anything in this legislation that might discourage fathers from agreeing to their name being included on the child&rsquo;s birth certificate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Section 18(4) provides that:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Where, on an application by an accredited body that proposes to place a child for adoption, the Authority [that is the Adoption Authority] is satisfied that, having regard to&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(<i>a</i>) the nature of the relationship between the father and mother, or</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">(<i>b</i>) the circumstances of the conception of the child,</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5" FLI="0">it is inappropriate for the accredited body to contact the father in respect of the placement of the child&mdash;</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">(i) the Authority, after first obtaining the approval of the High Court, may authorise the accredited body to place the child for adoption, and</P>
        <P LI="3" el="5">(ii) at any time after being so authorised, the accredited body may place the child for adoption.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">The adoption authority will first have to be satisfied that because of the nature of the relationship between the father and the mother or the circumstances of the conception the father should not be contacted.  Having made that decision, the adoption authority will then have to ask the High Court for a decision.  On what basis will the High Court make its decision?  There is little guidance in the section for the High Court.  A notice cannot be served on the father to get his view on it because that defeats the purpose of it.  What is the point in this duplicatory procedure?  What will the High Court know that the adoption authority will not know?  What mysterious information will suddenly descent on the lap of the High Court judge?  The High Court will only know what the adoption authority knows.  On what basis is the High Court to disagree with the adoption authority?  If the mother were to swear an affidavit about something that occurred relating to the nature of her relationship with the father, would that be enough? <Col N="445" /> Is the biological mother to be put in the witness box?  Is a mother who is stressed over the fact that she is placing a child for adoption &mdash; let us assume it is not a family adoption but a third party adoption &mdash; the mother who is stressed about the adoption can deal with an accredited agency informally, can fill out the forms correctly?  Is that mother to be thrown by the High Court into the witness box?  She will be told that if she wants her child adopted and if she does not want us to communicate with the father, even if the father raped her, she will have to go to the High Court and get into the witness box and explain that to the High Court judge.  Why are we going to put biological mothers through that?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I very much appreciate and agree with the view of Deputy O'Sullivan that on occasions we have not properly respected fathers&rsquo; rights.  However, this is not about respecting rights of fathers, this is about superimposing an additional court hearing that is not necessary, subjecting a biological mother to it in circumstances where we have not done so to date, adding nothing of value to the process because all the High Court will know is what the adoption authority knows.  At least if the adoption authority is dealing with it, there will be some consistency, but with the High Court, there can be a revolving system with different judges sitting in the High Court every few weeks.  A different judge may take a different view as to what circumstances are appropriate.  How do we provide consistency?  Is there any guarantee that there will be written published judgment about this so that one judge is guided by a decision made by a previous judge.  All these cases will be heard <i>in camera</i>.  What detailed types of hearings will take place?  Will the High Court, for example, direct that if an application is made to it some lawyer should be appointed <i>amicus curiae</i> to the court to argue the opposite case as to the why the father should be told just so the judge hears a balanced argument?</P>
        <P>I do not think this has been teased out.  I am not saying this to be awkward.  It will add stress to mothers placing children for adoption.  In the context of family adoptions of the type I described, this will create difficulties.  It will add unnecessary expense to the process.  There will be a lack of consistency between different judges.  The legislation does not even require that the decisions delivered of this nature are published and made available and that there is sufficient detail included in them to provide guidance to, for example, social workers working in the adoption area, lawyers advising in the adoption area, counsel dealing with cases and, more important, judges to ensure there is a consistency of approach.  I believe bringing in the High Court in this respect is a serious error.  I have tabled a series of amendments to take the High Court out of the process.  I will say no more about it but I believe this is an issue that will come back to haunt this House in the future.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">In the area of domestic adoption, of which there are far fewer instances now because of the numbers of adoptions that are, essentially, family adoptions of the type I described, there has been a considerable problem.  There are cases where a mother has agreed to the placement of a child for adoption, the child is placed with prospective adopters at a very young age and starts to attach to the prospective adopters and becomes settled in their home and sometime after the placement the mother may change her mind.</P>
        <P>I take the view that a mother must be given some opportunity to change her mind, having gone through the trauma of making decisions about giving up her child.  The child may be given up by the mother who, within a few weeks, may regret deeply the decision she has made.  Therefore, there must be some degree of flexibility.</P>
        <P>However, if we are going to protect the welfare of children, children cannot become parcels transferred between natural mothers and prospective adopters.  I have been aware of cases over the years, which, though a minority, where children have been placed for adoption for a number of months, the mother has changed her mind and the child comes back to the mother.  The mother changed her mind again two or three months later and the child is again placed with the same adopters.  We had a plethora of court cases running through the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s -the numbers are fewer since 2000 &mdash; where this has given rise to a problem.</P>
        <P>I make a declaration of interest in that, as a lawyer, I have represented in the courts natural mothers on occasions and, on others, adopters in cases of this nature.  One of the difficulties mothers have on occasion when they place their children for adoption is that, having made the decision finally, the issue revisits and haunts them.  They are asked over and over again whether they agree or consent.  We need a procedure that brings a closure to the process that is in the best interests of children.</P>
        <P>I go back to the report published in 1984 in which this issue was addressed.  The issue of children and attachment has been addressed in a number of very learned books, starting from that published by Bowlby.  We now know a great deal about attachments.  When a young child aged two or three months, younger in some instances, has been placed with adopters, by the time the child reaches 12 or 13 months very serious attachments have developed.  If the child is taken out of that environment, not only can it cause short-term detrimental implications for its development, but it can create major long-term problems in the capacity of that child when an adult to form attachments and maintain them.  A great deal of study has been done in this area.</P>
        <P>In a nutshell, I propose that where a child has been placed for adoption, 12 months after the placement &mdash; it has to be a minimum of 12 months after the mother has agreed to place &mdash; that agreement should become irrevocable.  The mother cannot simply decide she has changed her mind.  That is to preserve the integrity of the placement in the best interests of the child, in circumstances in which the child has clearly attached to the adopters.  It also gives a reasonable timeline for the mother, having agreed to her child being placed for adoption, to consider whether she really wants that adoption to go ahead.</P>
        <P>I do not believe this should be an open-ended procedure.  On some occasions, for reasons to do with social workers falling ill or communication failures between adoption agencies and the Adoption Board, it has taken between one to three years from the time when the child was placed with adopters for the adoption to be finalised.  That is not in the best interests of children.</P>
        <P>The other amendments I tabled are related.  The first amendment deals with the issue of the agreement to place a child for adoption.  The others &mdash; perhaps the Acting Chairman will remind me of their numbers so that I can find them.</P>

	<P>Amendments Nos. 42 and 43.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The other amendments deal with the issue of consent.  Our process of adoption is a two-prong one when it comes to domestic adoptions.  The mother signs an agreement to place, the child is placed with the adopters and after a reasonable period of time has elapsed and all assessments as to how the child is getting on have been completed, the mother is then asked to sign what is termed the final consent.  Even after the final consent is signed she can still change her mind but it is only after the final consent is signed that the Adoption Board make the adoption order.  My proposal states that where there is a final consent, it may be withdrawn within four months of being given but it shall be irrevocable thereafter.  There would not be an open-ended period.  </P>
        <P>The final consent comes after the agreement to place.  I suspect, frankly, that if the Minister of State was willing to accept the amendment with regard to the agreement to place we might not need the second amendment.  On the basis that he probably will not accept the first amendment, I tabled the second one in any case so that the consent issue and the entitlement to withdraw a consent already given are not open-ended.  It must be borne in mind that by the time four months have passed after the so-called final consent, which is a euphemism because it is not final until the adoption order is made, a minimum period of at least 12 months and possibly two to three years will have elapsed since the agreement to place.  Very often it is 18 months.</P>
        <P>I suggest that we should not have open-ended agreements and consents, all of which can be revoked, regardless of the time that passes.  One of the reasons that adoptions have been delayed on occasions has been simply because mothers have disappeared and consent has not been signed.  That prolongs the issue of the agreement.  If a mother disappears, she needs to know that after 12 months her agreement cannot be revoked.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I oppose the amendments on the basic principle that consent to adoption must be given freely.  The period of 12 months selected by Deputy Shatter is absolutely right.  It is a very long period in the life of an infant.  As the Deputy noted, a great deal of work has been done on the issue of attachment to carers which occurs very quickly in the early years of life.  Later on in life 12 months is not such a long period and when an adoption occurs at the age of five or six, 12 months might seem slightly capricious or arbitrary.</P>
        <P>I made the point on Committee Stage and reiterate that if a child finds out later in life that the mother wanted the child back after 12 months, perhaps because there had been reasons of an episode of depression or infirmity of some sort that took her out of the picture, if she comes back and expresses a wish not to place the child after all, it would be very tough to explain that to a child in subsequent years.  There could have been an episode of depression or infirmity of some sort that took the mother out of the picture.  If she returns and expresses a wish not to place the child after all, it would be very tough to explain to a child in subsequent years.</P>
        <P>The points Deputy Shatter makes are genuine and come from his experience in practice.  He detailed problems in prolonged periods for different reasons, with consent being withdrawn.  For example, he spoke about consent being withdrawn with the mother disappearing for a period or going overseas.  It is for that reason that section 31 allows a scenario where a person with whom a child is placed for adoption can apply to court for an order dispensing with consent.  That is trying to safeguard the issue raised by Deputy Shatter.</P>
        <P>Equally, section 26 provides that the requirement for the mother or guardian consent to the making of an adoption order may be dispensed with in certain circumstances.  However, the adoption authority must again obtain High Court approval before dispensing with such consent.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I rise to support Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s amendment.  What she is proposing in this amendment is reflective of one of the core objectives of the children&rsquo;s referendum committee with regard to the voice of children being heard and the right of the child to be heard.  That is one of the central tenets of what we have agreed on an all-party basis should be reflected in the rights of the child from the constitutional amendment that we hope to have presented to the Irish electorate in the current year.</P>
        <P>It is entirely appropriate and a requirement that this is reflected in the current legislation.  Commensurate with age and ability to offer respective views, children should be given this opportunity and that is what we hope will be achieved in conjunction with other changes in the rights of the child that we wish to see achieved in the course of this year.  I hope that as a staging post along the way to the presentation of the facilitating legislation, the Minister of State will accede to Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s proposition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill allows an exception for a child older than seven years to be adopted.  The view and practice has been that a child under that age would not understand the concept of adoption and all flowing from it.  A child may be adopted before the age of seven.  Section 24 requires the authority to give consideration to both age and understanding to a child aged seven years or more, and age and maturity are used in international conventions.  The use of the word &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; is consistent with section 24 of the Child Care Act 1991, which provides that in any proceedings relating to the care and protection of a child, a consideration having regard to age and understanding should be given to the wishes of the child.  The Adoption Board has given its view on this and argues that the word &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; in section 24 should be retained.</P>
        <P>With regard to those under seven, adoption is a profound concept.  This is one of the youngest age groups in which to statutorily allow the child&rsquo;s voice to be heard, and it is an appropriate age to ensure this happens in certain cases.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I disagree with the Minister of State.  I know many children under seven years who are well able to express their views and opinions, and who have a right in this <Col N="451" />fundamental adoption issue to have their voice heard.  I do not know why the arbitrary age of seven has been identified in the legislation.  Some children are more mature than others at that age but children tend to be well able to express themselves long before they reach that age.</P>
        <P>We are at a very late stage in the Bill now for the Minister of State not to be of the mind to accept the amendment.  We will not win a vote but this amendment would not cause much difficulty if accepted.  Anybody would understand what we are trying to achieve and consider it appropriate.  We cannot expect children to speak in sophisticated language but they can speak their mind.  They have strong feelings.  Certainly, any child in such a situation would have strong feelings on this matter.  I ask the Minister of State to reconsider his decision not to accept the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The critical principle is that the child must be at the centre of consideration.  For the life of me, I cannot understand why there would be any question as to the ability of children under seven years of age and certainly between the ages of five and seven years to express themselves and their views.  This should be seen as part of the natural engagements that need to occur in association with the consideration of the child&rsquo;s future.  The notion that this could happen at a remove from the child or that the child would not be engaged with it in any way is incredible.  I am a parent and do not need to remember too far back to when my children were pre-seven years old.  I have an eight year old who could offer strong opinions.  This is real.</P>
        <P>We are making a mistake, in that we are failing to complement properly a stated objective of a committee that has deliberated for some considerable time.  The right of the child to be heard is not prescriptively suggested by the children&rsquo;s referendum committee to apply to those over seven years of age.  As Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan&rsquo;s amendment suggests, the regard to the views of the child as appropriate to his or her age and understanding is crucial in the arrangements that would apply.  The amendment is reasonable and would have a practical application.  It would not only enrich, but improve the entire process.  I strongly commend it to the Minister of State.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>This section and the entirety of the legislation are governed by the principle of the best interests of the child.  The welfare of the child should be the first and paramount consideration.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Unlike Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, I do not need to remember back.  He is right about children having strong views at a young age, but I submit that sections 23 and 24 are read together.  Section 24 provides an exception to the rule that a child must be not more than seven years of age to allow for adoption.  In those circumstances, it is obligatory that consideration be given to the wishes of the child.  Arguably, the amendment would allow for circumstances in which an eight, nine or ten year old might not be consulted because there would be greater vagueness in terms of the discretion of the authorities to consult.  Section 24 makes the obligation mandatory in respect of all children over seven years of age.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>Lest there be any doubt, I am not proposing to delete anything from section 24.  I am proposing the addition of something.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>Fair enough.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not trying to reduce the rights of children over seven years of age in any way.  Rather, I am trying to include the rights of children aged less than seven years.</P>
        <P>According to the Minister of State, the Bill is about the best interests of the child, but adults can sometimes believe they are acting in those interests without listening to the child.  If the <Col N="452" />child has something to say, his or her opinion should be a part of the consideration of what is in his or her best interests, which is the fundamental aim of this amendment.  The more I listen to the Minister of State, the more I am convinced my amendment is necessary.  Six year olds have a lot to say about what they think and feel about things.  I do not see why there is a paternalistic view to the effect that, if a child is under seven years of age, he or she does not know what to think and that someone else should act in the child&rsquo;s best interests without what the child has to say forming part of the judgment.  I will be pressing the amendment.</P>

	<P>Amendment No. 27 arises out of Committee Stage proceedings.  Amendments Nos. 27 and 84 to 87, inclusive, are related and will be taken together.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I move amendment No. 27:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 24, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(2) In order to vindicate the welfare of the child referred to in this section, the State shall support the provision of comprehensive post adoption specialised services that respect the child&rsquo;s best interests.&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">My party and I feel strongly on this section and I will press the amendment to a vote.  The matter is essentially that of post-adoption services, tracing and the rights of people who have been adopted to know about their backgrounds, to know they are adopted and to have their birth certificates stored and provided in the same way as every other citizen.  It is about a statutory tracing system as opposed to the non-statutory system currently in place.  We have argued this point in detail on Committee Stage, but the only argument the Minister of State has given us against supporting these amendments is that he intends to produce separate legislation to address the issues.  I disagree with his decision.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill before the House is substantial adoption legislation.  The Bill implements the Hague Convention and adds it to the old adoption legislation that has been on the Statute Book for many years.  The discussion around this Bill began in 2003, at which time there was widespread consultation.  I have some of the papers from the Adoption Rights Alliance and other bodies with me.  The minutes of meetings held at the time clearly indicate that the intention was to include this matter in the Bill, not to introduce separate legislation.  I accept that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and not the current Minister of State was in office at the time, but the former indicated the interests concerned during the consultation process that these issues would be addressed in this Bill.  They are in despair because the provisions have not been included in this legislation and people do not believe the area will be dealt with in a reasonable timeframe.  They believe they will need to wait for years more before this mechanism and its various elements are put in place.</P>
        <P>People who are adopted need to have available to them as much information as possible.  They need to be able to find out about themselves.  We have heard of the various issues concerning medical records and so on, but this is fundamentally a human rights issue.  People have a right to know about themselves and their backgrounds.  Where the current tracing mechanism is concerned, issues like mutual consent by the natural mother and the person seeking to trace his or her origins have been teased out at length and all of the interests concerned have agreed on them.  If the Minister of State included this provision in the Bill, he would not need to contend with any fundamental issues of disagreement.</P><Col N="453" />
        <P>My colleague, Deputy Burton, also wishes to address this issue.  She has a great deal of experience in this regard, so I will not go on at length about it.  That the area is dealt with is important.  It can be dealt with by means of the fairly simple language of our proposed amendments.  Long, detailed sections and subsections are not necessary.  The Bill needs straightforward language to the effect that people have a right to post-adoption services, tracing mechanisms and the storing and accessibility of their birth certificates in the same way as is the case for every other citizen.  I urge the Minister to accept the amendments that have been tabled on behalf of the Labour Party.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am moving two of these amendments jointly with Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan, as well as the stand-alone amendment No. 87.  I strongly support this group of amendments.  It is essential that the adoption authority established by this Bill promotes the development of post-adoption services and that this is understood in the widest context.  This is omitted under the functions of the authority as set out in section 96.  The authority should be tasked with promoting the development of services to assist people who were adopted to trace their birth parents.  It should also promote the development of services for people who placed children for adoption and who wish to trace them.  These are the key post-adoption services and it is important that the responsibility in respect of the adoption authority is explicit in the Bill.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is not just about everybody&rsquo;s right to get an answer to the now popular question: &ldquo;who do you think you are?&rdquo;  Yet that is also a very important part of why people feel strongly that they want to know the answer to such a question.  I am sure it has crossed the minds of many people and not just those who have been placed for adoption.  It also has other important features, such as the need that applies to me personally and to my family to know and to understand one&rsquo;s family medical history.  It is a very important area that people need and have a right to know when making all sorts of arrangements that affect their lives.  One&rsquo;s respective family medical history is a very important area to which every citizen should have an absolute entitlement.  That facilitation needs to be provided as part of post-adoption services.  It is not just about wanting to know who we may be, but also about having the critical information that can inform important decisions about ourselves and about future generations of the adopted person.</P>
        <P>This issue is at the core of the demand made by many voices at this stage, not least the Adoption Rights Alliance and other non-governmental organisations.  I again wish to support fully that demand.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan for putting forward these amendments.  They would provide a comprehensive structure in Ireland for the first time that would allow adopted people obtain information about their origins.  Much of it is a desire for family medical information for themselves and for their children.</P>
        <P>I am disappointed at the response of the Minister of State and his approach to this area.  I expected him to be a person of greater courage than he has shown to date in respect of the arrangements on post-adoption services.  There is a great deal of literature from around the world on post-adoption services, ranging from Australia and New Zealand to British Columbia and other areas, including the UK.  In these countries and regions there has long been a structured system to provide post-adoption information and it has been the norm for a long time to give children access to that information and their original birth certificate, or details of that certificate, when they become adults.  These arrangements have been studied and reported on for at least several decades.  It is very clear what they show.</P><Col N="454" />
        <P>Many people who are adopted, especially women, want to get information about their background, their parentage and their medical history from the time they are older teenagers or young adults.  This desire increases when they get married or enter into a long relationship and it increases even more when they become parents.  These are the critical points in life where people want to get information about their backgrounds.  Anyone who has been to school in the past 20 years will know from the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child that the right to information about one&rsquo;s origins and medical history is part of a fundamental set of human rights.  The Minister of State owes an explanation to this House on why Ireland continues to have a patriarchal, secretive approach to the fundamental rights of a particular group of people in Irish society.  UN conventions and international best practice endorse that entitlement to the information.</P>
        <P>Most girls who are adopted seek the information at some point.  The evidence on adopted men is different.  Many men do not want to have that information.  International studies show that men tend to want that information somewhat later, if at all.  It is the right of an adopted person to decide whether he or she wants the information.</P>
        <P>We are looking for a solid foundation which was set out by the amendments put forward by Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan.  They are not unduly prescriptive.  They are extremely sensitive to the issues affecting all of the people in the adoption process.  There are at least five people involved in the adoption process, namely, the birth parents, the adopted child and the adoptive parents.  In my experience, the majority of adoptive parents, who love their children to such a degree that it may be difficult for natural parents, for whom parenthood may come much easier, to understand how terribly important their adopted children are, completely endorse their adopted children being given this information.  The international evidence supports this.</P>
        <P>For parents who have given up their children, in some cases the fathers may never know for certain that they have been fathers.  They may know in other cases.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P Just="Left">It may have been done with their consent.  I have helped many people.  It was the custom in Ireland approximately 50 years ago that if a couple, particularly a couple from farming families, intended to get married but jumped the gun and had a baby before marriage that the baby, on the diktat of local clergy, do-gooders and busybodies, was given up for adoption because of what was deemed to be the shame associated with it.  In many cases, that couple successfully went on to marry and have other children.  One speaks to people in that situation &mdash; a child who has searched and to the parents who gave up a child &mdash; who only want reconnection to find out what happened to each other.</P>
        <P>Nobody expects a fairy story with a happy ever after ending.  A child is given up for adoption based on a decision made by a birth mother; she may have been badly advised on it but she has made the decision.  The adopted child moves on to another life, usually with very loving adoptive parents.  What we want in this legislation is recognition that this society has come of age and that like other societies we can deal with the complexities and the human intensity of this issue for all of the parties to it.  I have been helped by people in a number of the organisations referred to, including the Adopted People&rsquo;s Association and the Adoption Rights Alliance and they all have one message for the Government.</P>
        <P>We are having this debate in the context of the Ryan and Murphy reports.  We must remember that adoption here was almost exclusively designed by and dictated by the Catholic Church, and by the Church of Ireland in the case of people who were Protestant.  The churches had a somewhat negative approach to adoption.  If one reads the Oireachtas debates at the time of the Adoption Act, the big issue was whether a child would be placed in a home of the birth mother&rsquo;s faith or would he or she be potentially lost to the Catholic Church.  Various Senators <Col N="455" />spoke about the fear of strangers going into a house.  We have moved on so far from that, and the Bill and statements made by the Minister of State recognise that.</P>
        <P>This is the last step the Minister of State has to make.  In the late life of the Government &mdash; we are more than three years into its term of office &mdash; there is no way, even if the Minister of State laid siege to the Cabinet room, that he will produce another Bill that will deal with adoption in the lifetime of the 30th D&aacute;il.  I can tell him about legislation that is waiting seven years in the queue.  If he thinks his Cabinet colleagues will give him another Bill in the maximum two years left in the life of this D&aacute;il he is wrong.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to be courageous and to go with it.  I can tell him what the experience is like and I am sure others have told him.  I am one of those people and I went in to the offices when I was in my twenties.  I went in when I was getting married to ask whether a letter could go to my birth family just to say that I was getting married, that I was alive and that I was all right.  The answer was &ldquo;No&rdquo;.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The very simple position of the traditional adoption societies of all faiths was to tell one to be happy, that one was adopted, that one had two arms and legs and what more did one want.  The answer is that people want to know.  That may seem unreasonable to the people in the Department of Justice and Law Reform who ran the Adoption Board, to social workers who think they know better than people who have been adopted and, in particular, to the religious orders who still have issues with adoption arising from their role in dealing with children who in various ways ended up in institutions.  For the most part, people allowed to trace their relatives find that it gives them the information they require.  In a percentage of cases very good connections are built up with birth families.  In other cases the contact does not really work out and it is informational only.  That is life; there is no guarantee of a happy ever after.</P>
        <P>I do not generally speak about this in the House but I have listened with increasing concern for the people who contact me.  A woman contacted me last week and commented that I had been through it.  She has been diagnosed with a particular condition and she wants to know whether it is hereditary and whether other members of her birth family have suffered from it so that she can be helped with the difficulties she faces.  Under this rule and the lack of action in the Bill, it is not possible for her to proceed because although she has some contact with the birth family there is no mechanism by which to reach a conclusion.</P>
        <P>I plead with the Minister of State to take his courage in his hands and address this issue.  Other countries with an English legal tradition have done this very successfully for decades.  People who are adopted are realistic and do not expect a magic wand solution.  It is so important for children who have been adopted in recent years from overseas countries that there is absolutely full commitment, as there is in most modern adoption arrangements, to continuing reports and feedback on how the child is doing.  In open adoption there are very good arrangements for periodic contact and information sharing between the adopting family and the original birth mother and that is as it should be.  The people involved in adoption administration in Ireland, with the number of overseas adoptions in this country over the past 20 years, are perfectly familiar with these arrangements and they know how good arrangements can work very well to the benefit of everybody involved in adoption, namely the child, the adoptive parents and the birth parents.</P>
        <P>Until relatively recently it was always nuns who decided that children could not have information.  It is a product of the era of secrecy that arose through the Catholic Church&rsquo;s control of institutions and the adoption process.  We have much information from birth mothers who say their consent was not fully given and that they, if approached now, would wish to have contact and information about their birth children.  We have good models from many countries of how that can be managed and it is at the choice of the various individuals.  I have had nuns <Col N="456" />tell me, with regard to my situation and with regard to people I helped and advised, that they gave solemn oaths to mothers giving up their children.  I do not know whether they really did give solemn oaths; maybe that is what many of those nuns were made to believe, and in their time they believed it was the best thing for the children, but it is not appropriate now.  The Minister of State has it within his power to address this issue.</P>
        <P>The biggest problem in Ireland now is that we have more than 5,000 children in foster care.  Modern adoption is infinitely better than it was and because we have quasi open adoption there is a huge amount of information.  However, there is a backlog of 40,000 to 50,000 people and their parents, although many parents are now dead, and extended families who want information.  I have told the Minister of State previously that the voluntary contact register established some years ago at God only knows what cost was effectively useless.  Everybody in the country was written to and 10,000 or 12,000 people made contact with it.  That money was spent because it was available at the time.</P>
        <P>I plead with the Minister of State to address this issue now.  The business of lack of post-adoption contact in Ireland belongs to our secret past.  It is not about privacy; everybody has a right to privacy and to structures around privacy.</P>
        <P>There is a difference for many people who are adopted when it come to secrecy about some of the information that is vital to their social and health well-being.  That is the net issue.  The Minister of State should take courage from the countries where this has been handled successfully.  We have more than two or three decades of experience of that.</P>
        <P>The Minister should have a look at Mike Leigh&rsquo;s film &ldquo;Secrets and Lies&rdquo;, which is probably the best film ever made about adoption and the most famous work on the subject.  It will tell him what it is like.  It is like life itself.  It is good and bad, but that is how people live life.  They do things, they want to find out things and they want to express themselves as human beings.  The amendments tabled by Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan give that opportunity.  It is then up to the Minister of State&rsquo;s Department to have appropriate regulations and structures.</P>
        <P>This is long past being done in this country.  I am shocked that the Minister of State has not reached to do this now, because if he is telling us he will draft a Bill in a short period of time he should forget it.  That is dishonest.  We are now three years into this D&aacute;il and there is no way the Minister of State will get Government time for another Bill on adoption.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I support the amendments.  We are revisiting, yet again, an issue we discussed on Committee Stage.  In the context of the amendment, greater detail was needed to establish the type of structure we need.  The difficulty I had in drafting it was that it was going to be ruled out of order as imposing an expense on the Exchequer.  I hoped that after Committee Stage &mdash; I suppose it was a vague hope &mdash; the Minister would come back with amendments on this issue.  Really, the speakers who have spoken already have well put the position.  This is something which has been promised for years.  The Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, went through a consultative process on this as Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children.  The consultation seems to have lead us all up a cul-de-sac with no result.  </P>
        <P>I do not take seriously the Minister of State&rsquo;s promise that we will see legislation during the lifetime of this Government on this issue.  There has been a decade now of promises.  There is a whole backlog of legislation on the children&rsquo;s brief.  The Minister of State does not have a hope in hell of producing legislation this side of next Christmas on the vetting issue to allow for the use of soft information.  I hope I am proved wrong; I would be delighted to be proved wrong. However, the Joint Committee recommended that be published by December 2008 and here we are in June 2010 and we do not have it.</P><Col N="457" />
        <P>We were to have legislation to give statutory effect to the child protection guidelines.  The Minister promised we will see that Bill before the end of this year.  The reality is there is no chance of legislation on this issue.  What I do not understand, and I am sorry to repeat a constant critique of this Bill, is why major issues that have been the subject of substantial reforming recommendations over the years and pleas from the Adoption Board that they be addressed are being entirely ignored in a Bill which is consolidating legislation and, in some places, retaining in force outdated, anachronistic provisions which go back to 1952.</P>
        <P>I want to put something on the D&aacute;il record because I think it is informative.  I suppose the group of experts at the coalface, who are neither adopters nor adoptees, dealing with adoption all of the time is the Adoption Board.  Its annual report addresses this issue.  Mr. John Collins is the chief executive officer.  In page 12 of the report it states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Finally, I wish to turn to the area of adoption information and tracing, an important service for users.  The levels of demand here should serve to remind us that a modern and enlightened adoption service does not end with completion of a legal adoption process.  It is an intrinsic and immutable characteristic of adoption that many adopted people, on reaching adulthood, will enquire into their origins and will seek to trace their natural parents and other relatives, who may well be seeking to trace them.  At the end of 2008, nearly 8,000 people had registered on the National Adoption Contact Preference Register (NACPR).  New applicants continue to present each year in the hope of being matched to a relative by the Register, established in 2005.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Then he says, which is particularly important, that:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Generally, the absence of a modern legislative basis for the national information and tracing service is an obstacle to the further development of the service.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This is a statutory body, established by the Government to make adoption orders and deal with our adoption service within the limits of existing legislation who said, not just in 2008, but in earlier years as well that there was a necessity for a statutory framework to facilitate adopted persons and the biological parents of adopted persons to trace each other.</P>
        <P>Why would a Government produce an Adoption Bill that has within it 176 sections and entirely ignore that issue and re-enact legislation which is grossly inadequate and goes back to 1952?  I just do not understand why; I do not take seriously the constant promises of reform.  This is not rocket science.  This is an area which has been addressed right across the world and in our neighbouring countries.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I hope people will not accuse me of being indulgent if I quote from the fourth edition of Shatter&rsquo;s <i>Family Law</i>  published too long ago now, 11 years ago.  It deals with this issue and referred to a particular thing.  It states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In Scotland, since the introduction of adoption in 1930 adopted persons, upon attaining 17 years of age, have had the right to obtain a copy of their original birth records.  In England and Wales, adopted persons, upon attaining 18 years, had a similar right since November 1976, but those adopted before the enactment of the Children Act 1975 must first undergo counselling but they still have the right of access.  In Northern Ireland, the Adoption (Northern Ireland) Order 1987 extended to Northern Ireland the same rights to adult adoptees that they have in England and Wales except those adopted prior to the 18 December 1987 are first required to undergo counselling before they get access to birth records.</P><Col N="458" />
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This is not rocket science.  This has been addressed in all our neighbouring jurisdictions.  Someone who was adopted across the Border in Northern Ireland has substantially greater rights than one has in this State.</P>
        <P>I do not believe we comply with Article 8 of the Convention which we should comply with.  I find it beyond comprehension that this issue is not being addressed.  Other Deputies have referred to all of the reasons it should be addressed.  It is not just the issue of tracing origins or facilitating people making contact with each other.  There is the whole issue of preserving records, an issue which should have been better dealt with in this legislation.  There is the whole issue of getting health histories.  There is a broad range of issues that this Bill utterly fails to address that it should have addressed.  There is no excuse for it.</P>
        <P>Quite simply, for whatever reason, this Government and its predecessor decided that this was an issue which was too hot to handle.  They feared controversy and difficulty.  I accept there are two different groups of people involved in this and we have to be realistic.  There are biological parents, primarily mothers, to whom promises of privacy were made in a different era.  There are adopted people who want to know about their origins.  We know much more today about the importance of people knowing their origins, accessing medical information and knowing the implications of that for them for the future but the State cannot stand on the sidelines and be paralysed and do nothing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">What is even more extraordinary is that, whatever the difficulties of dealing with it historically, the legislation does not even deal with it prospectively.  This is an amendment that we will come to that I have tabled on behalf of Fine Gael.  Why does the legislation not expressly contain a provision which says anyone who is adopted in Ireland and who is the subject of a domestic adoption from the date of commencement of this legislation will at the age of 18 have an absolute right of access to his or her birth certificate?  That will not create difficulties with the court judgment that was delivered because it means any person who places a child for domestic adoption or consents to the making of an adoption order will be informed that his or her child will gain access to an adoption certificate at the age of 18.  There will be no conflict of interest and the privacy issue will not arise.  A balancing exercise will not be needed.</P>
        <P>In this day and age we have to recognise the vital interest that adopted people have in gaining access to information that could in some cases mean the difference between life and death.  Why does the legislation fail to deal adequately with the maintenance by accredited bodies of the health records of both biological parents in so far as that information can be gleaned and is available?  Instead of enacting a modern code of adoption, we are consolidating anachronistic legislation based on a value system from a bygone age which utterly failed to address the real problems we have been discussing for more than a decade.</P>

      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not for one minute believe the Minister of State or his officials are deliberately setting out to be obstructive or heartless.  They are people who live much the same lives as the rest of us.  This is why I am puzzled about what is left out of the Bill before us.</P>
        <P>I cannot understand why we are not dealing with the issues of tracing and medical records.  If we want to buy a mobile telephone, we are asked for a medical history.  Before we can open a bank account or get a loan from a credit union, we are asked about our history of heart attacks, epilepsy or diabetes and, if our parents are dead, what caused their deaths.  Why is this not the case for a child who is adopted?  All that is needed is the history and we would not even need to share names.  People are driven by the desperate need to know where they came from, their family histories and their genetic predisposition.</P><Col N="459" />
        <P>The Minister of State should reconsider this section.  If he thought about it for any length of time he would realise that the bogey men who scared us in our youth no longer exist.  The church no longer plays a dominant role in adoption or in other areas of our lives.  I have yet to meet a person, whether adoptive parent or adopted child, who would object to this provision.  Will the Minister of State explain why he is rejecting these amendments?  Where is the obstacle and who is objecting?</P>
        <P>This evening, I spoke to a group of ten women from Cork who have been following the debate on the Bill from the Visitors&rsquo; Gallery.  They thought the arguments were very clear and understandable.  One of the women, who was in her 50s, told me separately about the difficulties she faced in getting information on her adoptive parents.  She named the adoption agency involved &mdash; given that she is from Cork it would not be difficult to identify it &mdash; and told me that she fought unsuccessfully for years to retrieve the information she needed.  Who does not want that woman to know where she came from or what happened to her parents?  I am sure her parents and their family are long past caring at this stage.  The adoption agency in question no longer exists.  Clearly somebody is making the argument that people should not have information that is critical to their well-being.  As Deputy Burton correctly noted, there is no way separate legislation will be introduced before the Government falls.</P>
        <P>The last occasion this Bill was debated, I sat down with a group of people in the restaurant to discuss open adoptions, transparency and traceability of medical records.  Of the five people sitting at the table, one was adopted and another was married to an adopted man.  This is not a small issue or one which affects only a few people.  The two people in question saw no difficulty with providing medical records.  Why should they not have this information?</P>
        <P>We could put safeguards in place.  If an adopted child who turns 18 decides to trace his or her parents but the parent does not wish to make contact, protections can be given.  However, the option should remain open because someone may have an entirely different view of the world at the age of 18 or 23.</P>
        <P>What organisation or individual is preventing this from happening?  I do not believe the Minister of State or his officials woke up one morning and decided they would not allow this to happen.  Somebody made a cogent argument against this proposal and the Minister of State needs to tell us who it was.  It is interesting that seven years will be the age at which a child&rsquo;s opinion about who he or she wants to live with will be respected.</P>
        <P>I urge the Minister of State to reconsider.  Usually when we ask Ministers to amend legislation, we urge them to be brave but this matter does not even require bravery.  It is a question of saying that we need to grow up and act like adults.  Adoption is not the secret that it used to be.  It is evident in today&rsquo;s Ireland who is adopted because usually foreign adoptions are involved.  Domestic adoptions have become very rare.  People are open about fertility treatment and adopting.  Whose secret is the Minister of State keeping?  Who argued against allowing people, even those in their 50s, to know who they are?  I ask the Minister of State to reconsider his position on this issue.  It is not a case of showing bravery but one of growing up, being adult and allowing people to find out what they need to know without having to go through the awful trauma of constantly being pushed back by the organisations that have control of the information.  Those days are long gone.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am pleased to address this matter, having given it serious consideration in the course of my work on the Bill.  This issue has been used to characterise me as not having guts.  Every Deputy in the House has beaten a path to my door to raise the issue of inter-country adoption and allowing adoptions from Vietnam to proceed in the face of evidence <Col N="460" />that it would not be in the best interests of children to do so.  Despite complaints from constituents, I took a child centred decision to suspend the operation of an agreement about which a doubt had arisen.  Some of the same Deputies are now arguing in this Chamber that the issue must be considered from the other side.</P>
        <P>There are two dimensions to this issue.  In the past, our actions were governed by the stigma associated with births outside marriage and single parenthood.  Having moved on from that position, we must reflect this in legislation and I have given a commitment to do so to the best extent possible.</P>
        <P>I reject the view that the Government has not done anything since 2003.  While I do not recall the precise circumstances, a Bill introduced in 2003 was rejected out of hand by all interests in this area because it proposed to criminalise anyone who sought to breach privacy in circumstances in which a natural parent did not wish to be contacted.  Since then the national contact preference register has been established.  Fewer than 10,000 people have applied to the register.  While Deputy Burton described the register as next to useless, I am informed that the rate of matches is not dissimilar to the rates one finds in other jurisdictions, although I stand open to correction on that.</P>
        <P>In 2007, a framework was established for the national information and tracing service.  The framework was piloted throughout 2008 and as recently as last year, information about how it was working was still being gleaned.  If we are to move to statutory provision in this area, surely we must have proper information about how the contact register and information and tracing service are working with respect to all the agencies that are supposed to take advantage of it in dealing with applications for tracing.  As recently as last year, studies on the service were being completed but we have the information we need at this point.</P>
        <P>One area about which we need a little more information &mdash; I referred to this matter in committee &mdash; is tracing in the context of inter-country adoption.  The first inter-country adoptions were from Romania.  Many of the children adopted at that time are coming of age and are interested in tracing.</P>
        <P>We cannot ignore the 1998 Supreme Court judgment to which Deputy Shatter referred.  The judgment sought to balance the right to privacy against the right of an individual to know who his or her parents were.  I remember one of the judges stated that there could not be a clearer example of a case on which the right to privacy had to be adjudicated and balanced against other rights, in this case the right of a person to know his or her natural parent.  The case in question was a non-1952 adoption, an illegal adoption if one likes, and the Supreme Court ruled that the right to privacy had to be protected.  In the opinion of most commentators, a 1952 type adoption would attract even greater protection because such adoptions were completed in the manner in which we have understood adoption in this country for many years, namely, as clean break adoptions.</P>
        <P>A comparison has been made with the United Kingdom.  As Deputy Shatter noted, the UK does not share our tradition of clean break adoption and has always considered adoption in a different light.  As far back as 1975, the UK Children Act allowed for contact orders in relation to natural parents.  This provided for an open adoption situation, which could be preordained and governed by counselling in advance in order that applicants understood the consequences of meeting natural parents before a contact order could be made.  The difference between Ireland and the United Kingdom is that we never had an open adoption system.  The Supreme Court has given its judgment on how it balances constitutional rights in this area and we must <Col N="461" />respect its ruling.  We cannot legislate outside the Constitution.  The parameters have been set down by judges of the Supreme Court in this case.</P>
        <P>Deputy Burton is concerned that legislation will not start.  As I indicated, legislation was proposed in this area but rejected, although I am not familiar with the precise circumstances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, no one wants that and the legislation was correctly withdrawn.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>I am relieved to hear that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>My point is that considerable work has been done on this type of legislation.  That such legislation was introduced underlines my point that it was always our intention to introduce a separate Bill.  The legislation before us consolidates existing adoption legislation and transposes into Irish law the Hague Convention.</P>
        <P>I agree with the point made about preserving records.  In recent days, developments in the National Archive have shown that the preservation of papers is difficult.</P>
        <P>On obtaining birth certificates, the Adoption Board&rsquo;s annual report for 2005 indicated that 95% of applications for birth certificates were granted by the board.  In the case of the most recent annual report for 2008, although not all applications for birth certificates submitted in 2008 had been processed by the time the annual report was made, as far as I recall from examining the matter a couple of weeks ago, only two of approximately 100 applications were rejected in that year.  We must be careful in this respect given that birth certificates are provided in the vast majority of cases.  The Adoption Board can judge whether to proceed on the basis of the criteria set down by the Supreme Court in the 1998 case, which was an assessment and balancing of constitutional rights.  The only way to circumvent the court&rsquo;s judgment is by way of a referendum.  To go beyond the parameters of the 1998 interpretation would require more than legislation.</P>
        <P>On medical records, while I stand to be corrected on this issue, I have never seen a form which asks for details of family medical history, in other words, the medical history of one&rsquo;s parents.  I have filled out many forms which asked whether I have this, that or the other condition.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>People are asked if there is a history of certain conditions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>I have never seen such questions about parents.  As I stated, however, I stand to be corrected.</P>
        <P>I restate my commitment to legislate in this area.  With two years remaining in the life of the Government, it is pessimistic to suggest that legislation could not be completed before the end of this term.</P>
        <P>I have received e-mails from individuals who have been adopted.  Deputy Burton is correct as I have also noticed that it is primarily females who wish to look behind the privacy issue.  In the e-mails I have received from males, the correspondents are not interested in doing this as they wish to protect their relationship with their adopted parent or parents and believe it would somehow be a breach of trust to look into the issue further.  They do not want to know their natural parent.   We must respect that this group of people are silent because of the nature of what they wish to have protected.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="462" />
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not compulsory.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BarryAndrewsFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Barry Andrews</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is absolutely correct.  We want to introduce legislation to allow people to obtain the most information possible while respecting the limits set down by the Supreme Court in this area.  I have met representatives of many groups, including the groups to which Deputy Burton referred.  They are looking for very basic information.  It does not even need to be identifying information.  It is information such as the relationship the mother had with the father, how long the relationship continued and where he went.  It is basic information that gives a family history to allow someone to flesh out some questions.  It does not need to be identifying information.  This kind of basic information is what is sought as a minimum.  Very few people want to knock on the door of somebody who does not wish to be met.  I have never really come across that inclination.  I am determined to respect that in legislation.  Work has been done on it before in respect of the 2003 Bill as far as I know.</P>
        <P>The amendments before us at the moment relate to post-adoption services.  Much later we are supposed to deal with the tracing elements, including amendment No. 77 and others.  I want to address my comments to the amendments before us which relate to post-adoption services, which is quite different.  Post-adoption services are listed in Article 8.9 of the Hague Convention as being one of the matters the central authority has a duty to provide for.  Section 9 of the Bill confirms that the Hague Convention has the force of law in the State.  The central authority, the adoption authority, will have the function to ensure the promotion of post-adoption services.</P>
        <P Just="Left">At the moment the HSE has a service level agreement with Barnardos on the provision of post-adoption services.  As I said in committee, the general services available to any child here are available to adopted people in the same way.  Just as children with Asperger&rsquo;s syndrome or autism should not get ahead in the queue because of categorisation, in this case the access to services should be based on need.  We could have another debate about availability of services for children who need speech and language therapies who have attachment difficulties and have all sorts of other problems.  However, to favour one group over another would defeat the general principle that the best interest of the child should govern that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JanOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Jan O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am bewildered by that answer which does not provide clarification, particularly the last point.  Let me first deal with a factual point.  Amendment No. 86 is in this group of amendments.  That amendment states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">In page 65, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</P>
        <P LI="2" el="5">&ldquo;(<i>e</i>) promoting the development of services to assist persons who were adopted and persons who have placed children for adoption to trace one another;&rdquo;.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Tracing is in this group of amendments.  I accept it is dealt with in other amendments also.</P>
        <P>We are not saying that any of this is compulsory.  We are saying we want to enable people who want to trace and enable people who have been adopted to get the information they seek.  It is not just adopted persons or natural parents who have approached us on these issues.  Barnardos, the Council for Irish Adoption Agencies, the Children&rsquo;s Rights Alliance and the Ombudsman for Children have all argued for the right to information and tracing.  There is wide acceptance that we need to provide for this right.  I know the Minister of State argues that he wants to introduce separate legislation.  What Deputy Burton has said is true.  There is no way that will be achieved within the next two years of the life of the Government.  I was first elected to this House in 1998 and at that stage there was an intention to introduce legislation on the exchange of soft information where children were considered to be at risk.  That legislation <Col N="463" />is still on the list of promised legislation.  With the best will in the world, I do not believe the Minister of State will get these provisions into law unless he accepts the amendments presented today.  The amendments are presented in a way that avoids being prescriptive about the mechanisms that need to be used in this regard.  They are very general enabling provisions.  I cannot see any reason for the Minister of State not to accept them.</P>

        <P>We live in a very different time from the time when women were put into Magdalene Laundries in order not to cause scandal.  We locked away people who got pregnant out of wedlock.  We live in a very different world.  If the Minister of State can provide for what we request he will find that practically nobody would feel he was doing something wrong.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>I again appeal to the Minister of State to look on these amendments favourably.  For a significant body of people these represent some of the most important issues for them at this point in their lives.  In trying to understand where other people are coming from we sometimes need to pause for a moment and imagine ourselves in their shoes, and try to understand that very strong inner need to know just who we are.  That is not a major difficulty for anybody here to try to understand.  I do not believe that I, the Minister of State or anybody else here could go through life knowing that he or she was adopted without wanting to know who he or she was.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to the issues of knowledge <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> health.  There is a footprint in the sand of time in terms of our people on this island, the neighbouring island and across parts of Europe that tells us much about who we are and from where we have come.  There are significant high incidences of various conditions in the Irish physical make-up, including presentations of haemochromatosis and coeliac disease.  These are markers in time that many of our people have inherited and would not understand why they feel so fatigued and have such great difficulty in digesting certain prepared foods.  All of these matters are critical, including information on who a person is, who his or her parents were, what they experienced and know to have occurred in their respective families, and are very likely to form part of what that person is.  These are important issues for people today.</P>
        <P>It is therefore very important for us to recognise that this is not just a need, as I indicated earlier, but a right that should be included in this instance.  Just as I argued in an earlier amendment about children&rsquo;s voices being heard, for people with this strong and very understandable need, it is their right.  I warrant that this legislation is the last chance the Minister of State will have as Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs.  It is most unlikely that after the next general election he will still be in that position regardless of the make-up of Government here.  We do not see people continuing in their respective portfolios, even if it were the electorate&rsquo;s choice to allow them all to continue &mdash; pray God they do not.  However, that is a different issue.</P>

Can he give us a timeline for the legislation?</P><Col N="464" />

        <P>I would like to raise another issue that is relevant to post placement services.  Couples who have declarations of suitability who want to adopt in Russia have experienced difficulty because the Russian authorities have indicated they are closing down adoptions in Russia by prospective Irish adopters because of the failure to furnish the Russian authorities with post adoption reports on how children have been getting on with their new families.  Some of the problems and delays in this regard related to the HSE because it did not have a statutory obligation to provide these reports.  There have been reports that the Russian authorities were preventing adoptions by other countries as well, including the United States, but that has been contradicted.  It seems we are the country in difficulty.  Many prospective adopters who hoped to adopt in Russia have had an obstacle placed in their way.  There should be a statutory obligation to provide this post adoption service.  In the context of dealing with post adoption services, will the Minister of State update the House as to what contact he has had with the Russian authorities and when he thinks individuals and couples who have been deemed suitable for intercountry adoption and who aspire to adopt in Russia will be allowed to proceed with such adoptions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister of State realise how offensive and devastating his remarks and response are?  He is defensive of his and the Government&rsquo;s position, but he ought to have regard to the people and families involved in adoption &mdash; the individual person, birth parents, birth siblings, with whom adopted children could build up a good relationship if they could make contact with them, and their adoptive families who love them to bits and fully support their search for information.  We have made it clear that we are not being prescriptive but providing this as an option.  We seek to provide an enabling function.  I just cannot understand what it is the Minister of State has to fear.</P>
        <P>The people who set up adoption here set it up in the context of a confessional State controlled by the churches, where being adopted was a sign that the person had been born out of wedlock and was a lesser person than others.  That is not the case now.  It never was the case.  Deputy Andrews, as Minister with responsibility for children, should be here to vindicate rather than frustrate the rights of people who have been adopted and the people involved in the complexity of adoptions.</P>
        <P>On the issue of medical histories, I do not know what hospitals the Minister of State has visited or where he has had his pulse taken and although he has never had a baby, his wife had children and he is a parent.  I would like to remind him of some of the questions that are put to people attending hospital.  If they have children, they are asked about their previous medical history.  If someone suffers from epilepsy, it is important to know the family medical history to access information on prognosis, outcome and treatment.  It is important to have access to the medical history if someone is bipolar.  When dealing with diabetes, hypertension or heart conditions it is very important as part of modern medicine to have access to the medical history, as in terms of prevention, these conditions are all very much influenced by the family history.  I do not know what hospitals or clinics the Minister of State attends, but medical history is a core part of modern medicine and is an important issue for people who are adopted and their children.</P>
        <P>I am utterly disappointed with the Minister of State&rsquo;s response.  Is he still trying to protect the Catholic Church?  Is he still trying to protect the adoption agencies that owned the children who were given up and which still want to continue their control over people&rsquo;s lives, long after many of the people who made these arrangements have gone to their graves?  Practice has changed everywhere else in the world.  Why is the Minister of State standing against reasonable change?</P>

I am absolutely sympathetic to the points being made so articulately by Deputy Burton and have no argument with what she has said.  I want to proceed on the legislation in question as soon as we are finished with the Adoption Bill, which was designed to deal with the question of the consolidation of the old legislation and the Hague Convention.  I propose to move on the issues and Deputy Shatter asked when that would happen.  I will begin straight after completion of this Bill, but I cannot give a categorical date for when the new legislation will be completed.  It is overly pessimistic to suggest that if there is an election in two years, it will not be completed by then.</P>
        <P>On the question of adoptions from Russia, I met Russian authorities in my office about three weeks ago and discussed what was required.  Every effort is being made to ensure that post placement reports are provided by every couple who signed affidavits to say they would provide them.  I have made announcements in that regard and the HSE and Adoption Board are working hard to try to secure them.  The Russian authorities, that is the embassy officials here in Dublin, are anxious to sort the problem out and we will continue to work with them to achieve that.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to bringing forward legislation on information and tracing.  While this is a sensitive area, it deserves legislation in and of itself.</P>

        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to the Bill introduced by Deputy Varadkar on behalf of Fine Gael.  My colleague, Deputy Higgins, outlined the Labour Party analysis of the proposal last night.  While the Labour Party will not support the Bill for various reasons, some of which our party president addressed last night, I nevertheless acknowledge Deputy Varadkar&rsquo;s attempt to engage with the real economy and the necessity of regaining our competitiveness to enable us to engage in the marketplace.</P>
        <P>The reality is that there has been a decrease in wages of up to 3.5% in the past year or so which has made us attractive once again from a real wage perspective and has contributed to a significant improvement in competitiveness.  When allied with our 12.5% corporation tax rate, which is sacrosanct because it is so important in the context of attracting business, the high level of educational attainment, flexibility and adaptability of our workforce, and our quality of life, all these factors have propelled us to the forefront as an attractive environment for foreign direct investment.  When one considers too the recent roadmap outlined by the IDA whereby it intends to create 105,000 new jobs by the end of 2014 or early 2015 and to attract significant investment in research and development &mdash; which is absolutely critical &mdash; we have some cause to be confident that we will be in a position to advance and sustain these important investments.</P>
        <P>Having said that, it is essential that we do not lose sight of the indigenous sector.  It is in this area that the Government has fallen down and can be constructively criticised.  The small and medium-sized enterprise sector has been left on the back burner, with significant job losses throughout the State.  Employers who provide three, five, eight or ten jobs are going bust, but that is falling below the radar.  Such job losses do not receive the same attention and headlines as the closure of businesses with 200 or 300 employees, but they have an enormous impact on individuals and families in small urban areas, towns and villages throughout the country.</P>
        <P>We have only to consider the calamitous way in which the proposed PRSI holiday has been handled to see how remiss the Government has been in this area.  That proposal was announced in the December budget and welcomed by all of us, but six months later, we are still awaiting its introduction.  We all saw it as an important way to boost employment to offer employers a tax break where they employ a person who has been unemployed for six months or more.  Such a scheme would, under certain qualifying conditions, offer people the chance of a real job, not a substitution or replacement job, and save the employer &euro;3,000.  We were told the scheme would generate 12,000 jobs, yet all we have had is a statement last week by the Minister for Social Protection to the effect that its implementation is forthcoming.</P>
        <P>That failure is a severe indictment of the Government and points to its apathy and lack of urgency in dealing with unemployment.  Although many of us might have disagreed fundamentally with how it handled the banking system, the Government did at least have a strategy and a sense of urgency in that instance.  Likewise, the broad parameters of its fiscal strategy have been clearly identifiable, regardless of whether one agrees or disagrees with specific cutbacks.  I have referred to the banking, fiscal and unemployment issues as the tripod of challenges facing us.  In the case of the third leg, unemployment, there has been no attempt to deal with it in the context of the real economy.</P><Col N="468" />
        <P>It has been outlined that the provisions of this Bill will mean an average saving of &euro;400 per household per year, which amounts to &euro;400 million to &euro;500 million annually across the economy.  However, taking that money out will leave a hole in the bucket.  We are all in favour of accident and emergency charges, the cost of medicines and so on being reduced, and the Government has always used such charges as leverage.  It is difficult to see how people will meet the increased costs.  However, one cannot cut the income to hospitals, local authorities and other service providers without a significant and generally detrimental impact upon services and employment.   A loss of income of up to &euro;500 million is bound to have an impact on services.  One either cuts services or raises money elsewhere; that is the reality and we must be honest with the people in this regard.  We have already had significant reductions in public service pay.  People do not want a situation where they save a few bob in one area only for that to have a knock-on effect in terms of taxation increases to fill the gap.  If there is a gap it must be filled from general taxation or something else.</P>
        <P>Local authorities are already pared to the bone.  They do not have enough outdoor staff because of the moratorium and because they were given a directive by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that they cannot hire permanent or even contract staff.  Most local authorities have during the past 12 to 18 months lost hundreds of contract staff.  The local authority outdoor staff in my area are excellent and superbly efficient and productive in terms of the roadworks they carried out and should be allowed to do more direct labour work.  There is too much rush here towards privatisation and contractual arrangements.  Local authorities provide important employment in local areas.  Those employed therein are the eyes and ears of local authorities.  They have done tremendous work down through the years and have been often denigrated.  I recall there was a programme which made a skit of local authority workers.  As a son of a former local authority worker, I rejected that with the contempt it deserved.  Local authority workers have an important role to play and there is now not enough of them to carry out essential and important work.  If we continue to deny them more income, there will be fewer of them.  What we will have then is the privatisation of local authority services.  One has only to look across the water to see the serious consequences privatisation has left in its wake.  Some economies are now engaged in reversing this process.  We do not want to reach a point where we know the value of everything and the price of nothing.  The Labour Party has unashamedly and unambiguously always stood on that platform.</P>
        <P>There will be a net loss to the Exchequer.  The question that arises is how is this gap to be filled?  There is no such thing as a free lunch.  Politicians appear continuously to perpetuate the myth that there is such a thing as a free lunch.  However, nothing is free.  The Government is examining the possibility of increasing many charges.  As a child I travelled free by bus to school, a scheme introduced in 1968 or 1969 by former Minister Donogh O&rsquo;Malley, without which, because I lived 12 miles from the school, I would not have been able to get there.  Given that I was the eldest of ten children and my family had a medical card, I would probably still have been eligible to travel free on the bus.  The cost of school transport increased to &euro;175, then to &euro;300 and it is now projected to increase to &euro;500 from this September.  I do not know if that is true but that is what people believe.  This would be detrimental for the people involved.  This is an example of where the Government is going.</P>
        <P>The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, has analysed the fiscal crisis in the banks, the crisis in the real economy, the social crisis and reputational and ethical crisis.  The big crisis for me is in the area of small and medium-sized enterprises.  The figures released today indicate there has been an increase of 44,000 people on the live register during the past 12 months, with a 5,000 plus increase in April.  I wonder, given those figures, if we have turned the corner.  I <Col N="469" />read a report on this matter but I do not pay much attention to reports because the real economy is often different.  The Ernst &amp; Young summer forecast has predicted that unemployment will stubbornly remain at 10% for the next couple of years and that it will be some period before we recover.</P>
        <P>The Government has run out of ideas and steam in terms of dealing with this issue.  While it is important that we address the issue of job creation through foreign direct investment, we must do something to ensure the survival and contribution to employment of our 250,000 small and medium-sized enterprises.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKennedy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Kennedy</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputies Frank Fahey, Thomas Byrne, Niall Collins, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Billy Kelleher.</P>
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill before the House.  While I congratulate to some degree Deputy Varadkar on bringing it forward, I do not believe that it will fulfil its purpose, namely, a reduction in business and consumer costs.  However, I compliment him on taking the trouble to prepare the Bill.</P>
        <P>The Government has clearly identified our main problems as the banking crisis, the credit crunch and overall budget deficit.  These are the key issues with which the Government is dealing and endeavouring to get under control.  We all recognise that reducing costs for business is important.  However, without functioning banks in terms of the availability of credit, businesses cannot survive or thrive.  This must be the first priority.  The Government has agreed to recapitalise the two main banks, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland, to the tune of &euro;6 billion over the next two years.  It is vital that the banks start lending this money which will provide businesses with the stimulus they need to trade profitably and successfully.  Any business person will agree that driving costs down is inducive to economic recovery.  However, our priority must be getting our budget deficit under control and getting credit flowing again.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is true that the Government has driven down costs. Energy costs have come down by10%.  It is hoped they will continue to drop as a result of new competition.  Equally, the Government has banned upward reviews of rents.  I make the point in respect of commercial rents that the trustees of many of our large pension funds are the people refusing to reduce rents.  I believe they have a moral responsibility to endeavour to look after their tenants and to allow them trade more profitably than is currently the case.  I appeal to them to be morally responsible.  Deputy Penrose mentioned local authorities.  A number of local authorities, including Fingal County Council, on which Deputy Varadkar and I served, have reduced commercial rates to businesses.  It has shown the leadership we expect of all local authorities.  There is no doubt but that local authorities have a role to play in this area and that they have huge budgets in respect of which they can bring about savings to business people.</P>
        <P>The Government has also reduced professional fees by 8%.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelKennedy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Kennedy</NameTxt>
	<P>The pharmacy sector has also endured reduced costs.  I believe the emphasis of Government should be on ensuring that our budget deficit and bank credit issues are to the forefront.  These are our priorities and will be the forerunners to recovery of our businesses.</P>
        <P>While Deputy Varadkar&rsquo;s proposals are well-intentioned, the reality is that the issues involved are a lot more complex than he recognises.  That the Labour Party does not support his proposals speaks volumes in terms of the future and the alternative Government of which <Col N="470" />Fine Gael and the Labour Party continually speak.  There are clear ideological differences between both parties and not only on the business front.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FrankFahey"><NameTxt>Deputy Frank Fahey</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  As stated by the Minister, while on the face of it this Bill has a laudable purpose, namely, to reduce the burden of costs on consumers and industry &mdash; something we would all like to do &mdash; it bears no relationship to the budgetary or economic realities with which we are faced.  Gimmicks and frills and facile initiatives such as that represented in the Bill before us will not create a single job or help a single person out of poverty.  </P>
        <P>The Bill would completely undermine the long established and carefully developed systems of independent regulation in this country.  The overall objective of economic regulation in markets where there are traditionally natural monopolies is to create the conditions for competition to emerge and to help drive down prices.  No more than the Fine Gael initiative to create 100,000 jobs, which are fictitious, this Bill will not do anything to serve the best interests of the Irish people.  We can only achieve the objective of this Bill through greater competition and by driving down prices.  In the transport area huge subsidiaries are paid to transport organisations such as Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, Bus &Eacute;ireann and so on.  Reducing costs in this area, as proposed in the Bill, would simply ensure that we would have to pay greater amounts.  There is a way forward by way of competition to make more efficient the services we provide.</P>
        <P>It is appropriate that yesterday&rsquo;s editorial of <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>  outlines the futility of legislation such as this.  Its editorial is headed &ldquo;The Irish Example Dublin is Showing other Indebted Governments how to cut Spending&rdquo;.  It shows that the approach that has been taken by Fine Gael in Opposition has been populist and has attempted to create an impression among people that the situation in the country can be improved with these kinds of fictitious proposals.  Yesterday&rsquo;s editorial of that newspaper states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">On the surface, Ireland is in the same trouble as its euro brethren, if not worse.  Its deficit-to-GDP ratio last year hit 14.3%, meaning its apparent ability to pay its bills was even more dubious than Greece&rsquo;s.  This small, open economy was hit early and deeply by the financial crisis, and its credit-driven construction bubble popped to reveal a pile of uncovered entitlement promises.  Dublin along with just about every other red-ink-spattered national treasury, responded by making all the right noises about cutting spending.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">So what makes Ireland special?  Its political leaders are doing it &mdash; and have been since October 2008.  The &ldquo;Celtic Tiger&rdquo; economy was born out of Ireland&rsquo;s last fiscal crisis in the mid-1980s, another tale of runaway public spending.  That eventually spawned supply-side tax cuts to restart private-sector initiative, which allowed for uninterrupted growth from 1994 through 2007.</P>
        <P LI="1" el="0">But while Dublin had learned the importance of non-government enterprise  ... [and it goes on.]</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">It also states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Athens, Madrid, Lisbon, Rome and the rest have begun to follow suit, finally having caught on that they can&rsquo;t spend their way back to prosperity.  The last year-and-a-half of Irish asceticism is now seen as Europe&rsquo;s Ghost of Frugality Future, and politicians around Europe could do worse than to look at Ireland&rsquo;s cuts as a model.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In that editorial <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> &mdash; probably one of the most respected newspapers in the world &mdash; has cited the example of what is being done in Ireland as the way for countries <Col N="471" />to get out of their economic difficulties.  It would not be writing that kind of editorial if we were to follow the type of policy we have heard proposed by Fine Gael in this House during recent months.  This Bill is typical of that policy; it has put forward a populist-type proposal to cut costs across the spectrum.  That will not get us out of our economic difficulties, rather it will ensure we will face challenges for many more years than we will have to if we continue with the tight, fiscal and financial reforms in which we are now engaged.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>The debate on this Bill provides an opportunity to explore the proposals put forward by Fine Gael to deal with the difficult situation, nationally and internationally, in the context of the global credit crisis, the global recession, our internal difficulties and the dynamics that have stemmed from that.  The Bill could be described as a smoke and mirrors emergency measures in the public interest Bill because it is simply creative accounting at its very best, and at its worst it is disingenuous in that it is claimed that if it was enacted, households could save more than &euro;400 annually.  The revenue will have to come from somewhere, otherwise there will have to be further cuts in services provided to the public by the various agencies and authorities that carry out work on behalf of the State for the people.  </P>
        <P>This Bill does not in any way address the serious situation the economy is facing on a number of fronts.  Primarily, there is the difficulty in terms of credit availability, the vulnerability of the banking system in Ireland and the possible knock-on effect of deleveraging of debt for the foreseeable future, which would create huge pressures for the financial institutions and there is also the issue of their inability to provide credit to small and medium-sized businesses and to individuals who want to purchase homes, cars etc.  For all those reasons, the big ticket item facing us is to try to ensure the economy recovers, grows, starts to expand and creates employment and opportunities again for our people.</P>
        <P>This Bill camouflages what we should be talking about, which are the serious issues as opposed to the trivia that has been outlined in this context and the bluff about the fact that the enactment of this Bill would in some way save money.  There is no creative or magic solution to trying to address the budget deficit.  The money has to be raised somewhere, otherwise there will have to be further cuts.</P>
        <P>The explanatory memorandum states:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The recession has impacted on people&rsquo;s lives through falling incomes and job losses.  This has been compounded by government decisions to raise taxes and cut pay, welfare and professional fees in response to the fiscal crisis.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The reality is that if this Bill was enacted, we would have to increase taxes further, cut pay more and then address the issue of social welfare pay also.  It is disingenuous to say this is a cost-neutral&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;Bill and it does not provide for anything in terms of what we are trying to do, which is to restore competitiveness in the economy, increase exports, attract foreign direct investment and ensure we can sustain the growth that is projected at the end of 2010.  For all those reasons&mdash;&mdash; </P>

      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the green spin.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;this Bill is not credible and it exposes the bankruptcy of proposals, particularly of Fine Gael, which has tried to be all things to everybody other than on <Col N="472" />the occasions of the responsible position it took on the bank guarantee in September 2008.  Since then it has opposed almost every measure while saying out of the other side of its mouth that if it was in Government, it would address the issue of cuts.  However, we had to address the difficult budgetary deficit in recent times.</P>
        <P>On an issue that is of critical importance and to which previous speakers have referred in this Chamber on numerous occasions, the 12.5% corporation tax is of major significance in attracting inward investment.  People commenting that it could be undermined does not assist Ireland in trying to attract inward investment, encourage people to locate in Ireland or consider Ireland as a location from which to export into Europe from further afield.</P>
        <P>Playing politics with the serious position Ireland is in the context of its vulnerability, which is still evident, as was alluded to by Deputy Fahey in his citing of an editorial of <i>The Wall Street Journal </i> on Ireland, is wrong.  We are vulnerable but we are on the path to recovery and it will be painful.</P>
        <P>In terms of restoring competitiveness in the economy, competitiveness is a word that camouflages the difficult positions in which people find themselves with falling wages and rising unemployment, but it is essential that we ensure there is competitiveness in the economy in all areas, not only by way of a reduction in salaries and wages but also by ensuring efficiencies at Government, agency and local authority level and across the private sector.  They are key areas in which we must continually ensure there are efficiencies.  The energy sector is also critically important in this respect.</P>
      </Speaker>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BillyKelleher"><NameTxt>Deputy Billy Kelleher</NameTxt>
	<P>It is amazing that we have set up regulators and independent organisations and agencies to act independently, yet this Bill suggests that the Government should interfere in every possible way with their independence.  We cannot have it every way.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to contribute to this debate on an important issue.  I listened with interest to the previous contributions.</P>
        <P>I would like there to be a reduction in local government charges for members of the public but we must be honest with each other.  We cannot have it both ways.  If we want to have public services, we must fund and pay for them.  There is no simple way out of that.  While the Bill may be well-intentioned, it is narrow in its focus.  I would like to see it broadened to include other areas in regard to the debate tonight.</P>
        <P>Deputy Varadkar has the report of an bord snip nua.  We also have the report on the Commission on Taxation, which reported around the same time.  That report referred to the broadening of our tax base and mentioned issues such as property tax, the funding of the provision of our public services and water charges.   These are all areas that must be fleshed out for the future.</P>
        <P>Deputy Penrose rightly mentioned provision of public services through local authorities and it is opportune to examine that proposal in more detail.  Some of my Fianna F&aacute;il colleagues and I met with a number of groups, including ISME, the Irish Hotel Federation, the Irish League of Credit Unions and many others that came to talk to us.  The single overriding comment the small and medium-sized industry sector makes to us is that the cost of local govern<Col N="473" />ment charges in this country is completely disproportionate.  We must address these issues in a serious way for the future.  Commercial rates, water charges, waste water charges and an entire pyramid of charges that kick in for business are prohibitive.  There is no return for the person who pays these charges.</P>
        <P>In that context it is opportune to roll the ball back across to Fine Gael which is in charge of 28 of the 34 local authorities in the country.  How many of those in the past year&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Carey</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="NiallCollins"><NameTxt>Deputy Niall Collins</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;have reduced their commercial rates?  The exception of Fingal County Council was mentioned.  To give that local authority credit, it is very innovative.  I believe it has a link with the credit union movement by which it provides loans to small businesses.</P>
        <P Just="Left">If a party is in charge of 28 of 34 local authorities, as I know Fine Gael is in my area, in Limerick County Council and also in Limerick City Council and Clare County Council, one must ask whether it has reduced local authority charges where it is in control.  If the party has control of local authorities there is a responsibility and the party should act as it means.  Although it displays the intention in this House, it has the power at local level&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Fine Gael cannot have it both ways.  It wants it one way in this House but when it is in control of local government on the ground in county and city local authorities it does not act.  </P>
        <P>Mention was made of the privatisation of public services.  Perhaps we should look seriously at that.  Some parts of the public service should be privatised, for example, the Passport Office which has offices across the street and in Cork.  The scenes we saw were scandalous.  The Passport Office has acted as a barrier to industry in this country.  I have come across, as I am sure other Members of this House have, people who were prohibited from travelling abroad on business because of delays in the Passport Office.  That is an example of the public service that should be privatised.  I agree that certain parts of it should not be.</P>
        <P>We must look also at development levies which are a huge barrier.  All local authorities have a development contribution scheme and now act as barriers to development in their counties.  I offer an example from my area where a person wanted to build an extension to a nursing home, a service the public needs, but the development contribution was &euro;110,000, more than the cost of building the extension.  We need to look seriously at these matters but we cannot have it both ways.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I shall try to leave some time for Deputy Byrne, if I cannot share it with him.</P><Col N="474" />
        <P>I welcome the opportunity to have a debate in the House on the crucial issue of competitiveness and how to achieve it.  We must be careful that we do not become populist and grab easy headlines but must work through what will work in a proper policy driven way.  In my area of responsibility competitiveness is an important element.  There are prices for energy and communications and a number of State agencies such as RTE, Inland Fisheries Ireland and other bodies must reduce and improve their cost competitiveness.</P>
        <P>I shall consider the regulated markets first because they are probably the most significant in scale.  Communications is a &euro;4 billion industry; energy is much bigger again, being worth perhaps &euro;6 billion to &euro;8 billion or more.  Energy is an important cost component within our industry although one must be careful with energy statistics.  Figures from Sustainable Energy Ireland show that for 95% of businesses energy makes up less than 5% of their costs.  It is not a main input cost in production for most companies although there are a number of energy intensive companies where we must be especially careful.</P>
        <P>On the back of European legislation directives, going back about ten years, we introduced a regulatory system.  I believe it works.  I believe what the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher said.  The Government must be very careful not to jump in with its two big lumpen feet, pretending or thinking we can do regulation better than the people we appoint and legislate for to do that job.</P>
        <P>In energy this system is working.  Our prices are and have been high, largely because of our dependence on fossil fuel arising from a long series of decisions.  However, our regulatory system is working and the competitive market the regulators are helping to deliver is starting to bring prices down significantly, getting us back into line and in shape with comparative countries in Europe.  I became aware of that in spring last year at the height of this economic crisis when competitiveness was a key issue.  The issue of energy prices came to the fore and we did a number of things.  With the regulator we set about this on a proper regulatory market basis and following good policy guidance, looking to see what we could do to bring down prices, in particular for large energy users which are those most at risk from high energy prices.  We made a series of measures that used good regulation and the ability of the ESB, with the help of some of the large payments it received in recent years from selling some assets, to bring about a non-discriminatory, non market-distorting market basis.  It brought down prices.  We put more than &euro;0.5 billion to that task as well as the benefits that came from lower energy prices coming on international markets.  The result in 2008-09, from second quarter to second quarter, was that Ireland had the second largest price reduction in gas prices to business across Europe&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>We are still higher than most countries.  Do not try to fool us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;and the third largest reduction in electricity prices for both business and householders.  We benefited most and got the biggest reduction.  In the process, having brought in all the energy companies, having listened to everybody and talked to them in great detail, it became absolutely clear to me that we now have a competitive market in electricity supply.  For some years we have had one for the large energy users and are now coming to the point, with the introduction of companies into the retail residential side, of having a competitive market in electricity across the market in this country.  That works.  It brings down prices and drives efficiencies.  It delivers better investments where the business communities take the risk in a free and competitive market.  A number of companies are acting in this, several of which are real-scale international companies as well as our own domestic companies.  </P><Col N="475" />
        <P>I advise Fine Gael to be careful.  Some of the populist measures that may look good in the press might not work out and would leave us with a distortionary effect that would mess up what clearly is a working system.</P>
        <P>There is a similar regulatory structure in communications which took a similar sort of timeframe to establish.  Just as CER is doing its job well on the energy side, ComReg is doing a very effective job in communications, in difficult circumstances.  Again, there are legacy issues where some of our utilities went through very poor ownership structures and the taking out of many of the assets.  It has not been easy.  Again, we have been playing catch-up because of some of those legacy issues but I stand and support and have worked with the regulator in the regulatory policy we have pursued which I believe is working.  It is based on competition and on being technology neutral with different companies.  We are not the best at calling which technology will work but we can set the market conditions that allow others to employ technology and try to win the customer base.</P>
        <P>We are starting to see this.  As I said, we are catching up and still must go further and faster but if one looks at what is happening on the back of that regulatory process, one sees that prices are coming down.  There are consistent reductions in prices for almost all users.  We must push further with our European colleagues.  However, in difficult times, our services are being improved on the back of competitive markets.  There was the decision by cable companies to start running out 100 megabyte connectivity on a very widespread basis in this country.  There was the decision by Eircom to start making investments in very difficult times when it has a great number of different challenges.  However, the company knows it is in a competitive market, where if it does not go out and win the customer with faster speeds and better products, it will lose the customer to someone else and, therefore, we are seeing that it, too, is committing to investment in next-generation access.  There have been very significant developments this year in what is called local loop unbundling.  This is opening up more competitive and more open access markets where there is a real wholesale option.  It is happening on the back of a good competitive regulatory market system.</P>
        <P>I was in Europe on Monday at a meeting of the Council of Ministers.    The message was not to mess with the regulatory systems, which are working and delivering for the country.  We should be careful with some of the simple policy approaches; the approach taken in the regulatory system might not grab headlines easily but it works for the people of the country.</P>
        <P>The Opposition might argue that it is more concerned with other Government spending.  In my Department we have met the target in terms of bringing down the staff levels to what they were meant to be under the employment control framework.  We are keeping a very tight ship and I can see the public servants in my Department working hard.  It is important that this is known because it is an easy story to pit the private sector against the public sector.  I do not see that in my own Department and, by and large, I see people working hard in a dedicated fashion to keep tight control of budgets.  This is happening in my Department and across the public service because people currently have an eye on the public interest and on ensuring that we do not waste money or overspend.</P>
        <P>I mentioned RTE and will take it as an example.  There is a new regulatory system with the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland but even before it was up and running in a new role we could see what happened on the ground.  In 2009, RTE saw an 18% reduction in operating costs, a 9% reduction in personnel costs and a 26% reduction in other costs.  That effort is driven by management and unions responding to the economic crisis together; they saw revenues drop and realised that the licence fee and other income would not be certain so they carried out reallocations.  These are real cost savings keeping RTE above the water.</P><Col N="476" />
        <P>I met the chief executive of An Post, Mr. Donal Connell, today and he is doing a fine job.  He said it has been a tough operating environment, with revenues down and mail volume seeing a decrease in the order of 10%.  The company is keeping its nose above the water and staying in the black by keeping its costs down, being flexible and delivering the required efficiencies.</P>
        <P>Rather than me jumping in like Boy Wonder to solve the difficulties of An Post, RTE, the ESB, Bord G&aacute;is or any other companies, we have a good system that is driving efficiencies and seeking improved performance in our economy.  This should be replicated across the board because we are in a difficult economic position where competitiveness matters.</P>
        <P>I regret that Deputy Byrne was not able to contribute but I welcome the opportunity to give some examples of what is going on in the real world under this Government.  We are driving competitiveness to the nth degree through clever policy making rather than populist measures that may grab the headlines but which would not do the job.</P>

	<P>Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DamienEnglishFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Damien English</NameTxt>
	<P>Some of us live in the real world, although the Government does not appear to.  We have had this debate concerning cost issues to businesses and taxpayers over and over again.  I read last night&rsquo;s speech from the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Calleary, and was shocked by it because he spoke as if there was no real problem or issue.  He and the Minister of State seated across from me, Deputy Mary White, sat with us during committee meetings over the space of four or five months when we listened to retailers and people involved in business telling us our cost price was way off compared to every other country in Europe.  We have the highest banking charges and costs for telecommunications, energy, rents, rates, contribution levies, insurance and waste disposal.  The list goes on, with all the costs in some way related to the Government or regulation from the Government.</P>
        <P>It is time we woke up.  This Bill is trying to change the mindset in order to drive down the charges which the Government controls.  It is possible and there is nothing wrong with indicating that we want to achieve a 5% cut.  In 2008, the Minister wanted to bring about a 3% cut in wages in State agencies.  Although it was not achieved, there was at least an attempt.  We want to achieve a 5% cut, which is possible.</P>
        <P>This is not about cutting services or putting up taxes.  We believe we can find another 5% in most of these agencies in cost savings, and in some cases where companies are regulated, profits can be reduced.  This is not about populist measures or increasing taxes and what we seek can be achieved in other ways.  We must find more savings in these budgets, and part of the issue is how the budgets are set in the first place.  We would like to see parties competing for resources in Departments in order to earn budgets, and the sooner this happens, the better.  They should prove their need and detail their spending.</P>
        <P>Efficiencies can be rewarded rather than penalised.  I worked in various State bodies over the years and I saw that if money was not spent, it would be lost the next year.  That logic still exists and we want to change it.  There should be a new approach to budgets, and part of the process is setting an overall target to cut costs.  It has been too easy for the Government to add stealth taxes and sneakily increase prices here and there.  Examples of this include television licences, accident and emergency department charges and local authority levies.  Even getting a taxi now involves colossal costs which have been quietly increased.  The registration fees in <Col N="477" />colleges did not rise quietly but jumped dramatically.  It has been too easy for the Government because no targets have been set as an example of leadership, and no costs have been cut through decreasing charges.  That is just not happening.</P>
        <P>Businesses want an action plan to bring these costs down.  Our businesses are not competitive but this country can only solve its problems through exports.  That is something on which we probably all agree.  For too many years we thought selling houses to each other would make us rich as a country but it did not.  The exporting of goods and services is the only way to bring more money to this country.  If businesses cannot compete on price, their products will not compete as exports.  That is why these charges must be driven down.  Businesses need a chance to survive.</P>
        <P>If the Government is not prepared to reduce these charges by 5%, we can consider other areas.  The high level group on business regulation came before the committee today, having been given the job to implement a 25% cut in red tape by 2012.  One would imagine that in the current economic climate we would speed up the delivery of that target but we are not in a position to do so.  The group spent the first three years drawing up a flowery list of reduction targets; it will spend another year implementing a plan to achieve these targets.  A dog in the street could draw up such a list.</P>
        <P>It is a pity the Minister of State, Deputy Kelleher, is gone as yesterday he attended workshops and will attend them again later in June and July.  He will speak with people in business about areas in which regulation can be cut.  Group after group comes before every committee we have to give us a list of areas in which we can cut costs and regulation, but we only organise more flowery meetings to delay any opportunity to give businesses a chance to reduce costs.  Government regulation is adding to the cost of business.  We must begin to address this one way or the other.</P>
        <P>There are other examples.  Many businesses in this country cannot compete with counterparts across the Border because of the VAT rate.  People can cross into the North, where the prices are the same but one can get away without paying VAT in some of the hardware stores.  We could try to fix that problem to give businesses an opportunity to grow.</P>
        <P>I am glad Deputy Collins mentioned local authority charges.  Fine Gael has held a majority on most councils for the past nine months but we are not in charge of the budgets because the money comes from the Government to every council, which then decide what to give or cut.  A small amount is raised in some county councils from rates but the majority of funding comes from the Government.  That funding has not matched population growth and service delivery in most counties.  The contribution to local authorities from the national tax take has decreased every year since the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, took office as leader of Fianna F&aacute;il.  The level was brought down and local authorities were expected to find a greater percentage of their own funding.</P>
        <P>Local authorities are not in a position to introduce all these rate reductions because they are not in charge of the finances.  Local authorities, under the direction of Fianna F&aacute;il, were told to bring in contribution levies which the Deputy claimed are causing a serious problem.  They are a major barrier to business and job creation.</P>
        <P>If a person wants to set up a small business employing ten people, the first thing received is a bill for &euro;80,000 or &euro;90,000.  That is before a shovel is even put in the ground, which is ridiculous.  These are Fianna F&aacute;il policies backed up by the Greens rather than those of Fine Gael.  We should not muddy the waters because it is quite straightforward to see who is in charge of this country and in Government.  This Bill seeks to change this logic and we must reduce costs if we are to survive as a country.</P>

	<P>After pouring &euro;14 billion into a septic bank, the Government has finally realised that Fine Gael was right.  The Taoiseach&rsquo;s admission in the House today that the Government was considering winding down Anglo Irish Bank was a welcome announcement.  The difficulty is that the &euro;14 billion put into the bank could have created 80,000 jobs in our economy.  It has taken the Government 16 months to reach the same conclusion highlighted by the Opposition during that period.  For 16 months, the Government could have focused on creating jobs and supporting small businesses instead of maintaining the high lifestyles of developers.</P>
        <P>The Government has shored up the builder&rsquo;s bank and those who owe it billions of euro have been living the high life, travelling via business class on sun holidays with their families or popping cases of champagne in London clubs, all on the back of taxpayers&rsquo; financial pain.  They continue to live the high life while being bankrolled by the public, which is struggling to keep up with increased interest rates, rising taxes and cuts in pay and social welfare supports.  The Government tells us this pain is necessary to save Anglo Irish Bank, the septic bank.</P>
        <P>Last year, while private sector prices fell by 2.5%, Government prices increased by 6.7%.  This is unsustainable.  It is time that we gave the public a break.  Instead of looking to the television licence, accident and emergency charges and leaving and junior certificate students to support the lavish lifestyle of the elite, it is time to give something back to the public.  Last week, a hike in school transport fees from &euro;300 per primary school child to &euro;500 was announced.  This is anti-rural, anti-family and unsupportive of rural transport.</P>
        <P>A reform of the system has been promised for years.  As Deputy English stated, this Government is always one report or consultation process away from making a decision, yet Government controlled charges continue to rise and need to be cut in line with wage and social welfare reductions.  We are looking to give householders who are struggling to survive &euro;400 into their pockets.  Not only would this benefit them, it would also reduce the cost of doing business, improve competitiveness and save jobs.  Instead, the Government has neglected the issue.</P>
        <P>I am glad the Minister, Deputy Ryan, attended the House, gave us his suggestions and tut-tutted what Fine Gael is doing.  Ten years ago, I stood in the Chamber and told the Government that it was about time for it to get its act together where broadband was concerned.  Our five broadband networks are owned by five semi-State companies and the Minister has done nothing about bringing them together, working them and sweating those assets in the interests of the taxpayer.  We cannot even put the broadband networks on a single map even though the Minister has been in office for three years.  His predecessors were sitting on their hands for the preceding ten years.  It is time the Government started pulling up its socks.  It is time it started focusing on the real issues, namely, the 440,000 people on the dole with nothing to do.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome this opportunity to contribute on the Bill.  I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Varadkar, on introducing it.  As he stated last night, an average of &euro;400 per household would be saved annually if the Government made the Bill law.  This would reduce the cost of doing business for struggling small and medium-sized enterprises.</P>
        <P>Before the Minister, Deputy Ryan, left the Chamber, he told us that we should live in the real world.  Small reductions mean a great deal in the real world.  I can give an example.  Recently, a number of people attended my clinics in west County Clare because the rent for local authority houses had increased by &euro;5 per week.  They were struggling, as the increase made a significant difference to them.  They were trying to get a reduction.  This is the real world.  It is how people live.  Increases like that are serious for those who are struggling.  Given the week that is in it, a week in which &euro;2 billion is being pumped into Anglo Irish Bank, this is ironic.  Figures published today show that unemployment has reached an all-time high of 439,000.</P><Col N="479" />
        <P>People are angry.  They did not create the mess.  Everyday, I meet people who ask why there has not been a bailout for the ordinary people who are in dire straits due to these financial circumstances.  Small reductions for many householders would set an example.  They must deal with significant debt commitments despite being hit by job losses, pay cuts and pay freezes.  In my constituency of County Clare, disposable income during the height of the boom was between 90% and 95% of the national average.  Today, 96% of consumers have no choice but to reduce grocery costs, which will have a ripple effect on local businesses, many of which are barely keeping afloat.</P>
        <P>Everyone must readjust, including Departments and Government agencies.  That is what the Bill is about.  Price reductions would provide much needed assistance for the hard-pressed consumer.  Instead of taking this approach, the Government&rsquo;s policy has been to place additional pressure on people.  For example, the carbon tax added to the cost of rural households&rsquo; fuel bills despite rural incomes falling by 30% last year.  The issue is out there.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Would the Deputy scrap the tax?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  We are discussing reductions, not scrapping taxes.  Small reductions would be the most important factor.  Last week&rsquo;s announcement regarding the VHI saw fears about further price hikes in health insurance, although that was outside the Government&rsquo;s control.  This will place considerable pressure on the public health sector.</P>
        <P>While doing some research tonight, I read a quote from Nobel Prize winning economist Milton Friedman, an adviser to President Ronald Reagan.  Mr. Friedman stated: &ldquo;The government solution to a problem is usually as bad as the problem&rdquo;.  He must have been thinking about this Government.  I urge it to support the Bill and the people.  Small reductions mean much and governments can lead by example.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AndrewDoyle"><NameTxt>Deputy Andrew Doyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I commend Deputy Varadkar on introducing the Bill, which tries to close the gap on a graph.  Some 5% represents &euro;400 per annum per individual.  If one gives &euro;400 to a family on the margins, it probably means the family will not go to another agency, such as the community welfare officer service, to be bailed out and to have some bills paid.  The effect will be a reduction in money spent, as the amount will not be transferred from one part to another.  If one gives &euro;400 to someone who has money to spend, the chances are that it will allow him or her to spend that money somewhere in the system, which will include VAT and keep someone in a job.</P>
        <P>The list in my hand details a death by a thousand cuts.  It includes the stealth taxes sneaked upwards by the Government in every budget when no one was paying attention thanks to the big ticket items on the agenda.  For the past two weeks, we have been told in state of the union speeches by the Taoiseach and others that we have &ldquo;turned a corner&rdquo; and are on the road to recovery.  Today&rsquo;s figures show an all-time high of 439,000 people unemployed and 255 people losing their jobs per day, but we have &ldquo;turned a corner&rdquo;.  God help us because we are actually bouncing along the floor, not turning any corner.  As has been stated, the Government has been slow&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P Just="Left">The chief executive of ISME stated today that &ldquo;We are in the throes of the worst economic crisis in living memory and it is critical that we stem the number of job losses.  Unfortunately, the Government is ignoring this fact and is contributing to an already dreadful situation by refusing to apply any coherent policies to address the issue&rdquo;.  A perfect example is the delay in the PRSI exemption.</P>
        <P>We had a debate last night about the recovery of windfall profits through carbon allowances at &euro;75 million per annum for two years.  A total of &euro;150 million has been lost due to the Government&rsquo;s delay in implementing a policy.  Deputy Coveney has been consistently pointing out that this revenue stream was being ignored and people were getting it for free.</P>
        <P>We are overburdened with red tape.  The HSA has become an industry in itself.  If we want to fill a pothole in the road and the pothole expands after a flood, then the HSA must write a new health and safety statement.  It is that ridiculous.  That is a public service cost.  We cannot lecture to the private sector on cutting costs and feeling the pain.  The graph presented in this Bill highlights the gap that is growing.  Instead of bringing this Bill before the House in its own guise in six months, which the Government inevitably does, it should accept it tonight.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this Bill.  I cannot help but refer to some of the comments made earlier.  Deputy O&rsquo;Kennedy was very worried about the ideological differences between Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  I cannot think of any greater difference than that between Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party.  Fianna F&aacute;il has rolled over in many areas and it has caused some of the increased costs that we are bearing today.  According to another speaker, the country has been built on proper regulation.  I know that the regulators for electricity and gas held up the price as long as they could, but some of the other regulators have a lot to answer for, and the &euro;22.5 billion needed for Anglo Irish Bank explains why.  We have to ask why the price of petrol and diesel are so high today.  Farmers and contractors are paying 44% more than they paid this time last year when we compare the respective prices of a barrel of oil.  Therefore, there are question marks over some of these regulators.</P>
        <P>It was very interesting to hear<i> The Wall Street Journal</i> quoted.  I would rather listen to ordinary low-paid civil servants on the ground and others who have to bear the increased costs and problems in this country.  It is hard to take lectures from people who have caused so many problems.  Only today, Eircom has put up its prices by 3%.  Every person I meet who is trying to set up a business in rural Monaghan cannot get broadband.  Deputy Conlon sent out letters and fancy cards to such people telling them that we would get the broadband, but the broadband never arrived.</P>
        <P>In the time available to me, I would like to refer to electricity costs and water charges.  The electricity costs for Wellman International in Mullagh are twice the costs for the company&rsquo;s factory in France.  That difference costs the company &euro;2 million every year.  We are lucky we still have the company because it is committed to the area.  A small factory outside Ballybay is in a business where it must use a lot of water.  It recycles its own water, but it still has to pay the waste water charge.  This is completely and utterly impossible for that factory to bear, along <Col N="481" />with the high level of rates.  Jobs are being lost in that area because of increased costs, and little effort is being made to control them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to share time with Deputy Varadkar.</P>
        <P>If we want to restore any sense of fairness in our society and if we want to get co-operation from those in the workplace who have taken great hits in their income and in the level of services they receive from the State, then we must do things like enact this Bill.  This is a positive step taken by Fine Gael.  We are trying to bring forward ideas to assist in a very difficult budgetary situation.  I have listened to the Minister and members of the media telling the Opposition that we should be responsible and take seriously the difficulties we are facing.  However, the minute we bring forward any decent proposal to help the situation, it is cast aside as if we do not matter.  This is precisely the attitude that was adopted by the lead Minister of State last night when he dealt with this proposal.</P>
        <P>The Government has lost touch with reality in its dealings with members of the public.  It does not understand that if people&rsquo;s income is to be reduced, then we must bring down costs equally so that we have a reasonable standard of living and that we get co-operation from both the trade union movement and from the individual on the street.  We cannot expect to have public charges remain at the same level or be increased while at the same time ask people to take massive cuts in income and services.  That is precisely the Government&rsquo;s response to this Bill.</P>
        <P>Deputy Calleary said that this Bill bears no relation to budgetary or economic realities.  We are talking about people.  The Government Deputies are obsessed with theory.  We are talking about practicalities.  We are talking about increased day-to-day costs that must be faced by people on reduced income.  Business people are struggling with overdrafts and struggling to collect money owed to them.  If they are trying to retain people in employment, they need help from the State and not sympathy.  They need help in the form of reduced charges, be they rates, water charges, waste charges and so on.  These things are in the control of the State, yet Deputy Calleary tells us that the Bill would &ldquo;completely undermine the long established and carefully developed systems of independent regulation in this country.&rdquo;  Who runs the country?  Are we now run by regulators?  Where is the Government?  Does it not take decisions any more?  Is it a mortal sin if we breach some regulation because it is in the interest of the people who we were elected to represent?  Have we lost our way?</P>
        <P>What regulator set the cost of a television licence at &euro;160?  The Minister for Finance sets that.  It is entirely within his grasp to cut some of these charges by a miserable 5% and reduce the cost of a television licence to &euro;152.  What regulation will we undermine if we do that sort of thing?  If we reduced the driving licence fee who would we upset?  The passport application fee is &euro;80 but we cannot even get passports.  People have queued but have lost business because they cannot get a passport to fly out to carry out business and through his Minister of State, the Minister for Finance is telling me that we would undermine regulatory systems.  He is not dealing with reality in his response to this serious Bill.</P>
        <P>I doubt the Minister for Finance had the opportunity to read this Bill because from my past dealings with him I would have thought he would have had a more compassionate, understanding and intelligent response to a request, where it is within the Government&rsquo;s powers, to through greater efficiency reduce costs imposed on the taxpayers of the country or, where it is within its remit, to reduce the cost of such items as a television licence, which would not upset the budgetary calculations for the year.</P>
        <P>Everybody will have to make sacrifices yet all the Government can do is rush into the House with emergency legislation.  There is never any difficulty in increasing taxes or imposing charges <Col N="482" />and the Government seeks the co-operation of the Opposition in taking these measures.  However, when it comes to a genuine effort by the Opposition to try to bring into line reductions in income with greater efficiencies and reductions in charges over which the State has some control, the Government finds it difficult to accept it.</P>
        <P>Ministers make speeches and lecture the private sector on getting its costs under control.  Did the decision to increase the third level registration fee from &euro;850 to &euro;1,500 cause many problems?  It was an increase of almost 100%.  All we are asking for is a 5% reduction.  What astonished me was the negative response.  I am sure the Government neither read nor thought about this Bill.  The new company filing standard fee is &euro;100.  How would it affect the budgetary estimates if it was reduced to &euro;95?  It may be small money but when it is all added up it means a lot of money to a lot of people.  I am providing small examples.  A driving test fee is &euro;110.  What is wrong with reducing that by &euro;5.50?  These are the signals the Government should be sending out; that in asking people to take a cut in salary or wages in turn it will endeavour to reduce charges from the huge list available to all of us if we had the time available to consider the matter further.</P>
        <P>This is a genuine sign that not only is the Government tired but that it has lost ideas and the will to take the trouble to think up new ways of getting balance in society through fairness in asking people to make sacrifices and show by example that in doing so it will respond, even if it is as small as reducing the cost of the television licence by 5%.  It is not about the &euro;8 difference that this would make; it would be a sign that the Government is taking this seriously, that it is asking people to reduce their income and in turn it will reduce their costs.  The Government wants to maintain the level of costs and in some cases increase them but it expects everybody else to reduce their income.  I rest my case.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank my colleagues for speaking in favour of the Bill and the Sinn F&eacute;in Party for supporting it.  I regret the Labour Party is abstaining on the Bill but I respect its decision, which I understand is based on its concerns that we will not be able to find the requisite savings to fund a reduction in Government charges by 5% and I will address that later in my speech.  Parties in the House are different and Fianna F&aacute;il and the Green Party manage to work together.  I am sure we can work together with the Labour Party.  When it comes to high Government charges and high utility prices, the Labour Party and Fianna F&aacute;il are much closer to each other than the Labour Party is to us and I am very happy with that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CiaranCuffeGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Cuffe</NameTxt>
	<P>Is Deputy Varadkar opting out?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill is simple; it proposes to reduce all Government charges by 5% and calls on Government regulators to reduce their prices and give relief to consumers and business.  As Deputy Doyle mentioned, this graph says it all.  I know I am not supposed to use props but perhaps the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will allow me to do so on this one occasion.  This shows the extent to which prices have fallen in the real economy but Government regulated and controlled prices have continued to increase.  Essentially, this Bill is about telling the Government it should do exactly what it expects its workers, people on social welfare and those in private business to do, which is to reduce their prices and accept a degree of reduction.</P>
        <P>I will respond to some of the arguments made.  Some Members, including the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, stated this would cause a cost to the Exchequer.  The majority of the cost of this would fall on the utility companies, such as the ESB which made a profit of &euro;200 million last year, Bord Gais &Eacute;ireann, which made a profit of more than &euro;100 million and Eircom, which made a profit of more than &euro;100 million and increased its prices today.  I note the fact that in his contribution the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural <Col N="483" />Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, made no reference to the fact that a company which makes more than &euro;100 million a year increased its prices today.</P>
        <P>Of course the PPP toll contractors would be affected by this and so would the NCT companies, and so they should be.  If the Government was able to use financial emergency legislation last year to ride roughshod over the contracts of public servants working for the Government and the contracts of pharmacists and other professionals, why can it not do the same when it comes to toll operators?  We know about the sweetheart deal done by the Government and the toll operators which requires that tolls increase with inflation but do not decrease with deflation.  It would be entirely legitimate to use financial emergency measures to force that cut.  The small number of costs that would fall directly on the Government spending Vote would be approximately &euro;70 million.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance is familiar with the McCarthy report, which has a menu of &euro;5.3 billion in savings from which to choose.  In his Department, it has spare capacity to be reduced by the OPW at &euro;20 million; benchmark rents and occupancy levels with the private sector at &euro;20 million; and IT efficiencies and Revenue Commissioners at &euro;8.6 million.  Those three measures alone are enough to reduce Government charges by 5% across the board.</P>
        <P>It was argued by the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, that the Bill would undermine the long established and carefully developed system of independent regulation.  We do not support the system of regulation as it is organised.  There are too many regulators and there should be a single utility regulator.  The regulators operate on a cost plus model; how much does it cost and how much can be added for profit.  That is not a good way to have a regulatory market.  They should be asked to squeeze their costs and that is not happening.  Ministers can make policy directions to regulators and have done so before.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, who has been accurately described as the moral adviser to the Government, sought to give advice to Fine Gael on this occasion.  He told us the Government was driving competitiveness to the nth degree.  However, the World Economic Forum does not agree with that nor does the<i> World Competitiveness Yearbook</i>.  These bodies, which assess international competitiveness every year, state that Irish competitiveness is continuing to decline because all the Government has done is cut wages.  It has not addressed any of the other issues that affect competitiveness.  That is why, according to these two bodies, overall we continue to decline in competitiveness.</P>
        <P>The Minister, Deputy Ryan, also stated that the regulatory system works.  I do not think anyone else believes that.  He stated the energy regulation system works.  I do not think anyone else believes that either.  He stated that the regulatory system was reducing energy costs.  However, the only reason energy costs increased in the first place was because of the Government&rsquo;s regulatory system, which stated that instead of achieving competition by splitting the ESB or privatising part of it, it would increase costs in order to bring other semi-State players into a fake competitive market.  The only reason prices are decreasing is because they were falsely inflated by the Government&rsquo;s regulatory model.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, demonstrated some of the typical bankrupt thinking of the Government by stating that bus and train fares could not be reduced due to the financial situation of Dublin Bus, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  However, higher fares reduce passenger numbers.  There are a number of reasons there are fewer passengers, most particularly the Government&rsquo;s recession, but higher fares reduce the number of people who use bus and train services.  There are plenty of efficiencies that can be achieved in CIE and there can be bus competition, for which Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd on this side of the House has always argued.  Deputy Fahey and the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, during his brief contribution &mdash; I am sorry he cannot make a greater one &mdash; told us about <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>  praising <Col N="484" />the Government.  I have no doubt it is praising the Government.  This Government is working for <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> .  It is the favoured newspaper of the bond holders, the people who are being protected by the Government&rsquo;s banking policies.  I am not interested in Wall Street, nor is this party.  We are interested in main street and that is what this Bill is about.  It is about businesses, consumers and people on main street, Ireland.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In regard to Deputy Collins, who raised a fair point about Fine Gael control of local authorities and asked why we did not cut the rates there, we actually have in some cases &mdash; D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council being one example &mdash; and in Cork, Limerick and other areas we have frozen rates.  That is despite the fact that the budgets given to local authorities by Governments have been reduced.  We have set a very good example there.  Even though the Government has reduced funding to local authorities we have not increased rates in the local authorities which we control and in one or two examples we have cut them.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This is a good Bill; it is timely, fair, workable and affordable.  I hope if the Government does not accept the Bill that it will at least give consideration at budget time to setting aside &euro;20 million, &euro;30 million or &euro;40 million to reduce Government charges by 2%, 3% or 4% and make the point that it understands that Government prices have to come down and that it understands the concept of fairness.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford"><NameTxt>Deputy Seymour Crawford</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this issue and the Minister for Social Protection for staying in the Chamber to respond to my comments.  An ongoing issue over the past 12 months is that the earnings of many farm families and self-employed people are being assessed on previous years&rsquo; income rather than actual income.</P>
        <P>The drop in income for farm families came as a direct result of the collapse of farm gate prices, such as the one third decrease in the price of milk.  This problem was exacerbated by extraordinarily bad weather conditions which forced farmers, particularly those in wetland areas, to purchase additional feeds for their animals.  One young family with whom I am acquainted relies on &euro;6.50 in social welfare benefits to support husband, wife and two children <Col N="486" />and had to raise money elsewhere to put food on the table.  This family&rsquo;s case was sent for appeal but it has not yet been resolved.  The family was not even able to get insulation aid.  Unfortunately, this is only one of many families facing hardship.</P>
        <P>Another young man who is self-employed in the furniture business applied for social welfare because he had no work or income.  He originally received &euro;9 per week but when his case was re-examined his benefits were increased to approximately &euro;100.  However, he did not receive a back payment.  Three of the furniture shops he supplied closed down, which is a clear indication of the difficulties this sector is facing.</P>
        <P>I was assured by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and departmental officials that the cases I describe are rare but farm organisations from all over the country have alerted me to similar problems.  I recently chaired a meeting of farm-related people in Cavan town at which two of the main issues discussed were the serious lack of finance and the failure of farm families and the self-employed to get social welfare benefits.</P>
        <P>One of the problems I have encountered in regard to self-employed builders is that inspectors are demanding the closure of businesses over C2 and VAT payments.  This is totally unacceptable and unrealistic because all that a self-employed builder wants to do is build.  Without his papers, he cannot even tender for the smallest jobs involving disability grants or school repairs.  These papers could give him the opportunity to return to employment and get off social welfare, thereby not only saving taxpayers&rsquo; money but also providing further tax revenue.  I accept the need for proper scrutiny but equally I see the need for realism and common sense at a time when self-employed families are coming under extraordinary pressure.</P>
        <P>On a more positive note, my local builder supplier has rehired full-time drivers for his ready mix concrete products.  This reveals that some level of activity is returning to the business sector.  The sun is shining and the price of milk has increased somewhat, thus perhaps reducing the pressure on the system.   It is unfair, however, that anyone should have to wait 12 months or longer for an appeal regarding an income which the Minister&rsquo;s predecessor, the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, Deputy Mary Hanafin, admitted no longer existed as a result of the failure of the building boom and decline in farm product prices.  As a member of the Committee on Social and Family Affairs, I had the opportunity to raise this issue with the previous Minister on numerous occasions.  She was positive and helpful and assured me that social welfare inspectors had been advised to take account of the serious fall in income, whether in farming or self-employment.  Unfortunately, however, the position remains difficult.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In all my years in the D&aacute;il I have found the social welfare structures and staff to be most understanding and, in the main, constructive.  Unfortunately, for whatever reason, a major difficulty has arisen in this area.  People, especially the young, are under severe pressure from both an economic point of view and mentally.  They did not want to be in the current position, nor did they ever dream they would be in this position.  I plead that the appeals be dealt with as a matter of urgency, files reviewed where possible and realistic payments made.</P>
        <P>I received a letter from the Minister dated 31 May 2010 and I appreciate the speed with which he replied to my correspondence.  The letter refers to a person who receives jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance at a rate of &euro;97.50 per week.  The individual in question does not have any income and until a few weeks ago received more than &euro;300 per week.  This figure was reduced to less than &euro;100 per week without any reason being given.  I hope the Minister, as an active politician who understands the problems experienced by those involved in this sector, will address this issue.  I would be pleased to go through the details of some cases with him.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank Deputy Crawford for raising this issue.  He is knowledgeable and sincere in this matter and presented his case in a fair manner.  One of the first things I did on being appointed to the Department of Social Protection was to ask the question the Deputy asked of me, namely, whether a person is assessed on the income of previous years.  I was told that this was not the case.  I will outline to the Deputy the manner in which the system is meant to work.</P>
        <P>Both jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and farm assist are means tested payments that are paid to persons who satisfy certain conditions.  Jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance is paid to unemployed persons who satisfy certain conditions set out in legislation that require, among others, that the person is unemployed, capable of work, available for work and genuinely seeking work.  To qualify for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance a person must also satisfy a means test.</P>
        <P>Legislation provides for the assessment of all income in cash and any non-cash benefits which the person or his or her spouse may reasonably expect to receive during the forthcoming year.  The means assessment guidelines state that where the income in the coming 12 months is not ascertainable, the income for the previous 12 months should be taken as a guide, allowing for any factors which it is known will vary.</P>
        <P>The means of a self-employed person are taken as any net profit he or she will earn in the coming 12 months.  While the person&rsquo;s income from the previous 12 months is used as an indication in estimating his or her likely future earnings, it is not simply assumed the previous year&rsquo;s earnings will be received in the coming year.  Instead, account is taken of the potential for significant upward or downward variations in income from one year to the next.  For example, if a self-employed person lost a contract and was unlikely to find a substitute contract in the coming year, this would be factored into the assessment of future income.</P>
        <P>It is recognised that the current downturn in the economy is having a significant impact on many self-employed persons, particularly those in the construction industry, and the consequent reduction in their income and activity levels would be reflected in any assessment of their means.</P>
        <P>Farm assist is a payment made to farmers who are aged between 18 and 66 years, engaged in farming and satisfy a means test.  The scheme takes into account both farm income and off-farm income of a farmer and spouse-partner.  Eligibility is based on actual means assessed being within specified income thresholds dependent upon family size.</P>
        <P>In carrying out the means test for farm assist the social welfare inspector seeks to establish the likely income of the farmer in the coming 12 months.  In doing this, the income in the previous 12 months is examined and allowance is made if there are factors which would affect anticipated income in the future, for example, a drop in the price of milk, increased fodder or farming costs.  As the social welfare officer is locally based, he or she will be familiar with farming issues in the locality.</P>
        <P>The means assessment is as follows.  Some 70% of self-employment income, including off-farm self-employment, is taken into account.  In this regard, the means test is more favourable than the scheme&rsquo;s predecessor, the unemployment assistance scheme for smallholders.  The child related disregards are &euro;254 for the first two children and &euro;381 for each subsequent qualified child.  In addition, income from the REP scheme is assessed separately, with the first &euro;2,540 and 50% of the balance disregarded.</P>
        <P>Assessment of capital for both jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance and farm assist is as follows.  The first &euro;20,000 is disregarded, the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;1 per &euro;1,000, the next &euro;10,000 is assessed at &euro;2 per &euro;1,000 and income over &euro;40,000 is assessed at &euro;4 per &euro;1,000.</P><Col N="488" />
        <P>Where a spouse of a jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or farm assist customer is working in insurable employment, the assessment is as follows.  Deductions from gross income are allowed for PRSI, the pension levy, superannuation, including AVCs and PRSAs, and union dues.  The person&rsquo;s net average assessable weekly earnings are assessed by reference to the previous 13 weeks or another period if this is more representative.  A disregard of &euro;20 a day for each day worked by the customer up to a maximum of three days per week applies up to a maximum of &euro;60 per week.  The balance is then assessed.</P>
        <P>If a self-employed person or the farm assist customer&rsquo;s position changes after he or she has made an initial claim for jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance-farm assist, he or she can apply to have his or her means reviewed in light of his or her changed circumstances.  In addition, it is open to the individual, if he or she is dissatisfied with the means assessed, to appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  I am aware that the Department is examining specific cases which the Deputy brought to attention following a recent meeting of the joint Oireachtas committee.</P>
        <P>I fully accept the point Deputy Crawford made on delays in social welfare appeals.  It is funny how some issues receive a great deal of publicity while others do not receive any publicity.  The published Social Welfare Bill includes a provision that allows the Department, as a temporary expedient, to re-employ retired social welfare appeals officers.  The Department needs skilled people to enable it to hear a large number of cases.  While we can discuss this issue further at another time, I am conscious of the appeals issue and it is the right of the customer to have his or her appeal adjudicated on quickly.  I am taking swift and immediate steps to try to rectify the matter and have no doubt I will receive the full support of Deputies on the other side.</P>
        <P Just="Left">On another issue debated over the weekend, the Department clearly faces challenges with regard to self-employed people.  For example, if a person has self-employed income, how does one know how much work he or she is doing each week?  The system is open to abuse.  I must examine novel ways to address this issue, while accepting the right of the self-employed to have an income.  The concept I am considering &mdash; Deputies will have read about it in various papers &mdash; is one in which I will give a person money provided he or she gives me time.  This is similar to the approach taken in the rural social scheme.  If a person gives a certain amount of time, we will give him or her money.  Such an approach would allow us to overcome the challenge we face in terms of how much work a self-employed person is doing.  Once I have been given a certain amount of time, the person in question can do self-employed work in the evenings.  That would not be a concern provided he or she pays tax.</P>
        <P>We must examine this issue.  I agree with the basic thesis that people should have a realistic valuation placed on their income.  We should go beyond this, however.  I am considering new ways of dealing with the issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CatherineByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting the issue of the regeneration programme in Dublin for discussion on the Adjournment.  In recent years, especially during the Celtic tiger, &ldquo;regeneration&rdquo; was the buzzword in Dublin and other urban centres.  For residents of flat complexes in my constituency of Dublin South Central, including St. Teresa&rsquo;s Gardens, St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate and Dolphin House, regeneration was the key to a new beginning.</P>
  
        <P>For many years, residents had been promised better living conditions and finally, through public private partnerships, their homes were to be repaired and, in some cases, rebuilt.  Many communities seized the opportunity with both hands and benefited from an injection of funding <Col N="489" />into local authority housing complexes.  An excellent example of this is Fatima Mansions in Rialto.</P>
        <P>With the downturn in the economy and a severe lack of funding, however, the chance for regeneration has passed by many communities.  People are left with empty promises and feel cast aside by a Government which is too busy helping the banks and developers, who brought this country to its knees.  Hundreds of local authority tenants are now living in substandard conditions with dampness, mould and sewage an everyday reality.  We were all shocked and horrified last week by the story of Dolphin House where residents are living in deplorable conditions with sewage coming up their sinks and black mould on the walls.  This is contributing to health problems such as asthma and bronchitis.</P>
        <P>A recent survey in Dolphin House showed that the number of residents reporting dampness in Dolphin House was 71%; the number of people reporting mould was 65%; and the number of people reporting sewage problems was 89%.  Many people say that these people pay very little rent.  Some residents in Dolphin House pay up to &euro;120 a week to live in these conditions.  How, in a developed country, can the Government and especially the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government stand by and do nothing?  The Government has a duty of care to the residents of these flat complexes, both through the housing Acts, and through public health requirements, but it chooses to ignore it.</P>
            <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The council claims its hands are tied because funding from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has dried up.  Nothing has dried up in Dolphin House and particularly not the sewage.  The Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, knows Dolphin House well as he has been there on many occasions.  Dolphin House and many other flat complexes have strong communities with people who are proud to live where they are.  Generations have grown up rooted in the community where they live.  They have supported the idea of regeneration from the start, initially through the consultation process and now through the development of a master plan for Dolphin House.  However, the problem of funding still remains, and once the master plan is complete, there is no certainty that change will happen.</P>
        <P>The bottom line is that the human rights of these people, their right to proper housing and sanitation, are being totally disregarded which is unacceptable and cannot continue.  It is vital that the Government takes action on the issue of housing conditions and on the broader issue of regeneration.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government must step up and take responsibility for the deplorable living conditions with which many residents of our city-centre flat complexes are forced to deal every day.  When I go home in the evening I can turn on my tap and have clear running water as, no doubt, can the Minister.  For many people in Dolphin House that does not happen.  The water running out of their taps is contaminated with sewage.  For many people living in Dolphin House when they put on their washing machines what comes out are clothes that are destroyed and need to be discarded.</P>
        <P>Residents are fed up with broken promises from the Government and want action.  We want the Government to take responsibility for all the residents of Dolphin House and St. Teresa&rsquo;s Gardens.  It is time to start again in order to give these people some chance of living in dignity in their homes.  I invite the Minister and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to visit Dolphin House again and to visit the homes of the many people who live there and need to deal with the conditions.  I believe in the regeneration of communities and I believe in strong communities.  I also believe that the people living in Dolphin House, St. Teresa&rsquo;s Gardens and St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate have rights.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.  As she rightly pointed out, I was in Dolphin House a number of times and I fully sympathise with the situation in which the residents find themselves.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s commitment to social housing takes a broad approach to supporting the development of sustainable communities.  A crucial element of this approach is our commitment to supporting the development of sustainable communities in existing local authority estates through various improvement and regeneration initiatives.  Regeneration, in particular, is focused on addressing social, educational and economic disadvantage experienced in areas of particular deprivation.</P>
        <P>In addition to improving the fabric of estates, each regeneration project takes a strategic approach to addressing the underlying causes of deprivation in the area, be they a lack of educational supports or community facilities or issues of anti-social behaviour.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government supports an ambitious regeneration programme with projects in most of our cities and across a number of regional towns.</P>
        <P>The Department is committed to a multiannual regeneration programme in Dublin city to help improve the lives and conditions of the communities involved.  It is reviewed on a regular basis with Dublin City Council with new projects added and additional elements of existing projects advanced as resources permit.  It is however a matter for Dublin City Council, in the first instance, to prioritise and manage the advancement of projects within the programme, having regard to its available funding.</P>
        <P>In the past decade the State has invested more than &euro;100 million in the Dublin City Council inner-city flats regeneration programme to improve the accommodation in the complexes and to address economic and social issues including anti-social behaviour.  Under the 2009 capital programme, &euro;12 million was provided for projects at Bridgefoot Street, Queen Street, Lourdes House and Se&aacute;n Treacy House.  Investment in approved projects at Poplar Row, Lourdes House, and Se&aacute;n Treacy House is continuing in 2010 with funding of almost &euro;9 million available to substantially complete the programme.</P>
        <P>In 2008, owing to the changing economic climate, the city council was not in a position to progress a number of projects under public private partnership arrangements.  The city council therefore suspended its PPP programme pending recovery in the market and established a multidisciplinary special housing taskforce to examine alternative options for the redevelopment, in particular, of the priority regeneration projects of St Michael&rsquo;s Estate, O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens and Dominick Street.  The taskforce&rsquo;s initial strategy for the phased development of these estates, incorporating the construction of social housing as phase one, was adopted by the city council in December 2008.  In support of this process, the Department has liaised closely with the council to ensure the former PPP regeneration projects are considered for inclusion in the national regeneration programme.</P>
        <P>Approval issued in 2009 to go to tender for phase one of the St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate project and funding of &euro;3.5 million is available to support the project this year.  Detailed proposals for the future redevelopment of O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens and Dominick Street are expected from the city council in 2010 or 2011 and in the meantime the council is continuing its strategy for the de-tenanting of these areas.  A second taskforce is now examining redevelopment options for a further group of projects including Croke Villas, Dolphin House and St. Teresa&rsquo;s Gardens.</P>

        <P>The regeneration of long-established communities requires sensitive management and, for long-term success, a consensus approach to the development of proposals is important.  In this regard the city council, in addition to addressing ongoing management and maintenance issues, is working with residents to develop regeneration solutions that are acceptable to the community and that can be implemented.  It will be up to Dublin City Council to decide on the <Col N="491" />type of regeneration proposal that is most appropriate for each area and to decide on the means by which each of the projects should be delivered.  It is then a matter for the council to submit a proposal in the usual way for approval and funding from within the authority&rsquo;s annual social housing funding allocation.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue on behalf of the pupils and their parents, in Bruff and surrounding communities.  Ard Scoil Mhuire, FCJ, in Bruff has proposed that the school will be closed in two to three years unless an alternative solution can be found.  I am asking the Minister to intervene with an alternative solution to allow the school to continue to survive.  The school has in excess of 250 pupils and most pupils from the primary school in Bruff transfer to the Ard Scoil Mhuire secondary school.  The school is very concerned about the situation that has arisen. This decision was taken without consultation with members of the community representative body.</P>
        
        <P>The FCJ school is a magnificent institution with a history of great all-round education.  For a long number of years pupils excelled academically, socially and on the sports field.  The local community, which has contributed so much to the school in partnership with successive generations of FCJ sisters over the past 150 years, feels it has been shut out of the decision making on this matter.  The school is a central element of the community and its closure will have a detrimental impact not only on the education of our children, but on the social and business balance of the community as a whole.  Pupils receive a personalised education and teachers go out of their way to help them on both a personal and educational level.  Many of these children have been together since play-school and have developed strong ties not only with each other but with the community.  There is an enormous community aspect to the school.</P>
        <P>The adverse effect the proposed closure of Ard Scoil Mhuire will have on the pupils, who relate so well to the school, is of extreme concern.  Local housing has been purchased by families with young children who need to be adjacent to a school.  The school has attracted people to live in Bruff.  There is also a good relationship between the school and older residents, many of whom take part in a project which involves pupils training senior members of the community to use computers.  Closing the school would create an imbalance in the area leaving fewer young people and many elderly residents in the area.  I cannot believe there is a compelling or any argument for closing the school, particularly in light of the fact that Bruff has a growing community and the school population is expected to grow rather than shrink in the coming years.  Financial proposals put forward showed how funding could be secured, not only from people in the parish of Bruff but from several of the neighbouring parishes.</P>
        <P>I would like to provide a brief history of the school.  The sisters of the Faithful Companions of Jesus, FCJs, arrived in Bruff from France in 1856 at the invitation of the then parish priest, Dean Cussen, and provided for primary and secondary schooling for girls.  The building commenced in that year.  In 1987, an addition or extension to the school building provided seven classrooms, a home economics room, a kitchen and staff room.  I put it to the Minister that the Department should support the continuation of the school.  Due to the fact the FCJ sisters propose to pull out, the Department needs to intervene to ensure the school&rsquo;s contribution to the educational needs of Bruff and the surrounding communities continues into the future.</P>

	<P>I am pleased to take this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Mary Coughlan, the Minister for Education and Skills.  I thank Deputy Neville for raising this matter as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to the House the current position with regard to Ard Scoil Mhuire, Bruff.</P><Col N="492" />
        <P>In general, the forward planning section of the Department has identified in excess of 40 priority areas throughout the country where significant additional accommodation will be required at primary and post-primary level in the medium term.  Factors under consideration include population growth, demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and capacity of existing schools to meet demand for places.  Having considered these factors, decisions will be taken on the means by which emerging needs will be met within the area.</P>
        <P>Ard Scoil Mhuire FCJ was originally established in 1859 as an all girls boarding school.  The school went co-educational from 1969 and the boarding school closed in 2001.  The school has experienced a steady decline in enrolment in recent years.  Since 2000-01, enrolment has declined by 29% from 379 students to 268 students in the 2009-10 school year.  The Department of Education and Skills is not in receipt of any current application for major funding from the school authority.  However, the school has, in recent years, received a number of capital grants for works of a small to medium scale nature to ensure that the building remains in reasonable condition and can continue to serve the needs of the pupils enrolled.  These grants have included a grant for a new dust extraction system, which was approved for the school in 2004 at a cost of over &euro;28,000.  In addition, the Department approved funding in the amount of &euro;82,643 for toilet facilities under the summer works scheme in 2007.</P>
        <P>However, I understand the school authority did not proceed with this project due to issues relating to the school building being a listed building.  The Department also approved &euro;74,881 for a home economics room upgrade under the summer works scheme 2009 and these moneys have been drawn down.  In May 2009, the Department approved &euro;260,717 under the emergency works scheme for electrical upgrade works at the school.  I understand that these works were completed in 2009.</P>
        <P>In more recent times, Department officials have had a series of meetings with the trustees of the school.  The trustees expressed some concern about the future viability of the school in light of the trend in enrolments at the school in recent years, which as I have mentioned earlier, have declined to the current level of 268 students.  At these meetings, the trustees of the school indicated to the officials that they were considering a number of options in relation to the future of the school and its viability.  The Department understands that the trustees have subsequently met with the school community, including the board of management, staff and representatives of parents from the school to inform them of their concerns on its viability.  However, as yet, the trustees have not formally notified the Department of Education and Skills regarding their intentions as to the long term future of the school.  When the trustees have formally notified the Department on this matter, the situation will be considered further.</P>
        <P>As part of this consideration, the Department will review overall provision of post-primary education in the area and the situation of other post-primary schools nearby, with a view to devising a long-term solution which meets the requirements of the broader community, while also providing value for money in terms of education provision.  This will also take into account demographic trends and the overall pattern of enrolments in the area, both at post-primary level and also at primary level, with a view to identifying likely future requirements at post-primary level in this area.</P>
        <P>I again thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the current position regarding Ard Scoil Mhuire.</P>

      <Title>Tipperary Hostel Project</Title>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me raise this matter on the Adjournment.  Work was suspended recently on the Tipperary hostel project.  The project was <Col N="493" />set up by a voluntary group in Tipperary town to restore an old famine building as a hostel project.  Anybody who knows Tipperary town and area is aware this the project is in a RAPID town area.  I understand financial contributions were made to the project by various Departments and, in particular, from the dormant accounts fund.  The moneys were provided to support the development of the project and to support employment in a town such as Tipperary where there is a great need for employment and capable and skilled workers were recruited to carry out work on the project.  Unfortunately, however, some weeks ago announcements were made in the media to the effect that the project was being stopped.  People living in the locality find it difficult to understand why it has been stopped when the project is at the half-way stage.  A great deal of voluntary work and effort, for which those involved must be commended, has been invested in this project.  However, the project is only half-finished and the hostel, which contains a number of beautifully refurbished rooms, cannot be opened.</P>
        <P>When I visited the site some weeks ago, I met 25 extremely disappointed men, skilled bricklayers, plasterers, stonecutters, carpenters and electricians, who had been informed that their services were no longer required on the project.  I understand that they may be given places on projects in other communities &mdash; an eventuality which came to pass in recent days for some of them.</P>
        <P>I am concerned that if the site is merely locked up and abandoned, it will be vandalised in the years to come.  As a result, a huge amount of taxpayers&rsquo; money will have been wasted.  I request that the funding required to complete the project be given to the local authority or some other agency in order that the work can be brought to a conclusion.  If work were completed, the hostel could be sold off as a going concern.  There is a great need for a hostel of this kind in the area.  It is located within walking distance of a railway station and there are many tourist attractions in west Tipperary.  As a result, real potential exists in the context of creating long-term employment in the tourism sector.  The Tipperary hostel project could be of major assistance in this regard.</P>
        <P>I do not know what is contained in the Minister of State&rsquo;s reply.  The downside of raising a matter on the Adjournment is that one does not know in advance what a Minister is likely to say.  I urge him to ensure that the money that has already been spent does not go to waste.  A way to revive the project must be found.  The shutters must not be pulled down.  Instead, we must build on the great work that has already been done in the locality.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Haughey</NameTxt>
	<P>I am replying to this matter on behalf of my colleague, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Mary Coughlan.  I thank the Deputy for raising the matter because it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the House the position in respect of the Tipperary hostel project.</P>
        <P>The Tipperary hostel project is a community-based project managed by Tipperary Hostel Project Ltd. and its objective is the transformation of a famine-era workhouse in Tipperary town into self-catering accommodation for tourists.  Since 2000, the project has been successful in securing the support and resources of a number of local agencies, notably F&Aacute;S, Tipperary Town Council, South Tipperary County Council, the South Tipperary County Enterprise Board, and the Tipperary Leader group, which provided funds towards a feasibility study, as well as being the subject of local voluntary fundraising initiatives.  The scheme of works to renovate and restore this former poorhouse has been in progress since 2000, with an original completion date for the capital elements of sometime in 2006 or 2007.</P>
        <P>Upon completion, the facility was expected to operate primarily as a local community-based hostel under community and voluntary management.  The income generating feature was expected to finance further educational and training modules on traditional trades and crafts, hosting local, county, regional, national and international residential workshops in Tipperary, which has a very rich history in such artisan work.</P><Col N="494" />
        <P>The former Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursement Board approved a capital grant of &euro;300,000 for the project in January 2005.  Some &euro;284,000 of this has been drawn down to date.  Pobal manages this grant on behalf of the former board.  An additional grant of &euro;30,000 was approved by the Government for the company to allow it to recruit a project manager.  These funds were approved under the dormant accounts fund RAPID additionality measure administered by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  I understand that Department became aware of allegations made against this company at approximately the same time that the matters featured in the national press &mdash; that is, 12 March &mdash; and immediately instructed Pobal to examine the matter.  Pobal&rsquo;s audit services commenced an examination of the company and issued its draft audit report to the board of the company on 26 April.  As is normal practice, the board was asked to respond to the issues raised by the audit.</P>
        <P>The grants approved for the company are currently suspended pending completion of the audit report and a recommendation from the board of Pobal as to the future action required.  I understand the head of internal audit at F&Aacute;S has recently been in contact with the head of internal audit at Pobal regarding this matter.</P>
        <P>As part of the job initiative programme, F&Aacute;S contracted with Tipperary Hostels Ltd. to provide staff to work on the project.  The main purpose of the job initiative programme is to assist long-term unemployed people to prepare for work opportunities by providing participants with work experience, training and development opportunities.  The programme is sponsored by voluntary organisations and public bodies involved in not-for-profit activities.  There are 21 job initiative participants, including one team leader and one assistant leader, involved in this project.</P>
        <P>F&Aacute;S provides financial support to assist with the job initiative programme, for example, in the form of participant wages.  In addition, while on the programme, participants can retain entitlements such as medical cards or child dependent allowance and be eligible for others such as revenue job assist.  The project sponsors have informed F&Aacute;S that they are currently not in position to provide funding for materials and that the project cannot continue.  Therefore, they no longer have a requirement for the job initiative participants.</P>
        <P>Following changes introduced on 10 November 2004 by the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, no new entrants have been admitted onto job initiative schemes.  However, contracts for existing participants are renewed thereby providing them with the option to continue until they are 65 years of age.  In order to support the service being provided, community employment participants replace participants who leave job initiatives voluntarily or through retirement.</P>
        <P>I understand that F&Aacute;S is actively seeking alternative employment for the participants.  I further understand that the job initiative participants involved were notified by F&Aacute;S on Monday, 31 May 2010 that they will be offered transfers to other job initiative places on the F&Aacute;S-funded community employment scheme within the locality as soon as possible.  In the meantime, I understand that they are continuing to be paid by F&Aacute;S.</P>
        <P>Again, I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and for allowing me to clarify the position as it currently stands.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TomHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Tom Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Minister of State might seek clarification for me in respect of the likely future of the hostel project.  The latter goes to the heart of this issue.</P>

	<P>I propose to present the information on reports commissioned by the Department of Defence since July 1997 in the manner requested by the Deputy in reverse chronological order.</P>
        <P>In 2009 the Department commissioned four reports as follows:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Deloitte were commissioned to undertake a review of the Finance Branch of the Department.  The objective of the review was to examine the business processes, procedures and organisational structures in operation in Finance Branch and to provide a report making recommendations for improvements in order to maximise efficiency and effectiveness.  The cost of the review was &euro;80,550.  The review is now being implemented and is delivering staff savings and improvements in efficiency and effectiveness.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Version 1 Ltd were commissioned to provide a report in respect of Oracle licence management in the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces.  The results of this report will assist in the formulation of policy and practice in the area of licence management. The cost of the report was &euro;2,308.</P><Col N="496" />
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Department commissioned an independent review of documentation in relation to a legal action initiated by a staff member. No implementation measures were required on foot of the report.  The cost of the report was &euro;2,430.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Department commissioned an independent quality assessment of the Value for Money Review of Naval Service Vessel Maintenance, as part of the standard VFM process.  The cost of the report was &euro;2,800.</P>
        <P>In 2008 the Department commissioned four reports as follows:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />PA Consultant Group were commissioned to make recommendations on the best means of meeting the medical requirements of the Defence Forces.  The cost of this review was &euro;95,000.  The consultancy focused on the sustainable provision of the relevant medical expertise and services to the Defence Forces.  The consultants recommended a programme of major change, implementation of which is ongoing.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Entograph Ltd were commissioned to carry out a report for the control of bracken in the Glen of Imaal.  The report cost &euro;30,129 and the advice contained in it has been implemented.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Mott McDonald Ltd were commissioned to carry out a review of the Safety Policy at Casement Aerodrome in Baldonnel.  The cost of this review was &euro;50,000 and the recommendations have been implemented.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />FGS Consulting were engaged to undertake a Value for Money Review of Military Training Lands.  This review is part of a programme agreed between the Department of Defence and the Department of Finance as part of the Government&rsquo;s Value for Money and Policy Review initiative.  The review is at an advanced stage and it is anticipated that this report will be completed in the near future.  The total value of the contract is &euro;90,000 and expenditure to date amounts to &euro;60,500.</P>
        <P FLI="0">In 2007 two reviews were commissioned as follows:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />TNS MRBI were commissioned to carry out research into the issue of Recruitment and Retention of Women in the Defence Forces.  The research tested women&rsquo;s attitudes to military life and a career in the Defence Forces.  The cost incurred was &euro;47,746.60. The result of this market research has assisted in the formulation of policy and practice in this area.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Department commissioned an independent quality assessment of the Value for Money Review of Clothing Procurement in the Defence Forces, as part of the standard VFM process.  The cost of the report was &euro;2,904.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I have dealt comprehensively with the decision by the Government on 30 March 2010 to withdraw the Irish contingent from the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic and Chad (MINURCAT) and the reasons for that decision. I can assure the House that it was not a decision the Government wanted to have to make and I have expressed my regret at how events unfolded in relation to the MINURCAT mission.</P>
        <P>The priority for the Department of Defence now is to achieve an orderly withdrawal from Chad. The Irish contingent deployed with MINURCAT was withdrawn in May 2010 and the recovery of equipment and assets is ongoing.  Some personnel remain on site to oversee this process.</P>
        <P>The 2010 Defence Estimate contained the provision to sustain the Irish contingent on this mission. It also provided for receipts from the UN in the form of Appropriations-in-Aid. Savings will arise over the remainder of the year in respect of overseas allowances and logistics. <Col N="498" />However, some budgeted receipts from the UN will not now be received. The withdrawal from Chad will incur expenses not provided for in the 2010 Defence Estimate. Furthermore, negotiations will be undertaken with the UN regarding reimbursement in respect of aspects of the cost of the withdrawal. It is not possible at this stage, therefore, to establish the net impact of the withdrawal on the 2010 Defence Estimate.</P>
        <P>If this process results in a net saving for the Defence Vote in 2010 I will take a view on its treatment when the nature of such a saving is known.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 52 together.</P>
        <P>The primary responsibility for the maintenance of law and order rests with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Defence Forces, pursuant to their role of rendering aid to the civil power, assist An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as required.  The Defence Forces, in conjunction with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, keep the threat level under continual review.</P>
        <P>The military authorities have informed me that, having regard to the threat level and other security considerations, they are of the view that there has been no increase in the threat level in the Border region which would warrant the deployment of additional resources generally to the area.  There has also been no request from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for additional assistance such as would warrant a general increase in the level of personnel deployed in  border areas.</P>
        <P>In relation to EOD teams, the locations of the explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) teams are under constant review with the teams being positioned to service areas of greatest demand.  There have been 78 EOD call-outs nationwide so far this year with 23 of those call-outs being hoaxes.  Of that number, 5 were call-outs in the Border area with two being hoaxes.  This represents a very small percentage of overall call outs for the EOD teams. However, the Defence Forces have put in place a number of measures that should reduce the response times for the EOD teams across the country.  This includes the pre-positioning of some equipment in the Border region.</P>

	<P>Since the late 1990&rsquo;s, the Defence Forces have participated in peace support operations in the Western Balkans through their  troop presence in the UN mandated NATO-led KFOR mission in Kosovo and in the UN mandated EU-led Operation ALTHEA (formerly SFOR)  in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</P><Col N="499" />
        <P>As outlined in the budget in December 2009, it had been decided that the Defence Forces commitments to overseas peace support operations would be scaled back in 2010 in response to the budgetary expenditure reductions. It had been decided to drawdown the Defence Forces personnel serving with EUFOR&rsquo;s Operation ALTHEA in Bosnia and Herzegovina in July 2010.  This was based on an expectation that the transition of the EUFOR mission to a training and support mission would be well in train by that time. Moreover, it was also expected that the UN mission in Chad and the Central African Republic, MINURCAT would be the mainstay of our overseas operations for the foreseeable future. However, the transition to a smaller training and support mission is now expected to be completed in December 2010 and, in the meantime, the Defence Forces contingent has been withdrawn from Chad.</P>
        <P>Against that background and following a request by EUFOR&rsquo;s Operation Commander, as I informed the House last month, I have decided to defer the drawdown of the Irish contingent from EUFOR, originally scheduled for July 2010,  until the end of 2010.  The Irish contingent will remain at its current level of 43 personnel.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35, 47 and 81 together.</P>
        <P>The Reserve Defence Force&rsquo;s most important contribution, as outlined in the White Paper on Defence (2000), is to support the Permanent Defence Force in its contingency defence roles in an emergency situation. As such, in peacetime, the main function of the Reserve Defence Force is to train and prepare for these contingency roles. This accounts for the majority of Reserve expenditure.</P>
        <P>The White Paper on Defence (2000), outlined an important change that RDF personnel should be considered for participation in overseas peace support missions, subject to appropriate qualifications, availability and advance training. This was identified as being an important motivational factor for Reservists.</P>
        <P>The Reserve Defence Force Review Implementation Plan provided for a phased development of Reserve capabilities over the period to end 2009. It was anticipated that the improvements in capability delivered as part of the plan would contribute to facilitating a small number of Reservists with specialised skills serving on overseas peace support operations.</P>
        <P>The military authorities had planned that Reservists would be drawn for overseas service from within the ranks of the integrated Reserve. A pilot integration programme was conducted in 2007 and continued into 2008. The numbers participating in these pilots was disappointing with just under 300 Reserve personnel participating.</P><Col N="500" />
        <P>To date, the operational requirements for overseas service have been met from within the Permanent Defence Force, without recourse to Reserve capabilities. The military authorities had identified a small number of overseas posts requiring specific skills that might be filled by members of the Reserve and had sought expressions of interest from suitably qualified Reservists who had undertaken integrated training.</P>
        <P>The identification of Reservists, who may have been eligible and willing to apply for these overseas positions, was at an advanced stage in early 2009. Any commitment to overseas service by members of the Reserve was to be on a voluntary basis and a final decision in regards to their deployment was dependent on the selected personnel completing an extensive training schedule to up-skill to the requisite military standards to enable them to serve overseas.</P>
        <P>In March 2009, the Government introduced a moratorium on recruitment to the Public Service.  This moratorium prevented the planned recruitment of members of the Reserve to the PDF for the purpose of overseas service, as intended.  Reductions in the Defence payroll budget at that time also limited the scope for payment of additional personnel.  Accordingly, plans to send members of the Reserve overseas were suspended.  As the pilot project to send a small number of Reservists overseas by end 2009 was at an advanced stage, its suspension was a disappointing development for all concerned.</P>
        <P>As outlined in the budget in December 2009, Defence Forces commitments to overseas peace support operations are being scaled back in 2010.  As a consequence, the number of PDF personnel serving overseas has reduced and there are no plans to send members of the Reserve overseas for the foreseeable future.</P>
        <P>The terms of conditions for members of the Reserve who may be eligible to serve overseas in the future will be developed as appropriate.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, emergency planning in this country is based on the &lsquo;lead department&rsquo; principle. This means that each department is responsible for assessing the risks, making appropriate plans and leading the response to those emergencies that impact on its areas of responsibility.</P>
        <P>The Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, which I chair, supports coordination in emergency planning across government departments and agencies. It is a forum for the sharing of information and best practice and it meets regularly to discuss emergency planning issues and hear expert advice.</P>
        <P>In December 2008, the Government noted the document entitled &lsquo;Roles and Responsibilities in Emergency Planning&rsquo;. This document, for the first time, identified the lead department and the supporting departments and agencies in over 40 emergency scenarios. It was prepared by the Office of Emergency Planning and was agreed by the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning.</P><Col N="501" />
        <P>The Department of Justice &amp; Law Reform is designated as the lead department in coordinating the response to national security related incidents (including terrorism).</P>
        <P>The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is designated as the lead department in coordinating the national level response to severe weather emergencies. During the recent severe weather events, that Department chaired meetings of the National Emergency Response Committee, which included senior representatives from Government Departments, the Defence Forces, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, Met Eireann, the National Roads Authority and other State Agencies that supported the response. The Committee examined all of the issues arising from the severe weather. It provided a forum for sharing of information and helped to bring about a coordinated &lsquo;whole of government&rsquo; response.</P>
        <P>The National Emergency Coordination Centre was activated in support of the National Emergency Response Committee. Staff from the Office of Emergency Planning (civil and military) managed the Centre on an ongoing basis during the period of the emergency.</P>
        <P>It should be stressed that the principal operational response to severe weather emergencies takes place at the local level and is coordinated by the local authorities in accordance with the arrangements set out in the Framework for Major Emergency Management.</P>
        <P>As in all emergency situations, lessons can be learned. As Chair of the Government Task Force on Emergency Planning, I have asked every department and agency involved in dealing with the severe weather events to review its response so that we can learn from the experience gained during these emergencies.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38, 41, and 55 together.</P>
        <P>The PA Report assessed the current arrangements for the provision of medical services and proposed a model for future delivery of those services.   The Consultants recommended a programme of major change.</P><Col N="502" />
        <P>As recommended by PA, Working Groups have been set up to progress the various projects identified. These continue to meet regularly and all have submitted reports.</P>
        <P>While none of the 7 recommendations from the PA Report have been completely implemented, the programme of implementation is progressing. In particular the Steering Group has:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Approved the high level organisation for the unit, which now includes a Line officer in the rank of Colonel commanding the Medical Corps.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Authorised the immediate introduction of a single annual medical for all Defence Forces personnel.</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Directed, following the findings and recommendations of the Future Medical Information System Working Group, that all Medical Corps personnel will implement the Personnel Management System Medical Module.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Directed the establishment of formal links with the Medical Council, the Health Services Executive, Royal College of Surgeons etc. to explore external training for Doctors in the Defence Forces Medical Services.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Progress has also been made on implementation of many of the other  PA recommendations including the development of medical officer lead care teams and the re-focusing of medical staff on appropriate clinical tasks.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Line officer, in the rank of Colonel, to command the new Centralised Medical Unit for the Medical Corps is to take up duty within the next 2 weeks.</P>
        <P>Final Reports from the Training &amp; Education and the Financial Arrangements &amp; Outsourcing Working Groups have been completed and will be considered by the Steering Group in the coming weeks.  A draft of the Future Medical Information System working group final report is currently being considered by members of the group and will be finalised shortly.</P>
        <P>The date of receipt of the final report from the Organisation &amp; Establishment Working Group has been extended until 30 June 2010 to enable that Group to have  full consideration of the reports of the other Working Groups. The Clinical Review Working Group is not due to submit its final report until 30 September 2010.  However, monthly reports are being submitted in the interim. It is only following completion of this phase that full implementation of the PA recommendations can be achieved. It is not my intention to publish the final reports of the working groups as they are internal consultative papers whose function is to inform and advise senior management.</P>
        <P>The process for implementation also requires that consultation with the Representative Associations must take place regarding any change within the scope of representation.  Publication of the Working Group reports would not be appropriate considering the discussions, which will take place with the Representative Associations under the Conciliation and Arbitration scheme in the near future.</P>
        <P>It is expected that there will be substantial progress before the end of the year in implementing recommendations. Some issues will be resolved quickly while others will require significant consideration and will for example require negotiation with the Representative Associations.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 157 together.</P>
        <P>Within the available resources, the Government is committed to maintaining the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at a level of 10,000 all ranks, for which Government approval has been secured in the context of Budget 2010.  This reflects the reductions in personnel recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Targeted recruitment will be carried out in 2010 to maintain the operational capability of the Defence Forces.  In this regard, I have recently approved the recruitment of 40 Recruits for the Naval Service' applications for which close at the end of this week.  Further recruitment to the Permanent Defence Force along with issues relating to promotions and acting appointments are kept under ongoing review.</P>
        <P>The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women throughout the Defence Forces and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities. It is on this basis that recruitment is undertaken.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Military authorities that the number of female personnel serving in the Permanent Defence Force on 30 April 2010, the latest date for which figures are currently available, was 564, of which 461 were serving in the Army, 33  in the Air Corps and 70 in the Naval Service.  In terms of ranks, the breakdown of female personnel serving on 30 April 2010 was 143 Officers, 169 Non Commissioned Officers, 239 Privates and 13 Cadets.  The percentage of female personnel serving on 30 April was 5.7% of the overall strength of the Force on that date.</P>
        <P>I am further advised by the Military authorities that in the two year period, 1 June 2008 &mdash; 31 May 2010, the number of female personnel who either retired, took early retirement or were administratively discharged from the Defence Forces, amounted to 31.</P>
        <P>Unlike many other national armed forces, the Defence Forces have no restrictions as regards the assignment of men or women to the full range of operational and administrative duties.  All promotions and career courses are open to both genders on merit.</P>
        <P>The Defence Forces prides itself on providing a gender neutral working environment.  Policies on equality are being constantly communicated to all ranks.  The military authorities are alert and vigilant to this issue and are committed to addressing this matter in a continuing and proactive manner.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 50 and 153 together.</P>
        <P>A vessel replacement strategy for the Naval Service is currently in progress following the commencement of a tender competition in 2007.  The competition sought tenders for the purchase of two Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs), with an option for a third, and one Extended Patrol Vessel (EPV), with an option for a second.  The process comprised two stages &mdash; Stage 1, a Request for Proposals and Stage 2, an Invitation to Tender.</P>
        <P>During 2008, Stage 1 of the tender process was completed and, insofar as the OPVs are concerned, tenders were received in response to Stage 2.  Following tender evaluation, a preferred bidder was selected last year and contract negotiations have taken place.  The decision to proceed with the final award of contract to purchase the OPVs is subject to Government approval and agreement on funding. Subject to such approval, delivery of the new vessels would be expected to commence on a phased basis from 2014.</P>
        <P>The Naval Vessel Replacement Programme was considered as part of the Estimates and budgetary process for 2010.  This included consideration of the report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes.</P>
        <P>In that regard, the particular recommendation in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes was that the Naval Service Vessel Replacement Programme be extended over a longer timeframe than initially envisaged.</P>
        <P>The acquisition of new ships for the Naval Service is a key focus for me as Minister for Defence. It is, however, imperative that the Department and the Defence Forces look to whatever efficiencies we can  make, taking into account the current difficult economic environment and the overall financial envelope available for the Department for major  acquisitions such as new ships over the coming years. The budgetary situation will dictate the level of funding available for new equipment and upgrades in that period and decisions have to be made accordingly.</P>
        <P>The acquisition of modern new vessels will ensure that the Service will be fully equipped to carry out its day to day roles in enforcing the State&rsquo;s sovereign rights over our waters and our fisheries and meeting Ireland&rsquo;s obligations in the area of maritime safety and security and fisheries protection. This strategy combined with a continuous process of refurbishment and repair will ensure that the operational capability of the Naval Service is maintained at a satisfactory level.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 77 together.</P>
        <P>A Board of Officers was convened in 2009 to examine the introduction of a Roll Over Protection System (ROPS) for use in military trucks. Following submission of the Board&rsquo;s report to the relevant military authorities in July 2009, a decision was reached to modify 100 Troop Carrying Vehicles (TCVs) to accept ROPS and to fit ROPS units to 50 Troop Carrying Vehicles initially.</P>
        <P>The contract for the provision of the Roll Over Protection Systems (ROPS) to the Defence Forces was awarded in January 2010 following an open tender completion. The contract was placed with an Irish company, Transport Component Distributors Limited. The work was completed in the first five months of this year.</P>
        <P>The ROPS units are modular in design and can be removed with ease when requirements arise to use TCVs for the carriage of equipment or stores. Future requirements will be the subject of further review later this year. The contract was valued at &euro;571,000 (incl VAT).</P>
        <P>The safety of our troops is paramount at all times. The provision of the ROPS is an important step for the Defence Forces given that it has been a top priority for the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces from the health and safety perspective in recent years. The provision of the new system will ensure that all personnel being carried for operational and training purposes on troop carrying vehicles will be afforded a significantly increased level of safety while in transit.</P>

	<P>A National Emergency Plan for Nuclear Accidents (NEPNA) has been in place since 1992.  In 1998, the Government decided to improve the NEPNA by enhancing the speed and quality of decision making by committees in the event and immediate aftermath of a nuclear accident. This plan provides a framework for the national response to a large scale nuclear accident.</P>
        <P>A Service Level Agreement (SLA) exists between the Defence Forces, the Department of Defence, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The role of the Defence Forces and the Department <Col N="507" />of Defence in the NEPNA is coordinated through the Emergency Response Coordinating Committee (ERCC). The Reserve Defence Forces, as a constituent part of the Defence Forces, have been assigned the role of radiological monitoring for the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>In order to fulfil the radiological monitoring roles assigned to the RDF, the Radiological Monitoring Section of the Directorate of the Reserve Defence Forces coordinates, maintains and trains qualified personnel in twenty seven (27) specified locations nationwide. These personnel are responsible for all monitoring equipment held by them in these locations.  A specific training syllabus provides for the instruction of RDF personnel in radiological monitoring.</P>
        <P>Radiological and Meteorological Monitoring Exercises (RadMon) are conducted annually and all recordings are submitted to the RPII and to the Directorate of Operations, Defence Forces Headquarters. The Radiological Monitoring Section, located at Kickham Barracks, Clonmel, is responsible for initiating, controlling and reporting on each exercise conducted.  RadMon exercises are designed to practice staff involved in the collection and correlating of material and data gathered.</P>
        <P>Exercises have been conducted annually since the inception of the NEPNA.  It is envisaged that a RadMon exercise will be conducted in the second half of 2010. In addition to these annual exercises, training has been and continues to be conducted by staff of Directorate of the Reserve Defence Forces in order to ensure a suitable pool of qualified personnel is available at all times.  There are no plans to change the role of the RDF in relation to radiological monitoring.</P>

	<P>The question of the recruitment of Non-Irish Nationals to the Defence Forces is not a new one.  Defence Force Regulations have always allowed for the recruitment of non-Irish nationals to the Defence Forces.  Entry to the Permanent Defence Force is either through the Cadetship Competition, Apprenticeship Competition, General Service Enlistment or Direct Entry Competitions which are held to fill vacancies in <Col N="508" />specialist appointments.  All applicants for each of these entry streams are required to meet qualifying criteria.</P>
        <P>There are generally more applicants for positions in the Defence Forces than places available.  The Department and the Defence Forces are fully committed to ensuring that all suitably qualified candidates who wish to do so are given the opportunity to join the Defence Forces.  The primary focus in recruitment is to attract people with the core competencies required by the Defence Forces.</P>
        <P>Non-Irish Nationals have been and are currently employed in the Permanent Defence Force, but this has mainly been in certain specialised areas.</P>
        <P>In terms of statistics, it is not the Defence Forces approach to categorise personnel by nationality or place of birth.  However I am aware that currently 8 of the 20 Medical Officers in the Defence Forces are Non Irish Nationals.</P>
        <P>An applicant who is a native born or naturalised citizen of another EU Member State may be enlisted into the Defence Forces providing they meet the same criteria as Irish nationals and are security cleared.  Consequently there are no specific arrangements with Member States of the EU in relation to the recruitment of Non-Irish Nationals to the Irish Permanent Defence Force.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 to 59, inclusive, 66, 82 and 149 together.</P>
        <P>Ireland has offered, through the UN Standby Arrangements System (UNSAS), to provide up to 850 military personnel for overseas service at any one time.  This figure equates to some 10% of Ireland&rsquo;s standing Army (excluding Reserves) and demonstrates Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the cause of international peace.  This is the maximum sustainable commitment that Ireland can make to overseas peacekeeping operations.</P>
        <P>With regard to future deployments, Ireland receives requests, from time to time, in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis.  When considering any particular request, the existence of realistic objectives and a clear mandate, which has the potential to contribute to a political solution, consideration of how the mission relates to the priorities of Irish foreign policy and the degree of risk involved are amongst the factors considered.</P><Col N="510" />
        <P>Apart from a recent EU request to despatch members of the Permanent Defence Force for service with the EU Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) military mission to contribute to the training of Somali Security Forces (EUTM Somalia) being carried out in Uganda, no other deployments are planned or envisaged at this time.  Five (5) Irish personnel took up duty with the mission at the end of April 2010. No requests have been received from the UN for deployment of personnel to other UN missions.</P>
        <P>On 30 March 2010 the Government decided to withdraw the Irish contingent from the United Nations Mission in Chad and the Central African Republic (MINURCAT) for logistical reasons and lack of clarity regarding the renewal and nature of the mandate beyond mid-May 2010.  Personnel of the 102nd Infantry Battalion were withdrawn from the mission last month. On 25 May 2010, the United Nations Security Council decided to terminate the MINURCAT mission by the end of the year.  Under the new mandate, the Government of Chad assumes full responsibility for the protection of civilians, a responsibility that was originally assigned to the military component of the MINURCAT mission.  Consequently, no discussions have taken place with the Department of Foreign Affairs on the resumption of the military element of the mission&rsquo;s mandate.  A small number of Irish personnel are currently being retained at the Force Headquarters bringing the current total of Defence Forces personnel serving overseas to 167.</P>
        <P>Following the return later this month of the Irish contingent-owned equipment from Chad, the Defence Forces will undertake the essential and extensive maintenance of equipment.  We have also begun the process of examining further options for Defence Forces overseas operations.</P>
        <P>I would like to assure the House that I am aware that participation in overseas operations over the years has given Defence Forces personnel the opportunity to develop skills and competencies through practice in actual operational situations. Personnel of the Permanent Defence Force will continue to receive ongoing training to enable them to participate fully in UN, EU and other missions overseas.  Indeed, over the years Ireland has built up a fine reputation in the field of international peacekeeping and a considerable volume of international goodwill has resulted.</P>

	<P>The Irish Coast Guard has overall responsibility for the provision of Search and Rescue, (SAR) services within the Irish Search and Rescue region.  In accordance with the roles assigned to them by Government in the White Paper on Defence, the Defence Forces are committed to providing support to the civil authorities including in relation to Search and Rescue.  In this regard, the Air Corps provides support to the Coast Guard as the need arises and within its available capability.</P>
        <P>The Air Corps was withdrawn from Maritime SAR in 2004 following operational difficulties in the provision of a consistent and satisfactory level of service.</P>
        <P>The Department of Transport at the outset of its deliberative process into the purchase of new SAR helicopters invited the Department of Defence to nominate a person to the Future Helicopter Study Group to ensure that the widest consideration be given to the matter.  A departmental official to represent departmental policy and an Air Corps Officer to advise on technical and operational matters were nominated by the Department of Defence.  The current <Col N="511" />Air Corps helicopter assets are not configured for maritime search and rescue nor does the Air Corps have pilots or winchmen with the required training and experience to support such operations.</P>
        <P>The Air Corps has a 24/7 general helicopter capability which is available in support of government approved missions. Its roles include support to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, air ambulance, transport roles in support of civil authorities and response to emergencies and natural disasters on land.  The Air Corps has a range of Service Level Agreements with State bodies and agencies including the Coast Guard.  The SLA which was signed in December, 2008 sets out the SAR assistance that the Air Corps provides to the Coast Guard.  The provision of assistance during mountain rescue operations and fixed wing top cover by the Air Corps Casa aircraft to Coast Guard helicopters are included in this agreement.</P>
        <P>There are no plans to restore the Air Corps Maritime SAR capacity; to do so would require very significant investment in equipment and training over many years before it could be operational again.</P>

        <Quest> if, in view of the greater focus on intelligence exchange among countries to tackle large drug shipments by sea, he accepts that the decision made by him to cut Naval Service patrol days by 200 days will limit the capacity of the Naval Service in its capacity to deal with drug trafficking; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>As part of the Estimates process for 2010, the Department sought to implement measures which would bring about the savings or the equivalent thereof as identified in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programme.  As part of this process and to achieve a reduction in current expenditure, the Minister for Defence proposed a cut to the Naval Service patrol days in 2010.  The planned number of patrol days for 2010 is 1,480.</P>
        <P>The Naval Service has a concurrent multi-functional role as the State&rsquo;s primary sea going agency.  On any given patrol day the Naval Service can carry out a number of taskings on behalf of other state agencies such as the Sea Fisheries Protection Agency (SFPA), an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs Service of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P>Naval Service patrols at sea undoubtedly act as a deterrent in the fight against drug trafficking.  However, increasingly this role is governed by intelligence led operations and greater cooperation between both national and international agencies.</P>
        <P>Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment in 1993 of a Joint Task Force, (JTF) involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Customs Service and the Naval Service, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating drug trafficking.  There is close co-operation between the civil authorities and the Naval Service in discharging this important mission.</P>
        <P>Internationally, the establishment in 2007 of the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre &mdash; Narcotics (MAOC-N) has led to a greater focus on intelligence exchange amongst countries to tackle large drug shipments by sea.   MAOC-N was set up by seven European countries &mdash; Ireland, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, France, Spain, Portugal and Italy. Europol, the European Commission and the US Joint Inter-Agency Drugs Task Force (JIATF) are observers at the centre.</P><Col N="512" />
        <P>The centre is designed as an international co-ordination force with access to national tasking agencies and requires participation and resources from all active members.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs Service have full-time officers based at the Centre in Lisbon.  Irish Naval Service personnel travel to the centre when requested by the JTF.</P>
        <P>I am therefore satisfied that with these initiatives in place, the Naval Service can continue to successfully battle against the threat of drug smuggling within its revised patrol pattern for 2010.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 79 together.</P>
        <P>The White Paper on Defence (2000) sets out the Government&rsquo;s Defence policy, having regard to an assessment of the defence and security environment. It set out the blueprint for the Reserve Defence Force based on a strength in the region of 12,000.</P>
        <P>The Reserve Defence Force Review Implementation Plan was formally launched in July 2004 and provided for the phased enhancement of Reserve capabilities over the period to end 2009.</P>
        <P>The plan set out the proposed establishment of the Reserve. The Non-Integrated element of the Reserve was to have an establishment of 9,692. This establishment came into force in October 2005 when the Reserve was re-organised.</P>
        <P>In addition, the plan provided for the development of an integrated element of the Army Reserve with a proposed establishment of 2,656 personnel.  In line with the plan a pilot Integration project was initiated in 2007 and continued into 2008. Just under 300 Reservists participated in these pilots, which was less than anticipated and disappointing.</P>
        <P>The numbers in the Reserve have declined over recent years, notwithstanding the improvements brought about under the implementation plan.  It should also be noted that, as part of the implementation process, a more rigorous approach is now taken to removing the names of non-effective personnel from Unit rolls. This accounts for part of the fall in numbers over recent years.</P>
        <P>A Value for Money Review of the Reserve Defence Force has been initiated and it is anticipated that the findings of this review will inform the future development of the Reserve Defence Force.  This review will also complement the development of a new White Paper on Defence.  There are no plans to revise the roles of the Reserve in advance of this review being published.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Defence</askee>
        <Quest> if he will revisit the gratuity issue to include a payment for reservists who cannot attend full-time training and also a graduated payment for those who give most; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>The Reserve Defence Force is a part-time, voluntary organisation whose primary activity is training. Members are free to determine their own level of participation in Reserve activities and may resign from the Reserve at any time.  Their service is provided entirely on a voluntary basis with no compulsion to attend.</P>
        <P>Members of the Reserve undergo both paid and unpaid training.  A gratuity is paid to members of the Reserve Defence Force as a measure of reimbursement on account of losses, expenses and disabilities incurred by them consequent on their obligations as members of the Reserve Defence Force.</P>
        <P>As part of the modernisation of the Reserve Defence Force, a new scheme for the payment of gratuities was introduced from 1 January 2008 following consultation and agreement with the relevant stakeholders including the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The new scheme provides for phased increases to the gratuity subject to the satisfactory completion by the Reservists of specified minimum periods of training and to have served for the period of the Reserve-training year, which, runs from 1 November to 31 October.  Service in the Reserve commences on completion of the recruitment process, including medical testing and security clearance.</P>
        <P>The provision this year for Reserve Defence Force paid training, gratuities etc. is &euro;4.7 million and it is anticipated that this level of funding will provide for approximately 31,000 paid training man-days. In light of the reduced paid training day provision for 2010, it is anticipated that there will be an increased emphasis on voluntary unpaid training and the allocation of paid training to individual reservists will take account of voluntary unpaid training undertaken.</P>
        <P>The aim is to ensure that reservists who complete specified voluntary unpaid training will be afforded the opportunity to avail of a minimum of 7 days paid training.  There will also be an allocation of training man-days to be used to deliver enhanced training to selected members of the Reserve, through full time courses of instruction in addition to their annual training.</P>
        <P>The payment of the gratuity requires the completion of at least 7 days paid training which can be aggregated over the full training year.  I am satisfied that the new scheme creates incentives to improve retention and attendance at training in the Reserve Defence Forces and this represents an effective productivity return from the revised gratuity rates and it is not my intention to reduce this requirement in the foreseeable future.</P>

	<P>Defence Force Regulations S.7 and its enabling legislation, the Defence Amendment Act, 1990, provide for representative structures for members of the Defence Forces including the Army and Naval Reserves.</P>
        <P>Under existing arrangements, RDFRA has open access to both the Department and the Military Authorities. A number of meetings take place each year between the Association and officials of the Department and separately between the Association and the Military Authorities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Reserve Defence Force (RDF) is a voluntary force and members are not dependent on it for their livelihood.  It must be remembered that RDFRA is not akin to the representative associations for the Permanent Defence Force, in that, the Association is not concerned with the day to day earnings of their members who have other employment, members of the RDF are not covered by employment legislation, and the nature of their engagement is entirely voluntary.</P>
        <P>That said, I remain sensitive to the concerns of RDFRA and, while I am fully satisfied with the processes currently in place, I will of course keep this situation under review to ensure that the good progress made to date continues into the future.</P>

	<P>I am advised by the Military Authorities that the strength of the Reserve Defence Force (RDF) as at 30 April 2010, the latest date for which figures are currently available, was 6,304.</P>
        <P>The White Paper on Defence, 2000, provided for an Army reserve of 12,000 and a Naval reserve of 400.  The RDF Review Implementation Plan, which was formally launched in July 2004, sets out the proposed establishment of the Reserve.  The establishment of the non-integrated element of the Reserve was set at 9,692.  This establishment came into force in October 2005, when the Reserve was re-organised.  In addition, the plan provides for the development of an integrated element of the Army Reserve with a proposed establishment of 2,656 personnel.  In line with the plan, a pilot integration project was initiated in 2007 and whilst numbers participating were less than expected, valuable lessons were learned.</P>
        <P>In the context of the Government decision on the implementation of savings measures on public service numbers and the reduced budgetary provision available for 2009, all recruitment to the RDF was suspended.  Following a subsequent review and examination of RDF personnel numbers and budgets for 2009, limited recruitment to fill vacancies arising due to existing Reserve members resigning, or being discharged in the normal manner resumed.</P><Col N="515" />
        <P>This limited recruitment is continuing subject to the overall strength level that existed at 1 January 2009 (7,671) not being exceeded.  The limited recruitment will also be monitored and kept under review in the light of the uptake of paid training within the RDF and the future budgetary provision available to the Department.</P>
        <P>I am aware that numbers in the Reserve have declined over recent years.  This trend in reduced volunteerism is not confined to the Reserve but is indicative of broader societal trends.  It should also be noted that a more rigorous approach is now taken to removing the names of non-effective personnel from unit rolls.  This accounts for part of the fall in numbers over recent years.</P>
        <P>There is now a requirement to examine the progress that has been made and to chart the future direction of the Reserve.  Work has commenced on a Value for Money Review of the Reserve and the findings of this Review, together with the lessons learned from the Implementation Plan to date, will inform the future plans for the Reserve.</P>

	<P>Resulting from the Government Decision regarding the reduction of public service numbers and the reduced budgetary provision available for 2009, recruitment, promotions and acting up appointments in the Permanent Defence Forces were suspended.  However, in order to maintain the ongoing operational capability of the Defence Forces, a limited number of exceptions to the application of the measures to the Permanent Defence Force were sought in a submission to the Minister for Finance, in June 2009. The need for limited recruitment, promotions and acting appointments for the Defence Forces was outlined.</P>
        <P Just="Left">As was announced on 24 November 2009, the Minister for Finance approved an allocation of 50 promotions, for the Permanent Defence Force.  These promotions were approved to address priority operational and command requirements of the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
        <P>Military Management reviewed existing vacancies in all ranks across the organisation as a whole, so as to prioritise those to be filled from the approved promotions.</P>
        <P>Following on from this review, a total of 13 Officer promotions and 30 Enlisted promotions have been completed to date.  A further 4 enlisted promotions will be completed as soon as the administrative procedures relating to them have been completed.

	<P>The White Paper on Defence (February 2000) sets out the need for change in the Reserve Defence Force and highlights the interface between the PDF and the RDF as being critical to the success of the reserve element of the State&rsquo;s defence capabilities and involving the Directorate of the Reserve Forces and the PDF Cadre.</P>
        <P>Permanent Defence Force Cadre staff assigned to Reserve Defence Force (RDF) units provide command, training supervision, administrative and logistic support.</P>
        <P>Posting or transferring of personnel into Cadre staff appointments occurs where vacancies exist and is normally done on a voluntary basis or by promotion following a promotion competition.  In cases of postings or transfers to Army Reserve units, the General Officer Commanding the Brigade is the authorised officer for the movement.  The Flag Officer Commanding the Naval Service is the authority for posting to Naval Service Reserve units.  The Deputy Chief of Staff Support approves and authorises NCO promotions.</P>
        <P>The report of the Defence Forces Review Implementation Board (known as the Swords Report) recommended that RDF training centres be located so as to allow use of PDF training facilities.  The Board also recommended that Cadre staff should normally be rotated after a period of three years and the postings should be staggered so as to ensure continuity.  The main reason for this recommendation was to ensure that instructors with the best modern training practices are available to the RDF.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 71 and 76 together.</P>
        <P>The Irish Red Cross Society is an autonomous body, established by the Irish Red Cross Society Order 1939 pursuant to the Red Cross Act, 1938 and is an independent, self-governing charitable institution.  The formal report of the Working Group on Governance was received in January of this year. A preliminary discussion on the recommendations in the Report was held in February between the Society and the Department of Defence. On the 18th May I met with the Vice Chairman and the Secretary General of the Society and assured them of my support in helping them achieve the aims set out in the Report. To do so will require significant amendments to the Irish Red Cross Society Order 1939. The Society and Officials from the Department of Defence are due to meet shortly to agree the specific changes required to the 1939 Order. In tandem with this, formal views on the changes will be sought from other Government Departments.</P>
        <P>The Chairman of the Society must be a member of the Central Council. In nominating persons to Central Council, the Government considers that it is highly desirable that the Society should have on its governing body, professional people with a wide variety of knowledge and expertise, gained through work experience in both the public and private sector and volunteer experience with the Society.  The Government, in recommending to the President a person to act as Chairman, will carefully consider and nominate a person who it deems will make a positive contribution to the affairs of the Society. Such a role assumes even greater importance now given the imminent changes to the Society&rsquo;s organisation.</P>

        <P>In difficult economic times there is a requirement to prioritise resources in order to maintain operational capacity.

It is in this regard that the number of promotions with the Reserve Defence Force must be managed on an ongoing basis. At a recent meeting with RDFRA on 28th April last I undertook to review the situation regarding the current ratio of Officers in the Reserve Defence Force to other ranks to determine whether there are any major issues.

	<P>The prevailing economic environment and the associated resource constraints have impacted on the entire Defence Organisation. The financial situation is such that it is not possible to provide the level of resourcing that was available in recent years. Within the reduced resource enveloped, the Department and the Defence Forces are working closely to prioritise the operational requirements of the Defence Forces and I fully support this approach.</P>
        <P>I have been informed by the military authorities that, within the current budget, the Reserve Defence Force (RDF) programme of training for 2010 will include Unit nightly parades, weekend training field days, annual summer camps and career courses for reservists.  The provision in the current year for Reserve Defence Force Pay etc. is &euro;4.7 million. This amount includes &euro;2.478 million for paid training for reservists. It is anticipated that this level of funding will provide for approximately 31,000 paid training man days for reservists.</P>
        <P>Training in the Reserve is comprised of both paid and unpaid training. In light of the reduced paid training day provision for 2010, it is anticipated that there will be an increased emphasis on voluntary unpaid training and the allocation of paid training to individual reservists will take account of voluntary unpaid training undertaken.  The aim is to ensure that reservists who complete specified voluntary unpaid training will be afforded the opportunity to avail of a <Col N="519" />minimum of 7 days paid training and that there be an allocation of training man days to be used to deliver enhanced training to selected members of the Reserve, through full time courses of instruction in addition to their annual training.</P>
        <P>Regarding training man days the Reserve Representative Association has open access to both military and civilian officials in the Department to raise issues of concern.  Members of the Reserve Defence Force are not considered to be part time workers in the employment of the Department of Defence as defined by the Protection of Employees (Part Time Work) Act 2001 therefore the Act  has no application to members of the Reserve.</P>

	<P>The All Party Oireachtas Consultation Group on the Centenary of the 1916 Rising met on Wednesday, 2nd December, 2009, for discussions and site visits to Glasnevin Cemetery and the National Museum of Ireland, Collins Barracks to view projects relating to the 2016 commemoration of the 1916 Rising.  In the discussion, the Group were informed of recent developments and events including:&mdash;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Arbour Hill renewal works including restoration and extension of the existing church car park, repair and restoration of all existing cemetery graves, repair of cemetery pathways and the planting of new trees.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The future location for the Abbey Theatre and possible redevelopment at the GPO with reference also to the protection of 16 Moore Street.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Recent acquisition for the national collections of items of interest relating to the independence period, amongst which were the 964 items of the Stanley Collection at a cost of &euro;3.5 million.  Other items purchased/donated include a letter from P.H. Pearse to General Maxwell and General Maxwell&rsquo;s brief reply and a copy of the Proclamation.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Assistance towards themed publication i.e. the Royal Irish Academy&rsquo;s recent publication on Se&aacute;n Lemass, and the SIPTU sponsored publication on James Connolly.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Military Archives Project which envisages that files, being the service records of personnel involved in the struggle for independence, would be released into the public domain on a phased basis in the years leading to the Centenary of the Rising.  The Group were informed that an Advisory Board of historians had accepted invitations to assist with this project.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5" Just="Left">At Glasnevin Cemetery, the Group inspected progress on the significant programme of ongoing restoration works under way for which &euro;6.4m of NDP funding has been provided to date.  I am pleased to report that the new Glasnevin museum was officially opened by An Taoiseach, Mr Brian Cowen, T.D., on 8 April, this year.  The Group also visited the ongoing restoration work being conducted on Erskine Childers&rsquo; yacht Asgard.  This project is scheduled to be completed by the end of June 2010. The suggested relocation to the GPO complex of the Abbey Theatre is currently being examined by the Office of Public Works.  The decision on future use will have regard to all advice and suggestions received.</P>
        <P>This year&rsquo;s commemorative event to mark the Easter Rising of 1916 was held at the GPO, Dublin on Sunday, 4th April, 2010.  The ceremony included prayers of remembrance, a reading <Col N="520" />of the Proclamation and the laying of a wreath by the President.  Preparations are ongoing for the National Day of Commemoration to be held in Kilmainham in July.</P>
        <P>A programme of events is being compiled to commemorate a whole series of centenaries across the island in the next 10 to 12 years, as we recall the key events in our history.  I am confident that all significant anniversaries occurring within the period of the multi-annual programme now being prepared will be commemorated.  The details of the commemorative programme will be discussed with Group members in due course.  I am currently engaged in the preparation for a meeting of the All Party Oireachtas Consultation Group, which I hope to convene soon.</P>

        <P>Targeted recruitment will be carried out in 2010 to maintain the operational capability of the Defence Forces.  In this regard, I have recently approved the recruitment of 40 Recruits for the Naval Service. In addition, as I have already stated, the military authorities will shortly advertise for some limited recruitment to the Army.</P>
        <P>In relation to the training of recruits for a six to eight week period following the Leaving Certificate, there is no scope for such a scheme as the minimum term of engagement for enlistment of recruits is 5 years.  In addition recruit training is carried out over a 16 week period.  Information in relation to recruitment may be found on the Defence Forces website, www.military.ie should candidates wish to apply for general service posts.</P>

	<P>My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social Protection.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF &mdash; rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.  I can confirm that my Department received a lump sum claim for the individual concerned on 25 March, 2010.  This claim awaits processing.  In respect of redundancy lump sum payments paid directly to employees, such as in this instance, the Section is, in general, processing claims dating from September/October 2009.</P>
        <P>The impact on business of the severe economic circumstances currently pertaining has resulted in an unprecedented increase in the level of Redundancy Payment claims lodged with my Department.  This has impacted significantly on the capacity to maintain the customer service targets that previously obtained.  On the Redundancy side the scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims in 2009 amounted to 77,001 which represents a threefold increase over the level of claims lodged in 2007 and earlier years.  In 2007, claims received were of the order of 25,000.</P>
        <P>Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for Redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both <Col N="522" />individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken in the Department in 2009 to alleviate the pressures on the Payments area include:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />almost doubling the number of staff through reassignment to a current level of 52 full time equivalents;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />prioritisation of the Department&rsquo;s overtime budget towards staff in the Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />establishment of a special call handling facility in NERA to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses concerned about their payments.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department&rsquo;s website;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against existing outstanding tax  liabilities which those employers owe to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The backlog and waiting times remain at unacceptable levels.  However, improvements are evident.  I should point out that my Department has, in 2009, processed 50,664 claims, up 70% on 2008.  During the period 1 January 2010 to 30 April, 2010, 23,593 claims were received and 27,592 were processed.  In the year to date, inroads have been made on the backlog of claims on hand, which reduced from 41,168 at the end of January to 36,333 at the end of April 2010.</P>
        <P>Responsibility for the payment functions arising under the Redundancy and Insolvency payment schemes is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2011.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims.</P>

	<P>As a result of the Government changes announced by An Taoiseach in March and my assuming the position of Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, the Delegation of Functions Orders in respect of three of the Ministers of State assigned to my Department lapsed.  Upon taking up my new responsibilities, my first organisational priority was to oversee the transfer of various functions in the skills training and employment programmes &amp; services areas from my Department to the Departments of Education and Skills and of Social Protection respectively, as well as the transfer in of functions in relation to the Programme of Research in Third Level Institutions (PRTLI) from the Department of Education and Skills.

        <P>In addition, my Department has also been progressing the transfer of responsibility for the Redundancy and Insolvency Payments Schemes to the Department of Social Protection, and the necessary Government Order in these respects has also now been made.  Further, the neces<Col N="523" />sary Government Order to give effect to the renaming of my ministerial title and that of my Department to &ldquo;Enterprise, Trade and Innovation&rdquo; came into effect on 2nd May.</P>
        <P>The final set of Orders required to be made relates to the delegation of legislative functions to my three Ministers of State and the necessary drafting work in that regard is currently ongoing within my Department.  Our aim is to have those Orders drafted and presented to Government in June for approval.  A notice will be published in Iris Oifigi&uacute;il, once the Orders have been signed.

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The definition of money laundering in the Criminal Justice Acts is very wide.  It includes possessing or using the proceeds of any crime, including tax evasion, as well as any attempt to conceal, disguise, transfer or convert those proceeds.  Given this wide definition, the Deputy will appreciate that it is difficult to arrive at any meaningful estimate of the exchequer loss due to money laundering.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may be aware that the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010 has recently been signed into law.  Its provisions will be commenced shortly by the Minister for Justice and Law Reform.  Existing anti-money laundering provisions, which are largely contained in the Criminal Justice Act 1994, impose obligations on financial institutions and on lawyers, accountants, auctioneers and certain other categories to identify their clients and report suspicious transactions to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P>The new Act strengthens the existing anti-money laundering legislation by, among other requirements, widening the offence of money laundering, establishing a system of compliance monitoring by competent authorities, requiring designated persons to identify the beneficial ownership of unlisted companies and trusts and introducing the concept of a risked based approach which will enable designated persons to concentrate resources on higher risk areas.  The new legislation will also strengthen the powers of the Financial Regulator by allowing him to impose administrative sanctions for breaches of its provisions.  The Financial Regulator is also devoting substantial additional resources to the inspection of credit and financial institutions to ensure compliance with their anti-money laundering obligations.</P>
        <P>Further anti-money laundering provisions are contained in certain EU Regulations which have direct effect in all member States.  The relevant EU Regulations require full identification of persons transmitting funds by wire transfer (EC Regulation 1781/2006) and require declaration of large cross-border cash movements (EC Regulation 1889/2005).</P>

	<P>The Consumer Credit Directive establishes a harmonised legal framework in the European Union for the provision of consumer credit ranging from &euro;200 up to &euro;75,000.  (It does not apply to mortgages).  It replaces a 1987 Directive (87/102/EEC), which laid down minimum rules for consumer credit arrangements within the EU.  In consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, my Department is currently preparing the draft Statutory Instrument, which will transpose the Directive into Irish Law.  It is intended that the legislation will be finalised by 11th June, 2010.  The Directive will take effect from that day.</P>
        <P>I believe that the Directive enhances the strong regulatory regime underpinning consumer protection, and as such, I have decided that credit unions should be subject to its full application.  However, following consultation with representatives of the Credit Union movement, I am aware that the credit unions will require some time to upgrade their systems and train staff, so that they can effect compliance with all the requirements of the Directive.  Consequently, I have adopted the discretion allowed for under Article 2.5 applying limited provisions of the Directive to them until 11th December 2011, after which date, the full Directive will take effect.</P>

        <Quest> the final date for which construction and other capital expenditure must have been incurred for inclusion in urban renewal, town renewal, seaside renewal, rural renewal, multi-storey car parks, living over the shop, homes, housing for the elderly or infirm, hostels, guest houses, convalescent homes, qualifying private hospitals, qualifying sports injury clinics, buildings used for child care purposes, psychiatric hospitals, mental health centres, student accommodation, holiday camps, general rental refurbishment, third level educational buildings, Temple Bar scheme, resort area scheme, designated islands, Dublin docklands, double rent relief, industrial buildings, commercial premises, rented residential accommodation and owner-occupied residential accommodation schemes; the maximum free depreciation or initial allowance and annual allowances claimable; the final year in the future in which any such allowance may be claimed; the estimated amounts claimed; the cost to the Exchequer of tax foregone in 2007, 2008 and 2009 and an estimate for 2010 and the succeeding years until all allowances claimable under the schemes have been exhausted; the way the cost of these allowances and reliefs are incorporated into projected taxation receipts for each of the years concerned; if any of these schemes have not been closed to new entrants; if a closing date has been specified to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[23749/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Revenue Commissioners have provided me with the information requested by the Deputy.  The information is presented in tabular format.  Because there are significant differences in the operation of tax relief between the commercial and residential schemes separate tables have been used in relation to the &lsquo;non-cost&rsquo; elements of the schemes. </P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Table 1 contains the commercial schemes,</P><Col N="526" />
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Table 2 contains the residential schemes, and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Table 3 contains composite figures for both commercial and residential relief in relation to the cost of the schemes to the Exchequer.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Commissioners have also made some general points that should be noted when interpreting the tables.  The termination dates are the dates by which the construction or refurbishment work on a building has to be carried out if the expenditure that is attributable to that work is to qualify for tax relief.  Where a building is not completed by the termination date the expenditure attributable to any construction or refurbishment work that takes place after this date cannot qualify for tax relief.  There are no set dates by which a person has to acquire a tax incentive property in order for tax relief to start to be claimed.  Tax relief can only start to be claimed after a building has been completed and the building leased or owner-occupied for the purposes required by the particular scheme.  Once a building has been leased or owner-occupied and is in use for the required purpose, tax relief can be claimed over varying periods.  In addition, the rate at which the available tax relief can be used up depends on the particular taxpayer having sufficient taxable income in any year to absorb the relief.  Any unused relief (with the exception of that for residential owner-occupier relief) can be carried forward indefinitely until it has been absorbed.  Thus, it is not possible to provide an indication of the final year in which tax relief under these schemes will be claimed as the start year for relief can vary from building to building and the relief period applicable likewise can vary within some of the schemes and between different taxpayers.</P>
        <P>At this stage the only scheme that is still open to new entrants is the Mid-Shannon Corridor Tourism Infrastructure Scheme.  New entrants have until 31 May 2012 to submit project applications for approval in principle.  Expenditure on approved projects under this scheme that is incurred before 31 May 2015 can qualify for capital allowances.  The scheme for Specialist Palliative Care Units has not yet been commenced.  When the Commencement Order is made, the commencement date will be made retrospective to 13 March 2008.</P>
        <P>The Deputy asked about the way in which the cost of allowances and reliefs are incorporated into projected taxation receipts for each of the years concerned.  While the exchequer cost attributable to a specific tax allowance or relief is generally set out (in the Summary of Budget Measures) in the year of its introduction, the ongoing cost of each specific allowance or relief is not thereafter disaggregated for forecasting purposes; projections for income tax receipts are based on assumed movements in macro-economic parameters and not by reference to the costs of individual tax reliefs.</P>

Refurbishment projects in general qualified for 100% write off of the capital expenditure incurred at the higher 4% rate of annual allowance.  For most types of construction projects, only 50% of the qualifying expenditure could be written off at the lower 2% rate.</P>

   <P Just="Left">(10) For Multi Storey Car Parks the annual allowance of 4%, free depreciation of 100% and initial allowance of 50% applied to expenditure incurred after 31/7/1998 where no lease had been granted for the purposes of double rent relief.  For expenditure incurred prior to this date the capital allowances available were restricted to a maximum 50% write-off of the capital expenditure incurred.  Under these circumstances an annual allowance of 2%, free depreciation of 50% and an initial allowance of 25% applied.</P>

   <P Just="Left">(12) Capital allowances for expenditure incurred on hotel projects are of long standing and different rates have applied over time.  From 1956 to 27/1/1994 the annual allowance was 10%.  From 28/1/1994 to 31/7/2008 the rate was 15% for the first 6 years and 10% in year 7.  From 1/8/2008, subject to transitional arrangements, the annual allowance is 4%, giving a current write-off period of 25 years.</P>

        <P Just="Left">(1) There are two types of residential tax relief, &lsquo;section 23&rsquo; type relief and owner-occupier relief. &lsquo;Section 23&rsquo; type relief (rented residential relief) is given, in its entirety, as a deduction from rental income in the year the property is first let under a qualifying lease.  If there is insufficient income to absorb the relief it is carried forward as a rental loss until used up.  Therefore, there is no standard writing off period &mdash; it could vary from 1 year to indefinitely as it depends on the ability of the investor to absorb the relief.  In contrast, owner-occupier relief is granted at a fixed annual rate over 10 years, i.e. at 5% of the qualifying expenditure in respect of expenditure on construction or at 10% in respect of expenditure on refurbishment.</P>
    <P Just="Left">(2) 1/6/1998 for &lsquo;section 23&rsquo; type relief and 6/4/1999 for owner/occupier relief.</P>
       <P Just="Left">(3) &lsquo;Section 23&rsquo; type relief only.</P>
     <P Just="Left">(4) Relief is available under the Countrywide Refurbishment Scheme in respect of rented residential property that is located anywhere in the country.  Unlike &lsquo;section 23&rsquo; type relief for designated areas, the qualifying expenditure is written off at a rate of 15% per annum in the first 6 years and 10% in year 7.</P>

        <P Just="Left">(1) The information available on the cost to the Exchequer is based on personal income tax returns filed by non-PAYE taxpayers (Form 11) and corporation tax returns filed by companies for the years 2007 and 2008, the latest year for which this information is available.  Data for 2009 cannot be provided as the tax returns for this year are yet due.  It should be noted that any corresponding data returned by PAYE taxpayers in the income tax return (Form 12) is not captured in the Revenue computer system.  However, any PAYE taxpayer with non-PAYE income greater than &euro;3,174 is required to complete an income tax return (Form 11).</P>
        <P Just="Left">(2) The estimated relief claimed has assumed tax forgone at the 41% rate for 2007 and 2008 in the case of individuals and 12.5% in the case of companies for both years.  The figures shown correspond to the maximum Exchequer cost in terms of income tax and corporation tax.</P>
     <P Just="Left">(3) The figures for 2008 are subject to adjustment in the event of late returns being filed or where returns already filed are subsequently amended.</P>

	<P>The correspondence provided by the Deputy in the main reproduces the material supplied by the Irish League of Credit Unions (ILCU) to its member credit unions as part of its current campaign in relation to amendments to Section 35 of the Credit Union Act 1997 contained in the Central Bank Reform Bill 2010 and to the transposition by Ireland of the Consumer Credit Directive.  I understand that the intention of the campaign is that all members of the House are to be lobbied on these issues.  The ILCU campaign material makes a number of points which I will address in the following paragraphs.</P>
        <P>I believe the current proposals as provided for in the Section 35 amendments in the Bill will benefit both individual members and the credit union sector overall.  The credit union sector is not immune to the economic downturn.  It needs to be safeguarded to ensure that it can continue to provide assistance to its members in the current difficult economic climate while at the same time lending only within its capacity to do so.  The Government&rsquo;s intention is to <Col N="532" />facilitate relaxation of the lending limits in conjunction with appropriate regulation of the sector to achieve this objective.</P>
        <P>The proposals contained in the section 35 amendments meet my intentions in this area.  In my address to the ILCU Conference in April 2009, I expressed my wish to help members who are experiencing difficulty in meeting loan repayments due to unfavourable changes in their financial circumstances in the current economic environment.  I stated that any solution would be subject to the over-arching consideration that the financial position of a credit union is not undermined, the security of members&rsquo; savings is maintained and accurate reporting of the financial status of a credit union is not jeopardised.  Re-scheduling of repayments to a level which is affordable to members should be possible in carefully monitored and controlled circumstances.  Of course, each credit union must fully and properly recognise arrears situations where they exist.  Where members are in difficulty the process of facilitating them must be transparent to board members and regulators so that a credit union is never in doubt as to its own position.  This continues to be my view and I believe that the proposed amendment to Section 35 will achieve the desired result.</P>
        <P>The credit union sector has been seeking relaxation of the Section 35 lending limits in an effort to facilitate borrowers who have run into difficulties in repaying their loans and need to have them rescheduled to allow for repayment over a longer period of time.  The lending limits are set in primary legislation.  Together with the measures to balance the increased flexibility in relation to rescheduling, they must apply to all credit unions in a uniform way.  Having said this, the scope for any additional flexibility is being examined by my Department in conjunction with the Registrar of Credit Unions and I have agreed to meet the credit union bodies again in this regard over the next week or so.</P>
        <P>Also, as I indicated to the House during the second stage debate on the Bill, the Registrar of Credit Unions will take a balanced and proportionate approach to the implementation of the new Section 35 requirements and he has set out for the credit union representative groups transitional arrangements and clarifications on the implementation approach.  The Registrar has already indicated that these include transitional arrangements for a 15% provisioning requirement up to 30 September 2011, trial periods, exceptions with regard to top-up loans and relaxation of the 100% provisioning requirement in respect of rescheduled loans which have missed two or more payments.  The transitional arrangements will help to ease the position for credit unions in the current financial year and the next financial year ending in September 2011.  They will also allow time for credit unions to adjust to the new regime.  Overall, the Registrar will take account of individual circumstances in credit unions in exercising the powers being given to him in the Bill.  I want to assure the Deputy that there is no question of a <i>&ldquo;one size fits all&rdquo; </i>approach as is being suggested by the League.</P>
        <P>The powers which are proposed to be given to the Registrar of Credit Unions are needed as soon as possible.  It is not correct to say that the Registrar has the necessary powers under existing legislation.  He does not have the power to impose conditions across the sector and it would not be prudent to await the outcome of the strategic review.  While the review itself is planned to be completed by March 2011, any primary legislation arising would require some considerable further time to implement.  As I have indicated already, the credit union sector needs to be safeguarded further now to ensure that it can continue to provide assistance to its members in the current difficult economic climate while at the same time lending only within its capacity to do so.</P>
        <P>As indicated by the Registrar during his appearance last week before the Joint Committee on Economic Regulatory Affairs, a Regulatory Impact Assessment within the meaning of the <Col N="533" />term as set out in the Better Regulation Guidelines prepared by the Department of the Taoiseach was not carried out.  However, as he also indicated, an internal analysis was carried out.  This examined the level of provisions which are held against rescheduled loans.  The Registrar indicated that he will make this analysis available to the Joint Committee.  I will ask the Registrar to furnish the Deputy with a copy of any material which he provides to the Joint Committee in this regard.</P>
        <P>Contrary to suggestions now being made, there was extensive and detailed consultation on the measures now being brought forward.  Following general discussions in early 2009, the detailed views of credit union representative groups on the Section 35 issue were sought and obtained in the summer of 2009.  The provisions to be included in the requirements to be made by the Registrar have already undergone considerable adjustment following discussions between the Registrar of Credit Unions and both credit union representative bodies.</P>
        <P>Concerns have been raised in relation to the need for the Registrar of Credit Unions to consult with the representative bodies before introducing requirements.  As a matter of general practice, the Registrar consults with the credit union representative bodies before introducing regulations or requirements in relation to any aspect of credit union regulation and I understand that he intends to continue with this approach.  However, the independent position of the Registrar of Credit Unions in carrying out the duty of financial regulation is not open to question and the Registrar has the statutory powers and responsibility to introduce, if necessary without consultation, regulatory requirements in the interests of the well-being and stability of the sector.  For this good reason, a requirement for the Registrar to consult with the sector is not included in the legislation.  Neither is it appropriate to provide for an appeals mechanism.  Such a device would render the provisions ineffective and inoperable as decisions of the Registrar would become subject to constant review.</P>
        <P>There is a balance to be struck between meeting members&rsquo; needs to reschedule loans and ensuring the stability of the credit union sector overall.  We are not seeking to have a credit union sector which is over-regulated.  However, we must act now in a prudent and preventative manner.  It is in the interests of every credit union in the country that the stability of the sector is safeguarded.  The proposals being brought forward in connection with the Bill will achieve this fundamental aim.</P>
        <P>The Consumer Credit Directive establishes a harmonised legal framework in the European Union for the provision of consumer credit ranging from &euro;200 up to &euro;75,000.  (It does not apply to mortgages).  It replaces a 1987 Directive (87/102/EEC), which laid down minimum rules for consumer credit arrangements within the EU.  In consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, my Department is currently preparing the draft Statutory Instrument, which will transpose the Directive into Irish Law.  It is intended that the legislation will be finalised by 11 June 2010.  The Directive will take effect from that day.  I believe that the Directive enhances the strong regulatory regime underpinning consumer protection, and as such, I have decided that credit unions should be subject to its full application.</P>
        <P>However, following consultation with representatives of the Credit Union movement, I am aware that the credit unions will require some time to upgrade their systems and train staff, so that they can effect compliance with all the requirements of the Directive.  Consequently, I have adopted the discretion allowed for under Article 2.5 applying limited provisions of the Directive to them until 11 December 2011, after which date, the full Directive will take effect.  Notification of my decision to adopt this discretion was published on my Department&rsquo;s website on 21 May 2010 and both credit union representative bodies were informed of my decision by e-mail on that date.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the question of whether an individual &mdash; including an actor &mdash; is engaged under either a contract of service (i.e. an employee) or a contract for service (i.e. self-employed) is a question of fact and of general law.  Regardless of how the parties to an engagement may describe the relationship, all the relevant factors, including written, oral and implied details, that bear on the relationship between the parties must be examined, given their proper weight and a decision made on their overall effect.</P>
        <P>Depending on the facts and circumstances of a case, an individual may be an employee or self employed.  To provide some clarity as to whether an individual is employed or self-employed, the Employment Status Group (set up under the then Programme for Prosperity and Fairness) published a <i>Code of Practice for determining Employment or Self-employment status of Individuals</i>.  This Code of Practice, which was updated in 2007, is available on Revenue&rsquo;s website.</P>

	<P>The Valuation Act 2001, provides for the valuation of all commercial and industrial property and the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Act. </P>
        <P>The recent revaluation of the Fingal County Council rating authority area was undertaken after the required consultation by the Commissioner with both the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Fingal County Council itself and the subsequent making by the Commissioner of the requisite Valuation Order in March 2007. The new valuation list was published on 31st December 2009. By reference to this list, over two-thirds of ratepayers in Fingal will experience decreased rates liability, no change in their liability or will be newly rated this year, while only one-third face increased rates liability.</P>
        <P>As provided in the Act, and as advised to all ratepayers in the Fingal area, there is provision for any ratepayer to formally appeal to the Commissioner of Valuation against the rateable valuation accorded his / her property in the valuation list published on 31st December, 2009. These appeals are now being considered by the Commissioner. If any ratepayer is still dissatisfied with their valuation they can appeal to the independent Valuation Tribunal and ultimately to the Courts on a point of law.</P>
        <P>The purpose of a revaluation is not to increase the total amount of commercial rates collected by local authorities. The legislation (Valuation Act 2001 and the Local Government (Business Improvement Districts) Act 2006) provides that the commercial rates income of local authorities in the year following a revaluation will be capped. The only increase in the total rates income of a local authority permitted in the year following publication of the new valuation list is an increase to cover for the rate of inflation. If deflation exists, the overall rates income will be decreased accordingly.</P>
        <P>The choice of Valuation Date does not affect the overall commercial rates income of a local authority.<b>  </b>The amount of rates payable on any property is the result of multiplying <b>two</b> variables: the Valuation, which is in line with rental values at the Valuation Date and the ARV &mdash; <Col N="535" />the annual rate on valuation &mdash; which is calculated by the local authority. Since the total amount of rates to be collected by the local authority is capped in the year after the revaluation takes place, the only movements are between the total amount of valuations and the ARV.</P>
        <P>If the valuation date of September 30th 2005 was altered and as a result produced a lower total valuation overall, then the ARV would increase, so that the local authority receives the pre-determined amount of rates income in the year following the Revaluation. Likewise, if a different valuation date produced a higher total valuation overall, then the ARV would reduce to provide the local authority with the same pre-determined amount of rates income. Therefore, changing the date of valuation will not affect the overall amount of rates income received by a local authority in the year following Revaluation.</P>
        <P>While individual increases or decreases in rates liability will inevitably be the result of a revaluation, such increases or decreases will reflect movements over time in the overall property market, and result in a fairer, more transparent rating system.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the provision of tax relief on pension contributions is not required to be linked to the values of pension funds in the manner set out in the question. Accordingly, there is no data available on which to provide the figures being sought.</P>
        <P>The maximum allowable pension fund that an individual can build up from tax-relieved contributions is known as the Standard Fund Threshold or SFT. The SFT is a lifetime limit which was introduced in Budget and Finance Act 2006 at an initial level of &euro;5 million and was increased in line with an indexation factor in 2007 and 2008 to its current value of just over &euro;5.4 million. A higher limit (the Personal Fund Threshold &mdash; PFT) was also introduced in Budget and Finance Act 2006 for individuals whose pension fund values exceeded &euro;5 million on the date the SFT was introduced (7 December 2005) and the PFT was also increased in line with an indexation factor in 2007 and 2008. In accordance, however, with the decision made in Budget 2009, there was no indexation of  the SFT or PFT  for 2009. Penal tax charges apply to any funds in excess of the thresholds.</P>
        <P>The current level of the SFT will be kept under review as part of the normal Budgetary and Finance Bill process.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AineBrady"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Aacute;ine Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>Government policy in relation to older people is to support people to live in dignity and independence in their own homes and communities for as long as possible. Where this is not feasible, support is provided to access quality, long-term, affordable residential care. </P>
        <P>In line with this overall approach, a priority of Government in recent years has been to develop a range of community-based supports such as Home Help, Home Care Packages, and Day Care. The HSE Service Plan 2010, approved by the Minister for Health and Children last March, commits the Executive to providing agreed levels of service nationally for these key areas. The Plan includes Respite Care, often available through Day Care or Home Care Packages, and delivered either directly by the HSE, or in partnership with the voluntary or private sectors.  Broadly speaking, the level of community supports for older people in 2010 is in line with 2009 provision. There is, in fact, an increase this year in the number of Home Care Packages available, due to an additional &euro;10m given in the last Budget for this purpose.</P>
        <P>I am not aware of specific issues relating to the provision of Respite Care in the Northside of Dublin. It is, however, a matter for the  HSE to manage the services I have outlined, including Respite Care, at national, regional, or local level, bearing in mind all relevant factors such as overall resources, local circumstances, and evolving service priorities. I have not established separate policy guidelines on this matter.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The Irish Blood Transfusion Service is a statutory body under the aegis of my Department. A contributory funded pension scheme, sponsored by the employer, was set up for employees in 1963. The Irish Blood Transfusion Service is a public service body as defined in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act, 2009 and consequently its employees are public servants for the purposes of the deduction from remuneration under that Act. The Scheme provides for payment on retirement at age 65 of a lump sum equal to 3/80th final salary multiplied by years of service and a pension for life equal to 1/80th final salary multiplied by years of service. Under the terms of the scheme the occupational  pension is not subject to integration and therefore is payable in addition to any entitlements to the State Pension (Contributory).</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been advised by the Nursing Careers Centre (NCC), which is under the management of An Bord Altranais, that there is no appeals process for students who fail to be called to the interview stage of  the Entry Competition for Mature Students into a Nursing Career Programme run by the NCC.</P><Col N="539" />
        <P>The current process for selection of mature code applicants for nursing/midwifery has operated over 10 years.  <i>Nursing/Midwifery A Career for You</i>(page 10) states that: &ldquo;A mature code applicant who passes the (NCC) written assessment and interview is placed on the list for each mature course code for which she has applied.  The overall score in the NCC written assessment determines an applicant&rsquo;s position on the order of merit list for each mature course code for which she applied.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>The NCC and the Public Appointments Service (PAS) periodically review and evaluate all processes in order to satisfy themselves that they are in line with best practice for recruitment and selection.  The NCC and the PAS  undertook an evaluation of the selection process in Autumn 2009.  The evaluation report included a review of the interview process.  One of its conclusions, based on best practice, recommended that a 2:1 ratio of applicants to places should be invited to interview.</P>
        <P>On the basis of this review,  it was decided by the NCC that, in the interests of fairness to applicants and to relieve them of the stress and cost of attendance for interview, only those applicants who had achieved a score likely to qualify them for an offer of a place in nursing/midwifery based on the order of merit list should be invited to interview.  In this year&rsquo;s competition, in line with best practice and evidence, the top successful candidates who achieved the highest scores at written assessment test were invited to interview.</P>
        <P>The 2010 competition saw an unprecedented number of applications for mature code nursing/midwifery.  There were 2224 applications in total, the highest number since the competition began.  Of the 1040 applicants who passed the written assessment, 659 were invited to interview for approximately 336 places.  This was in line with best practice in recruitment and selection processes.</P>
        <P>There are a maximum of 336 places available in any year for mature code applicants in the mature competition for Nursing/Midwifery, which has an overall quota of 1570 places nationally.  In the unlikely event that the 336 places are not allocated to mature code candidates, the NCC will revert to the list of remaining candidates who have passed the written assessment test and may invite a number for interview in order of merit.</P>

	<P>On 28 August 2009, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in consultation with the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment announced changes in the way the State&rsquo;s immigration system deals with non-EEA migrant workers.</P>
        <P>From that date, all non-EEA persons who have held employment permits for 5 years of more consecutively and have been working lawfully during that time, will be exempted, provided they meet certain conditions, from the requirement to hold a work permit and will no longer be limited to one employer.  Such persons will be issued with a Stamp 4 permission signifying the <Col N="544" />right to be present in the State and to be employed without an employment permit.  Persons seeking such permission should contact their local Immigration office.  The eligibility rules are clearly laid out on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Office <i>www.inis.gov.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>This permission will normally be granted for one year and can be renewed annually subject to certain conditions, including that the person is continuing to be in employment or if redundant, he/she is making efforts to seek employment and has not become a burden on the State.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, it is open to persons who have held work permits for 5 years consecutively to apply to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for long term residency.  Subject to such an application being approved, a person will be granted Stamp 4 for a five year period.  Details on the long term residency scheme are again on the INIS website.</P>

	<P>A valid application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question was received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in October 2008.</P>
        <P>All valid applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants.The average processing time from application to decision is now at 26 months. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale. Officials in the Citizenship Division inform me that further processing of the application is ongoing and the file will be submitted to me for a decision in due course.</P>
        <P>The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks. There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that it is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</P>

She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against her.  Representations have been submitted on behalf of the person concerned.</P>

All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision.

	<P>The visa application referred to by the Deputy was received in the Visa Office, Dublin on the 25 November 2009.  Following consideration by a Visa Officer it was refused on 4 December 2009 for the following reasons. There was insufficient documentation submitted in support of the application, specifically a full copy of the passport of the contact/host in Ireland was not provided; It was the opinion of the Visa Officer that there were inconsistencies in the information supplied.  The Visa Officer had concerns with regard to letters from the contact/host in Ireland; It was the opinion of the Visa Officer that the applicant did not have sufficient obligations to return to the country of origin and may not observe the conditions of a visit visa where one was granted.</P>
        <P>The applicant appealed the refusal to grant a visa.  The decision of the Visa Officer was upheld by an Appeals Officer on the 11 February 2010.  Each visa application is entitled to one appeal only.  It is however open to the applicant to submit a fresh visa application at any time.</P>

	<P>My officials have studied the report which issued last month and have already met with the group, which commissioned it, to discuss its contents. The views expressed in the report are broadly critical of the direct provision system in this country for asylum seekers. The group recommend its abolition. It is clear at this stage, however, that no alternative system for the reception of asylum seekers here would be either affordable or appropriate in our current economic circumstances.  There are, to be fair, points of detail raised in the report about the general administration of reception centres which either have been addressed by my officials or are in the course of being addressed. </P>

	<P>Non-EEA nationals who are in a de facto relationship or a partnership (either heterosexual or same sex) may apply for immigration permission based on that relationship (assuming that the other party is already entitled to reside in Ireland).  The rules vary depending primarily on the immigration status of the person with whom the de facto relationship is claimed.</P>
        <P>Partners of EU citizens exercising EU Treaty Rights in accordance with the European Communities (Free Movement of Persons) Regulations 2006 and 2008 will be dealt with under those regulations.   The rules applicable to those persons are available on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service.   Form EU1 is the appropriate application form in that situation.</P>
        <P>Partners of Irish citizens or non-EEA nationals lawfully resident in the State will be considered under national immigration measures.  In those situations the non-EEA national who wishes to remain in the State based on a partnership must be able to satisfy the immigration authorities that the partnership is genuine and durable and that the partners are residing, or intend to reside, as a family unit in the State.  For entry to the State, the person concerned must ensure that he/she has the relevant documentation with them, including a visa where required, to satisfy the immigration officer that there is a bona fide basis to permit entry.  The INIS website sets out details of the information and documentation which is necessary to support an application for immigration permission.</P>
        <P>The required minimum duration of the relationship is normally two years.   This applies where the person with whom a relationship is claimed is an Irish or EU national.   In certain circumstances it also applies where the partner is a non-EEA national with a particular immigration status. In other cases the required period is for 4 years.</P>
        <P>The onus rests with the person seeking immigration permission to satisfy the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service as to the bona fides of the partnership.  The nature and duration of the relationship would be taken into account in determining whether or not permission would be granted and the status of the lawfully resident partner will be taken into account.   Applications are dealt with on a case by case basis.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I am deeply concerned about the situation of North Korean migrants in China.  As reported in January 2010 by the respected NGO, Human Rights Watch, most North Koreans who flee the Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea (DPRK), do so by escaping through their country&rsquo;s northern border with China.</P>
        <P>The situation in the DPRK from which they flee has been described as &ldquo;abysmal&rdquo; by the UN Special Rapporteur, Prof. Vitit Muntarbhorn, in a report published on 22 October last. The Special Rapporteur reported that almost 9 million people in the country are suffering from food shortages. Where the human rights situation is concerned, he noted also that despite various formal guarantees in the Constitution, the people of the DPRK are subject to per<Col N="548" />secution, clampdowns, collective punishment, torture, arbitrary executions and public executions.</P>
        <P>In these circumstances, hundreds of thousands of North Koreans are believed to have crossed the border into China since the mid-1990s. Many are thought to consider China as a transition point from which to travel on to other destinations, including the Republic of Korea, and the number of refugees currently in China is hard to estimate. Conservative estimates suggest a figure of between 30,000 to 50,000, though some organisations have set the figure as high as 100,000 to 300,000.</P>
        <P>Those who leave North Korea without the permission of the State are considered criminals. As such, they face grave punishments upon repatriation such as torture, lengthy terms of imprisonment in horrendous detention facilities, and even execution.</P>
        <P>For their part, the Chinese authorities categorically label North Koreans in China &ldquo;illegal&rdquo; economic migrants and they routinely repatriate them, irrespective of the punishments they will face on return, or the reasons for which they left the DPRK in the first place (which often include political or religious persecution as well as endemic food shortages). In this context, concern has been expressed that the Chinese authorities are failing to fulfil the terms of the 1951 UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, which prohibits the expulsion or return of refugees to territories where their life or freedom would be threatened. China acceded to the Convention in 1982.</P>
        <P>This issue was not among the number of human rights issues I discussed with the Chinese Foreign Minister, Mr Yang Jiechi, during my visit to China last week, It will, however, feature in ongoing contacts with the Chinese authorities on human rights issues.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will have seen the welcome news that on Saturday President Mutharika granted an unconditional pardon to Steven Monjeza and Tiwonge Chimbalanga, after meeting with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. In a press conference announcing the pardon, the President stated that he had taken his decision on humanitarian grounds and that the law itself has not changed.</P>
        <P>I have been following the case of Steven Monjeza and Tiwonge Chimbalanga since the two men were first arrested. Our Embassy in Lilongwe, along with our EU partners, has been active in raising our concerns about the matter with the Government of Malawi throughout.  I want to emphasise in particular our very serious concern and dismay at the arrest, conviction and severe sentence imposed upon these men on account of their sexual orientation. The conviction was contrary to international human rights principles which Malawi has ratified. With our EU partners, we have called on the Government of Malawi to fulfil its commitments to the protection of the human rights of all individuals, irrespective of their sexual orientation. My colleague, the Minister of State for Overseas Development, Peter Power, T.D., made a statement to this effect on 20 May and Ireland supports the similar statement made by High Representative Catherine Ashton on 21 May, which also refers to Malawi&rsquo;s commitments and obligations under international human rights law.</P>
        <P>Malawi is one of the nine Programme Countries where Ireland has a commitment to long term strategic assistance. Our five year country programme focuses on nutrition and food security and support for good governance. These are targeted programmes and we do not provide general budget support. Ireland also supports civil society organisations working in Malawi, including those that engage in human rights work there.</P>
        <P>We remain in constant contact with our Ambassador in Malawi and our concerns are being fully communicated to the Government of Malawi. The Deputy can be assured that we will continue to coordinate with our EU and international partners on this matter to impress upon the Government of Malawi the need for compliance with its own obligations under international human rights agreements.</P>

	<P>Whilst my Department provides funding to our National Cultural Institutions, the Board of each Institution is responsible for all operational matters relating to the institution, including opening hours and I do not have a statutory function in respect of day-to-day operational matters. The National Museum of Ireland attracted over 783,000 visitors to its three sites in Collins Barracks, Kildare Street and the Museum of Country Life in Turlough Park in 2009.  With the reopening of the Natural History Museum in Merrion Street it is anticipated that National Museum will attract over 1 million visitors to all its sites in 2010.</P><Col N="550" />
        <P>The National Museum commissioned a Front of House review in 2008, which included consideration of an extension of opening hours.  The Museum is in consultation with staff representatives on the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report.</P>
        <P>My Department encourages the provision of additional public access to our National Galleries, Museums and Libraries.  The National Gallery of Ireland, the National Library and Crawford Art Gallery, are opened on Mondays as is the Chester Beatty Library for the period from May to September.  In addition, my Department has provided funding since 2006 towards Culture Night, when all our national cultural institutions remain open until late in the evening, allow people access to our national collections outside of regular visiting hours.</P>
        <P>Many international cultural institutions operate a policy of restricting access to the public one day a week.   It is common practice internationally for institutions to use this time to attend to work that cannot be accommodated while the public has access, for health and safety and operational reasons.</P>

I should point out that responsibility for applying to host the World Equestrian Games rests with the relevant national governing body, in this case Horse Sport Ireland (HSI).  In this regard, consideration was given by HSI in 2008 to making an application to host the 2014 World Equestrian Games.  However, I am informed by HSI that, following consideration of the matter at board level, they decided not to proceed with the bid.</P>

The claim made in August 2007 was disallowed by a Deciding Officer and this decision was upheld by an Appeals Officer. However, the claim was treated as a claim for illness benefit and payment was made on that basis.

	<P>The application for disability allowance, by the person concerned, was disallowed by a Deciding Officer following an assessment by a Medical Assessor of the Department who expressed the opinion that she was medically unsuitable for disability allowance. An appeal was opened and in the context of that appeal, her case was reviewed by a second Medical Assessor who also expressed the opinion that she was medically unsuitable for disability allowance.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that, in the light of this second medical opinion, that office decided to afford her an opportunity of setting out the complete and up to date grounds of her appeal. For this purpose, a form SWAO1 was issued on 30 November 2009. The person concerned failed to respond and subsequently her appeal could not be progressed.</P>

	<P>Ten military barracks have been closed since 1998. The receipts accruing from the sale of first five barracks were as follows: Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig &euro;44.5m, Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy &euro;973,889, Devoy Barracks, Naas &euro;9.3m, Castleblayney Barracks &euro;761,843, and Clancy Barracks, Islandbridge &euro;25.4m.</P>
        <P>The Government decided on 1st July 2003 that Magee Barracks, Kildare would be among the State lands released to Kildare County Council for inclusion in the Sustaining Progress Affordable Housing Initiative. However, this will not now occur and the Department has retained control of this property.</P>
        <P>In relation to the Government decision of 14 October 2008 that approved the closure of the barracks at Monaghan, Longford, Rockhill and Lifford in Donegal the current position is as follows;  Rockhill Military post is being prepared for public sale, although an agreement is in place with another Government agency for the purchase of part of the lands. Lifford Military post is under negotiation with another Government agency. An agreement is in place to dispose of part of Connolly Barracks, Longford to a Government agency and some interest has been recorded in the remaining portion of the barracks. An agreement for sale is also in place in <Col N="555" />relation to Monaghan Barracks.  Minimal costs are incurred in relation to the sale of premises as the preferred method is by public tender.</P>

        <Quest> the extent to which air and sea surveillance can be enhanced to deter drug or human trafficking; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Responsibility for the prevention of drug trafficking rests primarily with the Customs Service of the Revenue Commissioners. Responsibility for the prevention of crime, including people trafficking, rests primarily with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  However, the White Paper on Defence provides for a security role for the Naval Service and the Air Corps to assist and support the civil authorities in this important work.</P>
        <P>The Naval Service provides the maritime element of the Defence Forces and has a general responsibility to meet contingent and actual maritime defence requirements. The Naval Service operates eight general purpose patrol ships. All eight ships are involved in coastal and offshore patrolling and surveillance for the State in that part of the seas where State jurisdiction applies. The Naval Service intends to further enhance its surveillance capabilities by utilising both Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) and Long Range Identification and Tracking (LRIT) which identify merchant shipping in and approaching Irish waters.</P>
        <P>The primary day-to-day tasking of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State&rsquo;s obligations as a member of the European Union. However, as the need arises, Naval Service vessels are deployed to other duties such as aid to the civil power, search and rescue or recovery, and drug interdiction operations.</P>
        <P>The current Exclusive Fishery Limits extend to 200 miles offshore and cover an area of 132,000 nautical square miles. The Naval Service currently patrols the entire 200 mile limit and periodically patrols beyond these limits to protect specific fisheries. These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed to all areas of Irish waters as necessary. The number of Patrol Vessels on patrol in Irish waters at any one time varies between three and eight. The Naval Service is committed to having at least three vessels on patrol within the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone at any one time. All vessels are multi-tasked in the sense that they also undertake general surveillance, security and other duties while on patrol.</P>
        <P>Naval Service patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps. The Air Corps Maritime Squadron carries out aerial surveillance of our Exclusive Economic Zone using the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft.</P>
        <P>Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment in 1993 of a Joint Task Force involving An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the Customs Service and the Naval Service, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating drug trafficking.  The Air Corps provide air support and, on occasion, carry the Customs National Drugs Team in an observational capacity for the purpose of monitoring vessels suspected of drug trafficking and other illegal activities. There is close co-operation between the civil authorities and the Naval Service and the Air Corps in discharging this important mission.</P>
        <P>An Inter-Departmental Maritime Surveillance Co-ordination Group (MarSur CG), chaired by the Department of Transport, has been established under the auspices of the Maritime Co-ordination Group of Assistant Secretaries.  The Co-ordination Group will work towards the <Col N="556" />creation of a common information-sharing environment to enhance safety and security within the Irish maritime domain.  The Department of Defence and the Naval Service are represented on this Group along with other Government Departments and Agencies responsible for safety and security in the maritime environment.</P>
        <P>Internationally, the establishment in 2007 of the Maritime Analysis and Operations Centre &mdash; Narcotics (MAOC-N) has led to a greater focus on intelligence exchange amongst countries to tackle large drug shipments by sea. MAOC-N was set up by seven European countries and is designed as an international co-ordination force with access to national tasking agencies and requires participation and resources from all active members. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Customs Service have full-time officers based at the Centre in Lisbon. Irish Naval Service personnel travel to the Centre when requested by the Joint Task Force.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that with these initiatives in place, the Naval Service and the Air Corps can continue to effectively support the civil authorities in the areas of drug interdiction and people trafficking.</P>

	<P>There has been very significant investment in equipment for the Air Corps in recent years. The comprehensive investment programme included the acquisition of Pilatus training aircraft at a total cost of &euro;60m, two light utility EC 135 helicopters at a cost of &euro;12.8m, six utility AW 139 helicopters at a cost of &euro;75m, and a major mid life upgrade on the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft at a cost of &euro;16.5m.</P>
        <P>There are no plans to purchase new aircraft for the Air Corps in the immediate future. The acquisition of new equipment for the Air Corps is a matter that will be kept under continuous review. It is, however, imperative that the Department and the Defence Forces, including the Air Corps, look to whatever efficiencies can be made taking into account the current difficult economic environment and the overall financial envelope available for the Department for the acquisition of new equipment and for upgrading and refurbishment programmes for equipment, including aircraft, over the coming years. The budgetary situation will dictate the level of funding available for new equipment and upgrades in that period and decisions will be made accordingly. Funding will, of course, be continued to be provided in the relevant Subhead for the required maintenance of Air Corps aircraft.</P>

	<P>Military vehicles undergo regular maintenance and overhauls to ensure that they are roadworthy.  When a vehicle reaches its end of life, the vehicle is withdrawn from operational service and disposed of.  It is not the practice to retain a vehicle in service if it is not considered roadworthy.  Military vehicles are normally disposed of in accordance with S.I. No 282 of 2006 &lsquo;End of life Vehicle Regulations&rsquo;. </P>
        <P>The Defence Forces is equipped with a modern transport fleet which has proven itself capable of undertaking the roles assigned to it by Government, both domestically and in the recent overseas missions such as Chad and Kosovo. The recent addition of the Roll Over Protection Systems for Troop Carrying Vehicles has increased the level of protection available to Defence Forces personnel whilst being transported on such vehicles.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the current budgetary situation, a limited number of important equipment purchases will be advanced in 2010 including the delivery of 27 Light Tactical Armoured Vehicles from BAE Systems in South Africa. Other transport related acquisitions scheduled this year include 22 Minibuses, 2 ambulances, 45 patrol vehicles and 4 mid-coaches for troop transportation. In addition, funding is provided on a continuous basis for the required maintenance of the vehicles in the military transport fleet.</P>

        <P>Resulting from the Government Decision regarding the reduction of public service numbers and the reduced budgetary provision available for 2009, recruitment, promotions and acting up appointments in the Permanent Defence Force were suspended in 2009.  However, in order to maintain the ongoing operational capability of the Defence Forces, a limited number of exceptions to the application of the measures to the Permanent Defence Force were sought from the Department of Finance.</P>
        <P>As was announced on 24 November 2009, the Minister for Finance approved an allocation of 50 promotions, for the Permanent Defence Force.  These promotions were approved to address priority operational and command requirements.  Military management subsequently reviewed existing vacancies in all ranks across the organisation as a whole, so as to prioritise those to be filled from the approved promotions.</P>
        <P>Following on from this review, a total of 13 officer promotions and 30 enlisted promotions have been completed to date.  A further 4 enlisted promotions will be completed as soon as the administrative procedures relating to them have been completed.  The residual 3 approved promotions will be used to fill priority posts arising in the next few months.</P>
        <P>In addition to the 50 promotions, sanction was also received during 2009 for the filling of the following posts on promotion; Director of Military Prosecutions, Deputy Chief of Staff <Col N="558" />(Operations), 2 posts at Brigadier General level and 10 NCO promotions that were in progress prior to the moratorium.  Furthermore, the Department has recently received approval from the Department of Finance for the filling of the Military Judge post.  The number of promotions approved or pending at all ranks in the Reserve Defence Force for the same period is being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it becomes available.</P>

	<P Just="Left">The number of personnel who have recently left the Permanent Defence Forces is provided in the following tabular statements.</P><Col N="559" />
        <P>Within the available resources, the Government is committed to maintaining the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at a level of 10,000 all ranks, for which Government approval has been secured in the context of Budget 2010.  This reflects the reductions in personnel recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Military authorities that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force as at 30 April 2010, the latest date for which figures are available was 9,856 broken down as follows; 797 for the Air Corps, 1,023 for the Naval Service and 8,036 for the Army.</P>
        <P>Officials from the Department together with the Military Authorities are currently engaged in a review of the structures and posts required to meet the operational requirements of the Permanent Defence Force within the reduced numbers.  Following on from this review, discussions will commence with the Department of Finance to agree an Employment Control Framework for the Defence Forces, which is sustainable within a figure of 10,000 serving personnel in the Permanent Defence Force.</P>
        <P>In relation to recruitment, I have recently approved the recruitment of 40 recruits to the Naval Service.  In addition the military authorities will shortly advertise for some limited recruitment to the Army.</P>
        <P>While these are challenging times, my priority is to ensure that the Defence Forces are organised, equipped and staffed in a manner which will ensure that they can continue to deliver the services required of them by Government.</P>
        <P>I am advised that at this time the Defence Forces retain the capacity to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and overseas.</P>

	<P>Part E (Sound) of the Building Regulations, which is operative since 1992, sets out the legal requirements in relation to sound insulation in buildings.  The related Technical Guidance Document E (TGD-E) provides guidance on how to comply with Part E.  A review of Part E and TGD-E is currently under way in my Department in consultation with the Building Regulations Advisory Body (BRAB).</P>
        <P>I expect to publish a draft revised Part E and TGD-E for a three-month public consultation process later this year.  It will be open to all interested parties to make submissions to my Department on the draft proposals during that time.  A revised Part E and TGD-E will then be finalised by my Department following detailed consideration of all submissions received.</P>

	<P>A copy of the correspondence referred to was received in my Department on 21 May 2010.</P>
        <P>Under the Building Control Act 1990, responsibility for compliance with the Building Regulations is a matter for the owner or builder of a building. Enforcement of the building regulations is the responsibility of the 37 local building control authorities.  The authorities are empowered to carry out inspections and initiate enforcement proceedings, where considered necessary.</P>
        <P>My Department understands from Westmeath County Council that enforcement action in regard to the development has been ongoing since 2006 on issues of non-compliance with the Building Regulations and that the matter is currently before the Courts.</P>

	<P>Management and enforcement responses to litter problems, including defacement by graffiti, are a primary responsibility of each local authority to be met from their existing resources.  My Department also provides anti-litter and anti-graffiti awareness grants to local authorities to encourage long-term behavioural change in this regard.</P>
        <P>It is a matter for each local authority, in this case South Dublin County Council, to ensure that their functional area is, as far as practicable, kept free of litter, including graffiti.  I am satisfied that local authorities have adequate powers under the Litter Pollution Acts 1997 to <Col N="562" />2009 to tackle the problem of graffiti and adequate resources to discharge their responsibilities.  Sections 19 and 20 of the 1997 Act empower local authorities to take action in relation to graffiti and, as necessary, to remove or otherwise remedy the defacement.  Each local authority must determine the level of expenditure on individual local services as part of its annual estimates process and prioritise its resources accordingly.</P>

	<P>Section 14 of the Building Control Act 2007 sets out the eligibility criteria for registration in the statutory register of architects.  It includes a category of persons who have been who have been assessed as eligible for registration by the Technical Assessment Board in accordance with the practical experience assessment procedure viz. practising architecture for a minimum period of 10 years in the State.</P>
        <P>The Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland (RIAI), which is designated as  registration body for Architects under the Building Control Act 2007, has established an Admissions Board and a Technical Assessment Board so that the registration process may commence in the near future.  The RIAI has appointed architects to the boards and I have appointed the Chairpersons and non-architect majority to both boards.  Section 22 sets out the procedures for the operation of the Technical Assessment Board.</P>
        <P>The Act provides for an appeal against a decision of the Technical Assessment Board to an Appeals Board which will be appointed shortly.  The Appeals Board will also have an independent Chairperson and a majority of lay members.  There is ultimately an appeal to the High Court against a decision of the Appeals Board or any other Board or Committee.</P>
        <P>Once statutory registration has formally commenced it will be an offence under sections 18 (1)(a) and 18(1)(d) of the Act to use the title of &ldquo;Architect&rdquo; unless registered on the statutory register.  However, those sections will not apply</P>
        <P el="5">(i) where a person has applied for registration to either the Admissions Board or the Technical Assessment Board and where a decision has not been made on the application;</P>
        <P el="5">(ii) where a decision is awaited on an appeal to the Appeals Board against a decision of either Board referred to, or</P>
        <P el="5">(iii) where a decision is awaited on an appeal to the High Court against a decision of the Appeals Board, subject to the requirement that the application for registration to the Admissions Board or the Technical Assessment Board, or the  appeal to either the Appeals Board or the High Court, has not been withdrawn.</P>

        <P>Following enquiries by my Department, I understand that Meath County Council received an anonymous complaint in relation to the company in question, and the Council satisfied itself, an investigation, that the material in question, the subject of the complaint, was properly stored and addressed.  I understand that no complaint has been received by Longford County Council.</P>

	<P>In Budget 2006 a further package of excise relief on biofuels valued at over &euro;200 million over a five year period was approved by the Minister for Finance.  The Biofuel Mineral Oil Tax Relief (MOTR) Scheme II was advertised by my Department as a competitive call for proposals open to anyone who could fulfil the criteria for the scheme.  An assessment panel was established to review the applications comprising officials from my Department, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.  Each application was marked individually in accordance with the evaluation criteria outlined in the Guidance Notes provided to all applicants for the Scheme.  The final scores were then listed and the assessment panel awarded mineral oil tax relief to the highest scoring in each category, followed then by the second <Col N="564" />highest scoring and so forth.  My Department was required to make recommendations based on this process, to the Minister for Finance in relation to biofuels projects to be approved for excise relief under the scheme.</P>
        <P>Individual amounts of biofuel produced by particular companies under the scheme is deemed to be commercially sensitive information.  Biofuel production figures under the scheme are given out on the basis of either a general overall production figure or an overall production figure per category and are available on my Department&rsquo;s website.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the terms of the Renewable Energy Feed-in-Tariff scheme (REFIT), a new renewable generator accepted into REFIT must enter into a power purchase agreement (PPA) with a supply company.  Under the terms of the PPA, the supply company agrees to purchase RES-E from the new generating station at a fixed price irrespective of the supply company&rsquo;s commercial concerns about the alternative open market price at any particular time.  These fixed 15 year power purchase agreements are considered necessary to secure financing for new renewable generating projects.</P>
        <P>The balancing payment was introduced as a compensation mechanism for supply companies participating in REFIT to defray the additional cost to suppliers of participation in the scheme.  The Department is currently reviewing the REFIT scheme in the context of the State aid application for extension of the Scheme.  As part of the review, the Department will be considering in consultation with the Commission for Energy Regulation, how the balancing payment to suppliers is to be treated going forward.</P>

There is 3900MW of renewable generation included in the latest group processing approach, &lsquo;Gate 3&rsquo;.  To date, the CER has not required evidence of planning permission to be provided prior to determining that a project will receive a grid connection offer.</P>

	<P>The recently announced Renewable Energy Feed In Tariffs (REFIT) for biomass technologies will assist the development of a sustainable biomass supply sector in Ireland.  They will ensure that there is a ready demand for biomass and will build on the measures already in place including the REHEAT programme and the Energy Crop grant schemes run by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  The support tariffs will require State Aid clearance from the European Commission before they can be implemented.  Their announcement sends a clear signal to the market at this point and my Department will progress the State Aid clearance over the coming months.</P>

	<P>The National Skills Bulletin identifies skill shortages in the economy each year. Given the sharp rise in unemployment, there is an excess supply of labour in Ireland at present. As a result, no significant labour shortages have been identified in 2010. However, the incidence of skills shortages is very low.  These relate to a small number of posts and are confined to specialists within an occupation (e.g. electrical engineers with an expertise in high voltage grids), senior positions (e.g. senior software developer), niche areas (e.g. telesales with Nordic languages) and a specific skill mix (e.g. ICT and business).</P>
        <P>In terms of the skills requirements that will be needed in the future, the Department&rsquo;s policies  will continue to be guided, inter alia, by the Expert  Group on Future Skills Needs which reports regularly to the Minister for Education and Skills.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 188 and 191 together.</P>
        <P>Forward Planning Section of my Department is analysing demographic trends and the impact for school infrastructure provision on an ongoing basis. Based on this analysis of current demographic trends it is anticipated that there will be a need for a further post-primary school in the Lucan area in the medium term. More detailed analysis will be required in order to determine an optimum date for the commencement of that school.</P>
        <P>In the interim, my Department has increased post-primary school capacity in the  Lucan area with the provision of recently completed building projects. This includes the opening of a new post-primary school in Adamstown in September 2009 which has capacity to cater for up to 1,000 pupils. These recently completed projects, in addition to currently planned extension projects, will assist in reducing pressure for pupil places in the short to medium term while the process of advancing the project for a new school continues.</P>
        <P>I have previously stated that given the changing nature of Irish society and the projected need for a number of post-primary schools to open in the medium term, the Department is considering a number of broad policy issues regarding the establishment of new post-primary schools. As part of this, consideration is being given to the setting up of a new framework in relation to the establishment of new second-level schools and their patronage. New schools where only very initial planning has taken place, such as the case of the proposed new school in Lucan referred to by the Deputy, will be considered in the context of this framework when it is established.</P>
        <P>It is my intention to finalise this matter and convey a decision to all relevant parties at the earliest date possible.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan"><TitleTxt>T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Coughlan</NameTxt>
