      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>There are four staff assigned to the communications unit, two executive officers, one staff officer and one clerical officer.  The projected cost to date of the unit for 2010 is &euro;181,701, with &euro;84,156 being a direct cost to my Department and the balance being paid by three other Departments from which staff have been seconded to the unit.  These costs represent a reduction of 6% on the 2009 cost, 20% on the 2008 cost and 27% on the 2007 cost.  This has been achieved through greater efficiency in the operations of the unit and the application of Government policy on reducing staff numbers.</P>
        <P>The GIS comprises the Government Information Service, the Government Press Office, the communications unit and the Government website team.  The projected cost for the GIS in 2010 is &euro;1,308,100 which represents a reduction of 12% on the 2009 cost.  The Government Press Office and the Government Information Service provides, on behalf of myself, my Department and the Government an information service on Government policy to the public through the national and international media and promotes a co-ordinated approach to media matters across Departments.  The Government Press Office issues press releases to the media, briefs political correspondents, organises photocalls, information campaigns and ministerial representation on current affairs programmes.  It also disseminates information to the domestic and international media on the web and via e-mail.  Staff in the Government Press Office are available after hours and at weekends to answer media queries.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The cost of designing and developing the website was &euro;18,150.  Implementation, support and independent security testing cost a further &euro;3,116.  Computer hardware and software cost &euro;6,284 and audio-video equipment cost &euro;6,785, bringing the total cost to &euro;34,335.  The site is being hosted by the Local Government Computer Services Board and the annual hosting cost is expected to be in the region of &euro;4,000.  Apart from these costs, the project was developed using existing in-house resources in the Department.  Ongoing technical maintenance and support is being provided by staff in my Department&rsquo;s IT unit with support from an external web services company on an &ldquo;as needs&rdquo; basis.  The team that maintains and updates the site content is also drawn from existing departmental resources, with the exception of two temporary staff &mdash; journalism graduates &mdash; requiring relevant work experience who were recruited at clerical officer level.  There is no net additional cost as these posts have been funded from a reallocation of the overall staff budget, which has fallen by 11% since 2008 and is likely to be further reduced in the 2011 Estimates.</P>
        <P>It is clear that the manner in which information is transmitted through the Internet is changing.  It is important that the Government&rsquo;s ability to provide information via the web reflects this change.  The website, <i>www.MerrionStreet.ie</i> was developed following a study of best practice by more than 20 other Governments.  It provides citizens with a single on-line location where the activity of Government can be viewed.  The latest press releases from all Departments are <Col N="3"/>available on the site, which over time will become a valuable archive of Government information.  Its main purpose is to make the work of Government more accessible to citizens by reporting Government news in a user-friendly manner, using audio-visual tools and Internet capabilities, including YouTube, Flickr, Facebook and Twitter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply and would like to raise with him a couple of questions in regard to the final portion of it.  I understand that the new website, <i>www.MerrionStreet.ie</i>, which went live in July, cost approximately &euro;40,000 to set up and was inspired by the <i>www.Number-10.gov.uk</i> website.  I also understand that the dedicated website, <i>www.taoiseach.gov.ie</i>, which is already in existence could have been redesigned to provide the information contained on the <i>www.MerrionStreet.ie</i> website.  Were tenders sought in respect of the work carried out on the latter and, if so, how many were received?  What analysis was carried out in respect of the need for this website?  Would it have been possible to redesign the <i>www.taoiseach.gov.ie</i> website to allow it to include the user-friendly, on-line information for citizens to which the Taoiseach referred?  The interview the Taoiseach gave to his Government&rsquo;s deputy press secretary on the EU-Asia summit was placed on this website.  Was this to avoid the media in general or was it for the purpose of utilising the website?  Is it his intention to use this site more regularly in this way?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The <i>www.MerrionStreet.ie</i> website relates to the totality of Government activity and not simply that relating to the Department of the Taoiseach.  The website was specifically developed for this purpose.  As stated earlier, we must use all the modern Internet tools that are available in order to ensure that information is provided by the Government in a user-friendly way.  I am of the opinion that the cost involved is well justified, particularly in the context of the service that is being provided.  A tender was not required in respect of this matter because the work was carried out through the use of in-house resources.  That work involved an examination of best practice across a range of 20 other government&rsquo;s websites and not just one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I had understood that the cost&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the question of information, we meet members of the media directly and I did not realise that one cannot use a Government website to disseminate information.  Regardless of whether it is the media or a website, one can use these channels in whatever way one wishes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>To get the message out.  The website in question makes provision for web chats with Ministers and the publication of thought-provoking e-mails and letters from members of the public.  There are some who use other methods to publicise thought-provoking messages.  The website has not yet been used to any great degree for the purpose to which I refer.  Is it the Taoiseach&rsquo;s intention to ensure that more of these thought-provoking e-mails will be published and more web chats with Ministers will take place on the website?</P>
        <P>At this time last year, the Taoiseach decided to explore the appointing of a single provider of information across all Government Departments as part of a package of cost-cutting measures.  However, nothing was done about this.  I understand that when a formal tendering process was entered into, the bids received were in excess of the cost relating to the provision of the current service.  Will the Taoiseach verify whether this is the case?  In other words, will he indicate whether, when he followed through on his intention to appoint a single information provider, the tenders received in excess of the current cost of providing information?  I understand that the tender process was carried two years ago.  In light of the changed economic circumstances, <Col N="4"/>it might perhaps be worthwhile seeking new tenders because, as has proven to be the case in other sectors, the bids received might be much better value than those previously submitted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will have to check with those who deal with the service in order to answer the Deputy&rsquo;s first question.  A suggestion was made in this House, on foot of a question which was probably tabled by the Deputy, that we might consider appointing a single information provider.  I examined the matter and provided a detailed reply to the relevant question confirming the position in this regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The projected cost of the Government Information Service for 2010 is &euro;242,269.  This reflects a 6% reduction on the cost in 2009.  In light of the fact that there is absolute urgency with regard to reducing costs to a minimum while retaining effective services, is it the Taoiseach&rsquo;s view that this is the bottom line regarding what can be achieved in the context of cutting the costs relating to the Government Information Service?  Given the constraints and pressures now being felt, in this no more than any other area there must be a radical examination of what can be done.  Is that the bottom line in terms of the GIS?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Every area of expenditure is looked at in the context of Estimates and what is available for the following year.  As I said, this area has contributed to a reduction of 27% since I came to office.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been listening to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s replies to Deputy Kenny and I am still not clear why it was necessary to set up a new website, given that the Government already has the <i>www.gov.ie</i> and the <i>www.irisoifigiuil.ie</i> websites for official purposes.  There are also separate departmental websites for each Department and a citizens&rsquo; information website.  What was intended to be provided on this website that could not be made available on existing sites?</P>
        <P Just="Left">I note that there was a visit by a delegation from the Chinese Government recently but the Taoiseach did not do any media interviews following the visit.  Instead, he chose to be interviewed by an officer of the Government information services for the <i>www.MerrionSt.ie</i> website, with the interview posted on the site.  Is it intended to use that website more frequently for interviews where Ministers or the Taoiseach will be interviewed by officers of the Government information services?  This would be as opposed to doing direct interviews with the public media.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do interviews with the media all the time on any subject and where any issue can be raised.  This medium of the Internet was used to set out the work of the day, what took place at meeting and its relevance to the Irish public.  As I understand it, I am not obliged to pick and choose what media I deal with.  I deal with them all, including the Internet.  There is no more to it than that and if I get the opportunity to use this Internet medium to bring to public attention what it is the Government is doing and what is happening in the course of my job, I do not see a problem with it.  One of the great criticisms from the Opposition is a perceived dearth of information and that we need to get more information out there.  It seems that when there is more information out there, the Opposition has a problem with that as well.</P>
        <P>It would be intended to use that medium in addition to all other media to ensure that people are made aware of particular Government activities etc.  The purpose of the new website is that of a service to citizens who wish to get a clearer view of the work of Government.  Each Department has a responsibility to communicate its actions and policies and all Departments have websites as part of the process.  By and large, the websites of Departments are text-based and the new website is capable of far greater integration of audio-visual material and with its <Col N="5"/>links to social media sites such as YouTube, Facebook, Flickr and Twitter, it allows for the sharing of information between citizens.</P>
        <P Just="Left">All Departments communicate their press releases to <i>www.MerrionSt.ie</i>.  It is the job of the site to add an audio-visual dimension to the key information and make it available for distribution on more modern Internet channels.  All Government press releases should be visible on the site by means of really simple syndication, RSS, feeds.  The site&rsquo;s editorial team is tasked with communicating information on Government policy and action in a format more suited to modern Internet methods.  Its role is to report the work of Departments, Ministers and the Taoiseach in a factual manner, which is what it does.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The Taoiseach indicated the purpose of the website is to provide more information to citizens.  Why would a citizen looking for Government information do a Google search for <i>www.MerrionSt.ie</i>?  Where did the name come from and what was the idea behind it?  If a citizen wants to find out what the Government is doing and does not know which site to visit, I would think that person would look for the Government website and be directed to it.  The Taoiseach will appreciate there is a distinction between information and propaganda.  This is a propaganda site.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>What is the Deputy&rsquo;s basis for this claim?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I looked at the website.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That covers it so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I thought I was on the Fianna F&aacute;il website.  There is no difference between what is on that site and what one gets on Government party sites.  It has various press releases, interviews and so on.  It is not an information site but a form of propaganda, that is to communicate good news from the Government.  That is fair enough and I am not objecting to that.  However, there were already information sites in place.  This site was set up to propagandise for the Government.  It would have been more appropriate to leave that to the political parties in government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Gilmore makes the charge of propaganda but does not give an example.  That is an interesting way of making political assertions.  The website has been well commented on by media sources, both international and national, as a good source of information.  Most websites of this nature are text-based while this one introduces an audio-visual element to make it more user-friendly.  No one seems to have a problem with it except Deputy Gilmore.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is a bit surly today.  I was smiling when&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It has to be propaganda because Deputy Gilmore says so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Gilmore made mention of <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>If Deputy Gilmore says it, it must be true then.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I had to push the Taoiseach a bit.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Gilmore would know more about propaganda himself.  He is harking back to the old days of political instruction down in a little cottage in County Meath over a weekend.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Bring them on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>To cite an example from <i>www.MerrionStreet.ie</i> &mdash; can I have the Taoiseach&rsquo;s attention?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise.  Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s crowd was more interesting than Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s.  While Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in&rsquo;s just took it all in, Deputy Gilmore&rsquo;s boys had to be trained.  The old Stickies&rsquo; days.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>That is okay.  We will read about it in <i>The Irish Independent</i> tomorrow.</P>
        <P>The website in question is an effort on the Government&rsquo;s part to contrive some sort of a good news website and to put it in the best light possible.  I was interested by an article on the site titled, Health Innovation &mdash; Tubridy Cuts Out the Waste.  This Tubridy was not the Taoiseach&rsquo;s broadcasting friend but a consultant neurologist at St. Vincent&rsquo;s who claimed he cut waiting lists by 25% by the use of the HealthLink on-line service.  While that is fine for the hospital in question, it only gives false hope to many other people because the service in question is not commonly used across the country.  The critical story is not that this particular consultant has been able to reduce his waiting times by 25% for initial consultations; the real story is how many have to wait for them elsewhere.</P>
        <P>It is questionable whether <i>www.MerrionStreet.ie</i> was required at all.  While it probably will not take an enormous amount to maintain, I am more concerned about the promise made some time ago to secondary schools that IT equipment would be provided for every classroom.  Some 15 months later, nothing has been provided.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy is going off on a tangent.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>This IT roll-out project is far more important and beneficial to a raft of young people preparing for the severe challenges that will face them when they leave school than the <i>MerrionStreet.ie</i> website.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>On the matter to which the Deputy referred, as I said it is the use of technology for the purposes of dealing with people who have been waiting for services which has eliminated 25% of the cost.  It made a lot of difference to the people who got in much quicker as a result.  I do not see why&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>For the lucky ones.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>If other consultants took up the same practice, maybe they would reduce their fees by 25%.  Bringing that to public attention is a good thing but it seems that the premise of the Deputy&rsquo;s questions is that the Government&rsquo;s entitlement to bring it to public attention should in some way&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="7"/>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government could do it differently.  I have brought it to public attention a lot more effectively than <i>www.MerrionStreet.ie</i> by mentioning it here in the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I doubt it, Deputy, unfortunately.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I apologise, Deputy. I do not think the number of hits on the Deputy&rsquo;s website&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>Deputy, we need to move on.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We are talking about hits, I suppose.  The issue I am trying to get across is that these are good examples of good practice in the health services which need to be, and are being, brought to the attention of the public by whatever means necessary.  I find it amazing that people would regard that sort of information as something in which the public are not interested.  They are very interested in it because it will help them or a relative or member of the family to whom it would be germane at some stage.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 11, inclusive, together.</P><Col N="8"/>
        <P Just="Left">I met with representatives of IBEC and ICTU in July, when we discussed the budgetary situation and recent economic developments.  In addition, there is ongoing engagement between each of the pillars of social partnership and officials in my Department on a range of issues.  Indeed, I addressed the IBEC human resources leadership summit on 30 September.  Deputies will also be aware that there is regular contact on issues of concern to the social partners through bilateral contacts and consultation structures across relevant Government Departments.  The Government remains open to further appropriate discussions with all five of the social partner pillars under the ten year framework provided under Towards 2016 and we believe that continued social dialogue will play an important role in maximising consensus during this period of economic instability.</P>
        <P>In particular, the Government will be seeking the views of the social partners as we prepare a national reform programme as part of the EU 2020 process.  Preliminary meetings have already taken place at official level to scope out the key areas of concern to each of the pillars and further discussions will take place over the coming months.  I look forward to hearing the views of the social partners as that process develops.</P>
        <P>Ireland has nine places on the European Economic and Social Committee, EESC, and our nominations are divided equally between the three constituent groups of the EESC, that is, employers, employees and what are known as various interests.  The various interests group on the EESC comprises representatives of a wide variety of organisations, including non-governmental organisations, farmers organisations, co-operatives and non-profit associations and environmental organisations.  The EESC is mandated to consider environmental issues and environmental sustainability is a key focus of European policy.  Other countries have long had environmental organisation representatives among their nominees.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>For the first time, Ireland&rsquo;s nominees to the various interests group of the EESC included a representative from the environmental pillar.  This change reflects the decision which was taken by Government last year to create a fifth pillar of social partnership to represent environmental concerns and was not in response to representations received.  The environmental pillar of social partnership consists of 27 organisations with a diverse range of interests.  The environmental pillar selected an employee of BirdWatch Ireland as its nominee on the committee.  She is a representative of the 27 organisations in the environmental pillar and environmental interests more generally.  The environmental pillar representative will be able to draw on the combined capacity for economic, social and environmental research and analysis of the constituent members of the pillar and its secretariat.</P>
        <P>The National Implementation Body, NIB, comprising Government, employer and union representatives, has played two valuable roles over recent years.  First, it has exercised national level oversight of the industrial relations scene, assisting parties in actual or threatened disputes of national importance and providing a mechanism for ongoing review of trends in industrial relations in particular sectors.  As part of this high-level role, it has also operated as a forum for dialogue between employers and trade unions on the broad status and conduct of industrial relations in the State.</P>
        <P>Second, the NIB has sought to promote compliance with the terms of successive national agreements.  While the operating context for such a role has changed, it is clear that engagement between Government, employers and trade unions in regard to particular industrial relations disputes can be beneficial to all parties and is in the public interest.</P>
      
        <P>In recognition of that role, the Government agreed to participate with the procedures agreed between ICTU and IBEC under their Protocol for the Orderly Conduct of Industrial Relations and Local Bargaining in the Private Sector.  This protocol provides for the continuation of <Col N="9"/>tripartite engagement to oversee industrial peace and stability, and is to be reviewed by the parties at the end of 2010.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to ask the Taoiseach about the recent revelations on the SIPTU national health and local authority levy fund account, which had &euro;2.7 million transferred into it between 2002 and 2009.  The latest revelations indicate that perhaps some social partnership funds were used here also.  Does the Taoiseach have any information on this?  Has he carried out or is he carrying out an investigation into it?  I understand the HSE auditors counted 31 foreign trips across the globe.  The impact of these revelations has been to cast a very poor reflection on social partnership and travelling to study social partnership in other countries.  What is the story?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I cannot comment on whether any such funds mentioned by the Deputy were involved.  As Deputy Kenny knows, the question is being looked at by the Committee of Public Accounts and when we have that outcome and that from the two relevant Departments and the HSE, when the facts and circumstances are known, there will be an opportunity for everyone to look at the situation based on the facts as established.</P>
        <P>Clearly, as I and the Minister for Health and Children have emphasised, any potential waste of public funds is a serious matter.  Deputies are aware of the ongoing investigations into these matters and should await a full and proper analysis of the issues and allow the Committee of Public Accounts to consider these issues based on the fullest possible set of facts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the Comptroller and Auditor General did his report and the Committee of Public Accounts is looking at this.  However, there are two fundamental elements which are relevant to the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Department.  He should be able to confirm that nobody from the Department of the Taoiseach travelled on any of these social partnership investigation trips and he should certainly be able to ascertain whether any social partnership funds were used.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not sure questions on this matter are contemplated under this series of questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy puts down a question on it I can answer it with accuracy and certainty.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Croke Park agreement came about following a request from the Government for reforms following cuts in levels of pay.  Since the Croke Park agreement was ratified in June no efficiencies or savings have been made.  For example, in education, on which there was a great deal of discussion, the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014 agreed that by the start of the 2010-11 school year there would be the introduction of an additional hour per week to facilitate teachers to engage in duties determined by school management; an extra hour per week in institutes of technology and universities; ensuring that post-primary teachers are available for three timetabled class periods per week under the supervision and substitution scheme; a review and revision of teaching contracts; a review and revision of the employment terms and conditions of special needs assistants for those employed in the VEC sector; and a review of the academic employment contracts for institutes of technology by 31 August 2010.</P>
        <P>This is one area where there was a great deal of discussion and argument and eventually agreement, but the Government has sat on its hands completely.  Nothing has happened in respect of implementing the efficiencies contained in the Croke Park agreement.  What has been the big blockage to implementing agreements that were hard fought, hard worked out <Col N="10"/>and negotiated before the agreement was concluded?  Why has there been no impetus in the context of a more effective service and implementing the conditions agreed in Croke Park?  Why has there been no Government impetus, urgency or initiative about this to show everybody that an agreement like this can take place in the interests of those who work in the public service and those who receive the services those public servants are able to deliver?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is being driven by an implementation body which has arranged to obtain from the various Departments, agencies and offices action plans for the purposes of proceeding to implementation in the coming weeks and months.  In the meantime, significant work on the transformation programme is ongoing in all sectors and savings continue to be delivered against a background of falling numbers.  I am confident that the implementation of these action plans will deliver the type of changes which are required to secure cost savings, minimise the impacts of current resource constraints on service quality and availability, and improve services through the use of technology and other means.  It is true to say also that in the context of Estimates decisions that are being made, and where resources will be allocated, these changes will become clearly required and the implementation body is facilitating that engagement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is correct in that he is confident that these changes will bring about greater efficiencies and a more effective service.  On the educational block of the Croke Park agreement to which I referred, however, none of those elements have been implemented and the agreement stated clearly that these would take effect from the start of the academic year 2010-11.  Being confident is one thing but having the drive to put it through is something else.</P>
        <P>In respect of the agreement itself, as the Taoiseach will be aware, my party accepted the pay element of the Croke Park agreement, although with a different view in respect of the provision of infrastructure, for instance, in respect of our NewERA programme.  When does the Taoiseach expect that the changes agreed within the Croke Park agreement will start to take place or is this a situation where the Government does not intend to do anything about it?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is important to point out that the education situation, where the ASTI recently accepted the agreement and the TUI rejected it, involves having to deal with that issue.  That is on of the reasons some of the aspects on education have been delayed.  We will be insisting that the agreements we reach will be implemented but there has been an IR issue in the background which must be dealt with.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Croke Park agreement itself, it sets out the short-term, medium-term and longer-term issues that are being dealt with and the structural changes that must be implemented.  All of the agreement, as negotiated, has been agreed in good faith and needs to be implemented in good faith.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The formal social partnership arrangements were contained in the document Towards 2016 which was subsequently revised and called Towards 2016: Review and Transitional Agreement.  Do those two documents still apply?  Are those still live and operational and does the Government consider itself to be bound by the terms of those agreements?</P>
        <P>In respect of the implementation body set up to oversee the implementation of the measures contained in the Croke Park agreement, there was a reply from the Minister for Finance to D&aacute;il questions on Thursday last in which we were told that the implementation body held three meetings since it was established and that it was concentrating on the implementation of the agreement, including putting in place the structures at sectoral level and seeking from public service management their action plans for the implementation of the provisions of the agree<Col N="11"/>ment.  What Departments have submitted action plans for the implementation of the provisions of the agreement?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s first question, the ten-year agreement framework within which we operate social partnership continues to apply.  Like all social partnership agreements, this process takes account of the budgetary situation as it develops.  It is on the basis of maintaining and providing for stability and a good public finance position that these arrangements are entered into.  Those are what are being implemented.</P>
        <P>I do not have the detail of each departmental office but I understand responses have now been received from all sectors &mdash; Departments and offices &mdash; and will be reviewed by the implementation body in the coming weeks.  Therefore, the answer to the Deputy&rsquo;s question appears to be that all the responses are in.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Two questions arise from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s reply.  When was the last time there was a meeting together of all the social partners or all the main elements of the social partnership arrangement, namely of Government, employer bodies and trade unions in particular?</P>
        <P>Second, with regard to the action plans being made by Departments, do I understand correctly that the proposals to which the Taoiseach referred are the action plans for the implementation of the provision of the Croke Park agreement and that those action plans have now been submitted to the implementation body?  Will he outline what will now happen to those action plans?  Is it the case that they have to be agreed within the context of the implementation body and the procedures that have been set down for dealing with them?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not have the date the last plenary session of the social partnership process was held.  I will have to get that for the Deputy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Was it in the past year?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thought so but I will have to check that.  There have been meetings with the various social partners in various guises at different times but not all together.  There have been a number of meetings.  The last one with the business and employer pillar was on 19 July.  The one with the trade union pillar was on 16 July.  The one with the farming pillar was on 4 February.  I met representatives of the ICMSA on 22 July and I am due to speak at its annual meeting on 29 October.  Officials from my Department met representatives of the IFA on 29 July and I am due to meet them on 26 October.  I last met the farming pillar as a whole on 27 October 2009.  Officials from my Department met the community and voluntary pillar on 23 July &mdash; the previous meeting was held on 8 June in regard to the EU 2020 process.  I last met representatives of the environmental pillar on 27 October 2009 and, similarly, I last met representatives of the community and voluntary pillar then.  Department officials met representatives of the environmental pillar on 23 July in regard to the EU 2020 process.  The detail deals with one aspect of the Deputy&rsquo;s question.</P>
        <P>As I said, the information I have to hand is that action plans have all been submitted.  The implementation body will review those over the coming weeks and ascertain what way it can put them into place based on contacts between both sides of industry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>If the only meetings that have taken place on social partnership have been effectively bilateral meetings between the Government and individual components of the social partnership arrangement, and there has not been a plenary meeting in recent times &mdash; clearly, the Taoiseach cannot remember when there was last a plenary meeting of the social <Col N="12"/>partnership process &mdash; is it not fair to say that social partnership, certainly as we used to know it, is pretty well over?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not accept that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I will also take a final question from Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, told the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on 4 October that the Government intends to comply with the terms of the Croke Park agreement on pay and reform of the public service?  Will he confirm the assurances contained in the agreement that pay and pensions would not &mdash; I emphasise the words &ldquo;would not&rdquo; &mdash; be further cut and there would be no compulsory redundancies in the public service in return for flexibility in redeployment terms in the public service?  Will he give a clear commitment that nothing in the forthcoming budget will be in breach of the Government&rsquo;s position on the Croke Park agreement?</P>
        <P>On the ESRI recommendations <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> an across-the-board social charge, does the Taoiseach agree that this is a regressive proposal which will favour higher income earners at the expense of lower income earners?  Will he state that it will not be contemplated by the Government?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Obviously, I cannot discuss the budget with the Deputy.  On the Croke Park agreement, those who support the agreement and are anxious to implement it are anxious to work on the basis of the agreement as are those who have supported it and had the benefits that derive from it.  That is the position on that matter.</P>
        <P>On the Deputy&rsquo;s question on the issue of a social charge, the Minister indicated in his previous budget that he was preparing proposals on how he could bring about a situation in which the various levies and PRSI could be looked at in an integrated way for the future.  Many people on low incomes are excluded from the tax net.  This is about providing a sustainable way forward to ensure that the benefits of the commitments and social taxes are provided for in future with the demographics we have.</P>

        <Quest>  his views on the findings of the Second Development Cooperation Forum of the UN Economic and Social Council and their emphasis on promoting policy coherence for development; the steps he will take to address Ireland&rsquo;s shortcomings in this policy, as noted by the OECD Development Assistance Committee review; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish Deputy Breen well in his new position and look forward to the traditional cross-party support that has characterised our aid and development programme for many years. </P>
        <P>The global economic crisis highlights the importance of ensuring maximum coherence in the international effort to achieve the millennium development goals by 2015.  The Government is strongly committed to building a coherent approach to development across all Departments and ensuring that our development policies are supported, and not undermined, by other areas of policy which affect developing countries.</P><Col N="13"/>
        <P>We are working to ensure coherence within the Irish Aid programme, as well as coherence with our programme countries&rsquo; poverty reduction programmes.  Ireland is also playing a strong role internationally in policy discussions to build the effectiveness of aid and coherence across policies affecting the poorest countries and communities in the world.</P>
        <P>The United Nations development co-operation forum is an important body, bringing together national and local governments, parliamentarians, multilateral organisations and representatives of civil society and the private sector.  The aim is to discuss trends and challenges in development and share experiences and ideas for greater coherence and effectiveness.  Ireland has worked closely with the forum, with a particular emphasis on how to build accountability and transparency in development co-operation.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, the second meeting of the forum was held in New York on 29 and 30 June.  I strongly welcome the emphasis it placed on the need for coherent development programmes aligned to countries&rsquo; national development strategies.  This is, in essence, the aid effectiveness agenda on which Ireland has taken an international lead and which we implement in our own programme.</P>
        <P>The forum also noted the need for greater coherence between United Nations agencies, which has been an important Irish priority in our engagement with the UN system.</P>
        <P>I welcome the forum&rsquo;s focus on the issue of policy coherence.  I also welcome the emphasis in the outcome document adopted unanimously at the MDG review summit in New York last month on the need for increased efforts to enhance policy coherence for development.  Ireland played a strong role in the negotiations leading up to the adoption of the outcome document and our priorities are well reflected in it.</P>
        <P>The development assistance committee of the OECD carried out a peer review of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme in 2009.  Its findings were overwhelmingly positive.  It found that Irish Aid is a strong, cutting edge development programme with a clear focus on the world&rsquo;s poorest people.  It stated that Ireland is a champion in making aid more effective.</P>
        <P>The review provided a number of helpful recommendations on the further development of policy coherence for development in Ireland and it welcomed the establishment of the interdepartmental committee on development.  As the chair of the committee, I am ensuring that the recommendations are being examined and followed up across Departments.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply and best wishes.  The issue of policy coherence for development is extremely important and I refer, for example, to the importance of a global cohesive policy in respect of trade, fishing and agriculture.  I highlight this issue because both the United Nations and the European Parliament have made it a priority and, as the Minister of State noted, simply giving aid and assistance to Third World countries is not enough in this day and age.  Someone recently asked me&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Deputy Breen to come to the question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I will.  I was asked what was the reason for aid being given with one hand but taken away with the other.  One of the greatest challenges we face is the issue of policy coherence for development as although we are good at protecting our own interests, we sometimes do not protect those of developing countries.  I wish to praise the outstanding work carried out by Irish Aid to assist developing countries.  My question pertains to the interdepartmental committee that was set up in 1997, which is chaired by the Minister of State and brings together a wealth of people with experience.  I understand this committee has only met 11 times since its establishment in 1997.  How many times did it meet over the last 12 months?  How effective has the committee been thus far?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="14"/>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">While I must get the exact number of meetings over the past 12 months for the Deputy, the committee has been working highly effectively.  The idea behind the committee is to ensure, as the Deputy correctly pointed out, that Ireland does not undermine its highly effective aid programme by adopting policies across Departments that would so do, specifically in the area of trade.  The World Trade Organisation Doha development round of world trade negotiations constitutes a key example in this regard.  I was part of the Irish delegation, with the T&aacute;naiste, who was then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, as well as the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, which went to Geneva as part of the Irish national team that negotiated Ireland&rsquo;s national position at that round.  This is an example of how Ireland can put forward a unified national approach, even though some approaches and policies might be perceived to be opposed to other aspects of national policy.  However, the objective is to inform one another of one&rsquo;s overall national objectives and to seek, through this departmental committee, to marry them together and to put forward a cohesive and coherent national approach.  I will revert to the Deputy in respect of the actual number of meetings of the committee.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand, from the responses to a number of parliamentary questions, that this committee has only met twice over the past 12 months even though it originally was meant to meet bimonthly and then monthly.  The Minister of State might establish whether this is the case.  As chairman of the aforementioned committee, the Minister of State should put this issue at the top of his agenda because it is the way forward for developing countries.</P>
        <P>My final supplementary question in this regard is to ask the reason this committee has not reported to the Oireachtas and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs?  Although the report of the OECD development assistance committee, DAC, recommended that this committee should report to the Oireachtas, this has not been done.  Therefore, the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas aid should make this matter a priority because Ireland does not wish to be left behind when compared with other countries.  While this is separate from our own aid activity, I refer to the subject of policy coherence for development.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Far from being left behind on this agenda, Ireland is recognised as being a world leader in this area.  Not only did the OECD DAC report to which the Deputy referred state that Ireland is a champion in making aid more effective but within the United Nations system, Ireland is perceived to be a leader in respect of establishing coherence right across UN agencies.  Moreover, Ireland is the lead international donor in Tanzania and Vietnam in the delivery of UN projects and this is well recognised throughout the world.

        <Quest>  his views on the <Col N="15"/>breakdown of talks, hosted by the United States of America, between Israeli and Palestinian representatives, due to the increase in the development of illegal settlements; and his further views as to what this might mean for any peace agreement in the region </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Despite the many difficulties remaining, the direct talks between Israeli and Palestinian leaders that commenced on 2 September present a historic opportunity to at last achieve a just and lasting peace.  Compounding the complexity of the issues has been a deep lack of trust between the two sides, with each believing the other is not serious about negotiations.  Ireland and the European Union continue to regard Israeli settlement activity in the occupied Palestinian territories as illegal.  However, without prejudice to that position, the partial freeze on new settlement construction ordered by Prime Minister Netanyahu in November 2009, limited as it was, was an important element in creating the atmosphere to allow these talks to begin.  Ireland, along with our EU partners, with the United States and many others, strongly urged Israel to renew the construction freeze when it expired on 26 September, in order to allow the talks to continue.  As I made clear in my speech to the United Nations General Assembly on 27 September, it is deeply regrettable that the Israeli Government has not done so and has allowed construction to resume.</P>
        <P>Settlements and borders are only one of the issues which must be resolved in the negotiations.  However, continued settlement construction is intended to circumscribe a negotiated peace by creating facts on the ground which any agreement must accept.  It also involves the progressive expropriation of Palestinian lands, expulsion of families, and destruction of their homes. These factors would make it extremely difficult for President Abbas to continue in the talks, which have not yet progressed far enough to create stronger confidence in their outcome and he has stated clearly that he cannot do so if construction resumes.</P>
        <P>At this moment the United States is working hard with both parties to find a formula that will allow the talks to continue, perhaps in the form of a limited extension of the freeze for a short period. It is not clear yet if these efforts will succeed.  The foreign ministers of the Arab League agreed on 8 October to allow a further month for the US efforts to continue before deciding if the talks can proceed.</P>
        <P>These talks may be the last opportunity for a long time to achieve a just settlement based on two states living side by side in peace and security.  If this effort fails, new generations of leaders in Palestine and the wider Arab world may have no appetite to continue on this road.  To avoid this and achieve lasting peace, maximum restraint for the duration of these talks would be a small price.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am grateful for the Minister&rsquo;s reply.  Anyone must conclude that far from there being any element of trust or good faith going into these talks, it is singularly absent, as the events that have taken place prove.  I might put a number of questions to the Minister.  In respect of his statement, which I accept, to the effect that the issues of borders and settlements are two huge areas, I note that one of the parties in government in the Knesset has announced that it will require of the 20% of Palestinians who live in the state of Israel that they take an oath of loyalty to the Jewish state of Israel.  This  is a fact.  Again, with regard to the statement that it is not just that the settlements &mdash; I appreciate the Minister&rsquo;s emphasis &mdash; are in themselves illegal there also are the evictions that are taking place in East Jerusalem, something that has heightened in recent times.  Moreover, the extension of the settlements across the Jordan Valley has the effect, to put it plainly, effectively of dividing the West Bank into cantons, thereby making matters almost impossible.</P>
        <P>There is nothing to sustain the talks in practical terms such as, for example, a permanent secretariat that might take on the issues of settlements, evictions, borders, the future of Jerusa<Col N="16"/>lem and so on.  Such an initiative on the ground would function as a conduit to the opinions of the Foreign Ministers of the Arab states, which might ensure continuity past the breakdown of a particular set of talks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no difficulty with much of what the Deputy has said in terms of the events that have happened which, when taken together, undermine the prospects of a peaceful settlement.  I share Deputy Higgins&rsquo;s objections to the proposed oath of loyalty which is provocative and counter-productive to the peace process itself.  It is wrong.  What is clear is that there are forces within Israeli society which do not perhaps want the talks to succeed, just as on the Palestinian side there is Hamas and others externally who likewise do not wish to see a successful outcome.</P>
        <P>I made the point when I met in New York with Mr. Ahmed Aboul Gheit, the Egyptian Foreign Minister, and members of the Arab League that we must create space to give the talks a chance.  The Quartet, the United States and Mr. Tony Blair, as the Quartet&rsquo;s envoy in the Middle East, have been at pains to point out to us that the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr. Netanyahu, is essentially the only person in government at this point in time who can deliver a deal from the Israeli side.  Moreover, it has been communicated to us by all involved that he sincerely wants an agreement, just as it has been communicated to us that the Palestinian President, Mr. Abbas, seeks an agreement.  Efforts are continuing in that regard and I am pleased the Arab League has given at least a month to see if something can be worked out informally in order to allow the talks to continue.</P>
        <P>I take on board Deputy Higgins&rsquo;s final point in terms of the capacity behind the talks and the need for continuity.  What has tended to happen in regard to the Annapolis process is that when an Israeli Prime Minister retires or whatever, the entire process stalls.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>We are all agreed that we want peace to happen and we support the efforts of the Quartet in this regard.  However, if one takes the full list of issues &mdash; including prisoners, refugees, the future status of Jerusalem, settlements in the West Bank, borders and so on &mdash; they all require a type of permanent structure such as could be delivered through a secretariat.  Moreover, the existence of a secretariat would mean that when the political moment is not hopeful, one could deal, through text, with aspects of the problem.  Such a structure, as I said, would also be a conduit to the Arab League and to the Foreign Ministers of the region and so on.</P>
        <P>There is a difficulty in that some members of the Quartet are not engaged at all.  As a consequence one is pushed to a reliance on talks which are suddenly loaded with a political outcome.  One wishes the process well and hopes that the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr. Netanyahu, will deliver agreement, but one is still left with all the other issues.  The position of the United States as a guarantor on one side of the argument means it is very reluctant to delegate anything to a secretariat that might be in continuous dialogue about the issue.  I see nothing tangible from the efforts of Mr. Blair since his arrival in his role.</P>

The Deputy seems to be suggesting a mechanism to pull all of the work that has been done together and which has political approval.  That proposal has value.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Deputy Barrett on his appointment as foreign affairs spokesperson.  I acknowledge the merits of the proposal referred to by the Deputy which aims to harness the skills and experience of Irish people facing a period of unemployment to benefit communities in the developing world.  The Government is open to consideration of innovative approaches which would enhance Ireland&rsquo;s national contribution to the achievement of the millennium development goals.  We have paid particular attention over the past 18 months to the encouragement of volunteering in the developing world.  Through the aid programme, which is administered by Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Government is funding the work of some 1,300 development workers, volunteers and missionaries in developing countries.  Their work is an important and greatly valued aspect of the overall Irish contribution towards the achievement of the millennium development goals by 2015.</P>
        <P>Our support for volunteering recognises the unique contribution volunteers can make to development.  The Irish Aid volunteering and information centre in Dublin was established in 2008 to promote and facilitate responsible volunteering.  Since April of last year the centre has organised four volunteering fairs &mdash; three in Dublin and one in Cork &mdash; to highlight and promote opportunities to volunteer with the main development and humanitarian agencies and non-governmental organisations.  More than 1,000 people have attended the fairs, the most recent of which was held in September.  Twenty-seven volunteering organisations participated, recruiting teachers, medical personnel, engineers and other volunteers to work on construction in developing countries.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid is working closely with volunteering organisations to identify placements which will promote development in the poorest countries and provide volunteers with an opportunity to make a real contribution in the fight against poverty and hunger.  It is important to ensure that all volunteering assignments are suited to an individual&rsquo;s capacity and experience and are of benefit to the community they travel to in the developing world.  It is also important to address possible health, safety and security risks and to ensure volunteers and the organisations they work with recognise the complexity of the challenge of working in some of the poorest countries in the world.</P>
        <P>The Government has also established a rapid response  corps to enable members of the public with specific skills to assist in humanitarian crises, such as the recovery effort following the earthquake in Haiti in January.  Members of the corps have specialised skills in areas such as logistics, engineering, and water and sanitation and are available for secondment at short notice to the United Nations and other humanitarian organisations in emergency situations.  The Department of Foreign Affairs is working to expand the expertise available to the corps, and a new recruitment round will be held in 2011.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="18"/>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I join him in lauding voluntary organisations for the great work they are doing.  Is the Minister of State aware that in Australia the new Foreign Minister is putting a Bill through parliament, the Australian Civil Corps Bill, along the lines I am suggesting, whereby one would establish a register not only to work with developing countries but also to provide specialists to deal with natural disasters and so on? The establishment through legislation of a civilian corps would be of great value.  There is a great deal of good work being done in this area but much of it is not known.  Such an initiative would be evidence that we are thinking outside the box.</P>
        <P>Rather than having unemployed engineers and tradespeople sitting at home, they could volunteer through an organised corps to do work abroad as part of our overseas aid programme.  What recognition is given in our target of 0.7% of GDP to the value of the work done by skilled people working abroad?  Is that taken into account as part of the target?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>I will answer Deputy Barrett&rsquo;s last question first.  The answer is, specifically, no.  The official development assistance that donor countries provide to developing countries and aid agencies is measured in euro and dollars.  That is not to take away from the excellent work carried out in the name of Ireland by highly skilled and specialised people.</P>
        <P>We have a corps not unlike the one proposed by the Deputy.  It is our rapid response corps, which has been developed in the past 24 months, specifically to respond to emergency and humanitarian disasters.  That corps identifies the type of people about whom the Deputy is talking.  They are people with high skills and great experience in logistics, engineering, education and health delivery.  These are the sorts of skills needed in the immediate aftermath of an emergency or crisis.  One does not necessarily need hundreds of people very quickly but one needs highly skilled, effective and experienced people.</P>
        <P>I am aware of the Australian model to which the Deputy refers.  It also seeks to promote business people to engage in the developing world.  Australia&rsquo;s developing world is Asia, which is in closest proximity to them.  Ours is sub-Saharan Africa.  Our way of promoting Irish people to engage with the sorts of skills about which the Deputy is talking is through voluntary non-governmental organisations.  Since 2008, we are funding 3,000 people to get involved in those organisations, which we directly fund.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the millennium goals was to improve the standard of education.  Therefore one needs teachers and buildings.  If one provides assistance in that area alone, never mind the whole area of health which is also included in the millennium goals, one must deal with more than euro and dollars.  Surely we have gone beyond the point where it is just about dollars.  Can we not provide assistance in the form of individuals, particularly when we have so many qualified people?  I am sure a high percentage of qualified people would be only too willing to consider engaging in a properly structured, and not <i>ad hoc</i>, programme.  That is where legislation similar to that in Australia could come into play.  We need a properly structured programme whereby these people could sign up to 12 months or longer.  There may be professional people in the public service who might want to seek leave of absence for a period or people in farming might want to volunteer.  Targets could be met in this way.</P>
        <P>It is not just about money.  We should seek to have our contribution measured by way of personal and professional involvement.  This should be part and parcel of any target that is set.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Of course the Deputy is right.  It is not just about euro or dollars.  The Deputy mentioned education.  The greatest progress in the millennium goals has been in the area of education.  However, it was not achieved by transplanting teachers from Ireland to developing countries but by building up their inherent education systems and providing training colleges and trainers of teachers as well as the schools themselves.</P><Col N="19"/>
        <P>I do not think a new statutory body is the way to go.  We have a structured way, through funding of NGOs, where people are invited to come in and use their skills.  We are also funding specialist placement organisations, such as Voluntary Service Overseas, Suas, SERVE and the United Nations Volunteers organisation.  These provide opportunities for people with skills to contribute in the way the Deputy is proposing.  I welcome the fact that he is thinking outside the box in encouraging as many people as possible to volunteer but I do not think legislation is the way to go.</P>

        <Quest>  in view of the recent comments by the Chief Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia regarding the failure of Serbia to produce a person (details supplied), his views on whether the Stabilisation and Association Agreement motion should be passed prior to the confirmation of the delivery of the person to the Tribunal </Quest>
        <QRef>[36399/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia was signed in April 2008.  However, it was decided to defer ratification of the agreement until the Council was satisfied with Serbia&rsquo;s co-operation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY).  Following a positive assessment by Chief Prosecutor Brammertz regarding Serbia&rsquo;s ongoing co-operation with the tribunal, Ministers decided, by consensus, at the Foreign Affairs Council on 14 June 2010 to submit the agreement to their national parliaments for ratification.  At the same time, the Council again underlined that full co-operation with ICTY remains an essential element of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement process.  </P>
        <P>The Chief Prosecutor also reported to the UN Security Council in June 2010.  His report found that Serbia has co-operated satisfactorily with the tribunal in terms of access to documents, archives and witnesses.  He particularly welcomed the seizure by Serbia in February 2010 of Ratko Mladic&rsquo;s handwritten war time notebooks.  He also encouraged Serbia to increase its operational capacities and adopt a more rigorous and multi-disciplinary approach to the arrest of the remaining two fugitives.  The Serbian Government in reply confirmed that the Chief Prosecutor&rsquo;s suggestions and recommendations are being implemented.</P>
        <P>Each member state ratifies Stabilisation and Association Agreements according to its own internal procedures.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, this requires the passing of a resolution by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approving the terms of the agreement.  It is proposed to submit a motion to D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in relation to the ratification by Ireland of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia in the near future.</P>
        <P>The EU&rsquo;s Stabilisation and Association Agreement process provides the framework for co-operation on economic, political and legal matters aimed at bringing the western Balkan countries towards the standards and principles required for EU accession.  Co-operation with ICTY is a precondition for those wishing to conclude Stabilisation and Association Agreements with the EU.  It is a precondition which the EU has enforced consistently and firmly.</P>
        <P>When I met with the Serbian Foreign Minister, Vuk Jeremic, in New York last month he emphasised the importance Serbia attaches to EU integration.  During the meeting I asked him about progress on issues relating to ICTY.  Minister Jeremic underlined Belgrade&rsquo;s commitment to full co-operation with ICTY, noting that 44 of 46 indictees have been arrested and handed over to the tribunal.  He said that Serbia wants to see the remaining two indictees arrested as soon as possible.</P><Col N="20"/>
        <P Just="Left">It is important, I believe, that we acknowledge the substantial progress Serbia has made in the ten years since protests led to the end of the Milosevic regime.  We must continue to assist and encourage Serbia on its path to the EU.  At the same time, as with the Stabilisation and Association Agreement process, the EU will insist that Serbia co-operates fully with ICTY in bringing to justice the two indicted war criminals that remain at large.  However, as the Deputy will appreciate, we must base our decisions on the official reports by the chief prosecutor, rather than comments reported in the media.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister&rsquo;s information and mine seem to be at variance.  On 20 September the chief prosecutor, Serge Brammertz had very harsh things to say about the lack of progress in respect of the arrest of Mr. Mladic and company.  Is the Minister aware of the statement of 20 September, which reads,  &ldquo;Political support from the European capitals and from Brussels is of paramount importance in pressing Serbia to arrest Mladic and the only other remaining fugitive, former Croatian-Serb leader Goran Hadzic.&rdquo;  He also noted that the tribunal cannot wait indefinitely for Mladic to be arrested as the UN Security Council is pushing the tribunal to complete all its cases and shut its doors.  The tribunal is due to close down in three years.  He said, &ldquo;We need arrests now in order to be able to have a trial which represents the magnitude of the crimes committed&rdquo;.  Brammertz says Serbian authorities are doing all they can to track down Mladic but he &ldquo;senses a gap between political pronouncements and the actions he sees on the ground&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I would support the progress being made in Serbia and in many other areas, but this is a point of principle.  If we set up an international tribunal to deal with the worst atrocities in the history of Europe since the Second World War and are then seen to walk away from our responsibility of bringing these two monsters to justice, it would be a slight on all of us.  A small neutral country like Ireland should show example here.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister not to bring the Stabilisation and Association Agreement motion before the House until I have asked the Joint Committee on European Affairs to have Mr. Brammertz attend the committee and report to it on what he is saying in his reports.  This is the last remaining tool to support that international court.</P>

	<P>We need to take a considered approach and, apart altogether from Mr. Brammertz&rsquo;s assessment, the European process for the western Balkans is the most effective way to embed democracy and the standards to which we aspire.  The current Government of Serbia is progressive and pro-European Union.  If we set the clock back any further, we would put all that at risk for other countries in the western Balkans as well as Serbia.  </P>

        <P>I have attended European Council meetings at which Mr. Brammertz made presentations.  The last of these was in June, when he made a positive assessment of Serbia&rsquo;s co-operation with the ICTY.  He also made a positive assessment at the previous meeting.</P>

	<P>I am speaking about the Council.  The chief prosecutor is, of course, anxious to maintain pressure but equally he has stated that he presents the matter as he sees it and it is for us as Ministers and Governments to make our decisions.</P>
        <P>When I met the Serbian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Jerem&iacute;c, in New York he pointed out that his Government has already done the heavy lifting in regard to the political difficulties of handing over people.  It has handed over three former presidents and 44 of the 46 indictees have been arrested.  Last March, the Serbian Parliament in Belgrade issued a declaration condemning the Srebenica massacre.  The wartime notebooks of Mladic were handed to the ICTY in May.  In July, the Serbian and Croatian Presidents staged a joint visit to Bosnia for the Srebenica commemoration.  In September, nine former paramilitaries were indicted by the country&rsquo;s war crimes prosecutor for the killing of ethnic Albanians during the Kosovo conflict.</P>
        <P>The joint EU-Serbia resolution on Kosovo represented a very important event at the UN General Assembly in September.  Concerns initially arose that Serbia would not co-operate with the EU proposal at the UN but considerable pressure was exerted and it ultimately agreed with a resolution brokered by the High Representative, Baroness Catherine Ashton.  One has to act in good faith.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Lisbon treaty has provided new structures for external representation of the EU, including the appointment of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy, Baroness Catherine Ashton.  The High Representative now carries out the foreign policy representation functions previously carried out by the rotating EU Presidency.  The purpose of these changes is to allow the European Union to play a more effective role and have a stronger and more coherent voice in the international arena.  Over the past year EU ambassadors in New York have been fully engaged in explaining the changes arising from the Lisbon treaty to non-EU member states and working to ensure that the new external representatives of the EU can fulfil their role adequately at the UN. </P>
        <P>Following a lengthy process of consultation, EU member states tabled a draft resolution at the General Assembly last August to provide for a modestly enhanced status to the EU&rsquo;s existing rights as an observer, including allowing the EU High Representative and other EU representatives to speak in a timely manner in formal meetings of the UN General Assembly and Security Council as well as seeking the right of reply and to distribute official documents of the EU.</P>
        <P>This request is fully compatible with the EU&rsquo;s status as an observer at the UN General Assembly, a status which is also held by a range of other international organisations.  The request requires no change in either normal UN procedures or to the UN charter.  The United Nations very much remains an organisation of states and, therefore, there is no question of the EU or any other international organisation having a status at the UN beyond that of an observer.</P>
        <P>On 14 September, the General Assembly voted to defer consideration of the draft resolution on the issue of EU representation at the UN.  This should be clearly understood as a procedural set back rather than a verdict <i>per se</i>  on the substance of what the EU is seeking.  While this was disappointing for EU member states, it was apparent that certain other UN members wished to have more time to consider the implications of the changes in EU representation.  Concerns were also expressed by some UN members that the EU was seeking new prerogatives at the UN, which is not the case.</P>
        <P>As I noted in my speech to the UN General Assembly on 27 September, the EU and its 27 member states are firmly committed to effective multilateralism with a strong UN at its core.  We look forward to further consultations with UN member states on formalising the changes to the representation of the EU in the UN General Assembly.  This is something to which Ireland and its EU partners attach the utmost importance because the proposed modest adjustments will help the EU to make a more effective contribution to the work of the General Assembly and the UN.  It is also important the EU learns the appropriate lessons from its inability up to now to secure sufficient support from other UN members for the modest changes it is seeking.  A process of internal review is now under way in both New York and Brussels to assess the potential implications of last month&rsquo;s vote for EU standing within the UN.  The issue will also be discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council later this month, at which time I and my EU counterparts will be able to benefit from the results of the internal analysis now under way.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>In view of the fact that we are a small country with no axe to grind, can we not lead on this issue?  Does the Minister agree that reform of the UN is required?  Does he agree that the UN Security Council, with its five permanent members, is totally out of date in the current era?  Does he accept that the 500 million people of the EU contribute <Col N="23"/>more than anyone else to the running of the UN?  Does he agree that the EU should have a different status to that of the Vatican, the Red Cross and the Arab League?  It is time we as a country within the EU sought these changes and I ask him to set out the Government&rsquo;s position regarding reform of the Security Council and the general operation of the UN.  Will he take a lead on this issue within the EU?  He is smiling but, believe it or not, we could do a lot because we have nothing to lose.</P>

	<P>The Deputy asked two separate sets of questions.  The original question referred to the UN&rsquo;s refusal to allow the European Union the right to speak at a meeting of the General Assembly under new arrangements.  On the wider issue of UN reform, Ireland has already taken a lead.  My predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, was nominated by the Secretary General of the UN to lead reform by bringing proposals together.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>In regard to current reforms to peacekeeping and peace building, our permanent representative to the UN, Anne Anderson, has been asked by the Secretary General to lead work in these areas.  This reflects the high respect in which we are held by the United Nations.  We take leadership positions on a number of issues, the most recent of which was our significant diplomatic achievement on the review of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.  One of our officials chaired the Middle East resolution at the conference on that treaty.</P>
     
        <P>Most people would have said there was no chance of emerging from that process with a consensus leading to a conference in 2012.  There is still a lot of work to be done.  Ireland was asked to chair the process and it performed admirably in that regard.</P>
        <P>The real issue, which we flagged within the European Union, is that the Union did not go about its business in the most optimal way.  As the Finnish Foreign Minister says, the Union needs to be mindful of how it is perceived in other parts of the globe.</P>

	<P>Does the Minister agree that if there is no reform, there is always a danger that other arrangements will come into place, and that they will have an impact on the overall effectiveness of the United Nations?  The United Nations is well worth maintaining provided it is updated and has modern practices.  The real danger is that there would be more alignment between the European Union and NATO and such arrangements while ignoring the United Nations.  Is the Government prepared to take the lead and renew the request made to the now Minister for Justice and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to lead a reform programme?  Will the Minister for Foreign Affairs <Col N="24"/>return to us with an update on what exactly is happening in regard to the committee that the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I mean that sincerely.  Much work has been undertaken.  We will continue with the leadership role we have adopted in regard to many of the aspects of the work of the United Nations.  We will continue to push for reform where it is needed within the United Nations, as we do in respect of all the bilateral meetings we have held.</P>

        <Quest>  to report at UN level between Israel and Palestine; the EU response to these negotiations; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[36054/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The direct talks which began in Washington on 2 September continued in two further sessions, in Egypt and Jerusalem, on 14 September and 15 September.  The talks involved Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas, with very restricted teams on both sides.  The United States, usually through Senator Mitchell personally, is present at all sessions as a broker, but not a direct participant.  The other members of the Quartet &mdash; the United Nations, the European Union and Russia &mdash; fully support this effort.</P>
        <P>It is the intention of the parties that the progress of the talks should be kept as restricted and confidential as possible, and I respect that as an essential measure if they are to succeed.  There has been a serious threat to the continuation of the talks due to the resumption of Israeli settlement construction.  It is hoped this can be resolved and that the talks will continue, but this is not yet certain.  I dealt with this issue in more detail in reply to the priority question on this subject.</P>
        <P>The key issues to be settled are borders &mdash; including in respect of Jerusalem and settlements &mdash; and security, refugees and water.  The initial talks are between Israel and President Abbas as leader of both the Palestinian Authority and the PLO.  To reach a comprehensive settlement, Syria and Lebanon would also have to become involved in due course.  The question of Gaza, currently under separate Hamas control, would have to be taken into account.</P>
        <P>It is intended within one year to reach a framework agreement, with full details being elaborated subsequently.  This timetable is ambitious but entirely feasible if there is genuine will on both sides.  An outline agreement on borders, which would indicate which settlement blocks might remain part of Israel, would go a long way towards defusing the current serious difficulty over settlement construction.  This should compel both parties to make every possible effort, and show all possible restraint, for the comparatively short period required.  The prize of lasting peace is of vastly greater significance.  I again urge the Israeli Government in particular to renew the moratorium on settlement construction.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="25"/>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>As I understand it, both the Palestinians and Israelis accept the two-state solution.  Am I correct in saying that?</P>
        <P>As with our experience in Northern Ireland, it is a question of achieving a basic understanding and sticking to that.  Surely there are times when we must keep working towards acceptance of one particular fact.  I would be horrified to see the talks collapsing when there is agreement on the basic principle.  I am interested to hear whether the Minister believes enough is being made of the fact that the agreement already exists.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The fundamental lesson to be drawn from the Northern Ireland peace process is that hurdles were jumped where there was a will on all sides to reach agreement.  As I stated in my earlier reply, there is still a significant lack of trust in terms of one side trusting that the other will go the full road towards a solution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>That trust did not exist initially in Northern Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>There was a far greater degree of trust in the Northern Ireland peace process than might have been known about at the time, certainly behind the scenes.</P>
        <P>Achieving an agreement is very difficult and there are many challenges and hurdles.  That said, the feedback we are receiving suggests both leaders are putting on the table their genuine personal desire to see an outcome.  President Abbas has been weakened significantly over the past two years by a variety of incidents.  I will not go through all of them again.  He has the support of the Arab League and the Arab states, which support is essential.  These states make a call in terms of what is possible for him in respect of his ability to emerge from the talks with an outcome.</P>
        <P>I have made the point to anybody I have spoken to that every effort should be made to try to make space for the talks to proceed and to allow people to get into detail.  I do not disagree with the Deputy in this regard.  It is a matter of the United States trying to broker a formula that would keep the two leaders talking.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</NameTxt>
	<P>I made a point on the value of a secretariat in Question No. 80.  The Minister has acknowledged it represents a way forward, which I appreciate.  His own long list of unfinished business makes the case again for the secretariat.  I do not share the Minister&rsquo;s view on the Arab League.  The league switches on and off the issue in a fairly intermittent way.</P>
        <P>While the talks may be at the point of breakdown in regard to the settlement issue, there were other dimensions, including those the Minister has listed, that could have created some prospect of progress, such as the release of prisoners or addressing the issue on east Jerusalem.  Does the Minister agree?</P>
        <P>Following on Deputy Barrett&rsquo;s point, there is no agreement on the shape of a contiguous, independent, viable Palestinian state.  That is the issue.  I repeat that if there is an extension beyond Ma&rsquo;ale Adumim across the Jordan valley, one will have created such obstacles that there cannot be a contiguous, viable Palestinian state.  We have been saying for decades that a two-state solution is the issue but there is no agreement on what is required in terms of an international legal order to establish that.  That is where the Arab League could have been more active.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I made a point on the Arab league in the context of supporting President Abbas, not on the wider issues.  The Deputy is making the point that the settlements on the ground keep creating new facts on the ground that undermine the principle of having two states.  That is the problem and where the issue becomes very difficult.  On the Palestinian side, people are saying that, in spite of all the talk of having two states, the reality is different <Col N="26"/>on the ground.  Matching the rhetoric and articulation of principles with the reality on the ground is the big challenge and difficulty.  That is why President Abbas cannot really move too far forward without the settlement issue being at least temporarily put aside.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatBreen"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Breen</NameTxt>
	<P>What are the Minister&rsquo;s views on the Israeli offer to renew the building freeze in settlements in return for Palestinian recognition of Israel as the main Jewish state?  I know this has been rejected by the Palestinians.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>As I stated, I regard the oath of loyalty required of Arabs living in Israel, including Jerusalem, as counter-productive and wrong.  It is not helpful in any shape or form.</P>

        <Quest>  if he will seek an interim agreement at the next meeting of the EU General Affairs Council in setting up a rapid response corps, consisting of existing battle groups, to deal with global humanitarian crises; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The question of whether and how military assets and capabilities can best be used in responding to humanitarian emergencies was discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council in June in the context of the Union&rsquo;s response to the Haiti earthquake.  EU action in response to humanitarian crises is framed in the context of an overall international approach that brings together the United Nations, the Red Cross movement, humanitarian NGOs and others in support of action by the national authorities of the country concerned.  There is general agreement that humanitarian assistance should respect the principles of neutrality, impartiality and independence.  Accordingly, humanitarian action should be civilian in character and leadership.   </P>
        <P>However, it is established UN and EU policy that in certain circumstances humanitarian aid may draw upon military assets, notably for logistical and infrastructure support.  This would normally occur where there is no comparable civilian alternative and where only the use of military assets can meet a critical humanitarian need.  Operating procedures and co-ordination arrangements for military support to EU disaster response have been put in place within the overall framework of humanitarian operations retaining their civilian nature and character.</P>
        <P>There is considerable divergence of views among partners on the use and potential effectiveness of battle groups in a humanitarian context &mdash; not least because many of their components are not appropriate for disaster relief.  This means that a battle group may not be able to provide the necessary capabilities within the timeframe required, even if it is decided that the use of military units is appropriate in the particular circumstances.   I am in favour of further consideration of this question among our partners.  Ireland&rsquo;s position on this matter is pragmatic and needs-driven. Once it is clear that there is no comparable civilian alternative available to meet a critical humanitarian need, military assets should be deployed be they elements drawn from a stand-by EU battle group or generated for that specific purpose from the member states, whichever is the more appropriate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>Is the Minister aware of the suggestion made by Brigadier General Stefan Andersson, who commands the Nordic Battlegroup 2011, in which Irish troops will take part next year with Sweden, Norway, Finland and Estonia and will be on standby for rapid deployment in the event of a military crisis, that the EU should consider broadening the range of possible deployments for the battle groups to include natural disasters and humanitarian <Col N="27"/>crises such as the Haiti earthquake?  The Brigadier General went on to state that within the Nordic battle group is a medical company, transport, helicopters, tactical aircraft and well trained soldiers who can support those who need support in such situations.  I have spoken to people in the Irish Defence Forces who say they are ready, willing, able and capable of being discharged to assist in humanitarian crises and disasters.  To fight whom are we keeping this military force on standby when it could be being used to assist in dealing with disasters such as occurred in Pakistan?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy will be aware that I quoted the Brigadier General&rsquo;s comments at the last meeting of the Joint Committee of European Affairs.  I agree with Deputy Barrett.  I also agreed with a number of members at the European Foreign Affairs Council that the battle group should be utilised to assist in disasters such as occurred in Haiti.  This would be a good demonstration of the importance and relevance of battle groups and justification for the background work that goes into their formation, training and so on.  There is no disagreement on this issue.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The mood of the people ranges from deeply concerned to terrified in terms of the economic situation the country now faces.  They recognise that a significant element of this is because of poor Government, bad judgment and obscene wastage of their money.  This morning we heard from the European Commission that most of the sacrifices made by the people have now been frittered away in terms of payment for the banks.  The Fine Gael Party is not tied to any particular group or sector.  Its only interest is in the people and country of Ireland.  Obviously, others will feel the same.</P>
        <P>Yesterday, I received a letter from the leader of the Green Party, a minority party in government, requesting Fine Gael&rsquo;s participation in a forum seeking consensus on the approach to be taken to deal with the economic situation we face.  The Fine Gael Party has for more than a year accepted the need for a reduction to 3% in debt ratio by 2014 and has stated that this should be front-loaded.  We agree with the production of a four year fiscal plan in this regard.  We believe that is constructive.  The Labour Party holds the same view in terms of the main targets and objectives in this regard.</P>
        <P>The leader of the Green Party has put forward his view that there should be a consensus on the approach to be taken towards the fiscal and economic situation in which we find ourselves.  Was the letter sent by the leader of the Green Party issued on behalf of the Government?  Does it have the Taoiseach&rsquo;s imprimatur?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The letter was circulated by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in his capacity as leader of the Green Party.  It is very important, from the point of view of that party and from the point of view of everyone else, to see if there is some way a form of general consensus might be arrived at.  As the Deputy stated, there is consensus among the main political parties with regard to reducing the deficit to 3% by 2014.  I made the <Col N="30"/>point on the Friday before last that we would seek to facilitate the Opposition parties in respect of their spokespersons receiving briefings and analysis from the Department of Finance in due course.  It is hoped that this will be provided soon.</P>
        <P>I welcome the fact that Fine Gael and the Labour Party seem to agree that there is a need to achieve the 3% deficit target by 2014.  That is helpful.  An issue then arises with regard to the four-year plan that is being devised.  The Government obviously has a responsibility to bring forward such a plan.  No one claims to have a monopoly on wisdom and if people wish to suggest constructive approaches that might be taken or if they wish to offer their views, these would be welcomed.  The country faces an extremely challenging period but I am of the view that we will come through this if we deal with the matter in a rational, calm and intelligent way.</P>
        <P>I have always stated that the Opposition can take on board the briefings and analysis that will be provided and that we could then examine whether people share similar views on the facts as they stand.  The detailed policy response to those facts may differ from party to party.  However, it is important that we should all at least be given the facts relating to the nature of the fiscal challenge we face. Those are issues that will emerge in due course as the data is evaluated and as decisions and judgments are reached in respect of it.  In that context, it would be helpful if the three main parties &mdash; I understand Sinn F&eacute;in has a different point of view &mdash; could confirm that this is their broad position.</P>
        <P>Regardless of the situation relating to the banks, there is an issue to be resolved in respect of the gap that exists between what we spend and the amount of money accruing to the Exchequer.  It would not be correct to state that the issue relating to the banks is the source of all our problems but it does contribute to those problems in the context of the increased national debt to which it gives rise.  The fact remains that there is an issue on the fiscal front which must be resolved.  I look forward to people taking an open and constructive approach in respect of that issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>There have been many days on which and many issues in respect of which the House has been divided.  Perhaps it is time for a statement of agreement on an issue that affects every person in this country.  I am not going to do down any proposal which might have an impact with regard to dealing with the problems we face in economic and fiscal terms.  Those problems have a direct impact, in various ways, on the quality of life of many people.</P>
        <P>Deputy Noonan is happy to accept the invitation from the Department of Finance.  He will discuss with officials from the Department the advice or information they wish to provide when he meets them tomorrow.  When meetings of this type took place in the past &mdash; particularly as parties approached the possibility of an election being called at some time in the future &mdash; the information provided to the Opposition was not subject to any ministerial direction.  Will it be the case that the information to be provided to Deputy Noonan and, I presume, Deputy Burton and others, will not be subject to any such direction from the Minister for Finance and that it will constitute the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach quite rightly made the point that when the relevant information is received by the Opposition parties, they will be entitled to assess and analyse it and indicate what might be the shape of the budgets they would put forward based on the facts provided.  When he stated that the parties could meet when the information is received and assessed, was the Taoiseach indicating that he supports the concept of engaging in a discussion on the possibility of consensus?  I want to be constructive but there would be no point in my participating in the process if the Taoiseach does not do so.  I am seeking a straight answer in this regard.</P><Col N="31"/>
        <P>We will act constructively in conjunction with the Government.  We will also act constructively in the interests of the people and the country.  It was for this reason that I stated that we agree with the 3% deficit target, with the realisation of this by 2014, with the fact that there must be front-loading and with the Government&rsquo;s invitation that we should be briefed by the Department of Finance.  We will assess the information that will be made available.  Thereafter, I wish to be as constructive as possible in the interests of the people.  Is it the Taoiseach&rsquo;s view that the leaders of the parties could participate in a series of discussions regarding the possibility of achieving consensus?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Any briefings will be provided by designated officials from the Department of Finance.  There is no question of directions or anything else being given in respect of the advice that will be provided.  The facts of the matter, as they are emerging, can be conveyed.  The Deputy stated that Deputy Noonan will be meeting some officials tomorrow in order to discuss the means by which the relevant information can be provided to him.  I understand that others visited the Department earlier in the week.  The Department is evaluating the position at present and it is obvious that all its work will not be completed by the time the briefings are to be given.  However, such briefings will &mdash; perhaps later this week or early next week &mdash; be provided to spokespersons on that basis.</P>
        <P>I wish to return to the Deputy&rsquo;s point on our involvement, as a Government.  I made it clear on Friday last &mdash; there is a full transcript available in respect of what I said &mdash; that if, arising out of the briefings and analysis that will be provided, any proposals emerge from the Opposition which could be subsequently developed upon by means of a meeting at leadership level, I would have no difficulty in this regard.  That goes without saying, as far as I am concerned.  We all recognise the areas in respect of which we want to work constructively and we all agree that there is a framework &mdash; namely, reducing the deficit to 3% by 2014 &mdash; within which we are obliged to operate.  The provision of briefings and analysis would ensure that everyone would be armed with the same facts that are available to the Government.  When those facts have been provided, people will be in a position to make decisions and choices in respect of how they would resolve the problems that exist.  It would then be a matter for those concerned, in the context of a debate or whatever, to put forward their views.  All of that to which I refer would be helpful.</P>
        <P>I want to work constructively with all of those who are minded to bring forward proposals that would result in the best possible plan being devised.  One of the issues which must be considered in this context is the need to reduce the deficit to 3%.  The Government has not made any decisions on this matter as yet.  However, we must consider how we can reach our target while at the same time optimising the prospect of having a growth strategy for the economy and ensuring that the required adjustment will be achieved in the best possible way.  Those are issues which continue to be considered in the context of the data that is being analysed.  I do not have a specific view on the matter at present.  However, the issues to which I refer are those we are requesting be examined in order that we might arrive at the best possible approach.  Such an approach must be consistent with retaining as many existing jobs as possible, creating new jobs and providing growth in the economy.  It is obvious that it will also be necessary to address various expenditure and taxation issues in order to make the adjustment required by 2014.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to pursue the Taoiseach in respect of a number of the responses he provided to Deputy Kenny.  The letter which Deputies Kenny and &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in and I received from a Minister in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s Government refers to a three-stage process.  One of these is agreement on the 3% target, with which the Labour Party concurred when the Government reached agreement on it with the European Commission.  The second takes in the <Col N="32"/>briefings being provided for all parties by the Department of Finance.  This is something the Labour Party has been seeking since April and I am glad the process has started; Deputy Burton has already had her first briefing in the Department of Finance in these matters and we are happy to engage in that process.</P>
        <P>I am a little confused about the third part of the issue.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, has said the purpose of these meetings is to seek a political consensus on the budget and the four-year budgetary plan.  Is that the Government&rsquo;s intention?  My understanding of going into a process of consensus is that all parties must agree and all parties may exercise a veto.  Is that the process the Government is entering?  There is a suggestion of meetings with party leaders and finance spokespersons but I want to be clear on the Government&rsquo;s proposal.</P>
        <P>Will we have meetings to reach a consensus on the budget and the four-year budgetary plan?  We have had some experience on the island with consensus-making processes.  Is it the case that nothing is agreed until everything is agreed and nothing is agreed until all the parties agree?  Is that the process we are entering?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>To answer the Deputy directly, the position in that regard is as follows.  We made the point that on the basis of the briefings and analysis provided by the Department, if we can agree that this is the pitch upon which we are playing and those facts are the same for everybody, I have no objection to a meeting being held to confirm this is the position and to consider if it is possible for us to have talks beyond that which would meet with an outcome approved by everybody.  That is fine at one level. I am also aware of the Deputy&rsquo;s stated public positions on these fronts.  There have been policy choices from him even as late as yesterday suggesting that there should be no tax change or alteration to welfare etc.  There were a number of issues, and it would be very difficult from my perspective to know how to make an adjustment without having all these matters on the table.  However, I will not pre-empt the issue.</P>
        <P>I stated last Friday that we must take the matter step by step.  The stage we are at is the provision to the Opposition of an agreed process &mdash; which is under discussion &mdash; for the purpose of having analysis and briefings from designated officials in the Department.  The purpose of this is to arm all people with the same facts.  On that basis, if a meeting were to held to confirm that we are all agreed on that position, it would be fine if anything further could derive from it that would garner agreement from everyone.</P>
        <P>I am prepared to take the process in a step-by-step way and I am not tying the Deputy into a process about which he may have reservations or tying myself into a process suggesting that we end up in an arrangement where bits of everyone&rsquo;s proposal would be considered.  That would not meet the requirements of the issue.  As the Deputy knows, the Government has a responsibility to discharge, which is to bring forward a four-year plan, as other Governments in the European Union are being asked to do.</P>
        <P>We are trying to discern the areas upon which we can agree and whether these are at the macro-economic or micro-economic level.  It is all the better if they are policies to help us reach the outcome we all want.  That remains to be seen, as the Deputy&rsquo;s party will need to see and assess the analysis and briefings before giving its view.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not what the Minister, Deputy Gormley, has proposed.  What the Taoiseach has just outlined now is an entirely different process, whereby we would have a meeting to run a ruler over the information with which we have been provided from the Department of Finance and understand that we all have the same information.  That is an information-sharing exercise.  I will ignore the Taoiseach&rsquo;s temptation to resort to partisanship <Col N="33"/>but the second part of his reply noted that the Government has a duty to discharge even if we cannot reach agreement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Could we have a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, it is about consensus.  The proposal from the Minister, Deputy Gormley, is that there be a process leading to consensus.  The Taoiseach is not confirming that but is saying we will have a meeting to share information, with the Government going off to make its decisions.  I have not yet heard the Taoiseach say it is the Government&rsquo;s intention to engage in a process with the Opposition parties which is aimed at reaching a consensus on the budget.  That process leading to consensus involves committing to reach agreement with the other parties, with all-party agreement the result.  I have not yet heard that from the head of the Government.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>What the Deputy heard the head of the Government say was that there first would be a meeting to confirm that we share a common analysis because we would be therefore much more likely to have some prospect of a common conclusion.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg"><NameTxt>Deputy Emmet Stagg</NameTxt>
	<P>That hardly needs agreement.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I went on to say in my reply that we could assess what further meetings would be helpful if that is the case.  I was not committing the Deputy to the process unless there is a basic common understanding of what is required to resolve the problem.  I am not getting involved in any partisan comment but I was referring to the Deputy&rsquo;s interview in the <i>Evening Herald</i>, which I presume accurately reflects the Deputy&rsquo;s views.  He has not suggested otherwise.  There is nothing partisan about it.  It would be great if everybody could agree on the four-year framework, including expenditure levels, taxation issues and growth figures.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We should leave this as Leaders&rsquo; Questions for the moment so there might be some semblance of coherence.  If the process I outlined could be achieved, it would be excellent.  I am taking this on a step-by-step basis and we are making the analysis and briefings available to Opposition parties.  If there is agreement on a common analysis with the same facts, further meetings would be helpful to see if we can come to further agreement and I would of course favour that.  I will not pre-empt Deputies&rsquo; briefings and analysis before they decide on how to act.  We are open to a constructive approach from all sides if possible.</P>

	<P>When will the landlord and tenant Bill be published?  Will the Government consider the issue of upward-only rent reviews and in particular, legacy agreements on existing leases?  In the summer, Colm McCarthy, commenting on a report he produced for Retail Excellence Ireland, said recent policy actions by the Government have been unsuccessfully challenged in the courts on the grounds that they infringed constitutional property rights.  On that basis, he argued it may be worth reviewing the Government&rsquo;s position on legacy leases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I would like to raise two issues.  First, we heard in the news today there will be more savage cuts at Cavan hospital, depriving people of essential services.  This is an inevitable consequence of the closure of surgery at Navan which was not recommended by the Royal College of Surgeons.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, we are on the Order of Business.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>Some 1,800 cases of elective surgery have been cancelled which has caused horrendous problems for the whole system.  When will No. 59, the Eligibility for Health and Personal Social Services Bill, be published?  Will it have any meaning if people will be deprived of services at the whim of the HSE which is clearly out of control?</P>
        <P>The second issue I wish to raise with the Taoiseach is the Licensing of Health Facilities Bill, No. 63, which will provide for a mandatory system of licensing for public and private healthcare facilities.  There are currently private facilities in the country which are not subject to any sort of standard and we have had major problems with some of them.  In the meantime, we are closing our public accredited facilities.</P>
      </Speaker>

      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>In the programme for Government there was a commitment to introduce a Bill on climate change and we were promised it would be published before the global conference last year on climate change.  Now, 12 months later, the Bill has still not appeared.  I am sure if the Taoiseach is honest he would agree that most people consider it more important than getting a fifth mayor for Dublin.  As far as I can see, such a Bill is still in the twilight zone of list C.  Is there any prospect of bringing it forward?  When will a Bill be published?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">A framework for the Bill was published last year before the Copenhagen summit and on the basis of that framework the general scheme of the Bill is currently being drafted.  I understand it is currently at a progressed stage and it will come to the Government in due course.  Work is also under way on developing a national policy on climate change adaptation with a view to having a framework for that prepared.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>In the context thereof, the Chair will see that he is being helped.  Perhaps the Taoiseach might consider introducing the legal costs Bill at an earlier stage than was anticipated, given that some &euro;500 million in legal costs arising from the tribunal is coming down the tracks and that there are other costs, such as the Lord Mayor proposals that will cost the Exchequer a lot of money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

A top expert in this area, Dr. Hardiman, was on the radio recently talking about the need for an open debate on very complex and difficult issues which arise in regard to this area.  On that basis, there is a great deal of complexity and many issues have to be looked at before a commitment can be made to legislation on any particular point of view on the issue.

	<P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
          <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>I am very pleased to bring the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill 2010 before the House.  The purpose of the Bill is to make limited amendments to the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006.  The 2006 Act was a significant milestone in establishing a new statutory regime governing the way the criminal law deals with mentally ill persons who may have committed criminal acts.  The Bill before us provides for amendments in relation to two aspects of the 2006 Act.  The provisions concerned are section 4 of the Act which deals with the cases of persons who, because of mental disorder, may be considered by a court to be unfit to be tried on criminal charges, and section 13 which provides for review of detention by the Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board.  The review board was established by the 2006 Act as a new independent body to review the detention of persons detained in accordance with the Act.  Section 13 provides that the review board should carry out regular reviews of persons who have been found to be unfit to be tried or not guilty by reason of insanity and are detained by order of a court in a designated centre.  The only designated centre at present is the Central Mental Hospital.  The review board has the power to discharge persons from detention conditionally or unconditionally in certain circumstances.  In this regard, it must hear evidence relating to the mental condition of the person concerned from the consultant psychiatrist responsible for the person&rsquo;s care or treatment.  It also must take into account the welfare and safety of that person and the public interest.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P>The main amendment to the 2006 Act concerns section 13.  It arises from the fact that the review board, since its establishment, has been reluctant to order the discharge of patients who might be considered suitable for discharge subject to conditions because it has no statutory power effectively to enforce such conditions.  This has resulted in difficulties, not only for the patients concerned, but also for the Central Mental Hospital, whose limited capacity is being used up by the retention of patients who might otherwise be considered for conditional discharge under the Act.  The view of the review board is that it should be possible under the Act to provide for enforceable conditions to be applied to conditional discharge to facilitate the effective use of such discharge.</P>
        <P>The 2006 Act envisaged a relatively black and white situation where a person either required in-patient treatment or the person was completely cured.  The Minister for Justice and Law Reform accepts that there is a category of patient who is suitable to live outside a designated centre but where, at least initially, safety and health considerations require an ability to return that person for in-patient treatment in a designated centre if there is any material breach of the conditional discharge order.  Accordingly, this Bill makes provision for supervisory powers to cover cases where a patient is considered safe to discharge, provided he or she complies with certain conditions, and provided that such compliance can be supervised, and if necessary, enforced.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I might also mention the 2008 High Court judgment in the case of B <i>v</i> . Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board and Others. In that case, proceedings were taken by a person who was denied conditional discharge by the review board because it was of the view that it should discharge the person only if it had the power to impose enforceable conditions.  The <Col N="42"/>High Court agreed that the 2006 Act did not provide for enforceable conditions but held that the review board acted lawfully in refusing to discharge the patient.  The case is currently under appeal to the Supreme Court.  A certain urgency attaches to the proposed amendment because of the pending Supreme Court appeal, because a number of persons who might otherwise be considered for conditional discharge are not being so considered and because the Central Mental Hospital must keep them even if they are suitable for conditional discharge and even though it is under pressure for bed space.  The opportunity is also being taken to amend section 4 of the 2006 Act which at present allows a court to commit a person who may be unfit to be tried on a criminal charge to the Central Mental Hospital for an initial period of up to 14 days for the purposes of psychiatric examination.  On the basis of such an examination, the court can decide that a person who is unfit to be tried should be committed to a designated centre for inpatient or outpatient treatment.  The main purpose of the amendment is to ensure the present arrangements are fully compliant with Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which has been given further effect in our law since 31 December 2003 in accordance with the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003.  To guarantee such compliance, it is necessary to provide that a committal for examination can be made by a court only after hearing evidence from a consultant psychiatrist.  Some additional improvements are also being made to section 4 which I will explain as I go through the detail of the Bill.</P>
        <P>I will now outline the main provisions of the Bill.  Sections 1, 2 and 5 are technical drafting sections.  Section 3 amends section 3 of the 2006 Act.  The amendment will allow the Minister for Health and Children to designate psychiatric centres other than the Central Mental Hospital for the examination of persons referred by the District Court under section 4 of the 2006 Act in cases where a question of an accused person&rsquo;s fitness to be tried arises.  The provision is limited to referrals from the District Court so that only persons charged with less serious offences could be examined in such centres.  It will allow the Minister for Health and Children to provide for persons charged with minor offences to be examined in community hospitals, which is in keeping with Government policy as set out in A Vision for Change.  It will also help to prevent unnecessary referrals to the Central Mental Hospital of persons who could be dealt with in other psychiatric centres.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 4 amends section 4 of the 2006 Act.  As I mentioned earlier, section 4 is concerned with the procedures for dealing with a person who may have a mental disorder and thus be legally unfit to be tried on a criminal charge.  In the absence of any prior medical evidence on the issue, a court may commit the person for a period of not more than 14 days to a designated centre for psychiatric examination.  This is so the court can decide on foot of that examination whether the mental disorder, if it is present, renders the person unable to understand the nature or course of the proceedings on one or other of the several grounds set out in the Act.  This initial referral may be made by the court at present without recourse to medical advice.  It is now proposed in section 4 of the Bill, in the light of detailed consideration of obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights in this area, and the advice of the Attorney General, to provide that a court shall consider the evidence of an approved medical officer as to the person&rsquo;s mental condition before it decides to make an order to commit a person for examination at a designated centre.  At present, the psychiatric examination has to take place on an inpatient basis.  However, in the amendment proposed to be made by section 4 of the Bill, the court will be able to order that the examination should be done on an inpatient or outpatient basis.</P><Col N="43"/>
        <P>In providing for this amendment to section 4, the opportunity is also being taken to provide that the court may take account of the evidence of an approved medical officer to assist in determining the issue of fitness to be tried and to facilitate an adjournment to allow the person to receive appropriate medical treatment.  The latter should help to prevent unnecessary referrals to the Central Mental Hospital and give statutory recognition to informal diversion arrangements, which, I understand, operate quite successfully at present at Cloverhill District Court.</P>
        <P>Turning to the provisions relating to conditional discharge, the first amendment relevant to this issue occurs in section 6 of the Bill.  Section 6 amends section 11 of the 2006 Act to provide that the criteria to which the Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board must have regard in reviewing detention will also apply to reviews of the conditions of a person&rsquo;s conditional discharge and to applications for unconditional discharge from persons who have been conditionally discharged.  The criteria are the welfare and safety of the person concerned and the public interest.  Sections 7 and 8 of the Bill amend the 2006 Act to provide for enforceable conditions to attach to an order by the Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board for conditional discharge.</P>
        <P>Provision is made for a comprehensive system on the imposition of conditions, arrangements for supervision of the conditionally discharged person, provisions to facilitate variation of conditions, provision for the conditionally discharged person to be considered for unconditional discharge and arrangements for the return of the person to the Central Mental Hospital where there is material breach of the conditional discharge.  Most important, of course, provision is also made for the review by the Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board of the detention of a person returned to the Central Mental Hospital under these provisions.  Section 7 amends section 13 of the 2006 Act to provide that the Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board can conditionally discharge patients under the new section 13A.  Section 8 inserts three new sections, sections 13A, 13B and 13C, into the 2006 Act.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 13A creates a new scheme of conditional discharge.  Subsection (1) provides that the Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board may make an order for the discharge of a patient subject to conditions, including conditions relating to outpatient treatment or supervision, or both.  Subsection (2) provides that the review board may only make a conditional discharge order where the arrangements in relation to the discharge considered necessary by the clinical director of the designated centre have been made.  These include arrangements for facilitating compliance by the person with the conditions, the supervision of the person and providing for the person&rsquo;s return under section 13B if he or she fails to abide by the conditions.  Subsection (3) provides that the conditions must be communicated in writing to the person.  The effect of the order and consequences of non-compliance with the conditions must be explained to the person.  Subsection (4) requires the person to comply with the conditional discharge order.  Subsection (5) requires a copy of the order to be sent to the Minister for Justice and Law Reform and the clinical director of the designated centre.  Subsection (6) provides that the review board may vary or remove one or more of the conditions of the conditional discharge order, or impose further conditions, on application by the person concerned or by the clinical director.  Subsection (7) requires notice of an application under subsection (6) to be given to the person concerned and the clinical director &mdash; where the application is not being made by the clinical director.  Subsection (8) provides that the person concerned may apply to the review board for unconditional discharge after 12 months from the date of conditional discharge.  The person may make subsequent applications if necessary, so long as a period of at least 12 months <Col N="44"/>elapses between applications.  Subsection (9) sets out the procedure for dealing with an application for unconditional discharge.</P>
        <P>Section 13B sets out the procedures that apply where a person is in material breach of a conditional discharge order.  Subsection (1) provides that a person who is in material breach of a conditional discharge order will be deemed to be unlawfully at large.  Subsection (2) provides that a person is in material breach of his or her conditional discharge order where the clinical director of the designated centre, on reasonable grounds, believes, first, that the person is in breach of one or more conditions of his or her conditional discharge and, second, that there is a serious likelihood of the person causing serious harm to himself or herself or others or that the person may be in need of inpatient care or treatment.  Subsection (3) requires the clinical director to inform a person believed to be in material breach of a conditional discharge order in writing of that fact and the reasons for such belief.  Subsection (4) provides that subsection (3) does not apply where the material breach is such as to give reasonable cause for the clinical director to believe that there is a serious likelihood of the person causing immediate and serious harm to himself or herself or others.  Subsection (5) provides that the clinical director may make arrangements to effect the person&rsquo;s return to the designated centre, including requesting assistance from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Subsection (6) provides for Garda powers of entry and arrest for the purposes of section 13B.  Subsection (7) provides that a returned person must be given reasons in writing for his or her return.  The provisions of the Act of 2006 will once more apply to the returned person as they did when the person was originally committed to the designated centre under the Act of 2006 or the relevant provisions of the Defence Act 1954.  Subsection (8) provides that the clinical director must inform the review board of the return of the person and the review board must review the detention of the person as soon as may be.  Subsection (9) provides a definition of the term &ldquo;authorised person&rdquo;, which is relevant to the provision made by the new section 13C for externally-provided assisted returns.</P>
        <P>Section 13C is a technical provision to ensure that staff of private agencies hired to effect the return of patients to the designated centre can be considered authorised persons for the purpose of section 13B.  This provision mirrors an amendment made to the Mental Health Act 2001 to take account of legal difficulties in the operation of return procedures.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Section 9 corrects a drafting error in Schedule 2 to the 2006 Act.  Section 10 provides for consequential amendments to the Defence Act 1954.  Section 11 provides for the Short Title of the Act and its commencement.</P>
        <P>This is a relatively short Bill.  Its provisions are limited and are intended to ensure that the difficulties which I have mentioned can be corrected as quickly as possible.  It is not in any way a Bill which represents a full review of the operation of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006.  The Minister for Justice and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is planning to have a comprehensive review of the 2006 Act commence in his Department subsequent to the enactment of this Bill.  Wider issues relating to the Act can be examined in the context of that review.  However, this Bill needs to be enacted as soon as possible to correct the difficulties that I have mentioned.  Accordingly, it is of necessity confined in its amendments to ensure that it can be considered as quickly as possible by the Oireachtas.  I very much look forward to hearing the views of all Members of the House.</P>
        <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>First, I welcome the fact that this Bill is before the House.  Clearly, the 2006 Act contained serious defects and has not worked in the manner anticipated, particularly <Col N="45"/>with regard to those who have been sent to the Central Mental Hospital in Dublin and whose situation is such that there is view that they are persons appropriate to be released but that they should be subject to conditions, both in the interests of their own safety and welfare and that of the general public.  It has proved impossible to use these provisions because the original Act was defective in so far as the Minister of State correctly states it did not contain within it any provisions as to how one addresses a situation where someone was conditionally released and then did not comply with the conditions.</P>
        <P>It is also welcome &mdash; I understand it is a requirement of our obligation as pursuant to the European Convention on Human Rights &mdash; that there is provision included in the Bill to allow the courts, prior to having someone formally assessed as to his or her capacity to stand trial, to hear psychiatric evidence initially as to the person&rsquo;s condition.</P>
        <P>There is a number of things I want to say about this Bill which gives us some insight into a number of matters but before I do, I want to say something of some importance.  This is a criminal law Bill and while it deals with a discrete area, it is of relevance to the area of criminal law generally.  As we are having a debate on a law reforming measure in the area of criminal law which envisages the Garda having to take action in circumstances if difficulties arose after someone was released, I want to say, as Fine Gael justice spokesperson &mdash; I believe it is appropriate that I do so &mdash; that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na should be congratulated on the active and important role it has played &mdash; as it always does &mdash; in recent weeks in addressing the worrying re-emergence on our island of a small group of paramilitaries who wish to disrupt life, injure and possibly kill individuals and who have no respect for the wish of the Irish people, North and South, that we live in peace and that the arrangements agreed pursuant to the Good Friday Agreement be respected.  The Garda is to be congratulated on arms finds that have taken place in recent days and on its active investigations and the results of those, on which I do not wish to comment for fear such comment could prejudice any prosecutions that might take place.</P>
        <P>It is appropriate in this House, as the democratic Parliament of this State, that all of us clearly and unitedly stand behind the Garda in the work it is doing, in co-operation with the PSNI, to tackle the scourge of paramilitarism, which seeks to undermine the huge progress we have made in the past ten years on this island.  It needs to be said that no matter who is in government, paramilitary activity will not be tolerated; the Garda will be fully supported in the work it is doing and there will be the fullest co-operation on the part of any Irish Government that is in place, including a government of which my party is part, with the Northern Ireland authorities in bringing violence to an end.  It was something we thought had ended.  It is a considerable concern and regret that a small group of people are again trying to engage in such activities.</P>
        <P>The Bill is an important illustration of something that Ministers who have been in government for 13 and a half years constantly deny and fail to take account of.  This Parliament is particularly unusual in the manner in which it has operated since the 2007 election in my experience of being a Member of the D&aacute;il up to 2002.  Three and a half years have passed since this D&aacute;il was elected.  During my period as a Member of this House from 1981 to 2002, prior to my involuntary exit from it as a consequence of that general election, it was my experience that when Opposition Deputies brought forward Private Members&rsquo; Bills to address areas of law that Government did not have the time to give priority to or lacked the in-house expertise to address, those Bills were treated with some respect and seriousness.</P>
        <P>In my case, a number of such Bills were supported by the Government and adopted and passed in this House, while in the case of others, of which the Government might have been sceptical and voted down, it often adopted and brought before the House a similar Bill within <Col N="46"/>12 to 18 months.  There has not been a single Private Members&rsquo; Bill brought before this House since this D&aacute;il was elected that the Government has supported to the extent of allowing it ultimately to pass into law.  It has used its majority in this House to stamp out every constructive legislative proposal that has been brought forward and, on occasions, where stamping it out on Second Stage would generate particularly bad publicity, it has not voted it down but sent it into limbo by allowing it pass Second Stage and disappear down a black hole whereby Fianna F&aacute;il controlled committees do not allow it to be processed.</P>
        <P>The reason I have raised this point in the context of this Bill, and this point is directly relevant to it, is that the constant excuse that has been made for voting down legislation produced from this side of the House during the past three years is that the font of all wisdom in the drafting of legislation lies within Departments and, more particularly, within the specialised and elevated Office of the Attorney General.  Departments and the Attorney General&rsquo;s office are portrayed constantly as the only groups competent to bring legislation before the House.  When Private Members&rsquo; Bills are brought before the House in the justice or other areas, the Government will always hone in on some technical inadequacy in the Bill and make a meal out of it on the basis that the Bill is terribly flawed and could not possibly be allowed pass Second Stage.  On occasions, unthinking journalists who do not understand the legislative process report these sorts of comments as if they were on tablets of stone handed down by Moses having climbed down the mountain.  Often they forget, as do Ministers, that the legislation they produce on Second Stage is imperfect.  It need not always be perfect because we are supposed to go through a legislative process &mdash; this is a legislative Assembly &mdash; and legislation is amended on Committee Stage or Report Stage by amendments tabled by Government or by amendments tabled by the Opposition that more often the Government rejects but then republishes on Report Stage.</P>
        <P>That point is relevant to this Bill because this legislation is only before us because the 2006 Act was defective.  It was an Act published by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, taken through this House by the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, who I recollect the media at the time thought was the font of all wisdom, and, presumably, drafted within the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  The truth is that the original Bill passed in 2006 has not worked in the manner anticipated because it has two substantial defects in it.  It is time it was realised that this House should be allowed to legislate and Members on the side of the House, and backbenchers in the Government parties, should be respected as legislators and allowed to publish legislation which should have the possibility of being enacted without impacting on the pride of individual Ministers or their personal perspective of themselves as terribly important persons whose reputation might be damaged if they allowed anyone other than themselves to pass legislation in their area.  The truth is that if they did so their reputation would be enhanced.</P>
        <P>The original Bill is defective.  I welcome the fact that some of the defects are being addressed in this Bill but I want to raise certain issues, on one of which at least I know the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, would agree with me.  I do not mean any disrespect to him but he has limited influence because he is a Minister of State and, as such, is not a member of the Cabinet.  As someone who, as a constituency Deputy and lawyer, has worked over the years with individuals and dealt with their personal circumstances &mdash; individuals who are clearly under substantial mental strain and suffer from mental illness or mental disorder &mdash; there is an importance in all reforming legislation introduced in this House that we use appropriate terminology.  I do not believe it was appropriate in 2006 to pass legislation with the word &ldquo;Insanity&rdquo; in the Title.  It is <Col N="47"/>not appropriate that in 2010 we publish legislation entitled the &ldquo;Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill.  This Bill is about individuals who suffer mental illness or mental disorder.  We have other legislation called the Mental Health Act.  Why are we reverting to a form of language in the criminal law area that has been outdated for two decades but was apparently regarded as acceptable in 2006?  We still have legislation on our Statute Book which refers to people as &ldquo;lunatics&rdquo;.  We have rules of the superior courts which refer to people as &ldquo;lunatics&rdquo;; people are made wards of courts because &ldquo;they are lunatics&rdquo;.  That is 18th century wording.  As we moved through the 20th century the word &ldquo;lunatic&rdquo; was ultimately replaced by the word &ldquo;insanity&rdquo; and now that we have greater insight into these areas, we refer to people&rsquo;s mental health.  Although the Bill amends an Act which uses the word &ldquo;insanity&rdquo;, there is no reason the Title should not read, &ldquo;Criminal Law (Mental Health) Bill&rdquo;.  I genuinely do not understand the reason this is not the case as it could still amend the previous Act of 2006.  I do not understand why we have to use this sort of pejorative language for something that is fully recognised as a sickness.</P>
        <P>The only hospital to which the legislation is relevant is the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum, which is in my constituency.  There are a number of individuals within that facility who, having been there for many years, would be well able to exist outside and in the community but who cannot be simply unconditionally released.  They will require substantial supports and a degree of supervision when they are released and for some of them, there also will be a period of time when they will have to adapt to living within the community.</P>
        <P>It is a great shame that the original Act was defective and did not work.  I welcome the fact that this legislation is now before the House and we can progress it.  I am conscious that, in making decisions to release individuals from the Central Mental Hospital, very careful judgment is required both in the interests of the individuals concerned and the greater interests of the community.  There will be occasions when conditions are not complied with and individuals will be required to be returned to the Central Mental Hospital.  The hospital is currently the only facility available, although I am aware that in the context of the Bill, as drafted, there is a possibility in certain circumstances that some other facility may be utilised under its provisions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I draw to the Minister of State&rsquo;s attention my concern about section 13C.  The Bill envisages that if conditions are not complied with, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may become involved and return someone to the hospital.  As the Minister of State noted, section 13C &ldquo;is a technical provision to ensure that staff of private agencies hired to effect the return of patients to the designated centre can be considered authorised persons for the purpose of section 13B.&rdquo;  In this case, the designated centre could only be the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum.  The section allows the designated centre to authorise persons other than members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to return someone to the Central Mental Hospital or to other designated centres in the event that other such centres emerge.  There must be a possibility under this legislation that there will be privately funded designated centres which are paid a sum of money to care for someone sent to them as a consequence of the outcome of a court case.</P>
        <P>In so far as I can see, there is nothing stated in the Bill about the qualifications or training of the persons who may be recruited under section 13C.  Garda&iacute; would be given a certain amount of training on how to deal with mentally ill people.  If this sort of function is to be farmed out to some other body, what training will these individuals receive?  At present, we have a problem in some areas of this city surrounding the manner in which so-called private security firms are conducting themselves.  Will we find a couple of fellows, who were formerly engaged in criminal gangs or paramilitary activities and work as bouncers outside some night<Col N="48"/>club or pub, being recruited to collect from a local community some mentally ill individual who has been conditionally released and is failing to comply with conditions?  In what tragedy might that result?  I ask the Minister of State to clarify how he sees this provision working.  What controls will be in place?  What training will such individuals require?  In what circumstances will it be deemed appropriate that an outside agency that employs individuals should be utilised to return a mentally ill individual to the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum instead of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  This is a serious issue which needs to be clarified.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister of State clarify what is the position of the Central Mental Hospital and what is its future?  We all know it is a very old building which is no longer truly fit for purpose.  When the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr. Michael McDowell, spent unnecessary millions of taxpayers&rsquo; money to buy a piece of farmland on which Thornton Hall was to be constructed, the original plan was that the site of the Central Mental Hospital would be closed, the Government would make an enormous sum of money from, I presume, selling it off for housing or apartment development and the hospital would be inappropriately located in Thornton Hall, right beside the new prison.  That was a bad idea from day one and has since been dropped.  We are now back at the starting point with an outdated, inappropriate facility still being utilised without &mdash; the Minister of State will correct me if I am wrong &mdash; any definitive decision having been made as to where we go from here.  While I am aware that one or two ideas have been floated, I am unaware of any definitive decision that has been made.  What is the position?  Clearly, there will not be a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow for selling the site in question in the short or medium term based on the collapse of property values and the housing market.  For how long can we go on without replacing the current facility with something more appropriate?</P>
        <P>While I am conscious that there is not significant public interest in what happens to people in the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum, Ireland has certain international obligations in this area.  We must recognise mental illness and its impact on individuals.  They have some degree of human rights and are entitled to a certain amount of dignity.  Irrespective of how good is the work of the staff in the hospital, the current facility will never be adequate to meet the real needs or what is required to be in place in the 21st century to address the type of individual problems from which those who have been sent to the Central Mental Hospital suffer.</P>
        <P>I do not propose to speak at length on the Bill.  While I welcome the legislation in principle, there are one or two issues which need to be tidied up on Committee Stage.  I hope there is some insight into the fallibility of the Office of the Attorney General and Department of Justice and Law Reform.  If Members on this side propose amendments of a technical or substantive nature I hope they will be treated seriously and taken on board and that they will not be simply rejected because they emanate from the Opposition.</P>
        <P>I ask the Minister of State to address another issue.  The Law Reform Commission, in a report published in 2006, recommended the replacement of the wardship system with a comprehensive structure with regard to individuals who are currently designated as &ldquo;lunatics&rdquo; and whose property is managed for them.  We should properly update our laws in these areas.  I ask the Minister of State to comment on this matter.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State indicated that a review is taking place of the original 2006 Act.  Parts of the legislation have not worked properly, although I accept that other aspects of it are working.  Perhaps the Minister of State will give us some insight into what issues are being <Col N="49"/>considered in the review and how they might impact on the current workings of the criminal law.</P>
        <P>Two issues arise in this area.  The first issue of major importance is to ensure that those who are mentally unwell and who commit crimes, be they serious or minor, are not simply left at large to continue disrupting local communities.  Some of those who are in the Central Mental Hospital at present have been involved in events that have resulted in people&rsquo;s deaths, some in horrendous circumstances.  Consequently, there is a need to ensure that the public is properly protected.  However, there also is a need to ensure that those who are mentally ill are dealt with in a manner that reflects the value system that we should hold in the 21st century, in that they should be neither kept in facilities that were more appropriate 200 years ago nor neglected when they are conditionally released into the community.  That is the final point.</P>
        <P>As Members are aware, the HSE has huge difficulties in the manner in which it functions and in its capacity to deal with those who suffer mental illness.  The Minister of State might outline to Members the exact nature of the support and backup facilities that will be available to those who are conditionally released under the Bill to ensure they comply with those conditions both in their own personal interest and in the interest of protecting the wider community.  It is of the greatest importance that if people are to be conditionally released from the Central Mental Hospital, the wider community has no reason to fear any consequences detrimental to it as a result of such release and has confidence in whatever State backup and supervisory services are to operate so as to ensure the community remains protected and that an individual who is conditionally released does not pose any real threat to anyone else within the wider community.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch"><NameTxt>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
	<P>I will not take anything near to my allotment of 30 minutes.  As Deputy Shatter has already made many of the points I intend to make, I hope Members will not be put off by repetition.  While this is a fairly short Bill, it nevertheless is a highly significant one.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I welcome the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill 2010.  The Bill represents a step forward in respect of the relationship between criminal law and mental health.  While it does not constitute a full review of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006, I welcome the Minister for Justice and Law Reform&rsquo;s plans to conduct a full review of that Act once this Bill has been enacted.</P>
        <P>As a State, Ireland has a poor record in caring for its citizens who suffer from mental illness.  The State branded these people as lunatics and adopted an &ldquo;out of sight, out of mind&rdquo; approach to care for the mentally ill.  All Members are familiar with the asylums, those imposing grey buildings dotted around the country, which were used to house those with mental illness.  Incarcerating people in such environments often served to further compound their illnesses.  The issue of rights was considered irrelevant because the State&rsquo;s intervention was regarded as benign and as in the best interests of the person.  Mental health services have come a fair distance since then but there is still much work to be done.  We are moving towards a more rights-based approach to the provision of services for mental health and this is to be welcomed.  The improvements in the criminal law system regarding mental health comprise an important part of this work.</P>
        <P>I will make a few more general points before talking more particularly about the Bill and the amendments being proposed by the Labour Party.  There remains a stigma on the issue of mental health.  While many people regard it as a taboo subject and something which is difficult to talk about, at the same time we all probably know someone who has suffered or continues to suffer from a mental illness.  As a society we must confront the silence that surrounds the <Col N="50"/>issue and must begin to recognise that many mental illnesses can be successfully treated.  I compliment the Minister of State in this regard.  It often is extremely difficult to admit that one ever had a difficulty but it is only through people in public life so doing that movement will be seen.</P>
        <P>At a general level, there always has been an uneasy relationship between the criminal justice system and the area of medical, psychiatric and psychological sciences.  The criminal law is particularly relevant because there has been a relatively frequent occurrence of cases in which crimes have been committed by persons with mental disorders, often by reason of such mental disorders.  As a consequence, they may not have been able to establish intent for a crime or they may not, in certain circumstances, have had the capacity to understand the criminal justice process.  There have been great difficulties in accommodating recognition of persons with mental illness in the criminal justice system.  Obviously, a balance must be struck between recognising genuine mental illness and ensuring that people cannot evade the full rigour of the law by falsely claiming to be suffering from a mental illness.  While we have not managed to achieve that balance yet, we may be getting there.</P>
        <P>It is a matter of shame that so many people with mental illness continue to be imprisoned when what they really need is medical treatment.  I acknowledge the difficulties in this regard but there is still much to be learned in the field of mental health sciences which can better our understanding of how to approach the issue in a criminal law context.  One should endeavour to ensure that legislation in this area is in line with best practice with regard to care for the mentally ill.  I hope the Bill as proposed will go some way towards addressing these issues.</P>
        <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to amend sections 4 and 13 of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006.  The 2006 Act was welcome because it improved the law on criminal insanity and allowed for a statutory definition and restatement of the test for criminal insanity, which previously was based on existing rules in the common law.  A new verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity replaced the guilty but insane verdict and a new plea of guilty but with diminished responsibility was introduced.  The 2006 Act also set down provisions in respect of a person&rsquo;s fitness to be tried.  It amended the law on infanticide, provided for new rules on the transfer of patients who become mentally ill while serving a sentence and established the new review board.  This brought Ireland into line with many other countries, reflected changing attitudes to mental health and recognised the complexities therein.</P>
        <P>The principal themes of the 2010 Bill are improving the fitness to be tried mechanism to bring it into compliance with the European Convention on Human Rights and providing that discharge and post-release conditions imposed on persons by the Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board will be legally enforceable for the first time.  These conditions will apply both to those who have been found to be unfit to stand trial and those who have been found not guilty by reason of insanity.  It is proposed that section 4 removes any doubt about compliance with the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights.  The convention requires that, except in emergency cases, an individual cannot be deprived of his or her liberty unless he or she is found, on the basis of objective medical expertise, to be of unsound mind and that any mental disorder must warrant compulsory confinement.  It is necessary to comply with this convention both to respect a person&rsquo;s liberty and to ensure his or her personal safety.</P>
        <P>The second important change proposed in the Bill relates to an amendment to section 13 of the 2006 Act.  This amendment will allow enforceable conditions to be applied to conditional discharge.  There was an element of confusion in this regard in the sense that the 2006 Act envisaged a rather black and white situation in terms of a person&rsquo;s fitness for discharge.  This <Col N="51"/>neglected or ignored the reality in psychiatric care where cases might arise of persons who are capable of some sort of conditional discharge.  However, the conditions were not enforceable.  This anomaly came to light in a number of High Court cases, most notably highlighted by Mr. Justice Hanna in JB <i>v</i>. Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board. This case found that the Mental Health (Criminal Law) Review Board had no mechanism available to it by which it could make post-release conditions binding on the applicant.  The Minister of State has spoken of the urgency attached to this amendment given that there are people currently in detention who should, if the law allowed it, be considered for conditional discharge.  As such, I welcome the proposed amendment which underpins the principle of conditional discharge.</P>
        <P>While the Labour Party broadly welcomes the Bill, we have some concerns.  First, we have a difficulty with the rather outmoded language employed by the Bill.  The use of language can be delicate in many circumstances but is particularly so in the case of mental health.  In light of this, the Labour Party has proposed amendments which would replace the word &ldquo;insanity&rdquo; with &ldquo;mental disorder&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;insanity&rdquo; has specific negative connotations and is out of date.  It is important that our legislation uses the most appropriate terms available.</P>
        <P>Second, the Labour Party is proposing an amendment which would allow people to be detained in a &ldquo;...suitable place of treatment specified by the Minister for Health and Children&rdquo;.  This would allow for detention in places other than the Central Mental Hospital, a facility which may not be suitable for all detainees.  For example, a number of the &ldquo;fitness to be tried&rdquo; proceedings are currently being held in the District Court setting and, as such, are for summary and minor offences.  It would be inappropriate in many of these cases to send someone to the Central Mental Hospital.  I hope the Bill will be amended to offer the courts an alternative.</P>
        <P>These are sensible and reasonable amendments.  I am confident that if the Minister of State were to have his way, they would be taken on board.  As Deputy Shatter observed, it is frustrating for Opposition Members when reasonable proposals from this side of the House which would not involve a cost for the State and which would make life better for particular sectors of society are rejected purely on the basis that they did not come from the Minister or Minister of State.</P>
        <P>This Bill, the 2006 Bill and the review of the latter offer, above all else, the prospect of a new tolerance in regard to mental health.  They point the way in terms of ensuring that people now know that recovery is possible.  That is vitally important but was not always the case.  When I was growing up there was a general acceptance that there was no possibility of recovery from mental health problems, and depending on the particular psychosis or condition, there was indeed a great likelihood that one would never recover.  We have come a long way since then in terms of treatments and in terms of our attitude towards mental health.</P>
        <P>It is the absence of hope that drives us to despair, and this Bill is, more than anything else, about hope for those who previously had none.  Deputy Shatter remarked that the Joint Committee on Health and Children spoke to the families of many of those detained in the Central Mental Hospital to ascertain their view on the proposed move to Thornton Hall.  I realised in the course of these discussions that our attitude to and perception of people with mental illness and those who surround them is very flawed.  These were ordinary families whose hopes and aspirations for their loved ones are that they will return home and have a life like everybody else.  Those people will take great hope and comfort from this Bill.</P>
        <P>The people about whom we are talking are those who have experienced the most severe and traumatic mental health episodes.  However, they are in some degree the lucky ones because we are putting in place legislation which will ensure their situation is progressed.  We all know <Col N="52"/>of people who have mental health issues but do not have that type of path to recovery.  We should be conscious of them.</P>
        <P>We should also bear in mind that just as we members of the committee had a distorted view of people who are detained in mental health facilities for their own protection, so too do members of the public have concerns about the provisions of this Bill.  We must trust the professionals in this case.  I have no doubt that things will go wrong as they always do.  However, in the main, more things go right than go wrong.  We must be far more tolerant and we must accept there are episodes in people&rsquo;s lives when they do awful things.  However, with the right type of treatment they can recover.  That is what it is all about.</P>
        <P>I wish the Minister of State well with the Bill.  I hope he and his Department will take on board the amendments the Labour Party has offered in the spirit in which they are offered.  The objective is to bring us forward in terms of the provision of mental health services.</P>

	<P>I welcome the opportunity to address this Bill.  Deputy Kathleen Lynch observed that attitudes have changed in the area of mental health.  We all have a role to play in terms of recognising that people have episodes in their lives that bring them over the edge and lead them to do things they would not normally do.  We also have work to do in educating public attitudes to depression, suicide and other mental illnesses, which are as real as physical illnesses.</P>
        <P>The Bill proposes two important amendments to the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006.  It has been carefully devised to achieve a balance between the rights of the individual, which must be paramount in this, and the need to safeguard the community at large.  The primary amendment relates to the conditional discharge of persons detained in the Central Mental Hospital.  Currently, the mental health review board is entitled to conditionally discharge suitable patients, but it does not have the power to make the necessary arrangements for the supervision of a patient who has been discharged.  This means it cannot ensure that patients are returned if conditions are breached.  This is detrimental to patients, society and hospitals.  This lack of enforcement has effectively made the Act unworkable in this regard and has meant the board was not in a position to grant conditional discharges.</P>
        <P>Given that this goes to the core of an individual&rsquo;s right to freedom, it is not surprising that the situation has resulted in several legal challenges.  It is understandable that there are concerns regarding personal freedoms, but we must also consider the concerns of communities and society at large.  If this Bill is enacted, the board will be allowed to recall patients who breach the conditions of their release and thereafter to review, as soon as possible, their continued detention.  It will also be possible for a person who has been granted a conditional release to be granted a full release, without conditions, after one year.  This is a sensible approach.</P>
        <P>The second amendment deals with cases where unfitness to be tried may be an issue, a matter that has attracted a great deal of public comment.  As the law stands, the court can refer an individual to the Central Mental Hospital for up to two weeks for an assessment to determine whether he or she is mentally fit to be tried for a criminal offence.  This is not a standard procedure, nor should it be, because it presents a difficult scenario for the Judiciary and the Courts Service.  It can become very emotive when, for instance, a conviction is overturned on the grounds of mental insanity.</P><Col N="53"/>
        <P>The European Convention on Human Rights states than an individual cannot be deprived of liberty unless he or she has been found, on the basis of objective medical expertise, to be of unsound mind.</P>
      
        <P>In this instance, I agree with Deputy Kathleen Lynch that we must leave it to the professionals, and not the State, to make those decisions.  When clinical, psychological and psychiatric assessments are done on people who find themselves in these situations it is important that resources are in place to ensure that these procedures can be followed on a seamless basis.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The Bill ensures that our law complies with the European Convention on Human Rights.  It proposes that a court hear evidence from a consultant psychiatrist before requiring a full assessment of the accused person.  The Bill also allows for other centres, apart from the Central Mental Hospital, to carry out assessments.  The net effect of this will be to reduce pressure on the Central Mental Hospital, where accommodation is scarce.  I know the Minister of State is actively looking at alternative locations for the Central Mental Hospital.  I welcome the fact that he has engaged with interested groups in this area.  The relocation the Central Mental Hospital should not cause it to be seen as an extension of the prison service.  We must be careful of the public perception of the hospital and of the people who seek treatment there.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P>The proposed amendments represent a progressive common-sense approach to the law in this area.  At their most basic level, they bridge the gaps that currently exist in the law.  I welcome the fact that the legislation will be kept under constant review to see whether the procedures enshrined in the Bill are effective.  At the core of any legislation we pass there must be vigilance to ensure that the systems we put in place are working to the benefit of the individual patient, the Health Service Executive and the community.  Issues leading to disagreement will arise from time to time and anomalies may be created within the system.  That is why it is important it is kept under review.</P>
        <P>The alternative to introducing these amendments is to leave the situation as it is.  Inaction in this instance has never been mine or my party&rsquo;s preference.  A failure to act would undermine the interests of society at large, as well as of individuals, particularly vulnerable individuals.  It could also expose the State to further legal challenges with possible significant legal costs and damages awards.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill offers a win win situation for the individual, society and the State.  I am glad to have been given an opportunity to make my contribution to this issue.  Mental health needs a particular focus.  The Minister of State takes a particular interest in this area and it is important, particularly when resources are scarce, that mental health continues to be given the priority it deserves.  The figures are stark.  The effect of difficult economic situations on depression and on the break-up of families can be great.  These are difficult things for people to deal with and it is incumbent upon legislators and the Government to ensure that as many resources as possible are applied to this area.  Prevention of mental illness is better than its cure.  It is important that people can be open about depression, how they are feeling and their own mental health and can access services and talk to people.  This is particularly important for young men because we have seen an increase in rates of suicide among this group.  We must look closely at this area.  People must not feel that they cannot talk or seek advice.  If young people cannot seek help from their parents, and sometimes they cannot, the State should be able to assist these people where possible.</P>

        <P>I welcome the opportunity of saying a few words on this important legislation amending the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2006.  The fact that we are coming back to legislation that was passed in 2006 highlights the rate of development in this area.  The Government is conscious of its responsibility to do everything possible, within the very restricted resources we have, to stay up to date and to respond, as well as it can, to the professional advice in this area.  The wording, &ldquo;guilty but insane&rdquo; is not acceptable when one is defining someone&rsquo;s position in law.  The term, &ldquo;not guilty by reason of insanity&rdquo; is much clearer.  There are also issues regarding fitness to be tried.  Those amendments come on the back of recommendations that have come to Government.  I applaud the Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, for acting on the advice he gets.  He has shown himself to be very genuine and serious about his responsibility for mental health.  Those of us in Dublin North know of his interest in St. Ita&rsquo;s Hospital and in the work done in collaboration with the professionals, the community, the patients and their relatives in the hospital.  That must be acknowledged.</P>
        <P>The Bill gives us an opportunity to reflect on the recommendations that have come to us from different organisations, not least from Amnesty International, an organisation with which I have a long involvement.  As the name of that organisation suggests, it draws on its experience worldwide in the area of human rights.  Last Sunday being world mental health day makes it all the more appropriate that we reflect on the context of this legislation.  The report launched last Sunday by Amnesty International and its campaign challenging prejudice and discrimination against people with mental health problems point to the need for more work in this area.  The report, Hear my Voice: the Experience of Discrimination by People with Mental Health Problems, explores the experience of unfair treatment and discrimination as perceived by people directly affected by these issues.  This happens in all sorts of subliminal ways but it comes to a very serious impasse for the very small minority of people who become involved in the criminal justice system.</P>
        <P>As the Amnesty International campaign highlights, mental health is a matter for everybody.  Many people would say they are driven mad by politics.  There are many interpretations of what that might mean but there is no doubt that mental health is something to which we must all have regard.  We must overcome the stereotype that is a throwback to outdated ideas.  The Amnesty International campaign on mental health prejudice and discrimination was launched with DCU.  The report presents some glaring findings.  It states that 95% of participants reported some level of unfair treatment because of a mental health problem.   The vast majority, or 86%, of respondents indicated experiencing distress resulting from unfair treatment.  In addition, 64% reported unfair treatment in making or keeping friends, 63% reported being avoided or shunned because of mental health problems, 61% reported unfair treatment by family, 44% reported unfair treatment in terms of personal safety, 43% reported being treated unfairly in keeping a job, 36% reported unfair treatment in finding jobs and 66% decided against applying for work on the basis of perceived prejudices.  This evidence clearly suggests the disempowering effect this stereotyping can have on the people concerned.</P>
        <P>The Government ought to act without further delay to meet the report&rsquo;s recommendation that Ireland ratify the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its optional protocol.  The Government and Amnesty International need to work closely together given the latter&rsquo;s international experience and the former&rsquo;s wherewithal to bring about change.  Thankfully, the changes required are not capital intensive.  However, they require leadership in highlighting the potential for good attitudes towards mental health.</P><Col N="55"/>
        <P>I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, in that regard.  Both of us have had the honour of attending a suicide awareness fundraiser in the Four Seasons Hotel, at which the Minister of State was recognised as being aware of the challenges faced by people who are feeling suicidal.  In light of what he had to say on that occasion, I am proud to be a Member of a Government in which he has a portfolio.  By speaking from the heart, he demonstrated the leadership we require.  While accepting that money and resources will have to be found, he also highlighted the fact that Government involves more than resources.</P>
        <P>I was reminded that leadership can be expressed in different ways while attending the launch of a research report in Balbriggan town hall last Friday.  The report, which investigated youth well-being in Balbriggan, discussed issues of facilities, counselling services and feelings of self-esteem and it did not shy away from mental health in young people.  Some 27% of the population of Balbriggan is aged 18 or below, compared to a national average of 21%.</P>
        <P>I compliment the Headstrong organisation on its innovative approach to the area of mental health in terms of providing services which will make it less likely that people have to engage with the Criminal Law (Insanity) Bill 2010.  Those who receive Headstrong&rsquo;s support have an affirmation that they will be able to become constructive and full members of society.</P>
        <P>I commend the youth advisory panel and its working group on producing the A Voice Being Heard research report on youth well-being in Balbriggan and Amnesty International on its ongoing work in highlighting human rights issues in the area of mental health, prejudice and discrimination.  This Bill is informed by the latest research and will ensure that a humane and understanding approach is taken to people with mental health issues.  That is a good reason to support its passage through the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="OliviaMitchell"><NameTxt>Deputy Olivia Mitchell</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  It is rare that we find ourselves amending an Act passed as recently as 2006.  Nevertheless, it is clear that difficulties have emerged with the earlier legislation, which itself was welcome as a significant improvement on the law as it previously stood.</P>
        <P>The two major changes proposed in this Bill pertain to the mechanisms for determining whether an accused is fit to stand trial and conditional discharges, which was not working under the 2006 Act.  These changes are welcome.  In regard to the first mechanism, the former practice whereby a jury decided whether a person was fit to stand trial resulted in gross abuses of people&rsquo;s rights because it required sick people to undergo trial.  People who should have been in hospital were unfairly exposed to the rigour of the law.  The new mechanism introduced by the 2006 Act allowing a judge to make the decision was infinitely preferable.  However, as the requirement on a judge to reach a decision quickly and in the absence of expertise brought us into conflict with our commitments under the European Convention on Human Rights, we are now amending that Act.  Judges were making what appeared to be arbitrary decisions in the absence of objective expertise or advice from forensic psychiatrists.  It was also possible that decisions were made without due consideration because of the short time spans involved.  The amendments provided in the Bill are welcome in this regard.  Deciding on a person&rsquo;s fitness to stand trial is a grave responsibility for anybody and I am sure judges will welcome the amendments.</P>
        <P>The interface between the health service and the criminal justice system is fraught with difficulties and tensions.  Mental disorder and illness are catch-all terms which encompass a continuum of conditions ranging from very mild to extremely severe.  Many films have been made about the idea that those who appear the sanest are the most ill.  Judges do not like to be called &ldquo;laymen&rdquo; but nevertheless they do not always have the requisite expertise and the <Col N="56"/>input of forensic psychologists is essential.  An accused person who is incorrectly determined fit for trial is subjected to the full rigours of a criminal trial and, possibly, a prison sentence which would be totally inappropriate.  Prisons are not nice places, even for the healthiest people.  They represent a considerable abuse for those who are not of sound mind.  The potential for the abuse of human rights is enormous.</P>
        <P>Having to face confinement for an unspecified time, as in the case of those deemed unfit for trial, has considerable implications.  A decision made on this should only be made in the very strictest of conditions and it should be informed by fairness and the very best expertise available.  This Bill is very welcome in that it gives judges access to the best expertise available.  It also ensures decisions will not be made in haste.  It provides for a 14-day referral to the Central Mental Hospital, where a person can be assessed to decide whether he or she is fit or unfit.  Decisions made in haste by a judge could result in an accused regretting those decisions for a very long time.  I welcome the provision in this regard.</P>
        <P>I welcome the second measure, which clarifies and facilitates the termination of a person&rsquo;s detention.  The former legislation was dreadful in that, under it, a decision had to be made by the Minister.  Effectively, the decision was never made by a Minister.  Even when somebody was found fit to be discharged on medical grounds by the psychiatrist, a decision on the finding had to be made by the Minister.  Inevitably, decisions such as those are too susceptible to political considerations and public opinion on the crime for which one was incarcerated.  The 2006 Act, in setting up the review board to make such decisions, represented a huge improvement.  Without this improvement, people languished completely unnecessarily in the Central Mental Hospital, probably for much longer than they would have had to spent in an ordinary prison had they been deemed fit to go to trial.  Detention, for many, was for an indefinite period.</P>
        <P>The procedural defects in the 2006 Act are obvious and have been the subject of court cases and various recommendations to the Minister.  I congratulate the Minister on acting on these recommendations.  Incarcerating people needlessly in the Central Mental Hospital is a considerable abuse of human rights.  A provision to make conditions of discharge binding rather than mere recommendations is missing in the existing legislation but is provided for in this Bill.  That is welcome.</P>
        <P>Recovery is not a black-and-white issue.  People may be partially recovered or not so ill as to justify incarceration in the Central Mental Hospital, yet they may not be well enough to be discharged without supervision or on the assumption that they will never relapse into mental illness.  That decisions cannot be made in this regard results in people languishing in the hospital.  The intent of the 2006 Act was not being met as a result of the failure to provide supervisory powers for the board.  The safety of the public must be of paramount importance, in addition to the human rights of those incarcerated in the Central Mental Hospital.  The changes in the Bill represent an attempt to ensure that we will comply with our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
        <P>I regret the persistent use of the word &ldquo;insanity&rdquo; in the Bill.  Irrespective of its legal definition, it is an out-of-date term.  It is pejorative and very stigmatising.  I ask the Minister of State to consider a different, less pejorative term for future legislation.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State says there will be no cost associated with this legislation.  I question this; it must be incorrect.  Beds in the Central Mental Hospital come at a premium.  One benefit of the proposed legislation is that people will be discharged and not kept unnecessarily.  Nevertheless, patients will be referred to the hospital regularly and surely will have to be assessed by forensic psychiatrists, thus giving rise to a resource issue.  Quite apart from the assessment, <Col N="57"/>if people are to be discharged, placed under supervision and monitored in the community, perhaps while receiving treatment, surely there will be cost implications.  I hope we are not making another mistake in assuming that, by passing another law, we will solve a problem when a lack of resources will prevent its implementation.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State said in his speech that he is considering designating centres other than the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum as locations where people may be assessed.  That would be welcome but it would not overcome the problem associated with the general shortage of psychiatrists, particularly forensic psychiatrists.</P>
        <P>I want to raise the issue of the future of the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum, which is in my constituency.  In the old days of the health boards, of which I was a member, I visited the Central Mental Hospital on a number of occasions.  In the early years of those visits, people were still slopping out.  Conditions have improved slightly in that this is no longer happening but, by any standard, the conditions are Dickensian.  They are appalling conditions in which to place sick people and to have staff work.  The building is unsuitable and is in an unsuitable location.  I am probably not telling the Minister of State anything he does not know because I am sure he has visited the building.</P>
        <P>While we may be meeting our commitments under the European Convention on Human Rights to the letter of the law, we must remember the physical conditions in which people are being kept for indefinite periods are really appalling in this day and age.  While the Minister of State said Thornton Hall will not go ahead and that alternative locations are being considered, my worry is that an alternative location will not be announced until the terms of the public private partnership are agreed.  I am worried that there will never be another public private partnership.  Where are the developers who might have been involved in such partnerships?  Most are unable to obtain credit.  If we are to depend on the private sector, will the development ever happen?  Is there a plan B if we cannot get the private sector to participate?  Will the Minister of State clarify what is happening in this regard when replying?  Important as this legislation is, the reality is that people are living their whole lives and dying in the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum.  The conditions are really appalling.  I ask the Minister to consider this.</P>

	<P>I thank all the Members who contributed to the debate this evening.  I acknowledge the points raised and will address them individually.</P>
        <P>Deputy Shatter is correct that we are attempting to honour our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.  That is a given and I accept it.</P>
        <P>I take the points raised by Deputies Shatter, Kathleen Lynch and Mitchell on the reference to the word &ldquo;insanity&rdquo; in the criminal law legislation.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>We must move on in terms of the terminology we use in regard to mental health.  While we have come some distance, we have not come far enough.  This is what the review to be undertaken next year, to which I referred earlier, will be about.  I will come back to the Deputies on what will be addressed in that review as I deal with the specific issues raised.  It is important to state &mdash; I also gave this response in the Seanad &mdash; the reason we use this terminology.</P>
        <P>It is our intention to take on board amendments.  The point was made that the 2006 Act is defective.  An Act which provides for the release of people from the Central Mental Hospital, that the review board will have no control in terms of their whereabouts or the activities in which they engage and in respect of which we cannot insert restrictions or safeguards is, I <Col N="58"/>concede, defective.  This is the reason for the urgency of the legislation before us.  I agree with Deputy Mitchell that it is unusual for an Act, such as the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act, 2006, to be amended so soon after enactment.  This legislation is being introduced to allow us address the many issues surrounding the Central Mental Hospital, the pressures on it in terms of beds and the need to allow people to live in the community but, under supervision and restriction.  I do not intend addressing all the technical issues raised.</P>
        <P>It is important I set out the advice given to me by my officials, as I did when the Bill was before the Seanad.  I thank my officials for their advice.  While I fully understand the concerns raised in regard to the retention of the word &ldquo;insanity&rdquo; as used in the 2006 Act, I ask Members to bear with me as there are complex and fundamental issues associated with replacing that term.  These issues will need to be carefully examined.  I assure Members that this will be done in the course of the planned comprehensive review of the 2006 Act.  I will return later to the specific points raised in this regard.  The Minister for Justice and Law Reform has agreed this issue should be examined in the course of that review which will commence early next year.</P>
        <P>The word &ldquo;insanity&rdquo; is used in the 2006 Act because this is the correct description of the contents of the Act.  The definition of &ldquo;insanity&rdquo; in the 2006 Act was drafted on the basis of the decided judicial authority and the precise meaning of insanity and the circumstances in which the finding of insanity will excuse a person from criminal liability.  The House may be aware that this issue was extensively debated during the passage through the Oireachtas of the 2006 Act.  The 2006 Act was in gestation for ten years during which time the issue was examined in great depth.  I mention such long periods of deliberation to stress the complexity of the issue which has been raised.  The plea of insanity in Irish law is an excuse rather than a condition.  It is also a factor that excuses liability from the commission of a crime.  Our law places the matter within legal parameters directly related to personal responsibility for one&rsquo;s action.  In this scenario medial evidence will be influential but not decisive.  This means that an accused person who has been diagnosed as mentally insane may fail to satisfy the criteria for criminal insanity in law.</P>
        <P>I support Members&rsquo; suggestions that the use of this terminology, including references to lunatics and the involvement of wards of court, be addressed by way of amendment. This legislation is urgently needed.  We have received many submissions from the Law Reform Commission and other voluntary bodies, including Amnesty International and Members of this House on the need to make this necessary change in the legislation.</P>
        <P>I will try now to address some of the specific points raised, including what supervision will be in place for people released under the conditions set out in subsection 13(<i>c</i>) and what agencies, supervision or criteria may apply.  I fully appreciate the question.  This issue also cropped up in previous debate in this House in relation to the training of the people involved.  I stress that those involved will be people trained in the mental health system and not bouncers and so on.  Those involved will be people trained as psychiatric nurses, people who will have the necessary qualifications and who will be vetted by the Mental Health Commission.  It is most important that these are people from a psychiatric care background.</P>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The Bill does not appear to prescribe that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnMoloney"><NameTxt>Deputy John Moloney</NameTxt>
	<P>We are speaking of people specifically trained in mental health care similar to those recruited to deal with people returned under the Mental Health Act 2001.  That is the intention of this legislation.  The Deputy also raised fundamental questions in regard to <Col N="59"/>the safety of the person and the public.  While I will have another opportunity to address this issue on Committee Stage, I take this opportunity to confirm to the House that this Bill seeks to, on the one hand, ensure people who no longer need to be detained in the Central Mental Hospital are returned to the community and, on the other hand, that they and the public are protected.  We must ensure people live up to the conditions of their release from the Central Mental Hospital to the community.  I will return to the Deputy on this point later.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Deputies Shatter, Mitchell and O&rsquo;Brien referred to the Central Mental Hospital.  I take on board Deputy Mitchell&rsquo;s remarks in regard to the current economic climate.  Under the multi-annual capital programme we are allowed to sell off properties to the value of &euro;50 million.  However, we have this year raised only &euro;10 million through the sale of property due to the decline.  I acknowledge that Thornton Hall was the Government&rsquo;s preferred location for the new prison.  However, this is no longer the case.  I put the case for the withdrawal from the Thornton Hall project to Cabinet and did not announce a proposed relocation because advice to me at the time was that this cannot be done until we have the capital commitment to meet it.  I am not very proficient in financial matters.  I will engage with the director of estates, Mr. Brian Gilroy, during October-November on public private partnerships proposals in this regard.  I am led to believe this can be done.  I acknowledge that there are different types of public private partnerships but as I understand it this is a vehicle we can use.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I cannot yet say what will happen to the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum.  I do not make these points to pretend everything in mental health is being addressed because as Deputy Neville will I am sure remind me we have a huge distance to go.  However, we have been able to address some of the issues through the &euro;10 million we have secured, including the construction of the new psychiatric hospital in Letterkenny which will ensure no further referrals to the old hospital there.  The contracts for work on the Clonmel project have been signed and work on that site is progressing.  I am trying to follow the inspectors&rsquo; reports on the conditions in mental hospitals.  Three months ago, I turned the sod for the building of a 100 bed unit to replace St. Loman&rsquo;s Hospital, Mullingar.  I understand this is not what one would call fast forward movement but it is at least an attempt to deal with the worst hospitals as identified in the inspectors&rsquo; reports.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I wish to return to the specific question relating to the Central Mental Hospital.  I am led to understand that of all of the properties in which mental health services are provided, that Dundrum is considered one of the best locations in respect of which maximum funding might be procured.  Securing such funding will clearly be the intention as we prepare the capital programme for next year.  There is little point in bringing Dundrum on to the market until we can maximise the value in this regard.</P>
        <P>There is no point in creating false hopes.  In that context, I regret to say that the new central mental hospital will depend on funding secured under PPP arrangements.  I will not be in a position to say when that will happen until later in the year.  A certain area has been touted in the media as being the location for the new facility.  I met political and other representatives from that area and I assured them that, should the area be selected, they will be informed in advance of any public announcement.  I accept that this answer is probably not to the Deputy&rsquo;s liking.  However, the deadline for deciding how the project will be funded is either November or December.  I will inform the House of the position in this regard as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Deputy Kathleen Lynch raised an extremely important issue.  It is obvious that everyone who contributed to this debate wants a better quality of life for those who suffer from mental illness.  The Bill is designed to ensure that people who have been committed to the Central Mental Hospital will be released into the community as quickly as possible.  It has been suggested that <Col N="60"/>these individuals should be released into centres of population away from the hospital.  That is an extremely important point.</P>
        <P>I was beginning to think that I had lost the plot.  I refer, in that context, to the supplement and the editorial which appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> today.  When I entered the Department two years ago, I felt it important that I should set out my policy position and my hopes.  I did this so that we might drive forward a programme to deal with the closure of mental hospitals.  This can be achieved.  I also put forward the need for a director of mental health services.  I felt that was extremely important to deal with the stigma relating to mental health.  I reached a conclusion in respect of this matter, but not because I have a professional background in it.  I have no such background.  From many years as a public representative, I have been aware of the major concerns people harbour regarding loved ones or relatives who will not seek support in case it might affect their career prospects, relationships or whatever.  In that context, I set about launching the See Change initiative.  I did not do so lightly.</P>
        <P>I certainly had notions in respect of this matter but I invited people I respect to assist with the initiative.  I often said to Deputy Neville &mdash; I am sure he will confirm this &mdash; that it was important to highlight the area of mental health.  I did not try to do this on my own.  I invited people from all walks of life who, I believed, had a contribution to make and who were prepared to give of their time on the first Wednesday of each month to become involved.  Those individuals confirmed to me that the stigma attaching to mental health was a major issue.  That was what encouraged me to launch the campaign and to facilitate it I selected 27 centres throughout the country to which people would be invited to discuss the issue of mental health.</P>
        <P>On each occasion on which I discuss mental health in public, I make the point that the resources available in respect of this area are not adequate.  I am a Fianna F&aacute;il Deputy and I am not trying to pretend that I am not a member of the Government.  I wish to make that clear, particularly in circumstances where people might be of the opinion that we are trying to pretend that everything is grand and that the only issue which arises is that relating to stigma.  It is, however, important that we deal with that stigma.  To date, meetings relating to the See Change initiative have been held in Ennis, Limerick, Tipperary and, last night, in Donegal.</P>
        <P>I am somewhat concerned with regard to the editorial which appeared in today&rsquo;s edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> and which refers to what is being done as an extraordinarily cynical exercise on the part of the Government.  It is obvious that this is a reference to me because I am responsible for driving the campaign.  I was glad to realise, as I listened to Members contributions, that the stigma attached to mental health is not an issue I merely dreamt up.  This is a real issue.</P>
        <P>Regardless of whatever level of capital funding we can secure, unless people are prepared to present and seek support, there is very little which can be done for them.  I do not wish anyone to be of the view that I am presenting myself as the Mother Teresa of mental health or depression.  That is not the impression I wish to give.  However, I always knew I would front a campaign in this area.  I had occasion to be referred to a psychiatrist in the Mater Hospital some years ago and I felt it was important to publicise that fact if only to try to show people that there is no big deal when it comes to matters of this nature and that individuals can seek support and recover.</P>
        <P>I am glad Members have confirmed that the stigma attaching to mental health is an issue because I had begun to have doubts.  I had also begun to wonder whether it was right to engage in a national campaign, particularly if such a campaign was seen as a cynical exercise.  I do not believe the latter to be the case.  The See Change initiative is a fundamental part of the reform <Col N="61"/>programme we are pursuing.  The meetings that have been held to date have been arranged under the auspices of the various county forums, which acknowledge that there is a need for this issue to be addressed.</P>
        <P>Deputy Shatter referred to the safety of communities where persons are conditionally discharged.  I again draw attention to the fact that the review board must have regard to the public interest.  The authority being transferred to it brings its own level of responsibility.  In that context, the board must have regard to the public interest when deciding if a person can be discharged.  The board must also be satisfied that appropriate supervision arrangements are in place in respect of the person.  The Bill provides that a person who is in breach of the conditions of his or her discharge and who is a danger to himself or herself or others can be returned to the Central Mental Hospital.  I appreciate the Deputy&rsquo;s point in respect of this matter and I am using this debate to expand on the position.  The Bill also states that the Garda can be requested to assist in returning someone to the Central Mental Hospital.</P>
        <P>The Bill is an attempt, prior to bringing the conclusion of the major review, to allow people to be discharged conditionally.  I accept the Deputy&rsquo;s point that this should have been dealt with in the initial legislation.  The Bill is, therefore, an attempt to do that and to ensure that people can be discharged from the Central Mental Hospital, under supervised conditions to create additional space there.  I accept Deputy Mitchell&rsquo;s point regarding the conditions at the hospital.  It is not enough for me to state that I have visited the facility and have first-hand knowledge of those facilities.  That is why there is a commitment to progress matters in this regard.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill is an important example of the necessity to ensure that the criminal justice system sets the correct balance between safeguarding the rights of the person, particularly the vulnerable, and protecting communities.  If it is not considered strong enough, I will bring forward amendments on Committee Stage to rectify any shortcomings.  The conditional discharge conditions will enable patients to whom the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2005 applies and who are no longer in need of attention at the Central Mental Hospital to be allowed their freedom, while ensuring that the welfare and safety of those patients and the public interest are fully protected.  I appreciate that she said in opening comments that there has been some progress in the mental health area.  Although the health budget will be reduced by &euro;600 million, I will not use that for a second as cover for our demands within the mental health budget.  It has also been established that 70% of mental health issues begin in child and adolescent years so my pitch to the Government has been that the focus of funding this year must be in that specific direction.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have all met with various groups who have put their case before us.  It has been noted that Headstrong has a Jigsaw model and I saw what has happened at first hand when I called to Galway.  I will not try to escape through the hatch and it has been quite properly pointed out to me that the budget allocation is down to 5.5%.  I was questioned about this by Deputy Neville on previous occasions but have never used the excuse, which might give some cover, that funding is now being channelled to different areas, such as the primary care centres or community services.  I fully acknowledge that until we show clear commitment to what we promised in A Vision for Change by way of community supports and community mental health teams, the argument about insufficient funding will remain.  The challenge going into this budget will be to ensure that what we have promised in A Vision for Change can become a reality.</P>
        <P>A Vision for Change is a ten-year programme and I will not use the term &ldquo;work in progress&rdquo;, as a work in progress must come to a halt at some stage.  We have approximately five years <Col N="62"/>left for the programme, and there has been progress in the area of child and adolescent beds.  The commitment is for 100 beds and as we have come from 30 to 55 beds, there is a long way to go.  The option is to either suggest publicly that the programme is parked until the recession passes or else we work within the context of making the case to ensure that the commitments made in A Vision for Change become a reality.  That will require funding.</P>
        <P>Prior to Committee Stage full consideration will be given to the issues raised today.  I take the point that the Government does not always have all the answers, and I note this in regard to what can come from the Opposition benches, particularly with regard to health care and mental health.  I am open to and looking forward to amendments to improve the Bill.</P>
        <P>It is important to mention that the scope of the Bill is limited and looks to ensure the difficulties regarding fitness to be tried and conditional discharge can be resolved as quickly as possible.  Any other issues regarding the operation of the Criminal Law (Insanity) Act 2002 will be looked at in the context of the full review of the 2006 Act, which commenced towards the end of the year.</P>
        <P>A number of Deputies made the same point about the future of Dundrum and I have dealt with it.  The matter does not only concern criminal law and the electoral laws also refer to lunatics and people of insane mind with regard to participation in this House.  The issue was raised at a public meeting in Tralee and I have written to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, since that meeting.  I have sought a response ensuring that such references will be removed from the electoral laws.  The proposal went in over six months ago and shows that we have much catching up to do, although the opportunity has presented itself for an open debate.</P>
        <P>I hope I have answered most of the questions raised.  I take Deputy Kathleen Lynch&rsquo;s point that the Bill is about hope, tolerance and recovery.  The fundamental hope for A Vision for Change is recovery and the fundamental hope for this Bill is to drive the recovery forward for those who can participate in open society.  I know there are many issues which must be dealt with so safeguards can be put in place but it is fair to say in response that it is up to us to show that when we talk about people being supervised, the correct supervisory treatment will be put in place and people can be trained appropriately.  All of this is an attempt to tie in the commitments for A Vision for Change so that people can move from institutionalised care, whether it is the Central Mental Hospital or an acute hospital, provided that the necessary supports are in place.</P>
        <P>Many of these issues are now being presented to us and in the past fortnight I have met with Amnesty, with which Deputy Neville was involved.  They are putting together a proposal and perhaps its time is coming.  Like the Italian model, it may be important to legislate for our commitments to spending.  If we bring about another reform programme like A Vision for Change, there should be legislation underpinning the process to ensure whatever commitments we make can be legislated for.  There should be penalties or conditions imposed if we fail.</P>
        <P>I have responded as best I can to all the points.  I thank all Deputies for their support and look forward to hearing amendments and proposals as we go through Committee Stage.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>In this motion I am presenting the case on behalf of the Labour Party for a realistic and effective response to the hidden crisis of fuel poverty.  Thousands of families are being put in extreme anxiety because they simply cannot pay their utility bills.  This year already approximately 2,500 electricity disconnections and more than 4,000 gas disconnections have occurred every month.  Unless the Government wakes up to this reality, the crisis will simply deepen as winter sets in.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This motion does not ask the Government to do anything it cannot do in the current recessionary climate.  It does not even ask the Government to do anything it does not accept needs to be done.  This motion is about getting the Government to do what it said it would do but did not do.  It is about calling the Government to account.</P>
        <P>A year ago in the renewed programme for Government, Fianna F&aacute;il and the Greens stated, &ldquo;We will publish a fuel poverty strategy by the end of 2009, in keeping with the introduction of a carbon levy&rdquo;.  We got the carbon levy but only silence on the fuel poverty strategy.  The same programme stated those most at risk of fuel poverty will be protected with the introduc<Col N="65"/>tion of the carbon levy.  The Government passed on that one too.  Another deafening silence despite promises made at the last budget.</P>
        <P>The tabling of this motion has already produced some kind of result, even though we cannot tell yet what precisely is going on.  According to media reports today, there has been a promise of some kind of fuel allowance increase.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, are in total disarray on the issue, however.  The Minister for Finance opposes an increase in the fuel allowance while the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government talks up an increase.  Meanwhile, the Minister for Social Protection who has primary responsibility for the allowance, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, is saying nothing.  At a time when the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is looking for consensus from the rest of us, the Government parties are squabbling among themselves on this issue.  It would be funny except for the fact that it is tragic for those directly affected.  This debate has prodded a response, albeit a muddled one, from the Government.  Nothing in the Government amendment clarifies the matter, however.</P>
        <P>Recently, at my request, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources held hearings on the issue of debt management and the high level of disconnections, a matter of concern to both the energy regulator and the utility companies.  Organisations such as the Money Advice and Budgeting Service and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul play a vital role in supporting people at risk.  I want to record our thanks for their dedication.</P>
        <P>Neither does the Government have in place an over-arching strategy to deal with fuel poverty.  Will the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources outline his proposals for a strategy when he responds later?  Two years ago, the Labour Party foresaw the growing problem and published the Fuel Poverty and Energy Conservation Bill 2008, the purpose of which was to require the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to publish and implement a strategy for reducing fuel poverty.  He would also be responsible for setting targets for the strategy&rsquo;s implementation.  Regrettably, the Government ignored the Bill then.  Now, in the absence of any statutory initiative, I demand the Government takes up our proposal.</P>
        <P>In Northern Ireland the situation is markedly different.  A fuel poverty strategy is in place which includes a zero-disconnection policy which should be adopted here in the Republic.  It is based on the use of prepaid meters so that people use only what they can afford.  The regulator here has approved the use of an additional 17,000 free prepaid meters this year, welcome news.  Their cost is prohibitive and this measure does not go far enough, however.  The UK Government has a legal obligation to eradicate fuel poverty.  In Northern Ireland the strategy sets out targets to be met by 2016.</P>
        <P>It is time here in the Republic we lived up to this challenge at home.  Thousands of households will not be able to afford to heat and power their homes this winter.  Winter mortality death rates of approximately 2,000, mostly among older people, are recorded each year in Ireland alone due to the cold, one of the highest levels in the EU.  The rise in the number of fuel poor is likely to put more lives at risk this winter.  Many families with young children are forced to choose between heating their homes and cooking a hot meal.</P>
        <P>Fuel-poor people are living in cold, damp, energy inefficient housing and are often unable to heat their homes to an adequate level.  Fuel poverty is defined as the need to spend greater than 10% of the household income on fuel to achieve an acceptable level of warmth.  It depends on household income, the energy efficiency status of the property and the cost of energy. <Col N="66"/> However, no comprehensive up-to-date national statistics are available on the number of people experiencing fuel poverty.</P>
        <P>Research carried out by Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann on a sample of 500 household disconnections showed a new demographic development in fuel poverty.  Up to 59% of households disconnected were owner-occupied while only 2% were in social housing.  Overcome by unemployment, high mortgages, family breakdown or illness, these are the new poor who live in private estates and in terror waiting for the company man to come and disconnect an essential service.</P>
        <P>In one case I know of, a woman is desperate for help.  Her husband, self-employed, recently suffered a brain injury and cannot work.  They have a young child.  When the woman sought help from her community welfare officer to pay for heating oil, she was told no assistance could be given for oil fills.</P>
        <P>What is this woman to do?  What are all the others like her, mothers with young children, older people with long-term medical conditions who regularly come into our constituency clinics, to do?  It has been estimated that approximately 60,000 Irish households live in persistent fuel poverty and a further 160,000 or so experience intermittent fuel poverty.  Bord G&aacute;is stated in the order of 20,000 customers are currently carrying arrears of more than &euro;500 and 20,000 customers are in the final resolution stage where disconnection of supply is a possibility.  Among all the statistics, the most shocking one is the fact that debt management in Bord G&aacute;is is a problem that is 40 times bigger this year than it was last year.  That shows the scale of what we will have to deal with now.</P>
        <P>We know certain approaches will help.  Early intervention is key to finding the solution and new payment plans must be offered to all those customers who are struggling to pay their bills.  All utility companies must have an active role in ensuring that customers are facilitated in paying in methods that they can manage.  The ESB told post office workers that people have to pay in &euro;20 instalments, rather than the small amounts they have been paying until now.  That is not helpful and I hope it adopts a different approach.  That said, it is worth noting that companies, in the main, are making considerable efforts to assist customers in trouble.  It is not helpful that the regulator has set the price for disconnection and reconnection fees at around &euro;200.  This bears no relation to the cost of these measures or the ability of the debtor to pay it.  There needs to be a full review in the context of developing a zero disconnection policy in order that these fees are made manageable.</P>
        <P>It is curious that the regulator, which is so exercised with ensuring competition in the market, has not dealt with lack of competition in the free electricity units market.  At the current time, only ESB customers are entitled to free units, which is obviously part of social welfare support.  Other utility companies are only allowed to offer cash or cheque alternatives and, understandably, free units are preferable to customers.  It may seem a small point but this scheme should be redesigned to extend its availability to non-ESB customers.</P>
        <P>The Government maintains that prices have decreased but if we look back far enough we find that in 2002 we had among the lowest electricity prices in the EU.  Now we are on the higher end of that range.  On full deregulation, something that is now being considered by the regulator and which I hope will be helpful to customers, it is extraordinary that before we can have it for households, there will be further costs levelled in the interests of competition.  The regulator is insisting that the major utility companies must change their brand names if they are to have price deregulation at an early date.</P><Col N="67"/>
        <P>At a committee I asked the regulator how much it would cost.  I was rather startled to hear that the regulator did not know how much it would cost, even though he was imposing the requirement on the major utility companies.  It seems it is not his problem, rather it is our problem.  We are the consumers being sacrificed on the altar of competition.  It is a crazy plan that the Labour Party opposes strenuously.  Such a change, and a loss of familiar brand names in which this country can take a certain pride, such as the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is, would involve a campaign to explain it to customers to get them used to a new set of names and would cost at least &euro;80 million for no good purpose.  Bord G&aacute;is has estimated it will cost &euro;40 million.  The ESB is a much bigger company and it will cost more.  If one considers what Aviva spent in changing its name, it is mind-boggling.  Who will pay for this bling regulatory measure?  The unfortunate consumer will be forced to foot the bill.  In the interests of common sense I am asking the Minister, Deputy Ryan, who is a man of common sense, to step in and put a stop to this vagary once and for all.  We simply cannot afford it.</P>
        <P>There is a context to the issue of how we manage, price and use energy.  There is an onus on any Government to deal with fuel costs and climate change in a fair and equitable way.  It is a matter of regret that tackling climate change is now perceived by many people as simply about the imposition of a carbon levy.  I refer to the public perception that it is seen as a negative when tackling climate change is a responsibility for all of us and the Government can be a help or a hindrance in helping us to face up to it.  That is why it is disappointing that a Green Party Minister has failed to deliver fully on energy efficiency measures.  There is plethora of energy efficiency schemes but there is no comprehensive national retrofit effort that could transform Ireland&rsquo;s energy efficiency and play its part in tackling fuel poverty.</P>
        <P>At present most grant support for energy efficiency measures is geared towards those with disposable income who can afford to make up the cost of the solar panel or have the space for a wood pellet burner.  Private companies are springing up to provide renewables for households, and good luck to them, and are clearly targeting the better off who can avail of these grants.  I am glad the warmer homes scheme is now available.  It is geared towards providing insulation for elderly people on low incomes living in poor quality housing, but it is limited in its range.  In my area one has to have a fuel allowance to qualify for the scheme and I understand this is the case all over the country, which means the scheme excludes as many as it includes.  The fact is that very often those on low incomes are still living in poorly insulated, sub-standard, energy inefficient homes.</P>
        <P>In a recent survey among homeowners who took part in the home energy saving scheme carried out by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland it was found that &ldquo;single and low-income households are under-represented, as are younger adults and those in rented accommodation&rdquo;.  The reality is that  poor householders are means tested for basic insulation projects while the better off are entitled to claim for grants for various energy efficiency measures.  Even allowing for this startling unfairness the Minister, Deputy Ryan, failed to ensure that the funding allocated for energy efficiency was actually spent last year.  It was budgeted for and allocated, and was in the Estimates, but some &euro;35 million was returned to the maw of the Minister for Finance because the Minister, Deputy Ryan, could not implement his own policy.</P>
        <P>Other commitments that have been made in the programme for Government, such as the proposal to maximise energy efficiency with a target of 33% energy savings by 2020 in the public sector, have tremendous potential for job creation.  The Labour Party produced a document, The Energy Revolution, which put forward very clear proposals for a  national energy efficiency retrofit programme to create at least 30,000 direct construction sector jobs.  We recog<Col N="68"/>nise the need for an immediate jobs initiative and these schemes, and the retrofit project in particular, are the low hanging fruit for job growth and energy savings.</P>
        <P>This summer, during an Oireachtas committee meeting when I questioned the Minister, Deputy Ryan, on his failure to deliver, he asked me what I would do differently and I told him.  I said that, first, I would concentrate on houses for which there is greater need.  I certainly would invest in insulation in public buildings, such as schools and hospitals.  Every hospital should be covered with external insulation.  That should be the Government&rsquo;s marker if it is serious about insulation and increasing energy efficiency.  I am glad the Minister agreed with me, yet there is no major programme of insulation for our schools, hospitals, Garda stations and public buildings even though there are thousands of construction workers with the necessary skills who are without work.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryUpton"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Upton</NameTxt>
	<P>Fuel poverty has always been a major concern in my constituency.  Every winter people contact me worrying about their ability to heat their homes and looking for advice on where they can get assistance.  Last winter was particularly harsh and as the problem was far greater than had been experienced previously, we had to pay particular attention to the issue.  Last January, we had a big freeze during which the country came to a standstill.  People sought top-up deliveries of home heating oil and other heating fuels to ensure they could heat their homes adequately.  For many people this additional expenditure put stresses on already tight budgets.</P>
        <P>During this time of extreme weather conditions we were also reminded to keep an eye on our older relatives and neighbours.  The reasons for this are the consequences of being cold and the knock-on health effects of inadequate heating which are well known, particularly with regard to the elderly.  Last year, for perhaps the first time in a generation, we were also acutely aware of the effects of the recession on households.  It was not only elderly pensioners and low-income families who were at risk of fuel poverty, it was also those who were coming face to face with the reality of the recession for the first time.</P>
        <P>Traditionally, fuel poverty would have been considered an issue associated with lower income areas throughout the country.  However, this recession is so widespread that fuel poverty is now a very real issue in households that were previously considered well off.  Families who relied on two incomes to meet their financial commitments who never faced the prospect of not being able to adequately heat their homes throughout the winter but who have lost one of those incomes are now suddenly facing exactly this scenario.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In recent weeks, we were given an insight into the extent of the problem by presentations from the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is at an Oireachtas committee meeting.  We heard from Bord G&aacute;is that every five minutes it enters into payment plans with customers who have fallen into arrears.  We know that each month this year approximately 2,500 people have had the electricity supply to their homes disconnected.  Figures from the Commission for Energy Regulation show that gas disconnections are running at a rate of approximately 20 per day.  Disconnections are an absolute last resort when other measures have failed but while some of these figures can be accounted for through houses no longer being occupied as a result of persons leaving the country, the sheer number of disconnections is staggering.  We know that approximately 60% of gas disconnections now take place in owner-occupied housing and this is a huge change.</P>
        <P>Perhaps more worrying are the approximately 90,000 gas consumers experiencing debt difficulties.  This may in large part refer to persons who have exhausted their savings after becoming unemployed, fallen into arrears on bills and are unable to pay off their arrears and meet their <Col N="69"/>monthly outgoings at the same time.  This is the real effect of long-term unemployment and it indicates that the rate of disconnections is therefore only the tip of the iceberg of what is clearly a crisis.</P>
        <P>As my colleagues pointed out in recent days, the revised programme for Government promised a fuel poverty strategy by the end of 2009.  However, here we are almost one year on and there is still no sign of it.  How can the Government have been so negligent at a time of soaring unemployment with low-income families facing such financial pressures?  How can the Government not consider this an urgent matter?  In the intervening time we have seen the introduction of a carbon levy on home heating oil and the sanctioning of a 5% rise in ESB prices.  The carbon levy was introduced despite the failure of the Government to deliver on promises by Ministers that arrangements would be made to assist those most at risk of fuel poverty before the levy was applied.</P>
        <P>We have to consider the Government&rsquo;s priorities; we have spent more than two years debating every aspect of the banking crisis and it has consumed political life at the expense of almost all other issues.  This is not to say that the banking crisis is unimportant; it is important, but the knock-on effect of that crisis is critical.  It is precisely because of the banking crisis that we now find the country and the economy in the grip of a recession that affects everything from food on the table to payment of mortgages and the prospect of a miserable and freezing winter for many of whom we call the &ldquo;new poor&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>I find it inexcusable that an issue as important as fuel poverty, which forces people to choose between essentials like food and heat, is almost an afterthought for the Government.  Why should we have to question the Government for not delivering a strategy that was plainly needed last winter and is nowhere to be seen as we face into this winter?  Why, when the issue of fuel poverty is patently within our ability to resolve, do we have a Government which at best procrastinates on resolving the problem and at worst is remiss about it?</P>
        <P>This issue must be considered in wider terms.  In recent weeks we have seen an ESB price hike of 5%.  This increase compounds the problems we already face in this area.  However, not only does this increased cost affect those who have lost jobs or suffered wage reduction, it places additional costs on businesses and therefore affects the competitiveness of our economy, hampering efforts to start job growth.  I fail to see the logic in this approach; either the Government is serious about these issues and adopts complementary policies to address them, or it operates conflicting policies that just make the situation worse.</P>
        <P>That &euro;35 million in grant aid set aside for crucial insulation schemes in 2009 was handed back just beggars belief.  Measures to increase fuel efficiency, such as retrofitting homes with proper insulation, are absolutely necessary to tackle this issue.  As well as long-term cost savings and better home heating, they provide employment in the most ravaged sector of the economy.  Retrofitting homes is a labour-intensive job and its benefits are many, so why was this money in targeted grant aid not spent when it is clearly needed?  I have met many construction workers throughout my constituency with a variety of skills who asked me about what was being done for them.  These people want to work.  This is an area where there is a clear need for investment, but when we allocate money for such projects it is not spent.</P>
        <P>Fuel poverty is a problem throughout the country; surely it demands urgent and immediate attention.  The Labour Party has proposed measures to tackle this problem, from a national retrofit programme to return unemployed construction workers to the workforce to implementing a fuel allowance scheme to alleviate the pressures on low-income households following the introduction of the carbon tax.  These and other measures would more than offset their <Col N="70"/>costs if implemented as a coherent strategy that addresses the issue of fuel poverty while providing long-term benefits in areas of efficiency, savings and tax revenue.</P>
        <P>In the coming months, I fear we will see a much greater input from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and we must acknowledge the great work it does to support families in need, not only with regard to fuel poverty but in many other areas where there are huge demands in terms of household bills.  It is simply not good enough for the Government to sit on its hands and let the Society of St. Vincent De Paul and MABS take over its responsibility.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MartinFerrisSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Ferris</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Labour Party for providing me with an opportunity to speak this evening.  I fully support the motion.  My party has been campaigning strongly throughout the State on the issue as it is clear that fuel poverty is one of the key problems facing households.  Many in my party in the Munster area have been very active with regard to an attempt to cut off the electricity supply of an individual.  They collected more than 7,000 signatures which were handed in at the ESB office.  Recently released statistics show that at present the ESB cuts off the electricity supply of more than 900 people a month, with overall disconnections at a monthly rate of approximately 2,500.  Gas disconnections have increased to something in the region of 600 per month.</P>
        <P>My party and others have long pointed to the problem of fuel poverty here.  It has been highlighted in official studies and by various Government agencies, and from time to time Ministers have recognised the problem and promised to take measures to alleviate it.  Far from doing that, they recently facilitated an increase of 5% in the price charged to electricity consumers.  We called on the Minister to reverse the decision to impose the 5% levy but that call fell on deaf ears.</P>
        <P>I have dealt with cases, as I am sure has every other Member, where people have found themselves in financial difficulties which have caused them to fall behind in paying their electricity and gas bills, and in some cases have led to the threat or the actuality of their supply being disconnected.  I have dealt with numerous such cases, in some instances successfully but in at least two of the cases no compassion was shown.  In one instance earlier this year, a family whose daughter was doing the junior certificate was cut off a week before the examination.  This was deplorable.  It was subsequently reconnected.  Can the Minister imagine the daughter or son of anybody in the House going in to do the junior certificate without a shower or a wash in the morning as a consequence of a lack of compassion from the electricity suppliers?</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, many of us who have made representations on behalf of such people in difficulties have noted the unco-operative attitude which the ESB has adopted towards struggling families who are attempting to make arrangements to pay their bills.  Despite what the company states publicly, there seems to be a rigid attitude and a refusal in many cases to come to an agreement on repayments.  It even charges for the call out to cut people off.  That is outrageous behaviour from a State company.  It charges when it tells somebody the company is going to cut them off and then it also charges for a reconnection, adding to an already big bill that in many instances the family cannot afford to pay.  The ESB needs to begin co-operating with its customers who are struggling in the current climate and to start accepting new payment structures.  Cutting the electricity supply of families who are genuinely trying to meet their payments should not be an option.</P>
        <P>My party and others have adopted a responsible attitude to the issue and have advised that if people are in arrears they need to take positive action to address the situation.  We advise them to contact the supplier and attempt to arrange a repayment plan.  However, that is not <Col N="71"/>helped if the agencies concerned adopt the attitude which they have up until now.  The vast majority of people who fall behind in their payments do so not because they are reckless or irresponsible, but because of genuine financial problems.  They should not be treated as though they were criminals.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We have also advised that people in financial difficulties that are causing them to miss energy and other repayments should also consider contacting the Money Advice and Budgeting Service which has trained staff who can advise them on this and other financial problems.  Local representatives have made themselves available to accompany people to meetings with the ESB, Bord G&aacute;is and other energy suppliers to discuss arrears and repayments.  However, I reiterate that this is made more difficult if the companies themselves refuse to meet their customers half way.  That is why we have also called on the Minister to arrange a meeting with the relevant staff in the management of the energy companies and to impress upon them the need to act in a more socially responsible manner given the pressures in which hundreds of thousands of households around the State currently find themselves.  The fact that there is a State involvement in supply ought to mean that the companies concerned act in that manner without having to be reminded.</P>
        <P>The suppliers may argue that they themselves are facing financial pressures but that is to overlook the reasons energy supply was placed under State control in the first instance.  It was because there were no private entrepreneurs interested at the time that the ESB was established because they did not think they could make enough profit out of supplying electricity or gas, yet the then Government correctly judged that there were factors more important than profit.  Unfortunately, that attitude seems to have been lost along the way even to the extent that successful State companies, which would never have gotten off the ground or survived without State investment and which were of no interest to speculative capital in this State, are now proposed for sale or have already been sold off to speculators.</P>
        <P>The impact of the increases for domestic consumers has been particularly severe in many instances.  The most recent report I can recall on fuel poverty was by the Institute of Public Health, which conducted and published a study in 2007.  Even then, it found that fuel poverty in this country was at an unacceptably high level by international standards and in that regard it was supported by the World Health Organisation, which stated that it was shocked by the fact that 17% of households in this State were experiencing fuel poverty &mdash; a huge indictment of how the State looks after those most in need.  That already bad situation has been exacerbated by subsequent price increases and the overall economic situation, which has led to hundreds of thousands joining the dole queues.  Many people who are working have experienced cuts to their wages and living standards and are also finding it hard to make ends meet.  No doubt the percentage of households in fuel poverty now is much higher than 17%.</P>
        <P>Families on marginal incomes, and particularly the elderly, are the most affected, sometimes to the extent of having to go into further debt in order to heat their homes, and it is estimated that there are approximately 3,000 excess deaths per annum in the island of Ireland due to deficiencies in households being able to meet their energy needs.  The most alarming aspect of studies on fuel poverty here is that rates of fuel poverty were increasing even over the years of highest economic growth and that the level of household income below which families were finding it hard to meet their energy needs was also rising.  It is hard to comprehend that with the economic growth during the so-called Celtic tiger, more and more people were finding it difficult to meet their household&rsquo;s energy needs.  It reflects the inequalities in society where those on low income and surviving on welfare are finding it more and more difficult to meet <Col N="72"/>their energy needs.  As the motion points out, the majority of homes where gas is being disconnected are owner occupied.</P>
        <P>It is clear then that it is not a problem exclusively, or even mainly, associated with people on social welfare.  The fact that the income threshold at which people find it difficult to pay their energy bills has risen is also an indication that energy prices and the relative proportion of household income required to meet their needs has been rising at a faster rate than most other essentials.  In the current economic situation, that is a recipe for social disaster and a similar study on fuel poverty to that conducted in 2007 would undoubtedly make much grimmer reading.</P>
        <P>My party has also proposed measures similar to those in this motion.  We have pointed to the need for a fuel poverty strategy and to the failure to implement to date the Government promise to create such a strategy.  I also called here, when we were debating the carbon tax, for such funds that accrued from the tax to the Revenue to be devoted to the energy sector and to combating fuel poverty.  As I stated at the time, the carbon tax was simply another excuse to impose extra taxation.  It is ironic that the Green Party, which made energy such a central plank of its policies when in Opposition, ought to have co-operated in such a cynical move.  It would be expected that reducing energy wastage might be a priority for the Green Party also and there are economically beneficial ways of accomplishing that.  That would not only reduce the amount of energy lost, and reduce costs and bills, but would also create employment.</P>
        <P>The motion refers to a public programme to refit public buildings in order to make them more energy efficient.  My party has also called for a similar programme, not only for public buildings but also to ensure that domestic homes are likewise made more energy efficient and in that way help to reduce household bills as well as creating much needed employment in construction and other sectors.  In the current economic climate it seems a realistic way to go because we need to create employment and get as many people back to work so that we can reduce fuel poverty.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, in this area as in others, the Government has displayed little imagination and is wedded to a programme of cuts in public provision and expenditure allied to further impositions on ordinary people.  It is little wonder that such an attitude is shared by the management in the energy suppliers, with official encouragement.</P>
        <P>I support this motion and call on the Government to take on board what is being said here and recognise the serious situation facing many households in the State at present.</P>

        <P FLI="0" el="5">I propose the Government amendment to the Labour Party motion while recognising that this is an issue very much worthy of debate.  I commend Deputy McManus on raising it because, as I have said previously, this is a crucial issue in energy policy for us to get right, to consider and reconsider.  I will set out some of the programmes and projects in place and ones we need to introduce to supplement what we are doing in this area.  I will respond to some of the issues <Col N="75"/>raised in Deputy McManus&rsquo;s contribution and the contributions of other speakers and well as setting out some of the measures the Government has taken.</P>
        <P>I wish to refer to a useful meeting of the Oireachtas committee on the issue of disconnections, which is a matter of concern.  That meeting continued for four and a half hours and I followed parts of the debate on monitor.  It was a useful exercise to bring in the energy companies to account for what they are doing, to bring in the regulator to get the commission to reconsider the policies in regard to disconnections, which we all agree must only be the last resort.  What emerged from that meeting is that this is a complicated issue and it is important to reflect on how we can get this right to minimise the social disruption caused to people by being disconnection and to ensure we do not have a hugely expensive system that would impose a significant cost on customers.  That meeting was useful.  I look forward to the energy regulator returning with the commission&rsquo;s review of the disconnections policy in that regard and to ascertain if there are further measures that can be introduced to make the policy fairer and more effective.</P>

        <P>A measure that has been put forward and which is coming on stream is the allocation of pre-payment meters.  This is one of the immediate measures that can be put in place.  In regard to gas pre-paid metering, the CER has already revised the definition of &ldquo;financial hardship conditions&rdquo;, which has made it easier for people to get such pre-paid meters.  Since December 2008, some 1,500 gas meters have been installed on the grounds of financial hardship.  We all acknowledge that this is a serious issue for many people.  Such metering is one element which may assist people in danger of experiencing fuel poverty to ensure they will not suffer a disconnection.</P>
        <P>Returning to that meeting of the Oireachtas committee, having listened to what people involved in this area said, one of the key points is that we need to get people to contact their suppliers.  They should not ignore the problem, it is better for them to get engaged.  While I take on board what Deputy Ferris said about the Government&rsquo;s over-reliance on the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, or other bodies, those bodies are working effectively, they have public contact and have gained public trust.  It would be wrong for us to send out any message other than that people should contact their supplier and they should contact MABS.  A crucial first step in any good code of practice is to set out a repayment plan to acknowledge the issue and to seek flexibility, which, I believe, will be given by utilities in advance of any disconnection.  That is the best and most important measure that we can encourage and support to avoid traumatic cases where disconnections occur.</P>
        <P>There exists a code of practice which requires that customers must be given a seven-day notice of disconnection in advance.  It is right that no elderly customer would be disconnected in the middle of winter or that no person with a medical condition who relies on medical equipment would have such equipment shut off or his or her electricity disconnected.  It is right that the regulator is considering if we need to go further than that.</P>
        <P>When electricity and energy prices spiked in 2008, an interdepartmental committee was set up, the membership of which comprised officials from all the relevant Departments who have an interest in this area, including the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, my Department, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Social Protection and other outside bodies.  That committee examined the various measures being taken and if it was necessary to make immediate changes to them.  I will give some details of those measures, which are not insignificant.</P>
        <P>Some 380,000 customers are recipients of the household benefits package.  Under this package a standing charge for electricity is paid and 2,400 free units of electricity per annum are <Col N="76"/>given to those in receipt of it.  In the case of gas customers who are recipients of this package, a gas allowance of a subsidy of &euro;52 is provided in terms of a customer&rsquo;s gas bill every two months or a subsidy of &euro;111 is given over winter months.  This package of &euro;200 million from the State, recognises that fuel poverty is an issue.  It is not insignificant.  It is a significantly larger scale package than the equivalent measures in the UK.  Certain measures have been put in place, which recognise that fuel poverty is an issue of concern.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In addition to that, the fuel allowance scheme was increased in light of those higher oil prices, recognising that there was an increasing issue of energy poverty with the higher spike in oil prices two or three years ago, to a provision of &euro;20 per week for 32 weeks.  That was an increase in both the rate and the length of time in respect of which the fuel allowance measure applied.  This year, we are expecting that to have a cost of some &euro;231 million on top of the &euro;200 million that is allocated under the household benefits package.  Therefore, there are significant payments by the State to cover the valid issue of fuel poverty.</P>
        <P>Critically, I believe we would all agree that one of the best measures to protect people from fuel poverty is not only to provide an ongoing allowance to cover the fuel cost but to improve the building to ensure that the demand for such fuel is decreased.  That is a far better investment by the State and far better protection for people experiencing fuel poverty than concentrating on household benefits or fuel allowance packages.  As important as those benefits and payments are, it is far better to cut off the need for people on lower income to spend more money on fuel to heat their homes.</P>
        <P Just="Left">That is the reason I am proud, at a time when energy prices were rising, that we increased the provision for the warmer homes scheme.  When it was introduced in 2008 approximately &euro;2.5 million was being spent on it.  This year, the best part of &euro;30 million will be spent on it and the works will be carried out to more than 22,500 houses and up to 25,000 houses by the end of this year.  This scheme targets those people on lowest income &mdash; those in receipt of fuel allowance, disability benefit or invalidity benefit.  I have been in many houses where people have said their house has been transformed, it is a warm house and they do not have to turn on the heating as much because the heat is retained as a result attic insulation, wall insulation or other measures that have been put in place.  That scheme is working.  It has had a huge effect in terms of helping tens of thousands of households threatened by fuel poverty.  I am pleased that we have been able to extend it to the extent we have done so.</P>
        <P>I am told that this year the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will spend approximately &euro;40 million in a similar retrofitting scheme to benefit people living in social housing.  Under this scheme the local authority can claim 90% of the capital cost &mdash; up to &euro;15,000 &mdash; if a building is improved beyond a C1 rating, or if that is not possible, for technical reasons, in the case of the building, a 50% grant allocation is being made available to a local authority up to a total of &euro;15,000.</P>
        <P>I would say in response to Deputy McManus that there is an ongoing clear commitment on the part of the Government that when it comes to energy efficiency retrofit measures we target and allocate to those on lower incomes and in social housing.  That &euro;70 million budget this year will be spent and targeted, although we will not know the detail until the end of the year, as these things are often staged.  I have been told by both Departments that they are confident we will spend roughly that amount.  That targets specifically those in receipt of fuel allowance or those living in social housing.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We need to go further.  While it has taken longer than we expected, my Department has been working on a myriad of measures on which we have to work.  We have been working on <Col N="77"/>the alternative fuel energy strategy &mdash; the affordable energy strategy.  Having gone out to public consultation earlier this year, we will be able shortly to produce our report in that regard.  Critically, it sets out to do what Deputy McManus seeks, namely, to identify the most at risk categories.  We engaged consultants specifically to take account of demographics and household patterns to identify the worst cases, that is, those who are most vulnerable to fuel poverty.  We must target these extreme cases given the health effects that arise from what is a life and death issue.  It is appropriate, therefore, that we do research and statistical analysis to allow us to target these households and change our schemes to respond to extreme cases.</P>
        <P>This is not only a matter of correlating household formation but also of correlating the type of dwelling because there is a clear correlation between the age of a dwelling and the performance of the building.  It is this correlation of household characteristics data analysis and building analysis of age and type of building which will allow us to start targeting our measures on particular housing sectors.</P>
        <P>Deputy McManus cited a recent report done on the home energy savings scheme.  The scheme is working well and is receiving approximately 1,300 applications per week.  While I accept the scheme&rsquo;s budget was not fully spent last year, this was largely because it is a demand-led scheme.  It took time to get the scheme up and running and achieve the level of public response we expected.</P>
        <P>Some statistics concerning the home energy savings scheme bear repeating.  Of those who engaged work under the scheme, 98% would recommend to their neighbours that they do the same work.  This is not an insignificant percentage.  The research also indicated that 90% of respondents would approve the contractor who undertook the work.  While I would prefer an approval rate of 98%, I anticipate that in any survey of any category of work done on homes, a 90% approval rate is not a bad result.</P>
        <P>From speaking to officials from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, I understand the housing characteristic of the households involved in the home energy savings scheme is very much the standard, typical Irish house.  If I recall correctly, the survey found that the average household income of these households was approximately &euro;50,000.  I understand the number of people surveyed was 10,000, although I stand to be corrected.  Scheme participants belong to what would be described as middle Ireland and many of them would be in a certain amount of difficulty with debt, whether because one partner has become unemployed or the value of the mortgage may be higher than the value of the house.  The scheme has been of real benefit to tens of thousands of people this year and last year and will continue to benefit others next year.</P>
        <P>Deputies McManus and Ferris argued that we should introduce a national retrofit scheme.  The Deputies will be aware that the Department is engaged in precisely such a project.  Our new, national retrofit programme has been out for consultation.  The programme is designed to bring together and co-ordinate in a more efficient manner the various schemes in place.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the success of current schemes, we need to adapt and improve them in a number of ways.  First, we need to place on all utility companies supplying energy to the home, whether gas or electricity, an obligation to have their customers make energy savings.  When one analyses different international projects and policies, they all show that this is the correct approach.  We will then tailor the obligation scheme to meet some of our social and affordable energy objectives as well as our energy policy objectives.  Funding will remain available in difficult budgetary circumstances because this form of investment makes more sense than any other investment.  We will be able to target low income households at risk of fuel poverty with <Col N="78"/>support funding from the State.  This would be provided to the supplier &mdash; the person doing the work &mdash; to ensure the work is done at the least cost and in the most effective and efficient manner.</P>
        <P>The evolution of our various schemes towards one which is driven by a range of energy companies uses a variety of energy service company models to secure real efficiency and technological innovation in the way work is done.  This is the right way to go.  This evolution from existing schemes to one which imposes obligations on energy service companies and utilities will take time and will result in a better system.  Crucially, it will allow us to start introducing some pay-as-one-saves elements which will help fund some of the capital costs involved.  This approach entails providing a loan up front to be paid off subsequently over a five to ten-year period using the savings made by the householder.  The annual saving from the home energy saving scheme is estimated to be &euro;750.  This approach overcomes the capital cost obstacle to doing work of this nature.</P>
        <P>We are moving towards a retrofit scheme and the Department is committed to evolving the current model, not only for domestic buildings but also for public and commercial buildings.  These offer significant economic opportunities to make savings and reduce our current budgets while creating construction jobs which are badly needed at this time.  It will take some time to get right the financial mechanisms and utility obligation.  Once the mechanics are working effectively, however, we can ramp up the scheme to a massive size.  It makes economic sense to do so.</P>
        <P>We have commenced this process.  This year, for instance, we provided funding for approximately 45 projects in public and commercial buildings.  The nearest example that comes to mind is the Mansion House, with which Deputy Catherine Byrne is familiar.  The Department has committed to a whole energy plan for the building that will deliver energy savings.  We need to do this type of work on a range of public buildings and the Department is supporting many such projects this year with a &euro;9 million budget.  Over their lifetime, the projects will deliver savings of &euro;70 million.  These types of investments make economic sense.</P>
        <P>As we are only at the starting point.  We still have a major challenge ahead if we are to achieve our commitment to a 33% improvement in energy efficiency in the public sector.  It will take time to ramp up the scale of the response required to achieve this objective.  Crucially, we are doing it right, as has been confirmed to me during visits to the United States and United Kingdom where schemes similar to the new retrofit scheme we are on the point of launching are being considered.  We have done a detailed, lengthy and thorough consultation exercise which builds on the experience of recent years in operating other schemes.</P>
        <P>The increase in electricity prices arising from the introduction of the public service obligation, PSO, levy at the start of this month, as announced in early August, has been understandably controversial.  The levy was, however, prescribed in legislation.  By 1 August, the energy regulator had to have considered and introduced the levy.  It was not new, therefore, but a requirement under legislation.</P>

      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>The price increase is not the regulator&rsquo;s fault.  The Minister can change the legislation, which was passed by the Oireachtas with his support.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>PSO levies are introduced for a reason.</P>
      
        <P>I will go into the details and then will ask questions of Deputy Varadkar to which he may be able to respond during his own contribution.  As for the purpose, first and primarily&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand how PSOs work.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Allow me to frame the questions for the Deputy.  The PSO levy this year was approximately &euro;156 million, approximately &euro;90 million of which was accounted for by the peat-fired power stations, some brought over from the previous year but most from this year.  In my announcement I stated that I wished to examine this issue to ascertain whether this could be reduced, which would be appropriate.  However, I understand that Deputy Varadkar&rsquo;s party now appears to suggest that the PSO should be ended or stopped.  A motion to that effect was tabled in the Seanad last week by the Fine Gael Senators.  Deputy Varadkar should check with all the Deputies on his side as to whether they are comfortable with or support such a position.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>I believe the motion called for a postponment pending a review, rather than to stop it, which is quite a different thing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We will let the Minister make his contribution.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I look forward to hearing Deputy Charles Flanagan&rsquo;s response in this regard because a postponement along the lines suggested by Deputy Varadkar would have the effect of shutting the peat-fired power plants, as well as the associated harvesting arrangements.  That is what would happen.</P>
        <P>Similarly, the second reason for the PSO is that the best way to protect our people from price rises is to switch to renewable energy.  We have the cheapest available onshore wind in particular, to which we now can turn as the greatest protection from higher future fuel prices arising from volatility in gas or other fossil fuel import prices.  Moreover, it is bringing down the price of electricity today.  Every time the wind blows, it switches off the expensive&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>It is true.  Moreover, were the Deputy to talk to people within the industry&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>I do.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;about the reality of the market or were he to watch the market price, which now is transparent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer to the reality of the numbers.  Bringing down the price does not need a subsidy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;Deputy Varadkar would see that when the wind blows, it brings down the market price of electricity.  The reason I am surprised at the Deputy&rsquo;s position is that over the past four to five years, such has been the benefit of Ireland&rsquo;s switching to wind that it has derived more than &euro;250 million in a subsidy from wind that has helped to avoid having a <Col N="80"/>higher PSO in the peat-fired power plans and elsewhere.  Wind has subsidised our system and is the best protection and the best way to bring down prices in Ireland.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>That was the case but no longer is true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Commission for Energy Regulation has carried out a detailed analysis to the effect that, from memory, were we to meet the 40% target of wind by 2020, it would result in a reduction in prices of approximately 10% to 15% from what otherwise would have been the case given what is expected regarding gas prices.  Deputy Varadkar appears to have very little support in his own position for the renewable wind industry.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>On what does the Minister base that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy&rsquo;s proposal to postpone&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>We have not published any proposals.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Fine Gael has stated in its press releases, which accords with the position of its Senators, that the PSO in respect of wind should be postponed.  I assure the Deputy that the effect of so doing would be to kill immediately investment in the wind industry in Ireland.  This would have huge consequences in terms of job losses, higher energy prices and, for the second time in a number of years, would create uncertainty in the financial markets that would kill a renewables industry that we are mandated to deliver and in which we have comparative competitive advantage.  Fine Gael&rsquo;s suggested postponement of a PSO in support of such a wind industry would have a devastating effect on the development of renewables in Ireland.  I ask the Deputy to reconsider his position and to support the Government&rsquo;s position of supporting the renewable industry because the Deputy&rsquo;s proposals would kill it.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The actual outgoing to the wind sector is closer to approximately &euro;40 million this year.  However, even taking this into account, the effect of wind power within our system on a continuous basis is to help keep down the market prices.  Such support measures are in place in every other European country in which wind or any other renewables are being developed as alternative supply sources and are recognised to be the correct policy approach.  I cannot understand the reason Deputy Varadkar has changed Fine Gael policy to be against such an approach in a manner that is so threatening to Ireland&rsquo;s energy industry and the future lower prices that customers need.</P>

	<P>Please.  Minister, through the Chair.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Through the Chair, Deputy Varadkar&rsquo;s proposal to postpone PSO support levies would be hugely damaging to the wind industry in Ireland and would have huge consequences in terms of higher electricity prices in the long term for Irish consumers.  I am simply debating the proposals he has put in the public domain.  This is not fantasy but is reality.  It is the reality of an energy policy of which one should be extremely wary because it could have huge consequences to the people, were it put into effect.  I am glad the Government will not do so.</P>
        <P>I will continue by reverting to the issue concerning prices because it is a subject about which Members must be clear.  First, arising from that debate, a range of different statistics were produced regarding the present position on prices.  This is difficult because there is a range of different categories.  For example, were one to compare the price of a holiday home in Ireland with an ordinary home&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>I will if I have time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I am afraid that only three and a half minutes remain.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="82"/>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>I asked a specific question on whether the Minister would intervene with the regulator to induce the latter to end its crazy proposal which insists that the big utility companies must change their brand names?  As Members are running out of time, I would be grateful were the Minister to respond.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I respect the independence of the regulator.  However, I will, as I do on an ongoing basis, discuss that issue, among others, to ensure there is a common sense solution that does not cost the Irish consumer.  In a variation on this subject, I understand that any such cost of a brand change would not go through to the regulated cost base.  Although it would come from the company&rsquo;s cost base, it would not be put onto the prices.  This is one variation on what I heard during Deputy McManus&rsquo;s contribution.  However, I will continue to discuss this matter with the regulator, while recognising its independence, because a properly-regulated market also brings down prices.  We have seen this work as competition now exists whereby five or six electricity companies of real scale are bidding to win consumers.  Our households can switch tomorrow following a two-minute telephone call and can achieve savings in their bills of between 10% and 14%.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LizMcManus"><NameTxt>Deputy Liz McManus</NameTxt>
	<P>Why get rid of the brand names?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>This comes from having a regulated market and from giving the regulator the freedom to pursue competition.  On the back of this initiative, the average Irish household, that is, the category that encompasses approximately half of all Irish households, now pays approximately 2% below the eurozone average.  Deputy Varadkar should note that these are the EUROSTAT statistics.</P>

        <P>I agree with Deputy Varadkar that no one wants a price increase and that everyone would prefer not to have a PSO levy.  However, if the Deputy consequently wishes to kill the renewables industry in this country, that would be a terrible policy mistake.</P>

On the one hand, Deputy Kenny talks about building up a massive new energy project and being able to raise finance, while on the other hand, Deputy Varadkar states that he wishes to put a stop to the support measures that are an essential prerequisite to that industry getting off the ground.  That is a circle Deputy Varadkar cannot square.  Alternatively, perhaps Deputy Kenny is not being accurate about Fine Gael policy when he states he has this ambition, while Deputy Varadkar has a different ambition.</P>

We intend to work with the energy regulator on any review that comes out of the work done in the Oireachtas committee in terms of disconnections.  The Government will continue the policy approach it has been taking &mdash; which is the correct one &mdash; in order to reduce energy prices.  We have taken some &euro;500 million from the ESB to bring people&rsquo;s bills down.  Developing renewables will also reduce prices.

      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>I despair of the Minister.  For somebody who preaches about consensus and everybody working together to agree a budgetary strategy, he is showing a great contempt for the Opposition and a great ability to misrepresent other people&rsquo;s positions and make assumptions based on attitudes that are not correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no contempt, I am presenting the facts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>It shows how phoney the Green Party is that it demands consensus in regard to difficult decisions but in the case of other policy issues, it just wants to slag people off.  It is very disappointing.</P>
        <P>I thank Deputy McManus and the Labour Party for bringing forward this important motion, which we support.  I propose to address three issues.  First, I will refer to the truth about energy prices, which the Minister did not do.  Second, I will address the motion before us and, third, I will address ways in which we can reduce energy prices.  I am interested in the Minister&rsquo;s considered view on these matters rather than nonsensical contributions.</P>
        <P>The Minister&rsquo;s claim that energy prices in this State are 3% lower than the European Union average is incorrect.  The chairman of the Commission for Energy Regulation presented the relevant statistics at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources some weeks ago, a meeting which the Minister did not attend.  The data he presented clearly show that since the Minister assumed office, domestic energy prices in total have increased by 6%.  When I asked the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, what his Department has done in terms of studying these matters, that Department, through Forf&aacute;s, indicated that the most recent statistics show that average energy prices for high users in Ireland are 5% higher than the average for the euro area.  For SMEs, the most recent data show the gap is 15%.  The situation has improved in this regard but remains unsatisfactory.  All these figures are from the Forf&aacute;s report.</P>
        <P>Data from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland show that business electricity prices range from 97% of the eurozone average for very small users &mdash; those using less than 20 MW &mdash; to figures of 112%, 111%, 102%, 104% or 103% higher for categories above that.  These figures do not take into account the most recent increase.  In the case of domestic users, for those who use the least &mdash; less than 1,000 kilowatt hours &mdash; the price is 58% higher than for the eurozone average; 12% higher for the next group; 7% higher for the next; and for the next group &mdash; DD, which is the most common &mdash; prices are 98% higher.  Again, these figures do not include the increase in the PSO levy.</P>
        <P>These are the statistics from the Minister&rsquo;s own Department, but he just makes up whatever he wants to believe because he is basically a fantasist.  It is time the Government came clean and admitted to what everybody, including EUROSTAT, Forf&aacute;s, the SEAI,  the National Competitiveness Council, and every single business and consumer organisation in the country, knows &mdash; that Irish energy prices are higher than elsewhere in Europe.  One can argue about the degree to which they are higher and the different ways of calculating costs, but there is no escaping the reality that, in the main, they are higher.  The dogs on the street know it.  The Minister&rsquo;s own Department and agencies know it.  He should stop pretending and be honest about it.  It was not the case in the past but it is certainly the case now that energy prices in Ireland are higher.  That means there is something wrong with the policies we are putting forward.</P><Col N="85"/>
        <P Just="Left">I strongly support the motion before us.  Deputy McManus is absolutely right in pushing for a fuel poverty strategy, which the Government promised to publish but did not.  I have not read the Labour Party Bill on fuel poverty and energy conservation but I intend to do so.  On the question of rebranding the CER, I have a mixed view.  I would like to see where the European law stands on that because there are differing views on it and I have not yet received an independent opinion.  However, I have spoken to the ESB and Bord G&aacute;is about it.  While the ESB did not initially want to proceed with rebranding, it is now happy enough to go along with it at a cost, it predicts, of between &euro;5 million and &euro;8 million.  This is money it would have spent anyway in re-advertising and trying to gain back some of the market share it has lost.  For the ESB, rebranding the customer supply business is mostly about changing paper and advertising, which is why it estimates its costs will be much lower than those of Bord G&aacute;is.  I am not sure whether it is a case that the ESB is talking it down and Bord G&aacute;is is talking it up.  We must ascertain what the European law is in this regard.  If it must be done, then it must be done.</P>
        <P>I strongly endorse the position put forward by Deputy McManus in regard to the national retrofit programme both for public buildings and other forms of housing.  It is a no brainer.  We are all committed to reducing carbon emissions, and the retrofit and energy efficiency measures make perfect sense.  They are the most cost-effective measures and they definitely work.  We should be prioritising them rather than more expensive proposals, some of which have been put forward by the Minister in regard to certain refits.  Certainly we should not proceed in regard to onshore wind.</P>
        <P>My only criticism of the motion is that while it addresses many of the consequences of high energy prices in terms of how they impact on individuals and families, it does not address the underlying issue of how we can bring them down.  There are ways to do so.  For example, we can open more of the market to competition.  There is no reason that the dual fuel market, where one has Airtricity and Bord G&aacute;is both supplying gas and electricity, cannot be opened up to competition immediately.  Why can the Minister not tell us for certain that the Government will open the domestic market to competition?</P>
        <P>We currently fund our capital expenditure through transmission charges.  In other words, we put money on people&rsquo;s energy bills to fund capital investment.  An alternative system is that set out in the NewERA model where we would sell some of our non-essential semi-State assets and use that money to re-invest in the energy system, to pay for smart meters, establish a smart grid, build 1,000 MW of plant and have onshore wind power clustered in the right locations and connected cheaply to the grid.  All this could be done  without any need for high transmission charges that drive up costs and without any need for subsidies.  That is the difference under Fine Gael&rsquo;s NewERA model.  We want to use State investment, not high prices and high subsidies, to drive the industry.  The Minister is using the old fashioned model which facilitated the property bubble.  He is repeating all the mistakes of the property boom.</P>
        <P>Another issue to look at is reducing capacity payments.  This year alone generators will receive &euro;551 million just for being there, even if they produce no power.  We must consider whether it is necessary at a time when we now have surplus generating capacity to pay power generators more than &euro;500 million per year even if they never turn on the power station.</P>
        <P>In regard to the PSO, I am sorry that the Minister who is so keen on consensus and likes to pretend to be interested in the consensual green model is so keen to blackguard and misrepresent the policies of others.  The peat aspect of the PSO levy should be reviewed and phased out over time.  That is the position Deputy Coveney advocated in the past and we have not <Col N="86"/>departed from that.  Obviously, if that is done one must reinvest in the midlands and ensure there is not a net loss of jobs.  There are different ways of doing that.</P>
        <P>I am very enthusiastic about onshore wind energy.  Even though the subsidy increases prices, it is necessary to drive investment in the industry.  In time, as gas prices rise, it will make energy cheaper.  It does not do so now but it will in future.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>A brief one.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy not agree that stopping the refits for the support price mechanism would have damaging consequences for the financing of onshore wind projects?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>I do, but that is not our position.  We are proposing to defer the increase and in the meantime, if needs be, to take that money out of the massive profits of the utility companies.  The Minister needs to review aspects of the PSO levy.  Under the old system, when the price of energy was high, the owners of wind power plants had to pay something back into the fund, but that is no longer the case.  When the price is high, not only do they receive the guaranteed price, but they also get a bumper payment.  If somebody is getting a guaranteed price that protects them when prices fall, they should pay something into the fund, as they used to do, when prices go up.  That would help to reduce the PSO levy.</P>
        <P>We need to have a serious debate on this, perhaps somewhere outside the Chamber where we can be more consensual.  We must look at the types of refit subsidies the Minister is proposing to put in place for offshore wind and other renewables.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I look forward to taking the Deputy up on that offer, and I hope Deputy McManus will join us.  It would be useful in order to achieve clarity.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be.  It is a debate we have had at committee, which the Minister does not attend.  The Joint Committees on Climate Change and Energy Security and on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources have debated the matter of super-subsidies, such as those of 14 cent and 27 cent per kilowatt hour which are twice the market price of energy, and whether such subsidies make sense.  Can we be so sure gas prices will go so high so quickly that such subsidies make economic sense?  Many people think they do not.  For example, Bord G&aacute;is is deliberately not going down that route because it does not think it makes economic sense.  Many of the Minister&rsquo;s officials and people who work for other bodies say they do not agree with Government policy when it comes to super-subsidies.  On-shore wind generators clustered in the right place and connected cheaply to the grid, particularly in the west, north-west and south-west of Ireland, make a great deal of sense and that is what we should pursue.  We should do more or less what the Minister is doing in the communications area where he is taking a technology neutral approach and not giving extra-super-bumper-subsidies to the least efficient plant.  That does not make sense. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>I look forward to that lengthy debate in committee or elsewhere.  We could benefit from a very long and extensive debate on the whole issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>We should have that debate.  I hope the Minister, having said that, now has a slightly more advanced understanding of Fine Gael thinking on this.  We understand the issues.  We have studied them in detail.  We are not total idiots.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="87"/>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>My understanding of the difference between deferring and stopping has not changed.  I look forward to a more lengthy debate when the Member opposite can explain that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="LeoVaradkar"><NameTxt>Deputy Leo Varadkar</NameTxt>
	<P>When the Minister comes to that debate I hope he will bring his figures and his calculators.  I am not anti-ideology.  I am interested in political idealism and ideology but there is nothing worse than having an ideology and ignoring the numbers.  Whatever ideological or philosophical position one has must make economic sense.  The numbers must add up.  Some of what the Minister is doing on the renewable side makes a great deal of sense.  Some of it really does not.  It could cost us a fortune while gaining nothing for the public other than higher energy prices and pylons on people&rsquo;s property.  We need to think very seriously about that.</P>
        <P>We must also address the profits of semi-State companies.  I have nothing against companies making profits but the ESB, in the current climate when other companies are struggling, does not need to make a profit of &euro;500 million a year or Bord G&aacute;is to make a profit of &euro;200 million a year.  The public object to energy price increases because of the huge profits made by energy companies while everyone else is being squeezed.  The Government could have taken from their profits, as it has done for the big energy users.  The Government took the profits away from the companies to subsidise the big energy users but would not take the profits away from those companies to defer the PSO levy.  That shows how the Green Party have been taken over by the Fianna F&aacute;il big business agenda against the interests of small business and ordinary people.  Those profits are not justified.  The Minister should give a direction to the Energy Regulator that if companies are making profits of that size they are clearly not being put under enough pressure to reduce either their costs or their profits.</P>
        <P>There are ways to reduce energy prices if the Minister wanted to.  I do not think he does want to, because if energy prices do not keep rising many of his green gambles will not pay off.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue.  I thank the Labour Party for bringing this matter to the House and I thank Deputy Leo Varadkar for sharing his time with me.</P>
        <P>For most people, fuel is the basic fundamental need.  We all need it to keep warm, cook, heat water and travel.  It is not a luxury.  However, fuel poverty is a real threat for many people.  The steady rise in the price of gas and electricity in recent years has put a huge financial burden on many low-income households, and the elderly in particular.  This has resulted in many people not being able to pay their bills and struggling just to keep warm on a daily basis.</P>
        <P>The Government continues to increase taxes in the form of a carbon tax on oil and gas, which came into force last May, and the recent introduction of the PSO levy on electricity from 1 October.  Fuel poverty exists when a household needs to spend more than 10% of its household income on energy or fuel to keep acceptable levels of heat throughout the home.  The new carbon tax has brought a rise in electricity prices and the new green levy has put an extra burden on many elderly people, people with disabilities and the most vulnerable families in our communities, while the Government should be focusing on energy efficiency programmes.  The cost of gas, electricity and, particularly, solid fuel increased hugely between 2008 and July  2010.  The cost of solid fuel increased by almost 10% while the cost of bottled gas rose by 17.8% and electricity rose by 3.3%.</P>
        <P>This is not sustainable and is pushing many families over the poverty threshold.  Recent reports of people&rsquo;s electricity being cut off because they could not pay their bills are truly <Col N="88"/>shocking.  Many people are vulnerable at present and the current figure of more than 2,000 households being disconnected for non-payment every month is not acceptable.  More and more people are relying heavily on the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to top them up each week so they can manage to pay their home heating bills and keep food on the table.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul does a great job and it can do it because of the many charitable people who extend a hand to the society in donations.  This cannot continue forever and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul should not have to clean up the mess made by the Government.</P>
        <P>The Department of Social Protection pays a fuel allowance of &euro;20 per week from September to April.  While this is welcome, it only covers a small proportion of a fuel bill and is more of a gesture than a genuine commitment by the Government to help people meet their fuel costs.</P>
        <P>The new carbon tax that was introduced this year has increased the price of a bale of briquettes by 10%, a kilowatt hour of gas by 7% and 1,000 litres of fuel oil by 8%.  In other words, it will add approximately &euro;43 to a 1,000 litre fill of oil and &euro;41 to the average annual gas bill.  How on earth can people be expected to afford these extra costs when so many are struggling financially, which is not their fault?</P>
        <P>When the Government announced that it planned to introduce carbon tax it stated that it would protect those most at risk of fuel poverty.  I would like to know how this is this being achieved, because those I have spoken to feel the pinch and they do not feel they have been protected by the Government or by the State.  Many organisations, such as Age Action, Older and Bolder, The Carers Association, the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Alone, MABS and many others, called on the Government not to introduce the PSO levy on electricity.  This will mean an increase of almost 5%, or an extra &euro;2.73 on a monthly ESB bill.  This charge came into effect despite the financial hardship the Government has caused.  I welcome the announcement by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, that he has decided to increase the electricity allowance provided by his Department to cover the PSO levy.  This will come as a welcome relief to older citizens, who are very worried about making ends meet.  However, this is like robbing Peter to pay Paul, as the money needed to increase the electricity allowance has to come from the Government purse.  The question remains, will the new levy generate enough income to justify all the worry and confusion caused by the Government?</P>
        <P>Fuel poverty is a very real worry for older people because they are more fuel dependent than any other group in our society.  On a daily basis, and particularly on a nightly basis, I meet many older people in their homes and bed-sits who are unable to turn on the electric fire because they are afraid of the cost.  Many elderly people rely on a small fixed income and spend a high proportion of it on fuel and energy.  They have budgeted every penny for their basic needs.  Even a &euro;3 increase in their monthly bill might as well be an increase of &euro;200 or &euro;300.  Rising fuel costs have a devastating impact on older people and they simply cannot afford for the price to get any higher.</P>
        <P>Many older people spend more time at home and need to be kept warm, especially if they are vulnerable and unwell.  Many live in old properties without proper central heating or insulation and many rely on electric heaters, which cost a fortune to run.  I am also concerned about elderly people living in flat complexes.  I am familiar with senior citizens&rsquo; complexes run by local authorities where the heating is controlled from 7 a.m. until 11 p.m.  This is not acceptable, particularly when many elderly people wake up during the night and tend to walk around in the cold because they are afraid to turn on their heaters.    Ireland experiences a high rate of winter deaths compared to other cold European countries.  Between 1,500 and 2,000 deaths <Col N="89"/>occur each year.  Last winter was one of the harshest on record and this year appears to be going in a similar direction.</P>
        <P>The health and well-being of our citizens, young and old, must be safeguarded but this can only be achieved once fuel poverty is eradicated.  The Government must wake up to the crisis of fuel poverty among the low paid and the elderly and do all it can to ensure people are not forced to choose between heat and putting food on the table.  Is the Government really intent on sending us back to the dark ages of candlelit rooms and our fathers&rsquo; overcoats on our beds?  I commend the motion to the House.</P>

	<P>I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise an issue vital to the future of the children of Kinsale.  On behalf of the 762 pupils on the roll of Kinsale community school, I ask the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills the timetable for the completion of the proposed extension for their school.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The school&rsquo;s existing building was designed for 460 pupils and completed in 1996.  From the day it opened, it accommodated more than 500 pupils and the school management had to convert the stage into an art room and the art room into a woodwork room.  The school is now short of classrooms for biology, woodwork, metalwork, art, music, technical drawing and graphics.  It also requires a gym.</P>
        <P>There are no canteen facilities to cater for its current enrolment of 762 pupils.  Kinsale is regarded as the gourmet capital of Ireland and this sector offers good employment prospects in the local economy.  There is but one small home economics classroom.  If the Government&rsquo;s primary aim is to create employment, it is going about it the wrong way.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My information is that over two years ago departmental officials agreed that the school needed to be doubled in size and predicted that the school would have to cater for 850 pupils.  The school&rsquo;s management was told that a design team would be appointed in the third quarter of this year but we are now in the fourth quarter.  Miraculously this morning, after this matter was selected for the Adjournment debate, the building unit in the Department of Education and Skills contacted the school to arrange a meeting for next Tuesday to discuss the implications of appointing a design team.  Is this a new bureaucratic hurdle to be passed before the Department keeps its promise to appoint a design team in the third quarter of this year?</P>
        <P>The former Minister for Education and Science visited the school when two pupils, John D. O&rsquo;Callaghan and Liam McCarthy, won the European Competition for Young Scientists, having already won the Irish Young Scientist competition with their project on testing milk quality.  The Minister will recall that three years earlier in 2006 another Kinsale community school pupil, Aisling Judge, won the Irish Young Scientist competition with a project on food hygiene.</P>
        <P>In January 2008, I visited the school with my party leader, Deputy Kenny, who was very impressed with the excellent service it provides to the community in Kinsale despite the cramped conditions in which it must operate.  I ask for a completion date for the sake of the 762 pupils of the school.  The school provides services for the whole community of Kinsale six days per week from early in the morning to late every evening.  I am told that the school is not <Col N="90"/>allowed to replace its second caretaker, who retired during the summer, even though it is operating at double capacity.  I ask that an exemption be made in this case.</P>
        <P Just="Left">How would the Department fare if we had an education quality standards authority that was similar to the Health Information and Quality Authority?  This school is overcrowded in every classroom and corridor.  It is unhealthy for its children to be confined to one classroom from nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning until three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, especially on wet days.  The school is operating at nearly twice its design capacity.  On health and safety grounds I ask that its application be prioritised and completed as a matter of urgency.   Schools projects are delayed for many reasons but in the present environment of building costs it might opportune to prioritise this project and finish at least one school project ahead of schedule.  This school has proved itself to be an excellent provider for all its pupils and its community but it needs the space to house all its pupils and to give them a good start in life.  It does not need further bureaucratic delays.  I ask that the extension be built without delay.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Teachta Sheehan as ucht an &aacute;bhair seo a ard&uacute; inniu.  I am taking this Adjournment matter on behalf of the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Coughlan.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the D&aacute;il the Government&rsquo;s strategy for capital investment in school building projects and also to outline the current position regarding Kinsale community school.</P>
        <P>Modernising facilities in our existing building stock as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth present a significant challenge.  The Government has shown a consistent determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and ensure that the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.  The allocation of funding for school buildings in 2010 is a little under &euro;579 million.  This represents a significant investment in the schools building and modernisation programme.  This level of funding at a time of great pressure on public finances is a sign of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to investing in school infrastructure and it will permit the continuation of the Department&rsquo;s programme of sustained investment in primary and post primary schools.</P>
        <P>All applications for capital funding are assessed in the planning and building unit of the Department.  The assessment process determines the extent and type of need based on the demographics of an area, proposed housing developments, condition of buildings, site capacity, etc., and leads to an appropriate accommodation solution.  As part of this process, a project is assigned a band rating under published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects.  These criteria were devised following consultation with the education partners.  Projects are selected for inclusion in the school building and modernisation programme on the basis of priority of need.  This is reflected in the band rating assigned to a project.  In other words, a proposed building project moves through the system commensurate with the band rating assigned to it.  There are four band ratings overall, of which band one is the highest and band four the lowest.  Band one projects, for example, include the provision of buildings where none currently exists but there is a high demand for pupil places, while a band four project makes provision for desirable but not necessarily urgent or essential facilities, such as a library or new sports hall.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The project for Kinsale community school has been assigned a band rating of 2.1 under the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects.  A band rating of 2.1 means <Col N="91"/>there is a deficit of mainstream accommodation in the school and the deficit constitutes a substantial and significant proportion of the school's overall accommodation needs.</P>
        <P>All major projects on the Department&rsquo;s capital programme progress through the same structured process of architectural planning, which is divided into clearly defined stages.  There are five stages involved in the progression of major school building projects through architectural planning.  These stages are set out in the Department&rsquo;s design team procedures and are necessary to comply with Department of Finance guidelines which require that capital projects be fully designed prior to going to tender.  They also ensure proper cost management of capital projects and facilitate compliance with statutory and public procurement requirements.</P>
        <P>The project for Kinsale community school was announced earlier this year for the appointment of a design team.  Subsequently, the National Council for Special Education advised the Department of Education and Skills of the need for an autistic spectrum disorders unit at post-primary level in that catchment area.  A revised schedule of accommodation providing for additional accommodation for such a unit was issued to the school at the end of August.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The tender process for appointment of a design team for Kinsale community school will commence shortly as part of a bundle of schools tendering in the coming weeks.  The brief for the project includes the construction of an extension of approximately 4,500 sq. m. plus associated refurbishment and site works.  This brief will provide suitable accommodation for a long-term projected enrolment of up to 850 pupils in Kinsale community school.</P>
        <P>The progression of all large scale building projects, including this one, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of the Department&rsquo;s multi-annual school building and modernisation programme for 2011 and subsequent years.  However, in light of competing demands on the capital budget of the Department and taking into account the early stage at which this project currently stands, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project to completion of tender and construction.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I recognise the significant effect new motorways have on businesses that have been bypassed and the refusal of the NRA to allow for signage to promote those businesses.  I call on the Government to make amendments to the Valuation Act 2001 to state the bypassing of a property represents a material change of circumstances, as defined in section 3 of the Act.  Valuations for rating purposes are made in accordance with the Valuation Act 2001.  The Act confers authority to revise valuations on a revision officer only in instances where there has been a material change of circumstances.  These are defined in section 3.  They encompass circumstances where the structure or neighbouring structure has been rebuilt, or where a structure has for some reason been closed down or damaged by fire, for example.  A material change, therefore, must be of a physical nature.  The circumstances to which I refer concern a physical change, but not to the building subject to rates.  A change in turnover or a decline in the level of business activity would be insufficient, I am told, to warrant the authorisation of a revision of a valuation.  As neither of these events is a material change of circumstances as defined in the Act, the Act is too limited.  It is a great problem that the Government and institutions of State cannot react to evolving circumstances.</P>
        <P>Our road network is unrecognisable by comparison to that of ten years ago.  I and most people are delighted with that.  The new roads are safer, better for business and are wonderful but we must think of the businesses along the old routes, including a number of businesses on <Col N="92"/>the old N8 in Tipperary, which has been bypassed by the M8, the Portlaoise-Cork road.  Business has declined by 90% because of the bypass.  Surely this is unfair.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge that the new road was completed ahead of schedule and within budget.  A wonderful job was done and we all say that is fine.  While there was public consultation in the design of the new road, the county council officials and the NRA are totally intransigent in not allowing for any limited signage, although the council came up with a design for the signage.  I refer to off-road signage that would not be on the roadway.  I see how unfair circumstances are when I go to Cork, Limerick, Portlaoise, the other side of Tipperary and right up to Dublin, where there is signage everywhere.  The system is not being implemented fairly.</P>
        <P>Rate-paying business people, entrepreneurs, are affected.  A landmark hotel, Kilcoran Lodge Hotel, was employing 40 people.  Deputy P. J. Sheehan, who has now left the Chamber, always used to stop there.  He told me he was only half way to Dublin when he reached Kilcoran.  I am sure many of us have been there.  The hotel employs many people but cannot survive.  It cannot pay the huge rates.  There ought to be some recognition of their plight.  People from the town of Cahir going to transact business at the hotel end up on the motorway and cannot get off it until they get to Mitchelstown, which is a long distance away.  This is very frustrating.</P>
        <P>The hotel had a rate review recently.  One must apply for a rate review through the national body.  It costs &euro;250 but one is adjudicated by the body that set the rate in the first instance.  There is no independence or fairness.  The rate reviewers say the hotel is as it was, is fine and grand.  They are flippant about it but that is not acceptable.  We must have an independent review body for everybody.  It should not be the body that sets the rates.</P>
        <P>There is a wonderful shop and filling station that sells light refreshments for the traveller and others in the village of Skeheenarinky.  Some 90% of its business has been wiped away.  I have had meetings with council officials and they have no understanding of the sheer loss of business and do not accept that if the local authority takes away one&rsquo;s business, that same local authority should not expect to have rates paid to it.  One often heard the saying that one cannot get blood from a stone.</P>
        <P>The tools of the trade have been denied to the people to whom I refer.  They have a right to make a living, pay their staff, and pay their PRSI and taxes, which they always did diligently.  They always provided good employment but their opportunities have been taken from them.  They have been blindfolded and handcuffed behind their backs and they are not allowed to transact their business.</P>
        <P>There will have to be changes to the Act.  I appeal to the Minister, the Department of Finance, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and local authorities to examine the review system as it is unfair.  It is not fair that those who set the rates review the rates.  Surely there should be an independent body to review the rates for premises.</P>

        <P>The Valuation Act 2001, which came into effect on 2 May 2002 provides that all buildings used or developed for any purpose including constructions affixed thereto are rateable.  In regard to the Valuation Act 2001, the commissioner of valuation is independent in the exercise of his duties under the Act, and the Minister for Finance has no function in decisions in this regard.</P><Col N="93"/>
        <P>Under section 28(4) of the Valuation Act 2001, a revision officer of the valuation commissioner may carry out a revision of valuation in regard to a particular property only if a material change of circumstances has occurred since the property was last revised.  A material change is defined in section 3 of the Act as a change of circumstances which consists of a new building, a change in value due to structural alterations of an existing building, total or partial demolition of a building or a sub-division or amalgamation of relevant property.  The definition does not allow for a revision of valuation where the change in value is due to economic factors, differential movements in property values or other external factors such as roads or other infrastructural development in the vicinity of a property.  The valuation of commercial property is determined by reference to the values of comparable properties on the same valuation list.</P>
        <P>That is to say they are compared to similar properties in the same local authority area to ensure, in so far as it is possible, that they are all treated equally.  Therefore, while external factors such as roads or other infrastructural development in the vicinity of a property have no impact on valuations determined at revision, they can by their nature have either a positive or negative effect on a business.  For example, new motorways are allowing greater numbers of people to travel to outlying areas, bringing potential for increased trading.  While some businesses may have been bypassed by the new motorways, on the whole, the new road system has received a general welcome throughout the country and could be seen to have a generally beneficial effect on businesses. Similarly, the valuations of commercial enterprises that have benefited from infrastructural developments have not been increased.</P>
        <P>It is generally recognised that bypasses give the bypassed towns back to their communities; these towns have thrived in the absence of daily traffic jams, lack of parking, and the general hassle of trying to do business in such a congested environment.  Bypasses improve accessibility for whole regions, reduce travel times and transport costs and make journey times more predictable.  All this adds rather than detracts from the prospects for economic development in a region.</P>
        <P>In regard to signage on roads, spatial planning and national roads guidelines were recently published by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The guidelines indicate that the erection of advertising signage is tightly regulated for road safety and environmental reasons.  Regulation of signage on national roads ensures that the information needs and safety considerations of road users can be fully and properly catered for.  However, the authority&rsquo;s practice is to erect white-on-brown tourist signs identifying the town or village and including, as appropriate, symbols indicating the principal facilities and services available in the locations concerned.</P>
        <P>It is at a revaluation that economic factors, differential movements in property values or other external factors such as roads or other infrastructural development in the vicinity of a property are accounted for in the valuation process.</P>
        <P>With regard to the national revaluation programme, I am glad to report that steady progress is being made.  In a typical revaluation of all the commercial properties in a local authority area, the entire list is brought up to date by reference to values at a specific date and the list is then published on one date, usually 31 December, and comes into effect on 1 January the following year.  To date, revaluations have been completed in south Dublin and Fingal county council areas and the revaluation of D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown is nearing completion.  In the next phase, it is intended to roll out the programme to a further local authority in the coming months and the necessary process of consultation, as provided for under the Act, is under way.</P><Col N="94"/>
        <P>The Valuation Act 2001 has been in operation for eight years and the commissioner has now decided to initiate an internal review of the statute.  The various provisions in the Act are being examined from a number of perspectives in the light of experience and the implications of judgments emanating from the valuation tribunal and the courts over the past seven years.  In the context of this review, I will ask the commissioner to consider the matters raised by the Deputy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SimonCoveney"><NameTxt>Deputy Simon Coveney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister, given where he comes from, will understand the importance of access to the regions in parts of the country that are isolated from large population centres and which are and have for some time been heavily reliant on air access.</P>
        <P>I raise this issue because I am concerned that the subvention system in place to support the six regional airports I will mention is surrounded with uncertainty.</P>
      </Speaker>
        <P>The budget that has been committed to most of the regional airports is clearly grossly inadequate to even allow some of them to remain open beyond the end of this year.</P>
        <P>It is fair to say that the management and boards at all six regional airports have made huge efforts to reduce costs and to make the airports more cost effective and efficient.  This is reflected in the fact that the Opex subvention budget, which is operational current expenditure, has reduced year on year over the past number of years.  The cut so far this year has been dramatic.</P>
        <P>The Minister when replying to questions in the D&aacute;il last week gave me the following figures.  Last year, Galway Airport received an operational subvention of &euro;962,000.  So far this year it has received approval for only &euro;582,000.  The figure for Sligo Airport has reduced from more than &euro;300,000 to &euro;150,000 so far.  While the figure for Donegal Airport for last year was &euro;131,000 it has received nothing so far this year.  The figure for Knock Airport has reduced from &euro;445,000 to &euro;350,000.  The figure for Waterford Airport has been most dramatic with a reduction from &euro;1.5 million last year to just over &euro;600,000 so far this year.  The amounts allocated this year so far have more than halved.  The Minister would neither confirm nor deny that extra money will be found and approved by the Department of Finance to at least ensure all six regional airports remain open into next year until we have had a proper and honest debate on the future of regional airports, the impact of the end of this tranche of the PSO levy next summer and whether a new PSO will be introduced by Government and so on.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It would be inexcusable to cut budgets in a salami type manner with everybody taking a small cut year on year and month after month and to expect airports to remain open.  I am seeking from the Minister this evening an assurance that the Department of Transport, in consultation with the Department of Finance, will assure the public in regions like Galway, Kerry, Sligo, Donegal, Knock and Waterford that their airports will remain open into next year and that the relatively modest operational subvention budgets required to do so will be found, even in these difficult times.</P>
        <P>I understand that some of the airports received a letter today from the Department of Transport asking them to revise their budgets with a view to a top-up payment between now and the end of the year.  We need to provide budgetary certainty for the running of these airports so they can plan for the cost cutting that may be necessary and be in a position to give a <Col N="95"/>guarantee to airlines and the public that they have a future.  If they cannot do this, it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy.  Airlines that do not believe there is a future for an airport will not expand or commit to future routes at those airports.  Likewise, the public will not book flights from those airports.</P>
        <P>I would like a commitment from the Minister, which will provide reassurance and confidence to the communities in these regions that rely on an important airlink, that their airports will remain open into next year and that the relatively modest top-up budgets involved in this regard, in terms of operational subvention, will be provided by the Government.</P>
      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Teachta Coveney as ucht an t-&aacute;bhar seo a ard&uacute; inniu.</P>
        <P>The scheme to which the Deputy refers was introduced in 2006 in response to new mandatory EU guidelines on the provision of public funding for airports, including regional airports.  Under this scheme, the regional airports may be considered for annual subvention in respect of operating costs incurred in providing core airport services, to the extent that these cannot be met by prudent commercial management and by any surpluses available from other sources such as carparking charges and catering.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In view of a projected shortfall in the resources available to fund this scheme, after allowing for estimated requirements for the PSO Air Services Programme for 2010, the regional airports were allocated operational expenditure or Opex funding on a <i>pro rata</i> basis in July of this year, with no airport getting the full amount it might otherwise expect.  This allocation was in line with the Opex contracts with the airports.  However, the Minister for Transport is very much aware that several events have impacted on the regional airports since this year&rsquo;s applications for funding were received and that payments at the reduced level have been causing difficulties for them.  To that end, the Department of Transport has been monitoring the position with management at each of the airports.  In recognition of those difficulties, the Minister for Transport has decided to provide additional funding for the scheme for 2010.</P>
        <P>The airports have been invited to submit additional information in support of their applications for funding.  This updated information will be re-assessed by the Department of Transport in accordance with the terms of the scheme and allocations will be made accordingly.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Value for Money Review of Exchequer Expenditure on the Regional Airports Programme, including the Opex scheme, has been completed and is at present being considered by the Government.  It is expected that, in light of that review, decisions on funding for regional airports in future years will be made in the context of the Estimates and budget process later this year.</P>
        <P>With changes in EU legislation, the substantial investment in surface transport, the completion of this review and the requirement to make best use of scarce Exchequer resources, the focus for the future will be on ensuring the sustainability of a strong network of regional airports servicing the Irish public, both in terms of business and tourism.</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>I read recently that a Latvian NGO that offers support to victims of human trafficking claims there has seen an avalanche of sham marriages during the past year.  It also claims that Ireland and Cyprus are the two countries where Latvian sham marriages are most common.  I am fully aware this is not an easy problem with which to deal given the State must meet its responsibilities under EU law to guarantee free movement to the spouses of EU citizens and is also prevented from undertaking systematic checks of particular nationalities.</P>
        <P>The reality is that the EU directive on free movement is being exploited.  Since the directive became law in 2006 the number of people in Ireland applying for residency rights, based on marriage to an EU citizen, has increased from 1,206 in 2006 to 2,129 in 2009.  Every effort must be made to try to prevent these sham marriages taking place.  It will take an EU-wide approach to achieve this.  My colleague, Deputy Naughten, has sought to have the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010 amended to give registrars more power to interview prospective brides and grooms and to block any marriages they deem to be shams.  This is a reasonable amendment which should be made immediately.  The law needs to be changed to give registrars, the people performing these ceremonies, the powers to block until they are satisfied, through various checks, that a genuine marriage is taking place.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Many developed countries have introduced tough laws making it a criminal offence to enter into a sham marriage in order to circumvent immigration laws.  In this regard, the US law imposes a prison sentence of up to five years and a fine of up to $250,000.  I will give an example of the tragedy of these marriages.  An article I read in relation to the Shelter Safe House, an NGO looking after Latvian women following their return to Latvia, gave an example of an 18 year old woman who was promised a job in a shop in Ireland by a friend living in Ireland who had an Indian boyfriend.  When she arrived in Dublin she was allowed to stay in their house but no job materialised.  After some time, her friend&rsquo;s boyfriend told her she had to marry his friend to pay him back for board and lodgings.  She was put under a lot of pressure and because she had no one to turn to in a foreign country she agreed.  She has since returned to Latvia where she has found a boyfriend she loves and is pregnant.</P>
      <?oasys _cl13.5- ?>
        <P>She wants to marry him but cannot do so because she is already married.  This girl is 18 years old and she was conned into a marriage here.  I am ashamed that this type of thing is happening in Ireland, particularly in respect of people of certain nationalities.</P>
        <P>As stated previously, an EU-wide approach is required to deal with this extremely serious problem.  I ask the Minister to ensure the matter is raised at the next EU Council of Ministers with a view to achieving a common approach.  If such an approach is not taken, the institution of marriage, which is protected under the Constitution, will be seriously undermined.</P>
        <P>The Latvian authorities recently suggested that Ireland has been dragging its feet and has ignored calls to deal with the abuse, through marriages of the kind to which I refer, of Latvian citizens living here.  That is a serious allegation which could have major consequences on our international reputation.  It is incomprehensible that a request from any county to eradicate the practice of sham marriages would be ignored.  It is essential that this allegation be investigated fully and that the exact nature of what occurred be determined.</P>
        <P>Ireland prides itself on being an equitable nation.  Any suggestion that sham marriages were either not taken seriously or, worse still, ignored would paint us in a damagingly negative light on the world stage.  The exploitation by one person of another should never be tolerated in a civilised society.  If the Latvian authorities claim their requests to have the abuse of their citizens in Ireland stamped out were ignored, we must discover why.</P>
        <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle&rsquo;s office for allowing me to raise this matter and I sincerely hope the Minister will take on board the serious nature of it.</P>

	<P>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an Teacht Barrett as ucht an &aacute;bhar seo a chur faoi bhr&aacute;id na D&aacute;la agus deis a thabhairt dom freagra a thabhairt ar son an Aire Dl&iacute; agus Cirt agus Athch&oacute;irithe Dl&iacute;.</P>
        <P>I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Justice and Law Reform and I welcome the opportunity to deal with the issue of marriages of convenience contracted for the purposes of exploiting the terms of the directive on free movement and, in particular, the involvement of Latvian citizens.  This is a matter which has received significant recent publicity but has long been a concern for the Minister and the immigration authorities and their colleagues involved in marriage registration.</P>
        <P>Free movement is a fundamental right in the EU.  Under EU free movement rules, once an EU citizen exercises his or her entitlement to move to and live in a member state other than that of which he or she is a national, he or she is entitled to be accompanied or joined by his or her non-EEA family members.  Crucially, this includes persons whom such people subsequently marry, irrespective of their immigration status.</P>
        <P>Prior to the Metock judgment in 2008, Ireland had in place a rule that granted EU treaty rights only to non-EEA family members with prior lawful residence in another EU member state.  This provision, had it not been struck down, would have excluded virtually all of the types of cases currently being highlighted from benefiting under the directive.</P>
        <P>The Minister is surprised by the contention that Ireland has been passive on this issue.  This is not the message we are getting from the Latvian authorities.  The latter have expressed their appreciation of the measures the State is taking and there has been considerable operational co-operation between the Garda National Immigration Bureau and its colleagues in the Latvian police force.</P>
        <P>Far from being passive, no member state has been as active as Ireland on this matter at Justice and Home Affairs Council meetings.  The Minister has personally raised the issue at the highest level at EU meetings on a number of occasions as far back as September 2008, within weeks of the judgment being handed down.  He has raised his concerns at successive EU Presidency meetings of JHA Ministers in the intervening period.  However, the Minister received little support at the time from his colleagues from other member states.  The Department has had ongoing concerns since the Metock case precisely because it could see the huge potential for abuse of the directive and the extent to which the ruling effectively set aside immigration control in respect of family members of EU nationals.  The Department&rsquo;s experience is that the directive is now regarded by non-EU and EEA persons seeking to circumvent immigration controls as an unrestricted means to regularise their immigration status in the wider EU.</P>
        <P Just="Left">While the European Commission has set out guidelines for dealing with the issue, the balance of advantage is very much with the applicant and the onus of proof lies with the member state.  This is why Ireland and some other member states have called for an amendment to the directive to restore the pre-Metock position.  Ireland remains strongly of the opinion that amendments to the directive are necessary and that it should remain under continuing review at the Council of Ministers.  We continue to seek the support of other member states, including those whose citizens are involved in suspect marriages.  However, the difficulty of achieving such amendments must be acknowledged.  The Department will continue to highlight this issue at every opportunity, including directly with the Commission when it visits Ireland later this year to assess our implementation of the directive.</P>
        <P>Marriages of convenience are, of their nature, difficult to detect.  Final determination as to the validity of marriage-based claims in this area can be made only after an in-depth examination of the particular circumstances of each individual case.  The directive prohibits systematic checks.</P>
        <P>On the domestic front, both the Department and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na have been taking steps to address this issue.  I congratulate the Garda on the ongoing success of Operation Charity. <Col N="98"/> This operation, which was launched by the Garda National Immigration Bureau in November 2009, has so far prevented 80 marriages of convenience from taking place through the issuing of objections to registrars to planned marriages which it is suspected may be marriages of convenience.  The bureau has also made 16 arrests in this period for alleged offences including bigamy, the production of false documentation and illegal residence in Ireland.  There is valuable ongoing co-operation between the bureau and the organised crime enforcement department of Latvia, which is the member state of origin of the majority of EU citizens involved in suspect marriages.  There shortly will be a meeting under the auspices of Eurojust in The Hague between the Latvian state police and the Irish authorities to discuss information exchange and co-ordinating investigation activities relating to suspected marriages of convenience.</P>
        <P>In the longer term, the Minister will seek to further address the issue through legislation.  The Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill 2010, currently before the House, proposes, <i>inter alia</i>, to allow the Minister, in making his determination of any immigration matter, to disregard a particular marriage as a factor bearing on that determination where it is deemed the union is a marriage of convenience.  The criminalisation of the contracting of marriages of convenience was considered in the context of the Bill but difficulties are presented by the strong constitutional protection for marriage in Ireland and the issue of enforcement.</P>
        <P>The Minister particularly welcomes the updated guidelines for registrars for marriage notifications, which issued to all superintendent registrars in Ireland on 2 September.  These new guidelines include stricter conditions on proof of identity which will require applicants for marriage to provide letters of authentication of birth certificates from their embassies.  This requirement will, in most cases, bring the proposed marriage to the notice of the authorities of the member state of the EU citizen in question and afford them an opportunity to outline the risks involved.  The Minister is of the view that this measure alone could have a significant impact on the number of suspect marriages.  This is also the view of the Latvian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with which the Irish authorities have been in contact through our embassy in Riga.  As recently as last week, the Latvian Ministry thanked the relevant authorities here for the steps being taken to tackle this abuse and pledged their continuing co-operation with both the Minister&rsquo;s Department and the Garda to end the exploitation which is at the root of this matter.  The Minister has also instructed his officials to examine afresh the processes in place in the Department for approval and assessment of these applications.  Arising from that review, other steps may well need to be taken to tighten up the procedures.</P>
        <P>There is no quick fix solution to this problem.  A combination of actions, including prevention, ensuring that marriages of convenience are disregarded in immigration decisions and police co-operation, will be required.  Ultimately, the Minister believes there is a need for legislative action at EU level.</P>

	<P>For many years there have been discussions between the EU and NATO on questions of common interest related to crisis management.  This is not surprising considering that twenty-one EU Member States are also members of NATO. In addition, where both the EU and NATO operate in the same area, cooperation on practical issues is logical and enhances the security of EU personnel deployed, including Irish military and civilian personnel.    Arrangements for cooperation between the two organisations have existed since the Union&rsquo;s Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) originated over 10 years ago and have evolved in accordance with principles specified by successive European Councils. Permanent arrangements to facilitate cooperation between the EU and NATO in the crisis management area have also been developed.  These arrangements, known as &lsquo;Berlin Plus&rsquo;arrangements, allow the EU to draw on some of NATO&rsquo;s military assets &mdash; such as transportation, headquarters or planning facilities &mdash; in support of CSDP crisis management operations. The ongoing stabilisation mission EUFOR Althea in Bosnia-Herzegovina benefits from having recourse to these arrangements.</P>
        <P Just="Left">More generally, EU-NATO relations are underpinned by long-standing principles that include full respect for the autonomy of EU decision-making, recognition of the different nature of the EU and NATO, and non-discrimination against any of the Member States.   At least once per Presidency the Foreign Affairs Council adopts conclusions on CSDP which refer to this issue. For example, in April this year the Council &ldquo;recalled the objective of strengthening the EU-NATO strategic partnership in crisis management and welcomed the efforts by the High Representative and the NATO Secretary General to foster progress in this area&rdquo;.</P><Col N="100"/>
        <P>Most recently, on 16th September 2010, the European Council invited High Representative Ashton &ldquo;to develop ideas on how EU/NATO cooperation in crisis management could be further strengthened&rdquo;.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 and 126 together.</P>
        <P>The scale and magnitude of the ongoing flooding in Pakistan has been immense, with the UN estimating that 21 million people have been affected.  To date, more than 1800 people are known to have lost their lives as a result of the tragedy and with flood waters yet to fully subside in many areas and the risk of waterborne diseases, there are fears that this death toll may rise further. In those areas where the flooding has receded, millions of people have been left destitute and dependent on humanitarian aid.</P>
        <P>Ireland was one of the first countries to respond to the crisis. I attended a special session of the UN General Assembly in New York on 19 August and pledged &euro;2 million in immediate relief. Since then, the total direct assistance allocated by the Government to the victims of the disaster has risen to nearly &euro;2.6 million, with support provided through the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the World Food Programme and UNICEF as well as Concern, Tr&oacute;caire, Goal and Plan Ireland.  I also convened an emergency meeting of Irish-based NGOs responding to the crisis in order to ensure a seamless Irish response and met the Ambassador of Pakistan to Ireland, Mrs Naghmana Hashmi, to discuss Pakistan&rsquo;s needs and how Ireland could best contribute.</P>
        <P>Irish Aid also carried out two airlifts of emergency supplies to Pakistan, the second of which was the single largest humanitarian airlift ever undertaken by the State, providing shelter, water and sanitation equipment for 33,000 people. Irish Aid&rsquo;s Rapid Response Corps has been placed on standby, with one member already deployed to work as a logistician with Goal. A member of Dublin Fire Brigade has also been working in Pakistan with the UN Disaster Assessment and Coordination (UNDAC) team.</P>
        <P>In addition to this direct response, Ireland is one of the largest overall contributors to the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF) a funding reservoir which can be drawn upon within hours of a disaster. Ireland has contributed &euro;76m to this fund since 2006.</P>
        <P>Ireland will continue to support the ongoing efforts of the Government of Pakistan, the United Nations and NGOs to provide relief to the people of Pakistan as they face into the onset of winter. An international conference on the recovery of Pakistan is due to be held before the end of the year and we will examine further support for the ongoing recovery efforts in the light of the priority needs at that time.</P>

	<P>The systematic mass rapes which were carried out in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in July and August, in Luvungi and several other locations, were appalling and despicable.  Ireland fully shared in the international condemnation of those responsible, which included statements by EU and UN representatives.  In their 27th August joint statement on the violence, EU High Representative Ashton and EU Development Commissioner Piebalgs expressed outrage at the attacks and mass rapes and called on the Government in Kinshasa to make every effort to protect the population and end impunity for the perpetrators.  They also called for the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the DRC, MONUSCO, to speed up their efforts with the Congolese authorities to improve security in the region.   Of course the primary responsibility for the protection of civilians lies with the Government of the DRC, its national army and police force, which failed to protect the victims.  However MONUSCO peacekeepers also had a role to play, and the UN has admitted that they also failed, and could have done more to stop the series of attacks.  Poor infrastructure, difficult terrain, limited communication, and insufficient resources were some of the reasons cited for the failure.  </P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the failures of the DRC Government and of MONUSCO, it is important to remember that the fault lies with the perpetrators.  They and their leaders must be apprehended and charged with their crimes. The Government of the DRC has constituted a commission to bring them to justice.  By early September the DRC Government had arrested some of those responsible and they were awaiting trial.  Ireland also calls on the Government of the DRC to address issues of civilian protection, impunity, and security sector reform, which contribute to such abuse.</P>

	<P>The current phase of negotiations to find a comprehensive solution to the Cyprus problem began in September 2008, under the auspices of the Special Representative of the UN Secretary General, Mr. Alexander Downer.  By the end of March 2010, over 70 rounds of talks had taken place between President Christofias, the leader of the Greek Cypriots, and Mehmet Ali Talat, the then leader of the Turkish Cypriot community.  In April 2010, Mr. Dervis Eroglu was elected leader of the Turkish Cypriot community, defeating Mr. Talat.  A first round of talks between President Christofias and Mr. Eroglu took place at the end of May and eight further rounds took place during the summer months.   </P>
        <P>After a short recess in mid-August, Christofias and Eroglu resumed their talks at the end of the month.  An intensive two-day session took place on 9-10 September in a bid to accelerate the process before both President Christofias and Eroglu departed for international engagements.  They considered comprehensive written proposals from each side on the problematic property chapter and agreed that their respective representatives would take forward work on the technical aspects of the issue to try to identify and develop possible convergences.  The representatives hope to be in a position to produce an agreed joint document in advance of the resumption of talks between the two leaders this month.</P><Col N="102"/>
        <P>The UN has the lead role in the search for a comprehensive settlement and the Government fully supports the leadership of UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and his Special Representative Alexander Downer in this important work.</P>
        <P>Ireland, along with its EU partners, will maintain that support for the Secretary General and his Special Representative in this role.  We continue to encourage both sides to work for progress towards the achievement of a bi-zonal, bi-communal federal state through an honourable, balanced and durable settlement protecting and guaranteeing the basic rights of all Cypriots.</P>
        <P>We also encourage Turkey to bring its influence to bear in supporting a durable settlement.  When I met with the Turkish Foreign Minister in the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York on 21 September, I stressed the importance of making progress on the Cyprus issue. In particular I emphasised the need for Turkey to comply with its obligations under the Ankara Protocol and open its ports and airports to Cyprus.</P>

        <P Just="Left">The 2006 Comprehensive Study on the All-Island economy identified the need to build on our competitive strengths, particularly in the areas of infrastructure and R&amp;D. The recently published Innovation Task Force report was also clear on the benefits to be gained &mdash; not least to border regions &mdash; from jointly branding and promoting our &lsquo;Innovation Island&rsquo;.</P>
        <P>An important initiative in this context is the US-Ireland R&amp;D Partnership, an outcome of the US-Ireland Business Summit in Washington D.C. which was launched in July 2006. Its aim is to promote collaborative innovative research projects which create value above and beyond individual efforts. The Partnership represents a new model for international research cooperation and, to date, a total of seven awards have been made amounting to a total of $19m from a combination of sources in the US, Northern Ireland and Ireland. I will travel to Washington to attend the Northern Ireland Economic Conference on October 19th   which is being hosted by the US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. While there, I will take the opportunity to stress the potential of all-Ireland, cross border economic cooperation and the investment opportunities in the border region.</P><Col N="103"/>
        <P>To coincide with the Economic Conference, I will co-host an event with the First Minister, Deputy First Minister and the US Special Envoy to Northern Ireland, Declan Kelly, to promote the work of the US-Ireland R&amp;D Partnership.</P>
        <P>I anticipate that a number of key announcements will be made at that Washington event, including the expansion of the Partnership&rsquo;s relationship with the National Science Foundation in the US.</P>

	<P>Ireland fully supports the free movement of persons within the European Union, which constitutes one of the fundamental freedoms underpinning the internal market.    The Free Movement Directive (Directive 2004/38/EC) sets out the entitlement of EU citizens to free movement across the EU.</P>
        <P>Under Article 7 of the Directive, a Union citizen may reside in another Member State for a period of more than three months if he or she:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />is in employment or is self-employed;</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />has sufficient resources to support himself or herself, his or her spouse, and any accompanying dependants;</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />has comprehensive health insurance in respect of himself or herself, his or her spouse, and any accompanying dependants;</P>
     <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />is enrolled in an educational establishment for the principal purpose of following a course of study, including a vocational training course.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Where a person is in breach of these provisions, they may be removed from the State and, where appropriate, an exclusion period may be placed on them whereby they cannot re-enter or seek to re-enter the State during the validity of that period.</P>
        <P>Furthermore, under Article 27 of the Free Movement Directive, Member States may restrict the freedom of movement and residence of Union citizens and their family members, irrespective of nationality, on grounds of public policy, public security or public health.</P>
        <P>France has stated that the removals of members of the Roma community from encampments in France to their countries of origin have taken place in line with the provisions on the Free Movement Directive.  The situation of Roma people has been given special attention at the EU Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO)  over recent years, including in June 2009 and June 2010. The issue was also touched upon at the General Affairs Council in July of this year. Two European Summits on Roma Inclusion have been organised in recent years, the first during the French Presidency in 2008 and the second during the Spanish Presidency earlier this year.</P>
        <P>This issue has also been discussed at European Council level on a number of occasions in the past, including in December 2007 and June 2008 and most recently, I understand, at the Heads of State or Government lunch at last month&rsquo;s European Council meeting.</P>
        <P>The European Commission have an important role, as guardian of the Treaties, in ensuring that European Union law is applied fully and effectively in all Member States. In this regard, <Col N="104"/>it is usual practice for the Commission to enter into dialogue with a Member State if they have concerns about the application of EU law in that Member State. As regards the situation with France, I understand that the Commission is in continuing contact with the French authorities.</P>

	<P>Ireland played an important role at the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) Review Summit at the UN in New York from 20 to 22 September, working closely with our EU partners, with the US Administration, the UN Secretary General and our partner countries in Africa.  I participated in the Summit, along with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and we were pleased that there was strong representation also by the Irish development Non-Governmental Organisations.</P>
        <P>The MDGs are a series of detailed development targets agreed by world leaders at the UN in 2000, against which we must measure progress on the eradication of poverty, in all its forms, by 2015.  In preparing for the Summit, we recognised that important progress has been made in areas such as primary school enrolment and the treatment of HIV and AIDS, but that the actual numbers of people living in poverty and hunger continue to increase.  Ireland engaged intensively in the negotiations for the Summit Outcome Document, which was adopted unanimously by the UN General Assembly, and which recognises that we need to refocus international efforts if we are to meet the Goals over the coming five years. </P>
        <P>The key principles which informed our input to the Summit were recognition of the need to achieve all of the MDGs universally in order to combat global hunger and poverty, and the importance of delivering progress for the regions and groups which have made least progress, notably in sub-Saharan Africa, which is the geographic focus of Ireland's aid programme.</P>
        <P>Throughout the Summit, Ireland placed a central emphasis on the global hunger crisis, arguing that it is impeding progress across the full range of development goals.  There are up to one billion people facing life without sufficient food in the world today.  We consistently made the point that a focus on the nutritional needs of women, children and people living in vulnerable situations is key to making progress in tackling this avoidable crisis.</P>
        <P>Minister Martin outlined Ireland's overall approach in Ireland's national statement to the Summit, and I focused at the first Roundtable discussion on the opening morning of the Summit on practical steps the international community can take to tackle undernutrition, building on the recommendations of the 2008 Report of the Government's Hunger Task Force, which we have accepted and endorsed.  Ireland made a particularly strong policy impact by co-hosting with the US Administration a major international meeting which marked the launch of a new partnership between Governments, civil society and the private sector to address undernutrition.  The first part of the meeting was co-chaired by Minister Martin and US Secretary of State Clinton, and was addressed, among others, by the UN Secretary General, the Foreign Minister of Uganda and representatives of international civil society.  I chaired the second part, with the Head of the US Aid Programme.  It explored in detail the interventions which can be most effective in the first 1,000 days of the life of a child, from pregnancy to two years old.</P>
          <P>The Review Summit reaffirmed the strong commitment of the international community to achieving the MDGs by 2015.  I believe it did so in a realistic manner, recognising that in the current global economic environment, it is essential that we focus rigorously on the effectiveness of our aid, and on key sectors and priorities.  The success of this international effort will <Col N="105"/>be measured in the years ahead by the impact of our actions and policies on the lives of the poorest and most vulnerable communities in the world.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>The security procedures associated with the issuing of the Irish passport are under constant review.  Passport Service staff remain in regular contact with other passport agencies worldwide to ensure that &lsquo;best practice&rsquo; lessons are learned.  I understand that a new UK passport will issue shortly and that this passport book will incorporate new security features.  I am satisfied that the current Irish passport includes a suitable range of equivalent security features.  However, passport security is regularly reviewed by the Passport Service and new features will be added to the Irish passport, should this prove necessary.  Over the coming year the Passport Service will make significant changes in the processing of passport applications aimed at speeding the renewal of passports and preventing identity fraud.  These will include a new simplified application form and procedure for adults seeking to renew their passports and a requirement that certain categories of first time applicants submit additional documentary evidence in support of their application.  </P>
        <P Just="Left">In August I confirmed that the backlog in passport applications, which occurred following a period of prolonged industrial action, had been cleared.  Every effort will be made to ensure that such a backlog does not recur.  The introduction of different procedures for first time applications and renewals will assist in this regard.  Additionally, as part of the settlement of the dispute the Chief Executive of the Labour Relations Commission agreed to undertake an examination of staffing levels in the Passport Service.  I understand that this examination will take place later this year and I hope this process will help prevent future industrial unrest.</P>

	<P>A general election was held in Bosnia-Herzegovina on 3 October.  Under Bosnia-Herzegovina&rsquo;s complex constitutional system voting took place for the three-person state-level Presidency, the state-level House of Representatives as well as at a regional level within the Bosniak-Croat Federation and the Serb Republic.  Provisional results indicate gains for moderates in the Federation while the ruling party, the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats, did well in the Serb Republic.  Turnout is estimated to have been 56%, an increase on recent elections.   In its preliminary assessment, the OSCE-led election observation mission reported that the elections were conducted generally in line with OSCE and Council of Europe commitments and represented further progress for Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Ireland contributed nine short term observers to the OSCE-led election observation mission.</P>
        <P>I welcome the positive preliminary findings of the OSCE-led election mission.  The relatively strong turnout demonstrates the commitment of the Bosnian people to democracy and their determination to shape their own future.   Ireland, along with our EU partners, remains committed to enhancing stability in the Western Balkans region.  The EU perspective for the countries in the region, agreed at the June 2003 Thessaloniki European Council, is essential in helping <Col N="106"/>to build and maintain this stability.  When I met with   Foreign Minister Sven Alkalaj in New York last month he emphasised the importance of the EU accession perspective for his country.  This meeting followed up on the more detailed discussions I had with Minister Alkalaj during his visit to Dublin in March.</P>
        <P>It is important that now, after the general election, fresh impetus is given to domestic reforms to ensure Bosnia-Herzegovina moves forward on the path towards the EU.  The EU is ready to play its part by encouraging political leaders in Bosnia-Herzegovina to engage in constructive dialogue and by assisting with the reform process.  However, the key to progress lies with the political parties themselves.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 95, 128 and 387 together.</P>
        <P>On 7 August 2010 President Juan Manuel Santos Calder&oacute;n was inaugurated as President of Colombia.</P>
        <P>In his inauguration address, President Santos indicated that one of his fundamental aims as President will be to re-establish ties with Venezuela and Ecuador, to restore trust between them and to privilege diplomacy and prudence in their bilateral relations. On 10th August President Santos met with President Chavez and they agreed to re-establish diplomatic relations between the two countries which had been broken off by Venezuela on 22nd July in response to allegations that Venezuela was harbouring Colombian terrorists.</P>
        <P>Efforts are underway to normalize diplomatic relations between Colombia and Ecuador, which were broken off following an incursion in March 2008 by the Colombian Armed Forces into Ecuador which resulted in the death of a Forzas Armadas Revolucionarias da Colombia (FARC) leader Manuel Reyes.  On 23rd   September, Victor Su&aacute;rez, reportedly the military leader of the FARC, was killed by Colombian Armed Forces in La Macarena, in central Colombia. Commenting on the incident, President Santos noted that the loss of such an important FARC figure will make a considerable contribution to ending terrorism and narco-trafficking in Colombia.</P>
        <P>During his inauguration address, President Santo emphasised that human rights would be a key issue during his term of office.

	<P>There has been intense speculation about political developments in the Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea, following the announcement late last month of the promotion of Kim Jong-un, the youngest son of current leader, Kim Jong-il, to the rank of four-star general.  The promotion was announced to the North Korean media agency following the Worker&rsquo;s Party congress, the first to be held in forty-four years. The promotion is seen by some as a signal that Kim Jong-un is the heir apparent to his father.    Despite the ongoing speculation, there has been no official announcement of any change in leadership by the North Korean authorities to date.  Notwithstanding this, China, a key interlocutor for the Korean peninsula and the North&rsquo;s closest supporter, issued a statement on 2 October pledging to strengthen ties with the new leadership.  The United States has also issued a statement, calling on the new regime to honour the denuclearisation agreement signed in 2005.  </P>
        <P>Concerns have been expressed regarding possible internal instability in North Korea if the transfer of leadership, when it comes, is challenged. Such a development could have implications for the stability and security of the region as a whole and indeed beyond.  However, I hope that any transition would take place peacefully and might even allow for progress to be made on a number of outstanding issues, including the stalled Six Party Talks. Transition to a new generation of leaders in the Democratic People&rsquo;s Republic of Korea could also be an opportunity for North Korea to emerge from its isolation and implement reforms leading to democracy and human rights for its citizens. The international community needs to be ready to respond imaginatively and generously in the event of such a positive development.</P>

	<P>The European External Action Service, the EEAS, is an important innovation under the Lisbon Treaty to support the work of the new High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton.  The Treaty provides that the EEAS will comprise officials from relevant departments of the Commission and the Council Secretariat, as well as staff seconded from the national diplomatic services of the Member States.  The former European Commission Delegations outside the European Union have now become Delegations of the European Union, and are under the authority of the High Representative.  While the EEAS is not yet fully up and running, the European Commission opened the competition for Heads of Delegation in this year&rsquo;s rotation to applicants from the diplomatic services of the Member States and the Council Secretariat.</P>
        <P>On 15 September High Representative Ashton announced an initial tranche of appointments of 28 Heads of Delegation, as well as the Deputy Head of Delegation in Beijing.  There was a <Col N="108"/>number of applicants from Ireland&rsquo;s diplomatic service, some of whom were called for final interview.  However, none were successful on this occasion.  Of those appointed, three are Irish citizens working for the Commission.  While this is a gratifying reflection of the calibre of Irish people serving in the European Institutions, naturally they will be counted as coming from the Commission stream of staffing for the EEAS rather than that of the Member States.</P>
        <P>There are currently two other EEAS staff selection processes underway.  One is for 10 senior posts at the headquarters of the EEAS in Brussels, and the other is for 81 more junior posts, mostly in EU Delegations.  Appointments should be made by the High Representative in the coming months.  Officers from the Department of Foreign Affairs have applied for some of these positions.</P>
        <P>Ireland has consistently pressed for the EEAS recruitment process to be open, transparent and merit-based, while also ensuring that EEAS staffing is representative of the diversity of the Union.  The Council Decision establishing the organisation and functioning of the European External Action Service states that recruitment should be based on merit whilst ensuring adequate geographical and gender balance, and also that the staff of the EEAS should comprise a meaningful presence of nationals from all the Member States.</P>
        <P>I am conscious that the number of posts involved in this first round of appointments was small and not fully representative of the EEAS.  I am confident, however, that Irish diplomats will be included in future rounds of appointments and will make a valuable contribution to the work of the new service.</P>

	<P>In June I received a copy of the Passport Service investigation into the use of forged Irish passports in a Dubai incident.  This investigation reached the conclusion that an Israeli government agency was responsible for the misuse and, most likely, the manufacture of the forged Irish passports associated with the murder in Dubai.  As a result of my recommendation to Government, and by way of protest at this unacceptable action, Israel was requested to withdraw a designated member of staff of its Embassy in Dublin.  This request was accepted by the Israeli authorities.   On Sunday 27 June, U.S. federal agents arrested ten people in the states of New York, New Jersey, Virginia and Massachusetts for allegedly carrying out long-term, &ldquo;deep cover&rdquo; assignments in the United States on behalf of the Russian Federation.  A total of eleven defendants, including the ten arrested, were charged with conspiring to act as unlawful agents of the Russian Federation within the United States; while at that time one defendant remained at large.  The affidavit lodged by the F.B.I. to justify the bringing of charges against the defendants alleged that one of the defendants travelled to Moscow using a false Irish passport.  A search of the Irish passport database confirmed that a valid Irish passport with the same details as those on the alleged false Irish passport had issued in 2001 to an Irish citizen.</P>
        <P>On being made aware of these allegations I asked the Passport Service and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to undertake an investigation into the alleged use of a false Irish passport.  This investigation is underway at present and I do not wish, at this stage, to speculate on its conclusions.   However, I understand that the Garda&iacute; have since received information alleging that as many as six Irish forged passports using material cloned from the valid passports of Irish citizens may have been involved in the case in question.</P>
        <P>I can confirm that a small number of citizens have been interviewed by the Garda&iacute; and the Passport Service and that those whose passport details have allegedly been used are, as a precautionary measure, being issued with replacement passports.  None are suspected of any wrongdoing on their part.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Once I have received the reports of the Garda and the Passport Service, I will consider the evidence before reporting to the Government and recommending any course of action.  I will then report to the House.</P>

	<P>While I am aware of the recent travel advisories issued by other countries to their citizens travelling to Europe, it is the Department of Foreign Affairs that issues detailed travel advice for the benefit of Irish citizens travelling or resident abroad. The Department&rsquo;s advice is available on its website, www.dfa.ie. It reflects a considered assessment of the risks involved and is based on the best information available to the Department. It draws on reports from Irish Diplomatic and Consular Missions abroad and advice issued by other countries, including Member States of the European Union, as well as other like minded countries. The advice takes account of any current security situation that exists and every effort is made to ensure that the advice offered is accurate and up-to-date. </P>
        <P>Ireland works closely with other Member States of the European Union in the consular area in ensuring effective coordination and in exchanging essential information as to how to act together in advising and assisting all our citizens.</P>
        <P>The Department is not currently advising against travel to Member States of the European Union. We are, however, advising citizens when travelling to be alert to possible threats of terrorist attack on places frequented by tourists. If we are advised of any specific threat at any time we will amend our advice to reflect this.</P>
        <P>As I am sure the Deputy will accept, the primary responsibility for undertaking a journey overseas rests with the individual. However, I can assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to monitor the situation closely and will remain in regular contact with our European colleagues in order to provide our citizens with the most helpful advice in this regard.</P>

	<P>I attended the Ministerial week of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York from 20 to 28 September. A major event marking the opening of this year&rsquo;s General Assembly session was the High Level Summit meeting on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) convened by Secretary General Ban and which took place from 20-22 September. I was honoured to head the Irish Delegation to this important event and to deliver Ireland&rsquo;s statement to the Summit on 21 September in which I restated Ireland&rsquo;s continued commitment to the achievement of the Goals, emphasising in particular the challenge of addressing hunger. Also on 21 September, as part of the events of the wider MDG Summit, I co-hosted with Hillary Rodham Clinton, the US Secretary of State, an important meeting of international leaders to address world hunger and undernutrition. The meeting was attended and addressed by Secretary General Ban as well as ministers from a number of developing and donor countries, by the Heads of several UN agencies including World Food Programme, the World Health Organisation and UNICEF, and by civil society and private sector representatives. The event, entitled <i>1,000 Days</i>   and which focused on the danger posed by under-nutrition to children under two years old, was very successful in highlighting the need for more effective and concerted international action in this area as part of the drive to achieve the Millennium Development Goals while also providing an excellent example of the strong and effective cooperation which now exists between Ireland and the US in combating global poverty and hunger.</P>
	<P>I attended the opening session of the 65th UN General Assembly on 23 September, which was addressed by UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon, the new President of the General Assembly, Joseph Deiss of Switzerland, and US President Obama among others. I subsequently delivered Ireland&rsquo;s national statement to the UN General Assembly on 27 September, using the occasion to outline Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy priorities and issues of international concern. </P><Col N="111"/>
        <P>As part of ongoing work by Ireland to progress the international disarmament agenda, I participated in a Ministerial Meeting of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty on 23 September and in a High Level Meeting convened by the UN Secretary-General on 24 September, to examine how the work of the Conference on Disarmament and the global disarmament machinery in general could be revitalised.</P>
        <P>Together with my EU counterparts, I participated in EU Ministerial meetings with both US Secretary of State Clinton and Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Lavrov. Both meetings provided important opportunities for exchanges with these two key strategic partners of the EU.</P>
        <P>As is also customary during the UNGA Ministerial Week, I availed of the opportunity to conduct a round of bilateral meetings with a number of foreign ministers of other countries, including the foreign ministers of Australia, Turkey, Egypt, Serbia, Croatia, and New Zealand as well as the Secretary General of the Arab League.</P>
        <P>The focus of my visit to New York was not exclusively on UN matters but also provided me with a useful opportunity to engage in economic promotional work and also to meet local Irish community representatives in New York and Philadelphia. I carried out a number of engagements with business leaders, including the Irish American Leadership Council in New York and the Irish American Business Chamber in Philadelphia and also undertook a number of interviews with major US media, including Bloomberg, Fox Business channel and the New York Times, in which I briefed on the measures the Government is taking to meet the current economic challenges. I was also pleased during my visit to join with those taking part in the first annual Irish Theatre Festival in New York in celebrating and promoting Irish culture.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 102 and 386 together. </P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that I recognise the need for all countries in the Western Balkans, including Serbia, to cooperate fully with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY).  The EU&rsquo;s Stabilisation and Association Agreement process provides the framework for cooperation on economic, political and legal matters aimed at bringing the Western Balkan countries towards the standards and principles required for EU accession.  Cooperation with ICTY is a precondition for those wishing to conclude Stabilisation and Association Agreements with the EU &mdash; a precondition which the EU has enforced consistently and firmly.   A Stabilisation and Association Agreement was signed with Serbia in April 2008.  However, it was decided to defer ratification of the Agreement until the Council was satisfied with Serbia&rsquo;s cooperation with ICTY.  Following a positive assessment regarding Serbia&rsquo;s <Col N="112"/>ongoing cooperation with the Tribunal from the Chief Prosecutor, Ministers decided, by consensus, at the Foreign Affairs Council on 14 June 2010 to submit the Agreement to their national parliaments for ratification.  At the same time, the Council again underlined that full cooperation with ICTY remains an essential element of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement process.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Serbia formally applied for EU membership in December 2009.  The next step in the process is for the General Affairs Council to request an &ldquo;avis&rdquo;, or opinion, from the European Commission.  It is possible that this will be considered at the October General Affairs Council.   I believe it is important that we acknowledge the substantial progress Serbia has made in the ten years since protests led to the end of the Milosevic regime.  Recent months have seen a number of positive developments which demonstrate that Serbia&rsquo;s Government has moved away from the destructive   politics of past decades.  These positive developments include:  the declaration by the Belgrade Parliament last March condemning the Srebrenica massacre; the handing over of the wartime notebooks of Ratko Mladic to the ICTY in May; the joint visit by the Serbian and Croatian Presidents to Bosnia for the Srebrenica commemoration this July; the indictment in September of nine former paramilitaries by the country&rsquo;s war crimes prosecutor over the killing of ethnic Albanians during the Kosovo conflict; and the joint EU-Serbia UN General Assembly resolution on Kosovo this September.     When I met with Foreign Minister Vuk Jeremic   in New York last month he emphasised the importance Serbia attaches to EU integration.  He also underlined Belgrade&rsquo;s commitment to working with ICTY.</P>
        <P>The EU will continue to encourage Serbia as it rebuilds relations with its neighbours, allowing it to move further along on its path to the EU.  At the same time, the EU will also insist that this path must see Serbia continuing to cooperate fully with ICTY in bringing the two indicted war criminals that remain at large to justice in The Hague.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland continues to support the right to self-determination of the people of Western Sahara, as well as the continuing engagement of the United Nations in the search for a political solution in the territory based on the principle of self-determination. UN Secretary General Ban&rsquo;s Personal Envoy for Western Sahara, Christopher Ross, is continuing his efforts to convene direct negotiations between the two sides, following the last such discussions held in March 2008.   In an attempt to resume contact this year, Mr. Ross hosted a second round of informal discussions in New York in February following an initial round held in Austria in August 2009, but unfortunately he has had to report that so far there has been no real engagement between the two sides, Morocco and the Polisario, in resolving the outstanding issues. The major issue remains Morocco&rsquo;s refusal to allow a Referendum in the territory which would include an option of independence for the people of the Western Sahara. This has been provided for in a number of UN peace plans, and it is difficult to see that there can be any genuine self-determination without such a referendum. Mr. Ross visited the region in the early part of this year, and reported back to the UN Security Council in some detail. </P>
        <P>In an effort to move beyond the current impasse, Mr Ross this summer started to visit the capitals of the so-called Group of Friends (this group is comprised of the UK, France, Spain, the U.S. and Russia). Mr Ross reported that these meetings revealed an interest in moving beyond the status quo and finding a solution. In addition, there was unanimous agreement on the need to intensify work on confidence-building measures, including the resumption of family visits by air, the early inauguration of family visits by road and other steps proposed by the <Col N="113"/>UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). It is disappointing therefore that a recent family visit had to be aborted in September, particularly since Algeria, Morocco and the Saharawis had agreed to expand the Confidence-building Measures Programme in meetings with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees earlier in September. I urge all parties to resume these flights and build on the Confidence-building Measures Programme, and to implement the UNHCR proposal to allow family reunification visitors to travel by land as well as air to the Saharawis refugee camps, based in Tindouf, Algeria.</P>
        <P>Issues pertaining to the Western Sahara are regularly raised at EU level within the framework of the EU-Morocco dialogue. The most recent EU &mdash; Morocco Summit took place in Granada on 7 March 2010. The EU conveyed its concerns over the situation of Western Sahara as well as the need to safeguard the rights of both Moroccan and Saharawi human rights defenders, and these concerns were reflected in the joint statement after the meeting.</P>
        <P>Ireland will continue its dialogue with both Morocco and the Polisario, through their representatives based here in Ireland, to encourage support for the UN Secretary General&rsquo;s good office&rsquo;s mission and the efforts of Personal Envoy Ross to achieve some measure of political progress and increased confidence between both sides.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Foreign Affairs</askee>
        <Quest>  his views on the political situation in Ethiopia where recent elections have led to a situation whereby all but one parliamentary seat is held by the political party which has held power since 1991.  </Quest>

	<P>The development of Ethiopia as a stable and democratic State is of great importance to Ireland and to the European Union.  Ethiopia is one of the priority countries within our official development cooperation programme and is an important and influential country in the Horn of Africa region.   Elections to the House of Representatives and the State Councils took place in Ethiopia in May 2010.  The EPRDF party, together with six political parties that are affiliated to it, won 545 of 547 seats in Parliament in a first past the post electoral system.  </P>
        <P>The European Union Election Observation Mission (EU EOM), which included a number of Irish Election Observers, noted the high turn-out, the peaceful, orderly nature of the polling as well as the generally competent organisation of the elections.  However, while welcoming this positive feature of the elections, I am concerned to note the assessment by the EU Mission in its preliminary report that the process was marred by narrowing political space, an electoral playing field that was insufficiently balanced, and that overall the process failed to gain the confidence of opposition political parties.  I look forward to receiving the final report on the full findings of the EU Election Observer Mission that is due to be published shortly.</P>
        <P>When I visited Ethiopia in early July, I had the opportunity to discuss these issues with leading Ethiopian Government figures, including Prime Minister Meles Zenawi, as well as with representatives of the main opposition parties.  A further theme during all of these meetings was  how best political dialogue and engagement with civil society can be developed in the post-electoral period and how the international community can support the process of democratisation.  I urged that positive steps be taken to build confidence in the democratic institutions.</P>
        <P>Another issue that I raised during my visit was that of the detention of opposition leader Ms Birtukan Mideksa.  I have followed closely her case since her re-arrest and return to prison in December 2008.   I very much welcome that she has been released in recent days.</P>
        <P>We will continue to monitor closely developments in the political situation in Ethiopia and we will avail of every opportunity both bilaterally and with our EU partners to encourage further progress in its process of democratisation.</P>

	<P>In the wake of the events of 31 May, I echoed the call of the President of the UN Security Council on 1 June for a &ldquo;prompt, impartial, credible and transparent investigation conforming to international standards&rdquo;, and I spoke in support of the efforts of Secretary General Ban to establish a panel along these lines.   On 2 August the Secretary General announced the setting up of a 4-person Panel of Inquiry led by former New Zealand Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer, and crucially including members nominated by the Turkish and Israeli Governments, whose participation had been secured by the Secretary General. The Panel commenced work in August, and submitted a procedural report in mid September. In that report, Mr. Palmer stated that the Panel was operating successfully, and the members were working collegially and cooperatively.</P>
        <P>The work of the Panel is fourfold:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />To receive and review reports of the national investigations being conducted by Israel and Turkey</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />To request as necessary further information and clarifications from Israel and Turkey,</P>
    <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />To examine the facts, circumstances and context of the events, and</P>
 <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />To consider and recommend ways to avoid similar incidents in the future.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Panel is free to decide for itself how it will conduct its business and carry out these tasks. It is likely to be some months yet before the Panel will be in a position to submit a substantive report.</P>
        <P>A separate Fact Finding Mission established by the UN Human Rights Council reported on 22 September. I would expect that this report will also be taken into consideration by the Panel of Inquiry.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 107 and 110 together.</P>
        <P>Ireland is committed to the full realisation of all human rights, and to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, including the seventh Millennium Development Goal of reducing by half, by 2015, the proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water and sanitation.</P>
        <P>Through the Government&rsquo;s development programme Ireland is working with central and local Government in our Programme Countries, with civil society groups and with multilateral organisations to contribute to the achievement of this Goal.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland recognises that sustained and equitable access to water is not only a life-saving intervention in humanitarian responses but is critical in addressing the complex and multi-dimensional nature of poverty, especially in relation to child mortality, food security and gender equality. Last year, through the aid programme, Ireland provided &euro;12.6 million in direct support to water and sanitation activities through our Programme Countries and civil society organisations. In addition, significant funding was provided to multilateral organisations, including UNICEF, which have a strong focus on water and sanitation in their programmes.  As I informed the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs last week, Ireland was pleased to co-sponsor a Resolution on &lsquo;Human rights and access to safe drinking water and sanitation&rsquo; at the 15th   Session of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva last month. That Resolution was adopted by consensus.</P>
        <P>Two years ago, in 2008, the UN Human Rights Council adopted by consensus a Resolution which recognised the existence of human rights obligations relating to access to safe drinking water and sanitation. Ireland supported and co-sponsored that Resolution. The Human Rights Council appointed for a period of three years an independent expert, Ms. Catarina de Albuquerque, whose mandate includes the clarification of the content of human rights obligations, including non-discrimination, in relation to access to safe drinking water and sanitation, in cooperation with and reflecting the views of Governments and relevant United Nations bodies, and in further cooperation with the private sector, local authorities, national human rights institutions, civil society organisations and academic institutions. This process being conducted by Ms. de Albuquerque, which Ireland supports, has already produced some valuable insights into the issues involved. The process is based on inclusiveness and aims at allowing the emergence of a consensus within the international community.</P>
        <P>On 28 July 2010, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a Resolution on the human right to water and sanitation. The Resolution was adopted following a recorded vote of 122 in favour to none against, with 41 abstentions.  Ireland closely followed the negotiations on the draft Resolution sponsored by Bolivia and supported suggestions put forward by the EU that, in our view, would have resulted in a better and more balanced text and allowed the General Assembly to reach consensus on this very important issue. Unfortunately many of the EU suggestions were not taken into consideration. The final Bolivian text bypassed the Human Rights Council process and, arguably, prejudiced the outcome of that process, introducing division where consensus should have been sought.</P><Col N="116"/>
        <P>Following careful consideration within my Department and with other Departments, we did not feel that we could support in its entirety the final Bolivian text presented to the General Assembly.  Ireland, along with seventeen of our European Union partners, took the decision to abstain from voting on this issue.</P>
        <P>Ireland remains convinced that the only way to achieve real progress on access to safe drinking water and sanitation is to maintain consensus within the international community and we are committed to continuing to work in that direction with EU partners and the wider international community.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Taoiseach, Brian Cowen T.D., attended the 8th Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) Summit in Brussels from 4 to 5 October.  The overarching theme of the meeting was &lsquo;Quality of Life&rsquo;.    The ASEM Summit brought together the leaders of 46 countries, representing half of the world&rsquo;s GDP, two thirds of the world&rsquo;s population and almost two thirds of global trade.  New Zealand, Australia and Russia also formally acceded to ASEM at the summit.</P>
        <P>The Brussels meeting provided a valuable opportunity for the Taoiseach to engage informally with the leaders of all of Ireland&rsquo;s leading export markets in Asia, including China, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, Korea and India.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach addressed the summit session entitled &ldquo;Global Issues in Focus&rdquo;, at which leaders discussed a number of challenges including the fight against terrorism, piracy at sea and non proliferation. In his remarks at the summit, the Taoiseach highlighted Ireland&rsquo;s important role in promoting disarmament and the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, referring to the high priority which Ireland attaches to its work in this area. He welcomed the successful review conference of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in May of this year. Ireland chaired the body on the sensitive issue of the 1995 resolution calling for the establishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. He also referred to Ireland&rsquo;s key role in helping to secure a prohibition on cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians, and commended the achievement of the entering into force of the Convention on Cluster Munitions. He also welcomed the First Meeting of States Parties which will take place in November in the Lao People&rsquo;s Democratic Republic, a country which has suffered greatly from the effects of cluster munitions.</P>
        <P>There was also a discussion on human security issues, disaster prevention and relief together with reform of the UN system. Other sessions discussed global economic and financial governance, sustainable development, global and regional political issues and issues specific to ASEM.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Summit had a strong business focus, with dialogue between the leaders on the global financial and economic crisis. The Taoiseach had a meeting on Tuesday, 5 October with leading European and Asian business people, together with a briefing on the Asia Europe Business Forum which was held in parallel in Brussels on 3 and 4 October.  While in Brussels, the Taoiseach also attended an event organised by Enterprise Ireland targeting the healthcare sector in Belgium and the Netherlands.  Information technology in healthcare represents one of the fastest growing export sectors within the Irish economy and a number of Irish companies have successfully launched their products and services in Belgium and the Netherlands.</P><Col N="117"/>
        <P>I believe that the Asia-Europe Meeting is a valuable initiative, facilitating as it does high-level discussions and co-operation between Asian and European leaders on areas of common interest. Ireland is actively involved in the ASEM process and contributes to the ongoing dialogue and programmes, including those organised by the Asia-Europe Foundation, the sole physical institution of ASEM.</P>
        <P>I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate our Belgian colleagues on their successful hosting of the ASEM Summit and the wide range of parallel events.  The quality of the Chair&rsquo;s agreed statement and summit declaration, in the drafting of which Ireland was actively involved, was very high. The tone of the political aspects of the statement was very constructive, with agreement being reached on difficult subjects such as Burma/Myanmar, North Korea, the Middle East and Afghanistan.</P>

	<P>The Government remains closely engaged at both European Union and international level in monitoring the situation in Burma and in supporting the Burmese people in their struggle for democracy and human rights.    In relation to the upcoming elections scheduled to be held in November, the electoral laws published in March indicate that the regime intends to control every aspect of the election&rsquo;s preparation, outcome and the ensuing future government.  Instead of a free, fair and inclusive process, the elections, in my view, are likely to lack any real credibility. In their current form they seem intended only to maintain the regime&rsquo;s grip on the country.  </P>
        <P>Among the serious consequences of these laws are the restrictions placed on the registration of political parties and individuals, which have effectively forced Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy party, which has done much to promote justice, democracy and reconciliation in Burma, to disband as a political organisation.</P>
        <P>Notwithstanding the difficult position in which ethnic minorities and political parties have been placed by the actions of the regime, I note that some ethnic groups are working to try to take advantage of the possible opportunity afforded by the elections to secure representation in local and national legislatures. However, in spite of this sign of good faith by such groups, I am most concerned at reports that the regime has moved to stifle further the rights of minorities in the lead-up to the elections.</P>
        <P>At the recent ASEM summit, which the Taoiseach attended there was an agreed statement on Burma/Myanmar.  ASEM leaders called on the Burmese government to take necessary measures to ensure that the November elections were free, fair and inclusive and marked a step towards a legitimate, constitutional, civilian system of government.  They also sought the release of political prisoners and called on the regime to engage and cooperate with both the UN good offices mission and the international community.  The statement was a significant, positive step forward for this particular forum, which includes many neighbours and associates of Burma.</P>
        <P>I believe that a crucial element in the national reconciliation and democratisation process is the release without delay of all political prisoners, including Aung San Suu Kyi.  This could contribute to a new atmosphere in advance of the elections, allowing space for the initiation of a process of national dialogue and reconciliation, involving all opposition and ethnic groups.</P><Col N="118"/>
        <P>We also continue to support the good offices mission of the UN Secretary General and I call on the Burmese authorities to cooperate constructively with the mission and with his Special Envoy, Thomas Ojea Quintana.</P>
        <P>As the poll date draws nearer, I will continue to work closely with our European and international partners in support of human rights and democracy in Burma.</P>

	<P>Ireland played an important role in the negotiation of the Outcome Document for the MDG Review Summit which I attended at the United Nations in New York last month.  I am very pleased that the Outcome Document, which was adopted unanimously by the UN General Assembly, recognises that development policies and actions must focus on those living in the most vulnerable situations, including persons with disabilities.  It recognises that people living with disabilities must benefit from progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals.  It also highlights the need to provide more equitable access to economic opportunities and social services for persons with disabilities, including access to employment. </P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s approach to dealing with the issue of disability in the context of international development is guided by the 2006 White Paper on Irish Aid.  The White Paper recognises the inter-relationship between poverty and disability.  Disabled people are vulnerable to poverty and its effects.  At the same time, poor people are at risk of becoming disabled as a result of unsafe living environments, undernutrition, lack of access to immunisation, exposure to communicable diseases, and unsafe birthing services which endanger both mothers and babies.   Our development cooperation programme, which is managed by Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs, embraces the World Health Organisation&rsquo;s concept of disability as a complex phenomenon, which requires action across a diverse range of activities.  The aim is to ensure that disability is effectively prevented and that disabled people are not excluded or exploited.</P>
        <P>Since 2007, Ireland has provided over &euro;100 million annually for assistance in the areas of health, HIV and AIDS and communicable diseases.  We have focused this assistance on the world&rsquo;s poorest countries and communities, especially in sub-Saharan Africa.  We are making a very substantial contribution to the prevention of disability and to access to care through the provision of essential first-line services, vaccines and commodities.</P>
        <P>Ireland&rsquo;s support to basic education in developing countries also emphasises increased access for disabled and marginalised people.  We are also working in our Programme Countries to promote greater participation in politics and society by marginalised and excluded groups, including disabled people and those caring for the disabled.</P>
        <P>Ireland also provides significant direct support to development Non-Governmental Organisations working with disabled people and their carers.  These include Concern, Goal, Tr&oacute;caire, Christian Aid and Self Help Africa, all of which undertake significant health and human rights work that benefits disabled people.</P>
        <P>In addition, Irish Aid has established an important partnership with the International Labour Organisation which focuses on assisting people with disability and promoting legislation in relation to disability in Africa.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 112, 119, 123 and 394 together.</P>
        <P>The human rights situation in Iran has deteriorated significantly, from an already poor position, since the Presidential election in 2009. I am gravely concerned about the widespread, arbitrary and sometimes politically-motivated use of the death penalty in Iran, the possibility of execution by stoning, the execution of minors and the execution of members of minority communities. I am also extremely concerned about the continued repression of civil and political rights in Iran, including in relation to freedom of expression and assembly, arbitrary arrest and torture in detention. This highly targeted repression has been particularly stringent against members of Iran&rsquo;s religious and ethnic minorities, political activists, journalists and bloggers, human rights defenders and members of the legal profession in Iran who represent clients detained by the authorities. These actions are in clear violation of Iran&rsquo;s international obligations under the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights, of which Iran is a signatory. Many of these violations are described in detail in Amnesty International&rsquo;s report &ldquo;From Protest to Prison: Iran One Year after the Election.&rdquo;</P>
        <P>I drew attention to the deteriorating human rights situation in Iran in my address to the UN General Assembly on 27 September.  In my remarks, I called upon Iran to respect and fulfil the international obligations it has undertaken in the field of human rights, in both law and practice.  I referred to some profoundly disturbing recent instances of human rights abuses, including the appalling sentencing of Ms Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani to death by stoning for adultery. The case has also been raised with the Iranian Ambassador to Ireland by officials in my Department. Another case causing serious concern is the reported sentencing of Canadian-Iranian blogger Hossein Derakhshan to 19 years in prison for exercising his right to freedom of expression. I join the Canadian Government&rsquo;s calls for the Iranian authorities to respect Mr Derakhsan&rsquo;s legal rights, to allow him consular access and to release him and other dual nationals who have been unjustly detained.</P>
        <P>I have also made clear our concerns about the treatment of human rights in Iran in contacts with members of the Iranian Government, most recently at a meeting which I had with Foreign Minister Mottaki in Dublin on 9 June.  I have written to Foreign Minister Mottaki on a number of occasions to express my concerns about, and to raise specific aspects of, the human rights situation in Iran.</P><Col N="120"/>
        <P>Ireland has also been active in raising issues relating to human rights in Iran within the specific UN bodies which deal with human rights.   Along with our EU partners, we have traditionally supported the annual Resolution on the human rights situation in Iran which is adopted by the General Assembly.  In our national intervention at the just concluded UN Human Rights Council session in Geneva on 17 September, we raised concerns relating to the death penalty in Iran. I urge the Iranian authorities to introduce a moratorium on executions pending the abolition of the death penalty in accordance with UN General Assembly resolutions 62/149 and 63/168.</P>
        <P>The EU has also been pressing at the highest levels for Iran to abolish the practice of stoning and to meet its international human rights obligations.

	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 113 and 382 together.</P>
        <P>The number and frequency of disasters such as floods, drought, landslides and earthquakes has grown over the past decade and will increase further as a result of climate change and global warming. It is estimated that over 90 percent of disaster-related deaths occur in developing countries and it is the poorest who are typically worst affected.   Ireland has played a central role in efforts to reform and improve the effectiveness of the international humanitarian system since the Asian tsunami of 2004. The inability of the international community to more adequately and effectively cope with the scale of that disaster and its aftermath led to a comprehensive review of the response to humanitarian crises and the development of new coordination and funding mechanisms under the United Nations system. Ireland has been prominent in this process in both policy and financial terms and has been one of the main supporters of the UN&rsquo;s Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), a funding reservoir which can be drawn upon within hours of a disaster. Ireland has contributed &euro;76m to this fund since 2006. Ireland also strongly supported the development of a <i>Cluster System</i>   within the UN, which ensures that humanitarian agencies responding to a crisis do so in a coordinated fashion. More recently, as chair of the Good Humanitarian Donorship Initiative Ireland encouraged <Col N="121"/>greater cooperation between national governments as a means to ensure a more effective approach overall.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Government has also comprehensively reformed its own internal mechanisms since 2004 in order to better respond to humanitarian emergencies. Through the Irish Aid Rapid Response Initiative, Ireland can immediately deploy highly-skilled personnel and emergency supplies to a disaster zone within a relatively short time-frame following a crisis. We have also pre-positioned funding with a number of significant humanitarian NGOs such as Concern, Goal and Tr&oacute;caire which can be immediately released to support a crisis response.  In the days following the tragic earthquake in Haiti I attended an emergency meeting of Development Ministers and the February meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council. On each occasion I stressed to my EU colleagues the importance of an effective EU response to the situation in Haiti, within the overall coordination role of the UN. I subsequently attended an international conference on the reconstruction of Haiti in New York in March, at which I pledged &euro;12 million on behalf of the Irish people for the relief and reconstruction of Haiti. I also held talks with the then UN Humanitarian Coordinator, Sir John Holmes, on a number of ongoing humanitarian crises, such as Haiti, Chile and others and the lessons to be drawn from each.</P>
        <P>I witnessed the plight of the Haitian people at first hand when I visited the country in July of this year and held talks with Prime Minister Bellerive and UN officials. During the visit I visited a number of projects funded by the Irish taxpayer which are providing essential shelter and sanitation to thousands of destitute Haitians. We can all be proud of the contribution made by these projects and the many Irish people working with the UN and other agencies in Haiti.</P>
        <P>Ireland was also one of the first countries to respond to the ongoing flooding in Pakistan and to date the Government has committed nearly &euro;2.6m to the relief effort &mdash; one of the largest per capita international contributions to date. This included our largest ever airlift to date of humanitarian supplies, providing shelter and water and sanitation equipment for 33,000 people. I met the Ambassador of Pakistan to Ireland, Mrs Naghmana Hashmi, to discuss Pakistan&rsquo;s needs and also convened an emergency meeting of Irish humanitarian agencies responding to the crisis to ensure a seamless Irish response.</P>
        <P>The reform of the international humanitarian system continues to be a work in progress and with each crisis lessons are drawn and systems refined or improved. Ireland has been central to this process and we will continue to work to maximise both the impact of our humanitarian aid for beneficiaries and value for money for the Irish taxpayer.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>As I outlined in my address to the United Nations General Assembly on 27 September, Ireland believes strongly in the need for reform of the United Nations. Ireland has actively championed the reform agenda at the UN in recent years and will continue to do so.    In terms of the UN&rsquo;s development architecture, Ireland is particularly supportive of the &lsquo;Delivering as One&rsquo; approach at country level and has provided over &euro;6 million to date in support of UN System Wide Coherence and the Delivering as One programme. Under Ireland&rsquo;s co-chairmanship (with Tanzania) at the close of the 2007-2008 UN General Assembly, a consensus resolution was passed which gave broad support to the Delivering As One approach and helped to advance its agenda. </P>
        <P>The &lsquo;Delivering as One&rsquo; approach is yielding significant positive results, including greater coherence in UN development activities and improved delivery of services at the country level. It has also directly contributed to the establishment of the new, consolidated UN agency pro<Col N="122"/>moting gender equality, UN Women, which I warmly welcome. Ireland is committed to supporting this important new body within the UN system, as it works to enhance the rights and well-being of women worldwide.</P>
        <P>As regards the Security Council, Ireland is supportive of reform of the Council so that it better reflects twenty-first century realities and in order to improve its effectiveness and transparency. Ireland supports the constructive ongoing work of the intergovernmental deliberations currently taking place in the General Assembly on Security Council reform. I have called for these deliberations to be intensified with a view to identifying whether there is a model for Security Council reform which can command broad consensus.</P>
        <P>The UN itself needs to exert stronger budgetary controls over all its operations and this is something which Ireland and our EU partners are actively promoting. There is a particular need to review the current methodology for apportioning UN expenses in order to make it more properly reflective of capacity to pay. This is an issue which Ireland and its EU partners have highlighted in recent years and which we will continue to follow closely. I look forward to positive results emerging from the review of the existing Scale methodology which the General Assembly has been mandated to carry out.</P>
        <P>On disarmament, there is growing international concern that the global disarmament machinery is not working as it should, and this is a concern I fully share. Last month I participated in a High Level Meeting in New York, convened by the UN Secretary-General, to examine how the work of the Conference on Disarmament could be revitalised. The meeting also looked at the workings of other bodies with disarmament responsibilities, principally the UN Disarmament Commission, and the First Committee of the General Assembly. In March, I addressed the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva and expressed my deep disappointment that the Conference has not managed to engage in substantive work for almost 15 years. I made clear in New York that this state of affairs cannot be allowed continue. This view is widely shared by our EU partners and other Western States, but I have to say that it is not universally shared. Secretary General Ban is now to ask his Advisory Board on Disarmament Matters to undertake a thorough review of the issues raised at the High Level Meeting, with a view to considering what further actions may be necessary.</P>
        <P>In terms of reform of UN structures pertaining to climate change, the Governing Council of the United Nations Environment Programme decided to establish, at its 11th Special Session in February 2010, a consultative group of ministers or high level representatives whose mandate is to consider the broader reform of the international environmental governance system. Ireland supports the ongoing reform process and I look forward to the group&rsquo;s final report to be presented to the Governing Council&rsquo;s 26th session in February 2011.</P>
        <P>I also look forward to a successful outcome to the negotiations on climate change at the 16th Conference of the Parties later this year and to the discussion on the institutional framework for sustainable development, one of the main themes of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development to be held in Rio de Janeiro in 2012.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Finding a solution for our undocumented citizens in the United States remains an important priority for this Government. The Government is also committed to working with our friends in Congress to enhance Ireland&rsquo;s <Col N="123"/>bilateral visa arrangements with the US through the establishment of an E-3 type reciprocal visa facility. This would be a two year renewable working visa scheme. In addition, I look forward to the continued development of the new working holiday programme.   I am very much aware of the difficulties confronting undocumented Irish citizens in the United States and the distress which both they and their families in the US and Ireland experience arising from their situation. I would urge anybody who might be tempted to follow in the footsteps of the undocumented to take account of their plight.</P>
        <P>My Department, and the Embassy in Washington in particular, continues to work proactively with the US Administration, Congressional leaders and Irish immigration reform advocates, to make positive progress on this important issue. Immigration reform legislation requires the approval of both Houses of Congress in the US &mdash; it is not merely a matter of bilateral engagement between the two Governments.</P>
        <P>Immigration reform is a very sensitive political issue.  Most recently, in September, the Congress considered a bill concerning young people brought to the United States by their elders and who remain undocumented. That bill [the so-called DREAM Act] failed to advance in the Senate when the bill to which it was attached did not achieve sufficient votes.</P>

        <P>President Obama has repeatedly reiterated his commitment to resolving this issue, urging Congress to &ldquo;work together to fix our broken immigration system&rdquo;. In his comprehensive speech on the issue delivered in Washington in July, he signalled his willingness to move forward and shape a &ldquo;practical, common-sense approach&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>Earlier in the year, President Obama welcomed what he described as the strong outline proposal for reform presented at the end of April by senior Democratic Senators Harry Reid, Charles Schumer, and Robert Menendez. Following active engagement with our friends in Congress, this proposal, based on previous bi-partisan co-operation, included provision for a path towards the regularisation of the status of the undocumented, including the Irish. The outline proposal also specifically included provision for an E-3 visa arrangement for Irish citizens.</P>
        <P>On 30 September, prior to the current Congressional recess, Senator Robert Menendez published an immigration reform bill that includes an E-3 provision for Ireland. Although the publication of this bill is only the first step in a long process, the inclusion of an E-3 scheme at this stage is an important achievement for the Government and the Irish community. While I am encouraged by these developments, very considerable political challenges remain,   particularly in an election year.</P>
        <P>The Government will continue to maintain very close contact with the US Administration and Congress, as well as with Irish community advocates, to address this issue in the period ahead.  We are also providing practical assistance to support the efforts of organisations working for emigrant reform in the US.  Emigrant Support Programme funding of $40,000 was allocated to Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform in 2010 to support their activities, taking their total ESP funding since 2006 to $325,000.  Funding of $10,000 was also allocated in 2010 to the Chicago Celts for Immigration Reform bringing the total received by that organisation to $20,000.  </P>

	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 116, 130 and 135 together.</P>
        <P>Ireland played an important international role at the Millennium Development Goals Review Summit in New York last month in cooperation with our EU partners, with the US Administration and with our partner countries in the developing world.  The Government is committed to working in close cooperation with our partners in order to achieve the ambitious development goals established by the international community for the period 2000 to 2015.  We are committed to the UN target to provide 0.7% of Gross National Product to Official Development Assistance (ODA) by 2015.  The EU has committed to collectively meeting the UN target by 2015, and has set an interim target of 0.51% for Ireland and other Member States in 2010.</P>
        <P>This year, the Government is providing a total of &euro;671 million for ODA.  On current projections, this will amount to at least 0.52% of GNP, exceeding the EU interim target.  Last year, Ireland was the seventh most generous aid donor in the world in per capita terms.  We are ahead of most other EU Member States in our progress towards the achievement of the international ODA target in 2015.</P>
        <P>The economic crisis of the past two years has required very difficult decisions across all areas of public expenditure, including the allocations for ODA.  The sole motivation for these decisions has been the need to restore stability to the public finances, in order to create the conditions for a resumption of economic growth.  Stable public finances and sustained growth in our own economy are the indispensable bases for the resumption of sustainable growth in the aid programme.  Deputies are aware of the extent of the challenge facing the Government in framing the Budget for 2011.  Decisions in relation to ODA will be taken in the light of our commitment to restoring growth to the Irish economy and to playing our part in the effort to achieve the MDGs.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s aid programme is the Irish people&rsquo;s aid programme.  We can be justifiably proud that it continues to receive strong international recognition for its quality and effectiveness and for its sharp focus on the poorest countries and communities in sub-Saharan Africa.</P>
        <P>ODA is an essential element, but not the sole element, in a country&rsquo;s contribution to international development and the achievement of the MDGs.  The global economic crisis has simultaneously increased the needs of the poorest countries and the pressure on aid budgets across the developed world.  In these circumstances, it is clear that we must focus rigorously on the effectiveness of the aid we provide, and on key priorities.  In Ireland&rsquo;s case, we are taking an international lead on the global hunger crisis and have been recognised by the OECD as champions in making aid more effective and working in a spirit of genuine partnership with our Programme Countries.  Just last week, the influential Centre for Global Development in Washington recognised Ireland as among the best donors in the world across all measures of quality of aid provided.  The Government is committed to maintaining the high quality of Ireland&rsquo;s aid programme, and its focus on the fight against global poverty and hunger, so that <Col N="125"/>we make a strong national contribution to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.</P>

	<P>The European Union enjoys a long and close relationship with Turkey. Accession negotiations were opened in 2005 and Ireland continues to make a constructive input to on-going negotiations.     As a beneficiary of a past enlargement, and on the experience of more recent accessions, Ireland is broadly supportive of enlargement. The prospect of enlargement bolsters economic and political reform processes and helps to promote stability, security and prosperity in Europe.  The process includes rigorous conditionality and must take into account the capacity of the EU to integrate new members. Enlargement has to be negotiated and, as in any negotiation, the eventual outcome and timeframe cannot be predicted.</P>
        <P>These factors shape Ireland&rsquo;s approach to Turkey&rsquo;s candidacy. There are, in addition, potential gains to the single market and to trade through the accession of a country of Turkey&rsquo;s size. The Union&rsquo;s reach and influence in the Middle East and Central Asia could be enhanced through Turkish accession.</P>
        <P Just="Left">However, Turkey still has substantial work ahead in meeting the established criteria and conditions for membership, in particular, acceptance of the terms of the Ankara Protocol. Progress in the negotiations has been disappointingly slow.  Successive European Councils have highlighted Turkey&rsquo;s continued non-compliance with its obligations under the Ankara Protocol by continuing to refuse to open its ports and airports to vessels and aircraft from the Republic of Cyprus.  The Council decided in 2006 that eight chapters of the accession framework could not be opened and no further chapters would be provisionally closed until Turkey fulfils its commitments in this regard.  These measures remain in place. The matter is kept under review by EU Ministers in the Council, most recently at their meeting last December.  We will do so again before the end of this year. An Intergovernmental Conference with Turkey at Ministerial level was held in June, where enlargement was reviewed.  At the bilateral level I met with Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, in Dublin on 10 March 2010. In the course of that meeting, Minister Davutoglu outlined the progress Turkey has made on reforms in a number of areas as it has sought to bring Turkey more in line with the EU <i>acquis</i>. He explained how the accession negotiations provide a strong incentive for Turkey to pursue reforms, strengthen democracy and human rights and further modernise the country.  While much has been achieved in Turkey in these areas, the challenge is now for Turkey to maintain and accelerate the progress on reforms.</P>
        <P>I reiterated to Minister Davutoglu Ireland&rsquo;s support for the Turkish candidacy.  At the same time, I noted the Council&rsquo;s deep regret at Turkey&rsquo;s continued non-compliance with its obligations under the Ankara Protocol and I highlighted the need for Turkey to make progress towards normalisation of its relations with the Republic of Cyprus.</P>
        <P>When I met with Minister Davutoglu more recently, in the margins of the UN General Assembly in New York in September, I again stressed the importance of making progress on the Cyprus issue and emphasised once more the need for Turkey to comply with its obligations under the Ankara Protocol.</P>
        <P>Minister for EU Affairs and Chief Negotiator, Mr. Egemen Bagis, plans to visit Dublin in November and we look forward to discussing further the progress Turkey has made in reforms following passage of the recent referendum on constitutional reform, and the challenges which still lie ahead.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 and 129 together.</P>
        <P>I utterly condemn the incident which took place on 5 October.  As I noted in my subsequent public statement, this futile, destructive attack on the economic infrastructure in Derry took place at a time when the community is working hard to attract jobs, tourism and investment into the region. I know that great disruption was experienced by local residents and by many throughout the city who struggled to get to work and school the next morning. I would like to extend my best wishes for a quick and full recovery to the PSNI officers who sustained injuries while carrying out their duties in the area, protecting the local residents and serving the community.</P>
        <P>The British and Irish Governments and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the PSNI have, over many years, developed strong and effective cooperation methods to combat the threat from those misguided few who would seek to disrupt the future for all our young people.</P>
        <P>The devolution of policing and justice powers to Stormont, which itself sent a powerful message to such self-delusionists that progress would not be impeded by their actions, has consolidated the good cooperation on these issues, not only between the police services, but also between other areas of our respective criminal justice systems.</P>
        <P>A number of high-level meetings have taken place in recent weeks which give a good indication of the ongoing joint efforts being made by the British and Irish Governments and the devolved administration to tackle those who would seek to undermine the peace.  I held useful discussions with the Secretary of State, Owen Paterson in Belfast on 11 October and also in Dublin on 19 September.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Dermot Ahern, hosted the first trilateral meeting with his counterparts from Northern Ireland and Scotland, Minister of Justice, David Ford and Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Kenny MacAskill in Dundalk on 27 September, which was followed swiftly by the Eighth Annual Organised Crime Cross Border Seminar, held in Belfast earlier this month and attended by Minister Ahern and Minister Ford, the Garda Commissioner and the Deputy Chief Constable of the PSNI.</P>
        <P>All these meetings have been in addition to regular ongoing liaison between our respective officials, including through the British Irish Intergovernmental Secretariat in Belfast and our Embassy in London and also directly between the two police services. I would assure the Deputies that we remain united in our determination to ensure these activities by so-called dissident republican elements are countered at every turn.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 124 and 136 together.</P>
        <P>The Government remains concerned about the political and human rights situation in Sri Lanka. In August, the Member States of the European Union, including Ireland, decided to suspend special duty-free access given to Sri Lankan exports under the Generalised System of Preferences &mdash; the so-called GSP plus. This suspension came after the Sri Lankan authorities failed to deliver a written undertaking on three human rights conventions dealing with torture, children&rsquo;s rights and civil and political rights.  The estimated cost of the suspension to Sri Lanka is &euro;360 million a year.</P>
        <P>At the same time Ireland supports the continuation of a constructive dialogue with Sri Lanka about the particular steps which Sri Lanka must take to implement the three conventions to allow GSP plus to be re-instated.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A critical issue in the dialogue has been the treatment of members of the Tamil population. The most recent EU humanitarian report, issued in June on the subject, indicated that there were 56,825 Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) in the Vavuniya camp and 10,500 former Liberation Tamil Tigers of Ealam (LTTE) fighters held in closed rehabilitation camps.  The report stated that 246,967 individuals had been released from these camps and that, although the remaining IDPs now enjoy greater freedom of movement within the camps, conditions were understood to be deteriorating.  Concerns had been raised that conditions could push refugees out of the camps and force them to return to unsafe areas.  More broadly, the question of national reconciliation remains of the upmost importance as there is a possibility the conflict could resume if the grievances of the Tamil population are not addressed.  A key question relates to the autonomy of the northern Tamil province. The Sri Lankan Government has consistently stated that the basis for future arrangements will be the 13th Amendment of the Constitution, which sets out a model for devolved administration to the provincial level.  However, the Sri Lankan Government has said that the process of establishing devolved government in the North cannot begin until certain pre-conditions have been met, including, <i>inter alia</i>, the clearance of all land mines and the return of Internally Displaced Persons.</P>
        <P>Since the fighting ended, there have also been allegations of war crimes and human rights abuses levelled at both parties to the conflict.  In 2010, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon appointed an expert panel to investigate the allegations and report back to the UN with their findings.  The panel is chaired by Marzuki Darusman, the UN&rsquo;s special rights investigator to North Korea.  The other two members are Yasmin Sooka, a South African and former member of the commission which investigated apartheid atrocities, and Steven Ratner, a US lawyer. I have called upon the Sri Lankan Government to cooperate fully with this UN panel.</P><Col N="129"/>
        <P>I note that in September the President, Mr. Mahinda Rajapkse, sanctioned the imprisonment for three years of Mr. Sarath Fonseka, a former army commander and defeated candidate in the 2010 presidential election, on charges of committing military offences. The charges included engaging in politics while on active duty and of corruption related to arms procurement contracts.  Fonseka, who had led the army&rsquo;s campaign against the LTTE, claims the charges are politically motivated. I have asked my officials to continue to monitor this case carefully.</P>

        <Quest>  his views on the pressure the Irish Government has brought on the Cambodian authorities to allow for democratic practices; if in view of reports of mistreatment of opposition MPs admonitory action is being proposed by the international community, for example, in the area of development aid contributions.  </Quest>

	<P>Notwithstanding some progress, Cambodia`s compliance with international civil and political human rights standards and norms continues to be a cause for concern.  This concern has heightened in recent years with the trend of prosecution on defamation charges of representatives of the opposition, media, trade unions and human rights organisations. The opposition leader, Sam Rainsy, has been the target of efforts to suppress his activities and those of his party. In 2005, he was forced to leave the country after being stripped of his immunity from prosecution and was found guilty, in absentia, on defamation charges.    In October 2009, the National Assembly approved laws that restrict the freedom of assembly and expression.  Authorities in Phnom Penh have outlawed demonstrations except at the officially designated &ldquo;Freedom Park&rdquo;.  In March 2010, under pressure from foreign donors, the lower house approved an anti-corruption law, fifteen years after it was first proposed, that has resulted in the anti-corruption council and other bodies becoming answerable to the officials they are supposed to be monitoring.  </P>
        <P>At the same time, Cambodia has undoubtedly made progress in addressing some of the critical issues from its past, not least regarding the work of the Extraordinary Chambers of the Courts in Cambodia (ECCC) better known as the Khmer Rouge Tribunal. The tribunal&rsquo;s first conviction was in July 2010 when &ldquo;Comrade Duch&rdquo; was sentenced to 35 years in prison for crimes against humanity in the murder of 14,000 Cambodians.</P>
        <P>Support has been provided by the EU for legal reform and governance in Cambodia in addition to EU programmes in agriculture and rural development, basic education, culture, environment, gender, health, infrastructure, public financial management, tourism, trade and private sector development. We will continue, together with our European Union counterparts, to monitor developments in Cambodia carefully and at the same time will work closely together to support the implementation of a comprehensive agenda of reform. This must include protections for civil and political rights in accordance with accepted international standards.</P>
        <P>Ireland was actively involved in the drafting of the resolution on Cambodia at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva. The resolution covers a number of issues related to Cambodia`s adherence to international civil and political human rights standards.</P>

        <Quest>  the position taken by Irish representatives on the appropriate poverty reduction target indicator during the negotiations around and formulation of the EU2020 strategy; if he is concerned that member states may cherry pick from the indicators to allow for minimal poverty reduction effort in real terms and to make a statement on the outworkings of the EU2020 strategy.  </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the new Europe 2020 Strategy which was adopted by the European Council on 17 June and the Government fully support the core elements<i>.</i> I believe that the Strategy will provide an essential framework for action by the EU and Member States to achieve higher levels of sustainable jobs and growth as economic recovery is secured.   As the Deputy is aware, the European Council has agreed five headline targets in the areas of: employment; research and development, including innovation; climate change and energy; education; and social inclusion, in particular poverty. The target envisaged under the new Europe 2020 Strategy which aims to promote social inclusion is framed in terms of poverty reduction targets. Its purpose is to measure progress in reducing poverty and in ensuring that the benefits of growth and jobs are shared. </P>
        <P>The June European Council agreed a numerical target to lift 20 million people out of the risk of poverty and exclusion by 2020. The population &lsquo;at risk of poverty and exclusion&rsquo; is defined by three indicators: at-risk-of-poverty; material deprivation; and low work intensity. This gives a total figure for the EU of 122 million people at risk of poverty and exclusion. This numerical target places the focus firmly on lifting people across the EU out of poverty and exclusion. Such a focus greatly lessens the possibility of any statistical ambiguities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In support of the EU-wide target, Member States are required to set national targets using appropriate indicators which take into account national circumstances and priorities. This approach allows each Member State to reflect national policy priorities and/or to build on national targets, if these are already in place. Each Member State will consider how their national targets will contribute to the achievement of the EU target in dialogue with the Commission.   As the Deputy is aware, Ireland already has a national poverty target which is set out <Col N="131"/>in the <i>National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007- 2016</i>. The target is based on the consistent poverty indicator, which is the combination of both at-risk-of-poverty and material deprivation. The aim is to reduce poverty to between 2 &mdash; 4 per cent by 2012 and to eliminate it by 2016. The Irish approach aims to target those who experience multiple forms of poverty and exclusion in order to ensure that policies are focused on improving the living conditions of the most vulnerable.</P>
        <P>Work is ongoing to set an Irish national poverty target that will build on the Government target in the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016 and will contribute to the Europe 2020 Strategy. The Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs, Pat Carey, T.D, has sought the advice of an expert group, including representatives of the Social Partners, on how best the Irish national target can contribute to the attainment of the EU target by 2020. Proposals on the national poverty target will shortly be brought to Government.</P>
        <P>Work on the identification of each of Ireland&rsquo;s national targets under each of the five EU headline targets is well underway. Officials from the European Commission visited Ireland on 27-28 September to discuss national targets and potential bottlenecks. A follow-up meeting in Brussels between Irish and Commission officials took place on 5 October. Following these most constructive bilateral exchanges, work is progressing on the finalisation of national targets under each of the five EU headline targets. These national targets will serve as an important element in the preparation of an initial draft of Ireland&rsquo;s National Reform Programme, which is to be prepared by mid-November 2010. It is currently anticipated that final agreement on our National Reform Programme will be reached by April 2011. It is expected that the European Council will take stock of progress under this Strategy at its meeting in December.</P>

The renewal of settlement construction has threatened the continuation of those talks, which should be the first priority of both Israelis and Palestinians, and I urge that it be renewed by the Israeli Government.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>Natural disasters of the type recently seen in the mudslides in Colombia and Mexico are hugely challenging events for the populations affected on the ground.  Families lose their homes and livelihoods, children lose their schools and, with them, their vital access to education and essential services like hospitals and transport links are disrupted.  In this case, sadly, thirty people lost their lives in Colombia.  On many occasions, countries have the capacity to respond themselves.  In others, <Col N="132"/>they seek outside assistance from the international community.  To date, neither Colombia nor Mexico has requested international assistance in the context of the current mudslides.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Ireland provides pre-positioned support with a range of partner humanitarian organisations giving them the flexibility to respond quickly when such emergencies occur.  This includes support for the UN Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), to which Ireland has contributed &euro;76 million since 2006, and the International Red Cross Disaster Relief Emergency Fund.  Ireland also provides standby funds to a number of NGOs to enable them, in turn, to provide a response to particular sudden-onset emergencies.</P>
        <P>Ireland keeps its Rapid Response Corps on standby at the disposal of international organisations like the UN and NGOs which can call on the support of individual Corps members where their skills are required.  Ireland has pre-positioned stockpiles of emergency humanitarian supplies for delivery as needed in response to emergencies, as has been done on a significant scale in 2010 in relation to Haiti and Pakistan.  We keep in close contact with our contacts in the UN, Red Cross movement and NGO partners in the context of deciding which situations require our assistance.</P>
        <P>In the longer term, Ireland is involved in significant efforts at an international and local level to integrate disaster risk reduction approaches to our work in development assistance.  Such approaches stand the best chance of equipping local populations with the capacity to withstand such natural disasters and the skills to cope when they strike.  International studies show that for every &euro;1 spent on disaster risk reduction, &euro;7 is saved in emergency relief responses.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PeterPowerFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Peter Power</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government is committed to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the third of which is to promote gender equality and empower women.  We recognise that achieving equality between men and women is crucial to poverty reduction, and to international development.  Of the 1.3 billion people living in poverty across the world, 70%  are women. Women work two-thirds of the world&rsquo;s working hours.  They produce over half of the world&rsquo;s food, and yet they earn only 10% of the world&rsquo;s income and own less than 1% of the world&rsquo;s property.</P>
        <P>In recent months, Ireland made a strong contribution to the negotiation of the Outcome Document of the Millennium Development Goals Review Summit, which was adopted unanimously by the UN General Assembly last month.  I welcome its strong affirmation that achieving gender equality and empowerment of women is both a key development goal in itself and an important means for achieving all of the other MDG.  In this context, the establishment of UN Women, the new United Nations body for the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women, is particularly important. Ireland   played an active role in the intergovernmental negotiations to establish UN Women, and I welcome the appointment of the former Chilean President, Michelle Bachelet, to head it up. The Government&rsquo;s aid programme is informed by the Irish Aid Gender Equality Policy, approved in 2004, which focuses on the achievement of gender equality as an essential component of sustainable human development.  We are working in partnership with Governments in our Programme Countries, with communi<Col N="133"/>ties and civil society organisations and with the main multilateral agencies in order to advance gender equality in developing countries.</P>
        <P>I would cite a number of important examples from our partner countries.  In Zambia, the primary school enrolment rate for girls increased to over 92% in 2008 as a result of policies implemented by the Ministry of Education with support from Irish Aid and other donors.    In Sierra Leone, Irish Aid is supporting centres which help survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault. Since 2003, more than 6,000 women have been assisted at these centres. In Timor Leste, during the 2007 national elections, we worked with the UN to support women&rsquo;s electoral participation, and women now hold 30% of seats in the national parliament.  As a key element in our focus on the global hunger crisis, we are also working to increase the productivity of smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa.  80% of farm work in the region is carried out by women.  In Uganda, for instance, we have worked with the Government to ensure that the land law which is being developed protects and promotes women&rsquo;s access to land.  As an element in Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to the achievement of the third MDG, a National Action Plan on UN Security Council Resolution 1325, on Women, Peace and Security, is currently being developed, in consultation with civil society.   The Resolution calls for an increase in the participation of women in peace-making and peace-building processes.  It focuses on the protection of women and girls in armed conflict, and it calls for the incorporation of a gender perspective into peacekeeping and peace-building.  Through the Conflict Resolution Unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Ireland has also developed an innovative cross-learning initiative on women, peace and security involving participants from Northern Ireland, Liberia and Timor-Leste.</P>
        <P>The Government will continue to place a high priority on gender equality and women&rsquo;s empowerment as we work with our partners towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals.</P>

	<P>The annual General Debate at the UN General Assembly is a valuable opportunity for each Member State to address the wide range of issues and concerns facing the UN and its members.    In my address to the Assembly this year, I raised a broad range of issues of concern to Ireland and the international community, including the ongoing requirement for UN reform; the need for decisive international action to combat hunger and poverty (in which connection I co-hosted a successful event focusing on improving child nutrition with Secretary of State Clinton on 21 September); and nuclear <Col N="134"/>disarmament and non-proliferation, following on the important role played by Ireland in ensuring a successful outcome to last May&rsquo;s NPT Review Conference. </P>
        <P>In terms of regional issues, I addressed the situations in Sudan and Burma, as well as that in the Middle East Peace Process. In relation to the Middle East, I chose to address in a positive manner the real chance for a lasting peace which now exists, and to commend, encourage and support the Israeli and Palestinian leaders in their current negotiations to that end.  My remarks on Iran covered both the nuclear issue and the deteriorating human rights situation in that country.

	<P>Ms. Mairead Maguire was refused entry to Israel on 28 September on arrival at Ben Gurion Airport on a flight from Frankfurt. The basis for refusal was that she had been previously deported from Israel, most recently in June 2010 following her detention at sea on board the <i>Rachel Corrie</i>. She appealed this decision to the Central District Court and subsequently to the Supreme Court of Israel. Both Courts explored the possibility of a compromise solution, but no formula acceptable both to the Interior Ministry and to Ms. Maguire could be agreed.   The Irish Embassy in Tel Aviv extended full consular assistance to Ms. Maguire during this period, making contact with her, with her lawyers and her family and other concerned parties, visiting her on a number of occasions in detention, and attending both the District and Supreme Court hearings.</P>
        <P>Both courts found that she had been previously deported, and should not therefore have attempted to re-enter Israel without applying for the lifting of the barring order resulting from this deportation. On this basis, the refusal of entry was confirmed, and she was put on a plane leaving Israel on 5 October. It appears that the courts in both instances did not wish this episode to be regarded as a further deportation, and no costs were awarded against her.</P>
        <P>The Embassy has followed this case carefully, and it is clear that due process was correctly observed, and that both courts considered the case carefully. However, I have previously made clear, both here in the Oireachtas and to the Israeli authorities, my view that any accusation of entering Israel illegally in relation to the flotilla episode was unjustified, as neither she nor the other participants had entered Israel voluntarily on that occasion. Should Ms. Maguire now apply for permission to enter Israel, I would therefore urge the Israeli authorities to allow her to do so.</P>

	<P>Globally, there are seventy eight countries where individuals may still face criminal sanctions on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity.  A significant number, though not all, of these, are in Africa.    Ireland is among those countries that have been active at the United Nations and internationally in promoting recognition of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights, and most recently on 17 September 2010 we co-organised a High-Level event at the Human Rights Council in Geneva entitled &ldquo;Ending Criminal Sanctions on the Basis of Sexual Orientation&rdquo;.  Speaking at the event, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ms Navi Pillay, said that ending criminalisation on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity is an important step towards countering discrimination and homophobia.  UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon and Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu sent messages calling for an end to human rights violations directed against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will recall that in recent months there were two specific high profile cases which arose in Malawi and Uganda.  In Malawi the Government is carrying out a thorough review of the entire penal code and all laws, including those on homosexuality, are being examined.  The review will assess compatibility with the Constitution of Malawi and the country&rsquo;s international treaty obligations.  Ireland, together with its EU partners, will continue to seek the repeal of legislation which discriminates against homosexuality.</P>
        <P>In Uganda the draft Anti Homosexuality Bill 2009 is still at committee level in the Ugandan Parliament and has not been enacted into law.  Members of the Uganda Human Rights Commission visited Ireland recently and discussed this and other issues with officials.  The Commission is mandated with the function of recommending to Parliament effective measures to promote human rights and to monitor government&rsquo;s compliance with international convention obligations on human rights, and it is also engaged on this issue.</P>
        <P>Our Embassies in Malawi and Uganda, and our other Embassies in Africa, will continue to monitor developments in this area and to make known the views of the Irish Government on the need to respect international obligations and vindicate fundamental human rights.</P>

Since that time, I have met the High Representative regularly, including at meetings of the monthly Foreign Affairs Council and at informal &lsquo;Gymnich&rsquo; meetings of EU Foreign Ministers. I have also spoken with HR Ashton directly by telephone on a number of issues of importance to Ireland and officials from my Department are in regular contact with her Office.   Most recently, I met HR Ashton at the Gymnich meeting in Brussels on 10 &mdash; 11 September, which focussed on the EU&rsquo;s relations with its strategic partners, the humanitarian crisis in Pakistan and the EU&rsquo;s cooperation on foreign policy with Turkey. HR Ashton then attended the European Council on 16 September for a session focussed on EU strategic <Col N="136"/>relations, which built on discussions at the Gymnich. I accompanied the Taoiseach to the Council meeting, and participated in that session. </P>
        <P>In addition, I was in New York for Ministerial week at the UN General Assembly last month, and met HR Ashton on several occasions, including in the context of EU-US and EU-Russia Ministerial meetings.</P>

	<P>The events to which the Deputy refers occurred on Thursday 30 September in Quito, when President Correa was assaulted by police officers demonstrating against a proposed law relating to their benefits and salaries. The President was subsequently confined by a group of police demonstrators in a Quito hospital until released through the intervention of the Armed Forces. Five persons were reportedly killed in the course of these altercations, and 38 people were wounded. A State of Emergency was instituted for seven days which has now expired in all areas except the capital.   As soon as the disturbances broke out, a special session of the Permanent Council of the Organization of American States (OAS) was convened, and a statement was issued in support of constitutional government in Ecuador. On 1 October, an extraordinary session of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) was held in Buenos Aires, and a statement was issued in support of President Correa and his administration.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>The Censuses of Population between 1926 and 1991 were taken under the Statistics Act 1926, which prohibited the release of any data collected under the Act. The Statistics Act 1993 repealed the 1926 Act and allowed for the release of information collected on census forms 100 years after the date of the relevant Census.</P>
        <P>The retrospection entailed by the introduction of the 100 years exemption was seen by some as undermining the original confidentiality guarantee. However, it was generally accepted as a reasonable compromise between guaranteeing statistical confidentiality and giving access for genealogical research given that relatively few persons would still be alive 100 years after being enumerated in the relevant census.</P>
        <P>It would be totally inappropriate to reduce the 100 year threshold to 85 years as suggested by the Deputy as this would entail releasing the personal details of approximately 50,000 living persons aged 85 years and over who would have been enumerated in 1926 census.</P>
        <P>As the guarantee of statistical confidentiality is the cornerstone of all CSO surveys it is important that it is strictly observed. Otherwise there would be a high likelihood of a negative impact on response rates, not alone to the forthcoming census in April 2011 but also to other surveys covering households and businesses.</P>
        <P>Consequently, the Government does not have any plans to amend the Statistics Act 1993 through the reduction of the 100 years threshold.</P>

      <Speaker pid="JohnCurranFF"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy John Curran</NameTxt>
	<P>The official source of unemployment estimates for the State is the Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS). Estimates from the QNHS are available for each quarter since the first quarter of 1998, prior to that annual estimates of unemployment were available from the LFS on an annual basis. These estimates are based on internationally recognised standards for the <Col N="138"/>measurement of the labour market status of individuals. These standards were developed by the International Labour Office (ILO) and allow comparison of key indicators in relation to the labour market for different countries. They also ensure that the measurement of unemployment is done on a consistent basis over time and thus an accurate trend is presented. Within the ILO framework a person is regarded as unemployed if they have not undertaken any paid work in the reference period and are actively seeking and available for employment.</P>
        <P>As the ILO standards were only established in 1982 estimates of unemployment on an ILO basis are only available from 1983 on. Prior to 1983 estimates were based on respondents self-reported principle economic status (PES).</P>
        <P>The highest unemployment rate recorded since 1980 was 17.1% in 1986.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government established a Working Group on D&aacute;il Reform in 2009, comprising Minister Dempsey, Minister Ahern, Senator Dan Boyle and my predecessor as Government Chief Whip, Pat Carey. Following a number of meetings, this Group submitted a set of proposals to Cabinet for discussion and agreement. </P>
        <P>The proposals agreed at Government were brought before the relevant forum of the D&aacute;il Committee on Procedure and Privileges Sub-Committee on D&aacute;il Reform.  I believe that those proposals put forward by the Government represent an honest effort to make the working of this House more relevant and more efficient. They set out a new D&aacute;il schedule which would better reflect the normal working day and they accommodate some of the key concerns set out by the Opposition in the various policy documents which they have released on this issue.</P>
        <P>As you will be aware, a general agreement and consensus was not possible on the proposals brought forward by Government.  It is in this context that I am continuing my engagement with the various Party representatives on the Sub-Committee with a view to achieving the highest possible level of cross-party consensus in relation to proposals for the reform of D&aacute;il procedures.</P>
        <P>Of course, I do recognise the ongoing calls by Deputy Finian McGrath and others in relation to the availability of speaking time in the D&aacute;il for Independent Deputies.

	<P>At end September 2010, 7,614 of a total 18,380 apprentices were registered by F&Aacute;S as being redundant.  Of this number, 4,320 can progress in their apprenticeship having reached the minimum qualifying standard at the relevant training phase while 3,294 must first successfully pass their outstanding assessment(s) to permit similar progression. F&Aacute;S has introduced a number of measures to date which have assisted over 4,000 redundant apprentices with on and off-the-job training.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The rules for off-the-job training have been amended to permit redundant apprentices to progress to their next off-the-job training phases. Of those apprentices registered as redundant at end September, 2,439 had completed off-the-job training and 955 are currently attending off-the-job training.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The Redundant Apprentice Placement Scheme was introduced in April 2010 to provide opportunities to redundant apprentices to complete on-the-job training at Phase 3, 5 and 7.  The scheme provides a weekly subsidy of &euro;250 to the employer towards employment costs.  At end September 2010, 258 had commenced their on-the-job training phase, of whom 17 had completed the relevant phase.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />ESB Networks are providing on-the-job training to 252 eligible redundant electrical and motor mechanics apprentices in 2010.  At end September 2010, 189 redundant apprentices had completed the training with 63 currently in training with ESB Networks.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />F&Aacute;S has also developed Phase 7 Equivalent off-the-job assessments for redundant apprentices for the trades of Carpentry &amp; Joinery, Electrical, Plumbing, Brick &amp; Stonelaying and Cabinet Making, where Phase 7 assessments cannot be undertaken on-the-job. At end September 2010, 91 redundant apprentices had completed the assessments and a further 52 are scheduled to take the assessments.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Redundant apprentices may also avail of existing specific skills training courses and evening courses available at F&Aacute;S Training Centres to enhance their employable skills. At end September 2010, some 1,133 course places have been availed of by redundant apprentices to date in 2010.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Under the EU Leonardo Da Vinci III Life Long Learning Programme, L&eacute;argas in collaboration with F&Aacute;S, has supported 25 redundant apprentices to complete on-the-job training overseas.  Eighteen redundant apprentices are currently in on-the-job training overseas and 17 redundant apprentices will be scheduled for on-the-job training in the first half of 2011.</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />At end September, 9 redundant apprentices formerly employed by S.R. Technics had commenced Phase 5 and 7 on-the-job training with the Air Corps and a further 9 are scheduled to commence in November. FAS, in consultation with the Department, continues to examine further potential measures to facilitate the progression and completion of apprenticeships including possibilities for on-the-job placements with public sector employers. </P>

	<P Just="Left">It is the responsibility of the Board of Management of schools to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act, 1998. In the case of community colleges, the board of management is a sub-committee of the relevant Vocational Education Committee (VEC).  The acts of any subcommittee of a VEC are subject to confirmation by the VEC concerned.  In accordance with section 15 (2) (d) of the Education Act 1998, a function of a board of management in a VEC school is to publish, in such manner as the board and the VEC considers appropriate, the policy of the school concerning admission.</P>

	<P>The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for the relevant grant awarding authority, i.e. the applicant&rsquo;s local authority or VEC. An applicant may appeal the decision to the relevant local authority or VEC. Where an awarding authority rejects an appeal, the student may appeal this decision to my Department by submitting an appeal form clearly outlining the grounds for the appeal. Unless and until, an applicant makes an appeal to my Department, it would not be aware of the grounds for a refusal, however, the grant awarding authority provides this information to an applicant when issuing him/her with the outcome of his/her grant application.   The applicant in question has not made an appeal to my Department.  The Deputy will appreciate that, given my Department&rsquo;s role in the appeals procedure, direct liaison with the grant awarding authority on the details of an individual case would not be appropriate.</P>

	<P>I can confirm that the school to which the Deputy refers has made an application to my Department for large scale capital funding. The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned a Band 1.2 rating.  There are four band ratings under the prioritisation criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest. Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my <Col N="143"/>Department&rsquo;s website.  Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including this project, is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie. The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of the Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the Department&rsquo;s capital budget, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of a project at the school in question at this time. In the meantime, it is open to the school authority to apply to my Department for funding for temporary accommodation to meet its immediate needs.</P>

	<P Just="Left">Speech and language support therapy is provided by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to school children who have been assessed as having communication difficulties. The Education (Amendment) Bill 2010 provides for an amendment to the Education Act 1998 to clarify the position in relation to the delivery of speech therapy and other health and personal services to students of school-going age.  The proposed provisions will not impact on the availability of speech therapy services for children with special educational needs through the HSE. The Department of Education and Skills commitment to support the co-ordinated delivery of services to families of children with special educational needs is not diminished and the Department will continue to work with service providing partners in the health and disability sectors.   Additional funding of &euro;7.2 million for disability was provided to the HSE in Budget 2009 for the provision of 90 additional therapy posts. These posts are targeted to support children with disabilities of school-going age and include speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists. Recruitment for these posts is ongoing.   The HSE will continue to work with funded specialist providers and in co-operation with the education sector to address the health related needs of children with special educational needs in the context of the resources available.</P>

	<P>The Labour Market Activation Fund is designed to assist in the creation of innovative training and education provision by private, not-for-profit and public sector providers. It is targeted at specific priority groups among the unemployed, namely the low skilled, and those formerly employed in declining sectors &mdash; construction, retail and manufacturing sectors &mdash; with part<Col N="144"/>icular emphasis on the under 35s and the long-term unemployed. Following an open tender competition in which 370 tenders were received, offers of funding were initially made to 26 organisations across the private, not-for-profit and public sectors to support specific training and education programmes for the priority groups. An additional allocation of &euro;12 million has been made available to the Fund, raising it to &euro;32 million in all.  This has enabled the Department of Education and Skills to offer funding to 33 additional projects. This will bring to almost 60 the number of projects throughout the country being supported by the Fund. The commitment of additional monies to the Fund recognises the quality and diversity of the programmes tendered, and the overall level of demand evident for these programmes, and will bring to 12,000 the total number of places available to the unemployed supported by the fund. Tenders to the Fund were assessed by an independent evaluation committee who scored each tender under a number of selected criteria. Those tenders that scored the highest in relation to the criteria were offered contracts. To ensure that programmes who receive funding are meaningful and will offer a qualification to individuals, programmes financed under the Labour Market Activation Fund are accredited by FETAC/HETAC or a recognised industry certification body. Participants who successfully complete the programmes will receive recognised certification. These programmes will provide an opportunity for unemployed individuals to enhance their career prospects in a meaningful and realistic way and will provide a stepping stone for these people to pursue a career in their chosen profession. </P>

	<P>The Forward Planning Section of my Department has carried out a study of the country to identify the areas where, due to demographic changes, there may be a requirement for significant additional school provision at both primary and post-primary levels over the coming years. This study has been conducted using data from the Central Statistics Office, the General Register Office and the Department of Social Protection and with reference to recent schools&rsquo; enrolment data.  School accommodation requirements in the area referred to by the Deputy have been considered as part of this study and initial analysis indicates there will be no requirement for significant additional accommodation in the short to medium term. It is not envisaged that the school referred to will be re-opened.</P>

	<P>I can confirm that the school to which the Deputy refers made an application to my Department for large scale capital funding for an extension. The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned a band 2.4 rating. Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed appli<Col N="147"/>cations for major capital works, including the project referred to by the Deputy, is available on the Department&rsquo;s website at www.education.ie.  The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners. There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest. Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on the Department&rsquo;s website.  The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of the Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.</P>

	<P>My Department is aware of the difficulties that have arisen between the school in question, the building contractor and the Consultant Architect that has resulted in delaying the satisfactory conclusion of this project.</P>
        <P>The bulk of the funding due for payment under the terms of the contract between the school and the contractor for this project has issued to the school on foot of appropriate certification that certain works have been completed. This is a normal requirement before funding can be provided in relation to school projects.</P>
        <P>The dismissal of the Consultant Architect by the school authority has created difficulties in relation to final certification of the satisfactory completion of the project and, consequently, payment of the balance of funding due. Officials from my Department have visited the school and my Department will be in contact with the school management authorities again shortly to invite them to a meeting to discuss their ongoing difficulties.</P>

	<P>My Department has reviewed the requirements for establishing independent residency and is satisfied that the current practice in this regard is both reasonable and appropriate. In this regard, the documentary evidence normally required by a local authority or VEC to establish independent residence for mature students includes utility bills, such as telephone, gas or electricity bill, evidence of registration with the Private Residential Tenancies Board or official documentation received at the address, for example, from a Government Department.</P>
        <P>In exceptional circumstances, where it is not possible to produce such proofs of residence in the relevant period for demonstrable reasons, the awarding authority may, at its discretion, agree to accept other documentary evidence that provides an acceptable degree of proof of independent living in the relevant period. For example, while an affidavit, if accompanied by other supporting documentation, may be considered as evidence of independent living, an affidavit in isolation is not considered acceptable as sole proof of residency.  Individual circumstances should be discussed by an applicant with his/her grant awarding authority.</P>

	<P>Under the terms of my Department&rsquo;s Post Primary School Transport Scheme, a pupil is eligible for school transport if s/he resides 4.8 kilometres or more from her/his local post primary education centre. Children who are fully eligible for transport to the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside, may apply for transport on a concessionary basis to a post-primary centre outside of their own catchment area &mdash; otherwise known as catchment boundary transport.  However, the pupil referred to by the Deputy, in the details supplied, resides less than 4.8 kilometres from his local post primary centre and is therefore not eligible for school transport.</P>

	<P Just="Left">I propose to take Questions Nos. 188 and 189 together.</P>
<P>When the moratorium was introduced the Government exempted Principal and Deputy Principal posts in all primary and post-primary schools and these continue to be replaced in the normal manner. The impact of the moratorium is therefore limited to the Assistant Principal and Special Duties allowances payable to teachers on promotion. Vacancies at Assistant Principal and Special Duties level arise due to retirements in these specific grades and typically also from the knock on effect of filling Principal and Deputy Principal posts. What the school loses is the capacity to make a promotion by awarding the extra pay allowance to another teacher. The position whereby around 50% of all teachers have promotion allowances is simply not sustainable. Some further limited alleviation was announced in July for schools that are acutely affected by the impact of the moratorium at Assistant Principal level. The alleviation arrangements are set out in the published Department Circular 42/2010. Applications for alleviation have also been received from over 110 primary schools and these are currently being examined and prioritised and the schools will be advised of the outcome in the coming weeks. </P>

	<P>A former worker of a company who is deemed eligible for EGF is not required to pay any fees or charges for participation on accredited education and training courses during the period covered by EGF funding.  The Higher Education Authority is providing all relevant third level institutions with guidance in relation to EGF issues.  The individual should therefore contact the institution concerned directly with any queries in relation to EGF funding for a third level course.  An EGF information event will be run on 20 October 2010 to further inform redundant S R Technics workers of EGF co-funded services being made available. All eligible redundant workers will be contacted directly in this regard.  </P>

	<P>A project for the school referred to by the Deputy is currently at an advanced stage of architectural planning. Contrary to the information provided, the design team are currently working on completing a revised stage 2(b) submission which will be submitted to my Department for technical review when completed. The school have recently advised my Department that the design team anticipate forwarding the submission later this month. Following receipt and review of the stage 2(b) submission, the further progression of this project will be considered in the context of my Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme for 2011 and subsequent years. However, it is not possible to give a more indicative timeframe for the progression of the project to tender and construction at this time.</P>

	<P>I can confirm that the school to which the Deputy refers made an application to my Department for capital funding for major capital works in September 2010. This application is currently being assessed and it will be assigned a band rating in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects.   The school&rsquo;s application was accompanied by a submission and consultants&rsquo; reports. My Department is considering this submission with a view to formulating the most effective accommodation solution to meet the school&rsquo;s long term needs. The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of the Department&rsquo;s multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of the Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.</P>

	<P>The appointment of teachers to fill teaching posts is a matter for the individual school authority subject to agreed procedures. It is the policy of my Department that only qualified personnel should be employed by schools. This policy is reflected in Circular 40/2010 which my Department issued earlier this year. Under its terms, schools are directed to ensure that teachers proposed for appointment to publicly paid teaching posts are registered with the Teaching Council and have qualifications appropriate to the sector and suitable to the post for which they are proposed. Where an employer can satisfactorily demonstrate that every reasonable effort has been made to recruit an appropriately qualified and registered teacher, an unqualified and/or unregistered person may be recruited pending the recruitment of an appropriately qualified and registered teacher and this provision must be inserted in the employment contract. The employer must repeat the process to recruit an appropriately qualified and registered teacher within the period of any such contract and in any event within the school year.  In addition, the recently published Education (Amendment) Bill contains an amendment to section 30 of the Teaching Council Act 2001.  This amendment confers on the Minister the power to regulate the limited and exceptional circumstances in which a person who is not a registered teacher may be employed and the conditions attaching to that person&rsquo;s employment.</P>

	<P>Forward Planning Section of my Department has carried out a study of the country to identify the areas where, due to demographic changes, there may be a requirement for significant additional accommodation in future years. Following this detailed analysis it appeared prudent to plan for the establishment of new schools to commence operation in September 2010 to meet increasing demand in certain identified areas. There was detailed consultation during 2009 with all patrons in relation to the areas under consideration.</P>
        <P>There was a specific application for the establishment of a new gaelscoil in the area referred to by the Deputy. However, after detailed analysis of the increase in pupil numbers for September this year and of the capacity in existing schools it was not necessary to establish a new school to cater for the demographic increase. My Department was satisfied that the existing schools could cater for the projected increase in demographics in September 2010.  This situation in relation to the requirement for the additional school provision in the area will be reviewed for September 2011 in light of needs and consultation with the patron bodies.</P>

        <P>In accordance with the published criteria for large scale building projects, the project for this school has been assigned a Band 2 rating.

	<P>The Youthreach programme funded by my Department provides an integrated programme of education, training and work experience to young people who have left school early without any qualifications or vocational training.  There are almost 6,000 places available nationwide. Almost 3,700 of these are operated by VECs in around 100 Youthreach centres and the majority of the remainder are operated by F&Aacute;S in around 30 Community Training Centres (CTCs). Participants are paid a training allowance and are eligible for a range of additional allowances (meal, travel, long-term unemployment bonus). They are also eligible for child care support.</P>
        <P>The Youthreach programme aims to provide early school leavers (15-20 years) with the knowledge, skills and confidence required to participate fully in society and progress to further education, training and employment.  Youthreach offers learners an opportunity to undertake learning at various levels including:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Junior Certificate;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Leaving Certificate Applied;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Leaving Certificate;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />FETAC Levels 3 and 4;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Pre-apprenticeship programmes.</P>
<P FLI="0" el="5">The total funding provided to F&Aacute;S and VECs in 2009 under the Youthreach umbrella was of the order of &euro;120 million. This includes the cost of participant allowances, staff costs and other non-pay costs, including the current level of rents.</P>
        <P>The project referred to by the Deputy receives funding from my Department through the Back to Education Initiative (BTEI) programme.  Funding has been approved each year commencing in 2002.  The Project provides a Leaving Certificate programme to learners that includes English, Maths, History, Geography, Art and Music.  A total of &euro;35,677 was provided to the project in 2009 for its activities which provided a service to 42 participants. Funding in the current year is being maintained at this level.</P>

	<P>Under the terms of my Department&rsquo;s Free Fee Initiative the Exchequer meets the cost of tuition fees in respect of eligible students who are pursuing full-time undergraduate courses of study which are a minimum of two years duration in an approved institution.  Under the scheme rules students, who have previously pursued but have not completed a course of third level study and subsequently resume third level studies, are not eligible for free fees for the equivalent period of time spent on the first course of study where the course concerned has attracted exchequer funding,  including tax relief on course fees, subsidy towards course costs etc. Part-time and evening students are comprehended by this rule. Where undergraduate students do not meet the eligibility criteria of the Free Fees initiative such students must pay the appropriate tuition fee as determined by the third level institution. However, tax relief, can be claimed for tuition fees paid in respect of approved undergraduate courses at approved colleges of higher education in the State and any other E.U. Member State. </P>

	<P>I wish to advise the Deputy that the enrolment of a child in a school is a matter in the first instance for the parents of the child and the Board of Management of a school. My Department has no role in relation to processing applications for enrolment in schools.  The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which assists parents who are experiencing difficulty in <Col N="167"/>securing a school place for their child. The NEWB will try to help parents to find an alternative school placement if their child has been unable to secure a placement to date.</P>
        <P>Under the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, the NEWB is charged with ensuring that every child receives an education. As part of this remit it must ensure the registration of children who receive their education through home settings. This requirement exists in order to support parents in their right to home educate and to safeguard a child&rsquo;s right to a minimum education.  I am informed by the NEWB that the parent of the child in question has applied to the NEWB to have the child registered as being in receipt of home education.</P>
        <P>The Deputy may also be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible for the provision of a range of educational services at local and national level for students with special educational needs. In particular, its network of Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) co-ordinates special needs education provision at local level and arranges for the delivery of special educational services.  They act as single points of contact for parents of students with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department&rsquo;s criteria in allocating educational support.</P>
        <P Just="Left">All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child&rsquo;s special educational needs, using the contact details available on <i>www.ncse.ie</i>.</P>

        <P>Overall indications of interest and applications from would-be programme participants to date confirm the popularity of courses on offer.

A number of programmes from the first call of the Fund are still in the process of recruiting participants and it is expected that these programmes will be up and running before the end of the year.  Until all programmes are up and running it is extremely difficult to assess accurately the exact number of places that have been filled.</P>

        <Quest> if he will provide a net figure on the difference between the overall indebtedness of the State to the banks covered by the guarantee scheme, by reason of their purchasing of Government debt, and the overall indebtedness of the covered banks to the State; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The Central Bank of Ireland publishes data on domestic institutions (note that this includes both institutions covered by the guarantee schemes and other domestic institutions).  This data states that the total securities issued by general government held by these domestic institutions totalled &euro;9.3 billion at end August 2010.  With regard to the indebtedness of credit institutions, I assume that the Deputy is referring to monies which the covered institutions will pay back to the State.</P><Col N="168"/>
        <P>In the case of Bank of Ireland, a substantial portion of the initial &euro;3.5bn preference share investment has been converted into ordinary equity and there are &euro;1,837m preference shares remaining.  The terms on which the preference shares were issued provide for full repayment to the Government.  In the case of AIB, the Government retains its &euro;3.5bn holding in preference shares.  In my recent statement on the capital position of Allied Irish Banks, I announced that the NPRFC will underwrite a placing and open offer of &euro;5.4bn.  If necessary, the NPRFC&rsquo;s underwriting commitment will be satisfied by the conversion of up to &euro;1.7bn of its existing preference shares in the bank into ordinary shares along with a new cash investment for the balance of &euro;3.7bn in ordinary shares.  This transaction structure assumes the sale of AIB&rsquo;s stake in M&amp;T Bank and disposal of other assets in due course.  In the event that the bank&rsquo;s residual capital requirement is not met through asset sales by 31 March 2011, any shortfall will be met by the conversion of a proportion of the remaining &euro;1.8bn of preference shares.</P>
        <P>In relation to the EBS, the Society is in discussion with a number of parties about its future and any adjustment in its capital need that arises will be accommodated in the outcome of those discussions in due course.  The injections into Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society are classified as capital transfers and as such are not a directly returnable investment.</P>

	<P>While attending at the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Innovation on 21 September, Mr Trethowan informed the Committee <Col N="169"/>that &ldquo;Approximately 20 applications have been sent to the office for review, of which we have dealt with about ten, of which five have been upheld.&rdquo;  It is important to be clear that Mr Trethowan does not offer loan assistance, he can only make a recommendation after his review and the bank is not obliged to follow it.  However as Mr Trethowan told the Committee, the banks have followed his recommendations to date.  These figures have not significantly changed since then.</P>
        <P>The Credit Review Office has also formalised the internal review process within the two main banks and a number of refusals are being overturned by this process without ever going for review.

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 215 and 234 together.  In Budget 2010, I announced the Government&rsquo;s intention to launch a National Solidarity Bond, the purpose of which is to allow citizens an opportunity to invest and provide money to the State to stimulate economic recovery and to assist in the maintenance and creation of employment. The necessary legislative basis was provided in this year&rsquo;s Finance Act and the Bond was launched on Tuesday 4 May.  I am informed by the National Treasury Management Agency that, at close of business on Friday, 8 October, a total of some &euro;255 million had been invested in the Bond by almost 11,500 customers.  The Bond is part of the Government&rsquo;s State Savings schemes managed by the National Treasury Management Agency.  The proceeds of the Bond are used to fund the Exchequer and form part of the National Debt.</P>

	<P>The Income Levy is collected by the Revenue Commissioners as a component of Income Tax.  In Budget 2010, it was forecast that Income Tax receipts of &euro;11,530 million would be collected in 2010 and it was projected that the yield from the Income Levy would account for about &euro;1&frac12; billion of the overall amount forecast for Income Tax.  The 2010 Budget and Revised Estimates for Public Services 2010 provided for the following receipts: PRSI &euro;7,072 million and Health Levy &euro;2,431 million.</P>
        <P>As I announced earlier this month in relation to the end-September Exchequer Returns, Income Tax receipts remain behind target, reflecting labour market developments, which may also be affecting PRSI and Health Levy receipts.  The implications of a shortfall in receipts for the end year position are currently being examined.  Projections for 2011 are currently being compiled in the context of the formulation of the Government&rsquo;s four-year budgetary strategy, which will be published in the first half of November.</P>

	<P>The full year gain to the Exchequer from increasing the current standard rate of corporation tax from 12.5 per cent to 15 per cent is tentatively estimated to be about &euro;590 million. The gain includes the effect of increasing the standard rate for manufacturing companies from 12.5% to 15%, with the termination of the 10% rate of corporation tax for these companies taking effect from 31st December 2010.  While this estimate is technically correct it does not take into account any possible behavioural change on the part of taxpayers as a consequence of such an increase which is likely to be very significant and could cancel out any potential increase in the overall yield.</P>
        <P>It should also be noted that Ireland&rsquo;s low Corporation Tax (CT) rate plays an important role in attracting foreign direct investment to Ireland thereby increasing employment here.  We also must consider Ireland&rsquo;s place in the new enlarged EU where CT rates are low in some new member states.  Ireland must continue to remain competitive in this environment.  For these reasons it is essential that we maintain our present low CT rate.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the basis for any estimate of the corporation tax yield from the action suggested by the Deputy would be the corporation tax returns filed for the year 2008 (the latest year for which such information is available).  Assuming that the proposed additional tax rate would apply to the same taxable income of financial institutions to which current corporation tax rates apply, it is tentatively estimated that the full year yield to the Exchequer from imposing an additional tax rate of 12.5% could be of the order of &euro;1.6 billion.</P>
        <P>While this estimate is technically correct, it does not take into account any behavioural change on the part of taxpayers as a consequence of such a measure which would be a significant factor given the scale of the increase suggested in the question.  The mobile nature of financial services is such that it is very likely that much, if not all, of the international activity, in particular, being undertaken here would take flight. It should also be noted that corporate profitability in the financial sector is likely to have fallen since 2008 to the extent that the estimated yield from this measure in current terms would be lower than the figure given by reference to 2008 profits.  I have already highlighted, in separate replies to questions from the Deputy and others relating to the 12.5% rate, the huge importance to Ireland&rsquo;s international competitive position of maintaining this rate.</P>

I would point out that the lowest income households tend to be more dependent on solid fuels such as coal and peat. In that regard the carbon tax has yet to be applied to those products.  There is ongoing progress by the relevant agencies <Col N="171"/>under the remit of the Department of Energy, Communications and Natural Resources to target low income households for energy efficient investment.</P>

	<P>My view is that creating certainty is of utmost importance; if consumers are clear as to their future income prospects then the need for precautionary saving will be reduced.  As it stands there is no doubt that the savings rate is relatively high, thus displaying an element of caution by some in society.</P>
        <P>As has been previously stated, this Government remains fully committed to bringing the deficit below 3% of GDP by end-2014, and in so doing sustainability will be achieved.  As part of this process a four-year plan is being prepared and will be published in the first half of November.  This plan will set out the revised annual headline targets and the necessary annual adjustment, and in this regard help create greater levels of certainty for all.</P>
        <P>The Government has reacted in a timely fashion to the deterioration in the public finances and the worsening global economic environment.  Since July 2008, five sets of consolidation measures have been implemented.  This approach is designed to ensure that the public finances remain on a sustainable path and, as a result, consumers have greater certainty regarding future income prospects.  This timely and decisive approach has contributed to improving consumer confidence.  The Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes remains a key point of reference for the Government in considering its overall approach to consolidation.</P>

        <Quest> the action he proposes to take regarding vehicle registration (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[35912/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that on the introduction of vehicle registration tax (VRT) on 1 January 1993, there was a <Col N="172"/>requirement for all vehicles to be presented for examination prior to registration.  However, by the early years of this decade, the Revenue Commissioners had adopted a risk-based approach to the registration of vehicles, thus eliminating the need for all vehicles, save those that posed a serious risk of loss to the Exchequer, to be examined prior to registration.  While this risk-based approach proved satisfactory to protect the VRT yield, it meant that a significant number of the used vehicles entering the State were being registered in the State without prior examination.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that Revenue, as the registration authority for the State, also has a responsibility to ensure that all vehicles presented for registration are registered correctly.  This responsibility became more onerous with the transposition into Irish law in March 2009 of EU Directive 2007/46/EC, which laid down minimum European vehicle standards as a pre-condition for registration.  While the Directive impacts only on new passenger cars at present, its scope will be extended to all vehicles by 2014.  Additionally, other EU Directives will extend obligations on the registration authorities of all Member States to examine all vehicles prior to registration.</P>
        <P>In addition to the EU vehicle inspection requirements mentioned above, concerns were raised by members of the Oireachtas, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Road Safety Authority regarding the provenance and safety of some of the used vehicles presented for registration.  To address these concerns, the Government decided to make legislative provision to allow for the appointment of a competent person to carry out a pre-registration examination on all vehicles presented for registration.  The intention of the relevant law was to ensure that all the conditions necessary for the registration of a vehicle and the proper administration of VRT are complied with before a vehicle may be registered in the State.</P>
        <P>Thus, section 131 of the Finance Act 1992 (as amended by section 104 of the Finance Act 2010) provided for the appointment of a &ldquo;<i>competent person&rdquo;</i> to carry out certain functions relating to the registration of vehicles in the State on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners, while section 109 of the Finance Act 2010 provided for the authorisation of such competent person in respect of the collection and payment of the tax to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P>The requirement to have all used vehicles presented for pre-registration examination has presented some new challenges for both Revenue and the competent person appointed to carry out these functions, namely, the NCTS.  In consultation with other stakeholders, e.g. the Society of the Irish Motor Industry (SIMI), the Farm Tractor &amp; Machinery Trade Association Ltd.(FTMTA), Revenue and the NCTS are facing these challenges and have implemented some revised procedures to speed up the registration process.  For example, the NCTS have recently put procedures in place to provide additional capacity in their centres, including extending the opening times in some centres and the configuration of two additional centres for registration purposes in order to address current delays.  Revenue are examining the possibility of providing electronic facilities for the registration of used vehicles that have been subjected to a pre-registration examination.</P>
        <P>Revenue is confident that with the implementation of these and other similar initiatives, an efficient user-friendly service will be available to all persons requiring vehicle registration, notwithstanding the fact that the vehicle will, in all cases as provided for in legislation, have to be presented for examination prior to registration.</P>

	<P>In my statement on banking on the 30th of September I set out a number of measures which are intended to reduce uncertainty in relation to the remaining transfers of bank assets to NAMA.    The Government has decided after consultation with the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator, the European Commission and the NAMA Board that loans scheduled for transfer from AIB and Bank of Ireland are to be limited to debtors whose total exposure is above a threshold of &euro;20 million. It is considered that smaller loans below this threshold would be better managed through the banks&rsquo; branch networks and through local banking relationships. This change should also facilitate the completion of all NAMA transfers by year end. I have been advised by NAMA that there are 650 debtors with property-related debts of between &euro;5m and &euro;20m in these two banks accounting for &euro;6.6 billion of NAMA eligible loans. As a result, NAMA now estimates that total loans with a nominal value of &euro;73.6 billion will transfer for a consideration of &euro;30.7 billion.</P>
        <P>With the detailed loan-by-loan data available to NAMA from the transfer of the first two tranches and supplemented by information now available to it on the remaining loans, NAMA has been able to refine to a reasonable degree of accuracy its estimates of the discounts on the remaining loans to be transferred. NAMA has provided me with the estimated discount per institution on the remaining loans, as included in the following table.</P>

	<P>Many of the details sought, by the Deputy, are contained in the bank&rsquo;s published Half Year Financial Report as at end June 2010.  The relevant references in the financial statements are contained in the section entitled &ldquo;Notes to the Interim Financial Statements&rdquo; at Note numbers 22 and 23 (pages 72 to 80 inclusive) and Note number 26 (pages 82 &mdash; 84 inclusive). Some of the data requested is commercially sensitive and, as the Deputy will appreciate, is not available publicly for reasons of confidentiality and the relevant rules and regulations which apply to a listed company.    The representation of AIB as a &ldquo;soon-to-be-nationalised&rdquo; institution is inaccurate.  It is expected that, as a consequence of the decisions taken regarding the bank recently, the State may acquire a majority shareholding in AIB. It is intended that this recapitalisation will be undertaken in such as way that the bank will retain its market listing, with further details to be provided in due course in the prospectus.</P>

My Department officials also have ongoing contact with officials in HM Treasury and the Department of Finance and Personnel in Northern Ireland in relation to a range of matters.   The Deputy will also be aware that Budget 2011 is a matter for the Irish Government.</P>

        <Quest>   if his attention has been drawn to recent newspaper articles (details supplied) where the use of patent schemes for paint <Col N="176"/>tin lids were used for tax avoidance or evasion purposes; if he will have the matter investigated; if he will bring in amending legislation if this is found to be necessary; and if he will make a statement on the matter.   </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The newspaper articles referred to in the question deal with the concerns raised by certain shareholders in a company about aspects of a royalty payment apparently made in respect of a patent. The Deputy raises the issue of possible tax avoidance or evasion. I am not in a position to comment on that aspect or on the tax affairs of the company in question which are confidential to it and the Revenue Commissioners. I have, however, brought the Deputy&rsquo;s question to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners.   Section 234 Taxes Consolidation Act (TCA) 1997 provides for a tax exemption for income received by an individual or company from a qualifying patent subject to an annual limit of &euro;5 million and certain conditions. Section 141 TCA provides a tax exemption for distributions paid by companies from tax-exempt patent income, subject also to certain limits and conditions. The patent income exemption scheme has been in place for over 30 years and the rationale behind the scheme is to encourage research and development and to stimulate inventive activity to the benefit of the economy.  Royalty payments qualifying for relief under the scheme must not exceed that which would be payable on an arm&rsquo;s length commercial basis. The relief is also subject to restrictions on the use of tax reliefs by high-income individuals which were introduced in the Finance Act 2006. The ability of high-income individuals to avail of tax reliefs was further restricted in this year&rsquo;s Finance Act. </P>
        <P>Changes have been made to the scheme over the years to counter attempts to use the scheme for tax avoidance purposes. If any abuses come to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners which they are not in a position to deal with under existing legislation, I will have no hesitation in changing the legislation governing the scheme to bring such abuses to an end.</P>

        <Quest>   if registered charities are to be expected to pay full VRT and VAT in purchasing vehicles or equipment specifically required to carry out their charitable work.   </Quest>
        <QRef>[36149/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that with regard to vehicle registration tax (VRT), Section 131 of the Finance Act 1992 requires that vehicles used by State residents must be registered in the State. However, there are a number of occasions where an exemption or relief from the payment of VRT tax may apply.  One such relief in respect of VRT and VAT, subject to certain conditions, is provided for <Col N="177"/>in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations.   Statutory Instrument No. 353 of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994 (Regulation 12) sets out the medical criteria, certification procedures and repayment limits under this Scheme.</P>
        <P>Representatives of charitable organisations may wish to examine the above Regulations in order to ascertain whether or not their organisation is eligible under this Scheme. In that regard, such representatives should contact Revenue&rsquo;s Central Repayments Office, M: TEK II Building, Armagh Road, Monaghan (Telephone 047 62100). The Deputy may also wish to note that comprehensive information relating to the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers relief provisions is set out in an information leaflet entitled <i>Drivers and Passengers with Disabilities &mdash; Tax Relief Scheme </i>which is available in the VRT section on the Revenue website at   www.revenue.ie</P>
        <P>VAT is chargeable on most vehicles and equipment.  Where a charity is engaged in economic activities and its turnover from these activities exceeds certain thresholds it must register for VAT.  VAT-registered persons are entitled to claim credit for VAT charged on their inputs that relate to their economic activities, subject to some exceptions. A specific exception is that VAT-registered persons cannot claim the VAT charged to them on the purchase of a motor vehicle designed or constructed for the conveyance of 16 or less persons (inclusive of the driver) by road.</P>
        <P>There is no general provision for relief for VAT charged to charities that are not registered for VAT.   However, given the broad nature of the Deputy&rsquo;s query he may wish to give specific details to facilitate a detailed reply.</P>

        <Quest>   the recommendations in the Commission on Taxation report that he has so far accepted as policy and which of these he has implemented.   </Quest>
        <QRef>[36345/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>The Commission on Taxation was established in 2008 to carry out a comprehensive review of the tax system.  It submitted its report in <Col N="179"/>September 2009.  The report has a total of 250 individual recommendations covering income tax, capital, corporation, property and carbon taxes.  A comprehensive overview of the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations was prepared by my Department for the Tax Strategy Group which is available on www.finance.gov.ie/documents/tsg/2009/09.05.pdf.</P>
        <P>Of the total of 250 recommendations some simply set out general principles of policy while 51 recommended no change to the current situation.  A number of recommendations have been implemented such as those relating to further restriction of tax reliefs for high earners, changes to remittance, a windfall CGT rate on rezoned lands, corporate tax holiday for new businesses and a carbon reduction orientated car scrappage scheme to name but a few.  Other recommendations will be kept under review on an ongoing basis.  I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to two areas.</P>
        <P>Firstly the Deputy will be aware that the report of the Commission on Taxation made 111 recommendations on tax expenditures.  The Report recommended that 23 expenditures should be abolished or otherwise modified; five of these were subsequently abolished in the 2010 Budget.  The yield from this abolition amounts to &euro;40m in a full year, the majority of which relates to service charges (&euro;23m) from 2011 onwards.  Further abolition of expenditures will be considered in the context of Budget 2011.</P>
        <P>The measures that were abolished were:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Capital Allowances for child-care facilities</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Income Tax relief on service charges</P>
      <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Tax relief provided for long term care policies</P>
       <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />BIK relief relating to the loan of certain art objects</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Modification of residence requirements for donors of property to the State</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">A further 31 recommendations made by the Commission proposed changes to the existing tax treatment of certain schemes.</P>
        <P>The remaining 51 recommendations propose that there be no change in the current tax treatment of the expenditures concerned at the time of the Commission&rsquo;s Report.</P>
        <P>Secondly,   I announced in Budget 2010 that a carbon tax at a rate &euro;15 per tonne would be introduced on fossil fuels. It should be noted that a carbon tax came into effect on 10 December 2009 in respect of petrol and auto-diesel and from 1 May 2010 to kerosene, marked gas oil (also known as &lsquo;green diesel&rsquo; or &lsquo;agricultural diesel&rsquo;), liquid petroleum gas (LPG), fuel oil and natural gas.</P>

        <Quest> the number of dental practitioners who have ceased business to date in 2010; her view on whether cutbacks to the dental treatment benefit scheme and dental treatment services scheme have been primarily <Col N="181"/>responsible for many of these closures; if she will consider reversing the measures; and if she will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>
        <QRef>[35722/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>I have no information on the number of private dental practices which have ceased business this year.  Private dental practitioners provide dental treatment under contract through the Dental Treatment Services scheme (DTSS) operated by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and the Dental Treatment Benefit Scheme (DTBS), which is the responsibility of the Minster for Social Protection.  In 2009 there was a net increase of 233 dentists contracted to provide services under the DTSS and a net increase of 116 dentists contracted to provide services under the DTBS.  During the period January to September 2010 an additional 104 dentists were contracted to provide services under the DTSS and 26 dentists terminated their contracts.  In the DTBS an additional 91 dentists have been contracted to provide services this year and 93 have terminated their contracts.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s decision to limit the funding available to the DTSS was made in view of the current position of the public finances and the 60% increase in expenditure in the DTSS over the past five years.  While the HSE has introduced measures to contain DTSS expenditure at the 2008 level of approximately &euro;63 million it is projected that expenditure on the DTSS will reach &euro;79 million by the end of the year. There are no plans to reverse these measures.</P>
        <P>Changes were also made to the DTBS, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Social Protection, to save money as the Social Insurance Fund, which funds the scheme, was running a deficit for the first time in a number of years.  It is expected that dentists will receive payments of &euro;105 million (DTSS: &euro;79m; DTBS &euro;26m) this year from the two schemes.  It should be noted that the income derived from state schemes does not represent the total income received by dentists, as many have private practices.</P>

	<P>The HSE launched the 2010 Seasonal Flu Vaccination Campaign on 6th October. Based on advice from the World Health Organisation (WHO), this year the seasonal flu vaccine contains three common flu virus strains, including the Pandemic H1N1 (Swine Flu) strain which is still circulating this year and is expected to be the most common strain this winter. </P>
        <P>The National Immunisation Advisory Committee has recommended that those in the &ldquo;at-risk&rdquo; categories should receive the seasonal influenza vaccine. In addition, healthy pregnant women and women up to six months after giving birth who have not previously received the swine flu vaccine are urged to get the seasonal flu vaccination this year as they are at a higher risk of complications from swine flu. Pregnant women who have a long-term medical condition such as diabetes, heart or lung disease need to get the seasonal flu vaccine, even if they already have had the swine flu vaccine.</P>
        <P>This year&rsquo;s seasonal flu vaccine can be given at any stage of pregnancy and will also protect the baby. The vaccine is also safe for breast-feeding mothers and their babies. Pregnant women will be interested to know that the annual flu vaccine does not contain the adjuvant (aluminium) or thiomersal (mercury based preservative) which were part of one of the swine flu vaccines during last year&rsquo;s pandemic.</P>
        <P>Since 1st October 2010, medical card  holders are required to pay a 50 cent charge for medicines and other prescription items supplied to them by community pharmacists. The charges are subject to a cap of &euro;10 per month for each person or family.</P>
        <P>Should a person or family pay more than &euro;10, the HSE will issue refunds automatically on a quarterly basis based on the information received from the dispensing pharmacy. However, if a person considers that they have not received the refund due to them there is a refund claim <Col N="183"/>form available through the HSE and an on-line version of the form is available at www.medicalcard.ie or www.hse.ie</P>

	<P>The Adoption Act, 2010 gives force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption.  The new legislation, which incorporates the provisions of the Hague Convention, is designed to provide a framework to ensure that appropriate procedures have been followed and that all adoptions are effected in the best interests of the child.  Future Inter-country adoption arrangements will be governed by the terms of the Adoption Act, 2010, once commenced.</P>
        <P>The Russian Government has made it clear that if adoptions are to continue, they wish to see have bilaterals put in place with countries wishing to proceed with the adoption of Russian children.  I am aware that the US and New Zealand Governments are currently negotiating bilaterals with Russia.  I intend to pursue the matter of a bilateral with the Russian Ambassador in Dublin in the coming weeks and establish whether it is possible to put in place a bilateral agreement with Russia that provides safety around the issues of consent and the financial costs of effecting an adoption.</P>
        <P>It should be noted that the Adoption Act, 2010, contains a special provision that will enable prospective adoptive parents to proceed with an adoption from a non-Hague or non-bilateral country, if prior to the establishment date, they have been issued with a Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability to adopt.  This is significant in that it allows applicants to adopt from Russia if the Declaration has been issued by the Adoption Board prior to commencement of the legislation.  The provision requires that the Adoption Authority (to be set up under the Act) would be satisfied that the particular adoption meets all the standards of the Hague Convention.</P>
        <P>The Russian embassy have indicated to the OMCYA that, during a recent visit to Ireland, the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister confirmed that Ireland was not blacklisted as regards to inter country adoption.</P>
        <P>Although the Russian Embassy in Dublin advised the Department that prospective adoptive parents can still proceed in applying to the Russian consulate for documents for visas and adoptive dossiers for registration, I am aware of queries received recently indicating concerns regarding delays in appointments for visas.  Officials in my Department have been in contact with the Russian Embassy on this matter.</P>

In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.

      <Speaker pid="MaryHarney"><TitleTxt>Minister for Health and Children</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Mary Harney</NameTxt>
	<P>The Health and Social Care Professionals Act was passed by the Oireachtas in 2005 and provides for the establishment of a system of statutory registration for 12 health and social care professions.  The 12 professions to be regulated under the Act are clinical biochemists, dieticians, medical scientists, occupational <Col N="187"/>therapists, orthoptists, physiotherapists, podiatrists, psychologists, radiographers, social care workers, social workers, and speech and language therapists.</P>
        <P>The structure of the system of statutory registration will comprise a registration board for each of the professions to be registered, a Health and Social Care Professionals Council with overall responsibility for the regulatory system and a committee system to deal with disciplinary matters.  The first step in the implementation of the system of statutory registration was the establishment of the Health and Social Care Professionals Council in March 2007, for the purpose of protecting the public and promoting high standards of professional conduct, education and competence among these professions.  The Council is now being established on a phased basis and has already carried out considerable work on developing Governance arrangements, financial management systems, fitness to practice procedures, ICT requirements and other such issues that will be needed to support the establishment and functioning of all Registration Boards.  The Council has already examined which professions from within the designated twelve are most suitable for early registration, the first of which, the Social Workers Registration Board, was established recently.  It is envisaged that further progress in bringing additional registration boards on-stream will be made over the coming months.  While the proposed system of statutory registration applies, in the first instance, to twelve health and social care professions, the legislation empowers the Minister for Health and Children to include, on the basis of specific criteria, additional health and social care professions in the regulatory system over time, as appropriate. Section 4 of the 2005 Act sets out the criteria governing the subsequent addition of any further professions into the regulatory system at a later date, including:</P>
<P el="5">(a) <?oasys _ix ?>the extent to which the profession has a defined scope of practice and applies a distinct body of knowledge;</P>
<P el="5">(b) <?oasys _ix ?>the extent to which the profession has established itself, including whether there is at least one professional body representing a significant proportion of the profession&rsquo;s practitioners;</P>
<P el="5">(c) <?oasys _ix ?>the existence of defined routes of entry into the profession and of independently assessed entry qualifications;</P>
<P el="5">(d) <?oasys _ix ?>the profession&rsquo;s commitment to continuous professional development;</P>
<P el="5">(e) <?oasys _ix ?>the degree of risk to the health, safety or welfare of the public from incompetent, unethical or impaired practice of the profession;</P>
<P el="5">(f) <?oasys _ix ?>any other factors that the Minister for Health and Children considers relevant.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The priority for the Health and Social Care Professionals Council is to establish statutory registration for the twelve designated health and social care professions in the first instance.  The issue of inclusion of other grades, such as music therapists, within the scope of statutory registration will be considered after the initial designated twelve professional grades have been fully dealt with.</P>

	<P>The Children and Youth Services Development Unit (CYSDU) of my Office supports the delivery of a range of youth work programmes and services for all young people including those from disadvantaged communities through grants in aid, which are part-funded by the National Lottery.  The Special Projects for Youth Scheme (SPY) is one such initiative supported and funding of &euro;19.5m has been allocated to this Scheme in 2010 through resources made available under Subhead G of Vote 41, which is part funded by the National Lottery.  The overall funding provision does not differentiate between the Exchequer and National Lottery element of the <Col N="189"/>allocation.  Funding allocations for 2011 for the youth sector will be considered and finalised following on the budget. </P>
        <P>Funding is also made available to national youth organisations under the Youth Service Grant Scheme, local youth clubs, youth information services, collaborative programmes on health and youth arts, Gaisce &mdash; the President&rsquo;s Award scheme and L&eacute;argas, the body established to administer international exchange programmes.</P>
        <P>During the years 2004 to 2008, funding to the youth sector increased from &euro;35.5 million to &euro;52 million.  The grant-in-aid budget, under Subhead G, decreased by 3% in 2010.  In determining the 2010 allocations to initiatives and schemes, every effort has been made to minimise the impact of the reduction in the 2010 budget on front line youth work services and to treat each stakeholder in an equitable manner.  The emphasis in 2010 has been on consolidating, in so far as practicable, the progress made in recent years.</P>

Development funding totalling &euro;51.2m was allocated to the HSE in 2006 and 2007.  Additional funding of &euro;2.8m was provided in 2009 for the recruitment of 35 therapy posts for the child and adolescent mental health service.  There are, however, also substantial resources tied up in institutions and their release is also required to fund the new model of care. </P>
        <P>In relation to annual expenditure on the implementation of <i>&lsquo;A Vision for Change</i>&rsquo; this question has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</P>

	<P>The Mental Health Commission has issued a code of practice relating to the admission of children under the Mental Health Act 2001 which outlines arrangements and facilities that should be put in place to ensure the protection and safety of such children.  An addendum to this code of practice was issued by the Commission in June 2009 and provides that;</P>
        <P el="5">(a) <?oasys _ix ?>No child under 16 years is to be admitted to an adult unit in an approved centre from 1st July 2009;</P>
         <P el="5">(b) <?oasys _ix ?>No child under 17 years is to be admitted to an adult unit in an approved centre from 1st December 2010; and</P>
        <P el="5">(c) <?oasys _ix ?>No child under 18 years is to be admitted to an adult unit in an approved centre from 1st December 2011.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">If, in exceptional circumstances, a young person is admitted to an adult unit, the approved centre is obliged to submit a detailed report to the Mental Health Commission outlining why the admission has taken place.  The Commission reviews any such notifications received and follows up as appropriate. The HSE has prioritised the development of mental health services for children and adolescents.  During 2009, bed capacity for children and adolescents almost doubled, bringing the total number of in-patient beds to 30.  In addition, two new 20 bed units at Bessboro, Cork and Merlin Park, Galway are due to open before the end of the year, and this will increase capacity to 52 beds.  A child should of course only be admitted as a psychiatric in-patient as a last resort and should as far as possible receive the necessary treatment in the community.  To this end there are now 55 consultant led child and adolescent teams in place throughout the country and a further 8 teams are in development.  In addition, work commenced recently on the Linn Dara, Child and<b> </b>Adolescent Facility at Cherry Orchard, Dublin, which will provide a day hospital as well as accommodation for mental health teams and administrative staff, and training and library facilities.  It is anticipated that these developments will greatly reduce the need to admit young people to adult units.</P>

        <P>The information requested by the Deputy is set out as follows in tabular format.  As can be seen, the numbers employed at my Department have been falling steadily over the period concerned with overall numbers decreasing by 173 or 27%.  This reduction has been achieved as a result of a number of developments including:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the establishment of the HSE &amp; HIQA and the transfer of certain functions from the Department to these bodies;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the transfer of the General Register Office from the Department to the Department of Social Protection;</P>

        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the Incentivised Career Break scheme and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the moratorium on the filling of vacancies in the public service.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">It should also be noted that my Department took on a number of additional responsibilities and functions during this period.  Responsibility for Youth Affairs transferred into my Department and three agencies have been subsumed under the Government&rsquo;s rationalisation of agencies programme.</P>
        <P>In line with the Employment Control Framework (ECF) setting out Government policy on numbers employed in the public service, my Department must further reduce its staffing complement to 450 by 2012.  We will use all appropriate mechanisms such as re-organisation and re-allocation of work, including redeployment where necessary, to meet this target.</P>

	<P>Community Audiology Services provided by the Health Service Executive (HSE) offer assessment and rehabilitation for medical card holders and for children. Children and young people up to 18 years are entitled to access HSE audiology services free of charge at the point of delivery. This covers screening, assessment, diagnostic and related investigations, treatment, habilitation, rehabilitation, hearing aids and cochlear implants. All adults can access acute-based ENT services and associated audiology assessments free of charge. If hearing aids are required, those with medical cards are entitled to be referred to HSE audiology services for the hearing aids, which are provided free of charge. </P>
        <P>The Treatment Benefit Scheme, which is the responsibility of the Minster for Social Protection, provides aural services to insured workers and retired people who have the required number of PRSI contributions. Under this Scheme hearing aids may be provided by suppliers who have a contract with the Department of Social Protection.

	<P>I have responsibility for implementing the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme, which was introduced in January of this year.</P>
        <P>Children qualify for the free pre-school year when they are aged between 3 years 3 months and 4 years 6 months in September of the relevant year.  Based on the information provided by the Deputy, the child in question is not within the qualifying age range for the scheme in the current school year but will be eligible in September 2011.  It is accepted that the child in question will not be able to avail of the free pre-school year in September 2011 if he commences primary school at that time, at the age of 4 years and 3 days.</P>
        <P>Exceptions are allowed to the upper age limit for the scheme in certain circumstances, for example, where a child is developmentally delayed and would benefit from participating in the pre-school year at a later age. Exceptions to the lower age limit are not provided for.  This is because the objective of the free pre-school year is to make early learning in a formal setting available to all children in the year before they commence primary school and services partici<Col N="194"/>pating in the pre-school year are expected to provide appropriate age related activities and programmes to children within a particular age cohort.</P>
        <P>It is necessary, therefore, to target the pre-school year at a particular age cohort and to set minimum and maximum limits to the age range within which children participate in the scheme.  The age range of almost 17 months which is provided for under the scheme is extensive and takes account of a number of factors including the variation in school admission policies and the fact that the majority of children commence primary school between the ages of 4 years 6 months and 5 years 6 months.  Arrangements for the 2010/2011 pre-school year are now finalised.</P>

	<P>Aftercare is a key element to achieving positive outcomes for young people leaving care.  Aftercare services have been developed in Ireland to assist young people in care in bridging the transition from care to independent adult life in the community.</P>
        <P>Aftercare is provided for under Section 45 of the Child Care Act, 1991, which states:</P>
<P LI="1" el="5"><b><i>&ldquo;45.</i></b>&mdash;(1) (a) Where a child leaves the care of a health board, the board <b><i>may</i></b>, in accordance with subsection (2), assist him for so long as the board is satisfied as to his need for assistance and, subject to paragraph (b), he has not attained the age of 21 years.</P>
<P LI="1" el="5">(b) Where a health board is assisting a person in accordance with subsection (2)(b), and that person attains the age of 21 years, the board<b><i> may</i></b>  continue to provide such assistance until the completion of the course of education in which he is engaged.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Consideration has been given to the legal position with regard to the provisions of aftercare services, having regard to the existing legislative provisions of the Childcare Act 1991.  Calls have been made to place Aftercare on a statutory footing, i.e. to amend Section 45 of the Child Care Act, 1991 from a &ldquo;may&rdquo; to a &ldquo;shall&rdquo;. The legal advice is that the Act creates a statutory power and the HSE, as recipient of this power, must put itself in a position where it can exercise the power should the need arise. There is therefore no need to amend the Act as suggested.</P>
        <P>Section 45(4) of the Child Care Act allows the Minister to inform the HSE and instruct it in this or in any other regard.  In order to ensure that there was no doubt about the matter, and to emphasise the importance of aftercare services, I wrote to the HSE in June clarifying the issue and directing the HSE to formulate and implement aftercare policies.</P>
        <P>In line with the Government commitment as reflected in the Ryan Implementation Plan, funding of &euro;1.0m was set aside by the HSE in its 2010 Service Plan, for the development of aftercare services in 2010.</P>

There is no provision under the scheme to enrol children that are below the qualifying age.</P>
        <P>The objective of the ECCE scheme is to make early learning in a formal setting available to all children in the year before they commence primary school.  Services participating in the pre-school year are expected to provide appropriate age related activities and programmes to children within a particular age cohort.  It is necessary, therefore, to target the pre-school year at a particular age cohort and to set minimum and maximum limits to the age range within which children participate in the scheme.</P>
        <P>In setting the minimum and maximum age limits, account was taken of a number of factors, including the variation in school admission policies and the fact that the majority of children commence primary school between the ages of 4 years 6 months and 5 years 6 months.  I understand that the person referred to by the Deputy has a child who will qualify for the ECCE scheme in September 2011 but is outside of the lower age limit for qualification in September 2010.</P>
        <P>I also have responsibility for implementing the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) scheme which provides funding to community childcare services to enable them to charge reduced childcare fees to disadvantaged and low income families.  Parents can qualify for support with their childcare costs through the CCS scheme which is open to community not for profit childcare services.  Some 950 services throughout the State are participating in the CCS scheme and receive funding which is passed on to qualifying parents in the form of reduced childcare fees.</P>
        <P>Eligibility for a GP visit card is based on net income and takes account of outgoings such as rent and mortgage repayments and other expenses including childcare costs and travelling expenses.  As a result, parents with substantial gross incomes can qualify under the CCS scheme.  Parents who do not qualify for subvention are charged the cost price for their childcare service.</P>
        <P>Parents who consider that they qualify for support under the CCS scheme should contact their local City and County Childcare Committee to establish exactly what participating community facilities are available in their area.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The costs incurred by the State meeting claims against obstetricians engaged exclusively in public practice and those with a mix of public/private patients for each of the past three years cannot be quantified as the State Claims Agency does not gather its claims data by reference to a  breakdown between consultant obstetricians with a public only practice and consultant obstetricians with a public/private mix.    </P>
        <P>The State Claims Agency has received &euro;1,468,130 from third party contributions on obstetric claims from 2007 to 2010 (to date). However, medical defence organisations frequently agree apportionment of liability with the Agency in obstetric cases and make their payments directly to Plaintiffs. Details of these payments are not recorded.</P>
        <P>The contingent liability in respect of obstetric claims for each of the next three years is estimated to be &euro;170 million cumulatively. The contingent liability is the State Claims Agency&rsquo;s best current estimate of the ultimate cost of resolving each claim less any payments that have already been made: it includes all foreseeable costs such as settlement amounts, plaintiff legal costs and defence costs (such as fees payable to counsel, consultants etc.). Estimated Liabilities may be revised on a regular basis in light of any new information received.</P>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s decision to limit the funding available to the Dental Treatment Services Scheme (DTSS) was made in view of the current position of the public finances and the 60% increase in expenditure in the DTSS over the past five years.  The Health Service Executive (HSE) has introduced measures to contain DTSS expenditure at the 2008 level of approximately &euro;63 million. There are no plans to reverse these changes.</P>
        <P>Under the new measures the range of treatments available are being prioritised. Other than emergency care, the remaining care provision is subject to prior approval by a clinician in the HSE, who will prioritise for:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />High risk and exceptional patients,</P>

        <P el="5" FLI="0">The HSE will monitor the ongoing effect of these changes from a clinical and budgetary perspective and will continue to engage with dental professionals to ensure clarity and consistency in implementing these changes. The dental and oral health services currently provided through the HSE Public Dental Service for high risk groups will not be affected by these changes to the DTSS.</P>

	<P>A new ward block to replace existing accommodation is being developed at the hospital. This facility will provide single room en-suite inpatient accommodation (100 rooms) and a dedicated day unit for people with Cystic Fibrosis, including 10 single day treatment rooms with en-suite sanitary facilities. </P>
        <P>St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital and the HSE are committed to this project and are taking every possible step to resolve all issues in order to ensure earliest possible delivery of the new ward block.  St Vincent&rsquo;s University Hospital has advised my Department that the signing of the contract is imminent.</P>
        <P>The site has been cleared and is ready for construction to begin and the contract, once awarded, will require 18 months for construction of the new facility.</P>

	<P>The new Childcare Education and Training Supports (CETS) scheme  was introduced in September of this year and is being implemented by my Office, on behalf of F&Aacute;S and the Vocational Educational Committees (VECs) under the Department of Education and Science.</P>
        <P>The CETS scheme replaces the previous childcare support schemes implemented by F&Aacute;S and the VECs under which qualifying students and trainees were given a weekly Childcare Allowance of up to &euro;63.50 per child as a contribution to their childcare costs.  Under the new CETS scheme, qualifying students and trainees can avail of childcare places free of charge.  The eligibility criteria are unchanged and continue to be determined by F&Aacute;S and the VECs.</P>
        <P>Information in regard to the number and location of childcare places claimed in the 2009/2010 academic year was compiled by F&Aacute;S and the Department of Education &amp; Skills earlier this <Col N="201"/>year and provided to my Office in order to put the new arrangements in place and allocate CETS places to services which were accepted into the scheme.  Some adjustments to the initial allocations have since been made to take account of the actual demand in each area as students and trainees with childcare requirements commence courses.</P>
        <P>Based on the information provided to this Office, 9 full time places are being allocated to two childcare services participating in the scheme in Mallow town with a further 10 full time and 5 part-time places allocated to four services operating in the general vicinity of the town. The two services located within Mallow town, Youthreach Training Centre creche and Rising Stars Childcare, made late applications to this Office in recent weeks to enter the scheme and, as a result, are still in the process of going to contract.  However, I am informed that this will be completed shortly.</P>

	<P>Under the Health Act 2008, higher income thresholds are used for persons aged 70 years and over applying for a medical card.  The Health Service Executive (HSE) does not finalise assessments for medical card eligibility on the higher income thresholds until the applicant has reached his/her 70th birthday.  The HSE has advised that in this case the medical card application was processed and approved on the date the person reached 70 years of age (4th October 2010) and the card issued very shortly thereafter.</P>
        <P>The HSE has informed me that its Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) has processed 211,801 medical card applications over the last 18 months and currently meets the 15 working day turnaround target in respect of all complete applications.</P>

	<P>The Government and the HSE remain committed to the development of a comprehensive needs-based service for children at risk.  In this context, the HSE established the Emergency Place of Safety Service in June 2009. This service makes provision for garda&iacute; to access an appropriate place of safety for children found to be at risk out of hours under Section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991. The provision of this service, which conforms with relevant regulations and standards, aims to ensure that children presenting as &lsquo;at risk&rsquo; outside of normal working hours are provided with an appropriate emergency place of safety thereby reducing or eliminating social admissions of children in an acute hospital setting. The Emergency Place of Safety service provides a standardised response across the country for children who can be appropriately placed in a family setting. This service applies outside the Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow areas where such services are already provided. The on-going operation of the service is under review by a joint HSE/Garda Committee. I am informed by the HSE that since  the Emergency Place of Safety Service was established there have been 309 phone calls from an Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na with 172 children and young people having been provided with placements through the service as of 15th   September, 2010.</P>
        <P>In addition, and instead of developing a stand alone social work out of hours service, it has been agreed to develop alternative proposals based on a more integrated approach which builds on the HSE&rsquo;s existing out of hours services including GPs, acute hospital services and mental health services.  This should provide a more effective and integrated service by using existing resources and strengthening the links between services such as mental health and social work to appropriately address incidents occurring outside usual working hours. The aim is to ensure that persons seeking personal social services outside normal working hours can be provided with appropriate advice, information, support and, in emergency situations, access to specialist staff, such as staff working in the areas of mental health and suicide prevention. The Government&rsquo;s Implementation Plan for the recommendations of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse also committed to the piloting of two out of hours projects. The sites of these two pilot sites are now being finalised and discussions are ongoing to commence the pilots as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>As the specific matter referred to by the Deputy is a service matter this aspect has been referred to the HSE for direct reply.</P>

	<P>Under the agreement of March 2007 between the Irish and British Governments on a funding package to support the restored Northern Ireland Executive, the Irish Government made a commitment to provide funding of &pound;400/&euro;580 million in a roads investment package for Northern Ireland which will contribute to the upgrading of the A5 road from Aughnacloy to Derry/Londonderry to dual-carriageway status.    The Irish Government&rsquo;s contribution will be made on the basis of actual expenditure incurred during the development and construction phases.  In this context drawdown of funding <Col N="206"/>depends on the achievement of agreed project milestones and clearance by the Cross-Border Roads Steering Group and North-South Ministerial Council.</P>
        <P>The A5 project is being implemented by the Roads Service of Northern Ireland (RSNI). I understand that work is currently progressing well to meet the next key project milestone &mdash; Publication of Draft Orders &mdash; in late 2010. The expected completion date of the project is July 2015.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>The development of safety regulations for fishing vessels dates back to the Fishing Vessel Safety Review group, which reported in 1996. One key recommendation made by that group was for the establishment of a safety regime for fishing vessels covering stability, strength, hull and machinery. Following several fishing vessel tragedies in 2007 efforts focused on the development of a scheme for the fishing vessels in the 15 to 24 m length category. My Department developed regulations for such vessels based on international standards and these regulations were subject to extensive public consultations, following which the regulations entered into force in September of that year.  A phased approach was adopted in implementing the regulations, with all new fishing vessels to comply by the 1 October 2007, the following October fishing vessels up to ten years old had to comply and from 1 October 2009 fishing vessels up to 20 years old had to comply. This October the remainder of the fleet have to comply. </P>
        <P>Among the safety provisions now being introduced are rules governing the integrity of the hull and stability of the vessel. While I understand that some owners are reluctant to submit their vessels for survey because of concerns about meeting the hull and stability standards, I have to stress that these rules in particular are critical to ensuring the safety of fishing vessels. It is only through the implementation of such internationally accepted safety standards can we hope to avoid many of the fishing vessel tragedies in the past.</P>
        <P>I am glad to say that the majority of owners in the fishing vessel class in question have already made application for inspection to the Marine Survey Office (MSO) of my Department. The surveyors are continuing to work with these owners to ensure that vessels can progressively be brought up to compliance standards as quickly as possible. I would, therefore, encourage any vessel owner who has yet to apply to do so now and to engage with the MSO on progressing his / her vessel towards compliance.</P>
        <P>As these are key safety regulations and as there has been extensive consultation with the fishing industry and engagement by the majority of vessel owners in the class it is better not to extend the deadline for compliance.</P>

      <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Transport</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Dempsey</NameTxt>
	<P>There are a number of Government policies that address the interface between development and national roads.  Where the National Roads Authority participates in the planning process &mdash; through consultation with planning authorities on the content of their Development Plans or by way of comments, including appeals to An Bord Plean&aacute;la as necessary on planning applications &mdash; the Authority seeks to have the objectives of these official policies upheld.  Underlying these policies is the recognition that national roads are primarily intended to cater for long-distance inter-urban and inter-regional traffic, rather than short, locally generated trips that should more appropriately be accommodated on local roads or by public transport.  Government policy objectives include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />protecting the substantial investment being made by Government in upgrading national roads;</P>
           <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />maintaining the intended transport function, traffic carrying capacity and efficiency of the network of national roads;</P>
          <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />ensuring high standards of safety for road users and that these standards are not compromised by risks arising from traffic movements associated with multiple access points to the network, and</P>
         <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />extending service life of the national road network, thereby deferring to the longer term the need to reinvest in further road improvements and the construction of new roads which would have implications for landowners, local communities, the environment and public expenditure.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Conflicts can and do occur between development proposals and the broader public interest in maintaining the safety and capacity of the national roads.  Such matters fall to be determined by An Bord Plean&aacute;la as the body designated to determine the acceptability of individual proposals from proper planning and sustainability perspectives as well as their consistency with relevant official policies.</P>
        <P>The National Roads Authority is a statutory consultee under planning legislation and planning authorities must, accordingly, refer to the Authority all planning applications that may impact on national roads. In that capacity, the Authority is entitled to participate in the planning and development process, to make submissions to the planning authority concerned and, in the event of a decision to appeal a planning authority decision, to pursue the matter through An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</P>
        <P>Under section 17 of the Roads Act 1993, as amended, the statutory remit of the NRA is to secure the provision of a safe and efficient network of national roads. Under section 10 of the Act, local authorities are the statutory authorities responsible for local and regional roads. The NRA has no statutory remit, functions or responsibilities in relation to such regional and local roads, including traffic thereon.</P><Col N="208"/>
        <P>It is clear from long established national policies that national roads are intended primarily to cater for strategic inter-regional and inter-urban traffic. While national roads can and indeed do accommodate some local traffic, it is essential that the volumes of such traffic are not such that would undermine the primary intended function of national roads in catering for strategic inter-regional and inter-urban traffic.</P>
        <P>Best practice in relation to development proposals is that the traffic/ trip implications should be assessed and the appropriate manner to cater for such traffic/trips determined as part of the planning application process. Such responses may entail public transport, walking, cycling and/or the upgrade of the local and regional road network such that any residual trips to cater for national roads do not undermine the strategic function of national roads. This approach has most recently been set out in the Guidelines for Planning Authorities which were issued for public consultation in June, 2010, by the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</P>

	<P>As part of its role on the Government Emergency Task Force, my Department has reviewed the transport-related response to the severe weather events last winter.  The Task Force is working on putting in place additional measures should similar events occur in the future.  In relation to transport issues, my Department and its agencies are engaged in the development and implementation of these actions.  In this regard my Department has issued a Circular to all local authorities requesting them to forward their Winter Maintenance Plans to the Department of Transport and National Roads Authority by 12 November 2010.  Plans should identify the lengths (in km) of national, regional <Col N="209"/>and local roads that are scheduled for regular winter treatment and, in the event of severe weather, the prioritised routes that will be maintained.  </P>
        <P>The NRA is also finalising its updated &ldquo;Winter Maintenance Guidelines&rdquo; which I understand will also address the response to severe weather events.  The Guidelines will be launched to all local authorities this Thursday, 14 October.</P>
        <P>The NRA has also been tasked with ensuring adequate salt supplies are available in future to maintain a prioritised road network.  To achieve this, the NRA advertised a framework contract in August 2010 for the supply of de-icing salt for the coming winter.</P>
        <P>The contract is for the supply of 80,000 tonnes with an initial call off of 50,000 tonnes to be imported and distributed by mid December and a further 30,000 tonnes in January 2011.  This supply will be in addition to the 20,000 tonnes of salt stock currently available.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The NRA is also investing &euro;6 million this year in additional dry storage facilities for de-icing salt and a further &euro;2.5 million for grit spreaders/snow blades etc for local authorities.</P>

	<P>As of 7th October 2010, only 11 so called headshops remained open for business. None of these outlets, to date, have been found or are suspected to be involved in the sale or supply of harmful psychoactive products.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Act, 2010, which came into effect on 23 August, 2010, has had an immediate positive effect in vastly reducing the number of &lsquo;headshop&rsquo; outlets open for business throughout the country.  This compares to an equivalent figure provided to me earlier this year by the Garda authorities in May this year to the effect that 102 headshops were operating in the State at that time.</P>
        <P>The above Act is part of the Government&rsquo;s multi-pronged approach to targeting the activities of headshops and the sale of unregulated psychoactive substances.  It works in tandem with the ongoing controlling as appropriate of identified harmful substances by the Department of Health and Children through the Misuse of Drugs legislation and also links in with the HSE&rsquo;s current National Drugs Awareness campaign which is highlighting the dangers of the use of psychoactive substances.</P>

	<P>The Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) provides employment vetting for a large number of organisations in Ireland registered with the Garda&iacute; for this purpose and which employ persons in a full-time, part-time, voluntary or training capacity to positions where they would have substantial, unsupervised access to children and/or vulnerable adults.  The GCVU has managed a substantial increase over recent years in the numbers of vetting applications it receives &mdash; 187,864 in 2007; 218,404 in 2008 and 246,194 in 2009.  At present, there are approximately 60,000 vetting applications in the course of being processed.</P>
        <P>The processing time for vetting applications fluctuates during the year due to seasonal demands when the volume of applications received from certain sectors can increase.  Additional time may be required to process an individual vetting application in cases where clarification is required as to the details provided or where other enquiries need to be made, for example, when the person in question has lived and worked abroad.  There will always be a reasonably significant time period required to process a vetting application.  Registered organisations have been advised to take account of this in their recruitment and selection process.  However, the Garda&iacute; make every effort to reduce this to the minimum possible consistent with carrying out the necessary checks.  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the current average processing time for vetting applications received at the GCVU is in the region of ten to 12 weeks, given that demand is particularly high at present.</P>
        <P>The allocation of Garda resources, including personnel, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  Due to the high volume of applications, an additional ten persons have recently been recruited to the Vetting Unit on a temporary basis.  In addition, overall staffing arrangements at the Unit are under review at present, in the light of the increasing demands being made upon it.</P>

The purpose of initiating a Garda recruitment campaign at this time is to establish a panel of approved candidates who will be available to meet future Garda recruitment needs in line with Government policy. I was happy to obtain the approval of my colleague the Minister for Finance for this. This forward planning is necessary given the lead time involved both in establishing such a panel and in training recruits to the point of attestation.

	<P>The Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act 1993 makes it an offence to solicit in a street or public place for the purpose of prostitution.  The offence can be committed by the prostitute, the client or a third party &mdash; a pimp, for example.  The Act also provides for offences such as organising prostitution, coercing <Col N="213"/>or compelling a person to be a prostitute, knowingly living on the earnings of a prostitute, or keeping or managing a brothel.  In addition, the Criminal Law (Human Trafficking) Act 2008 makes it an offence to knowingly solicit or importune a trafficked person, in any place, for the purpose of prostitution.</P>
        <P>Currently under the criminal law in Ireland, it is not an offence, in itself, to sell sex.  In general, it is not an offence to purchase sex either.  The matter is currently being examined.  Any proposal to amend the law in terms of criminalising the purchase of sex would require very careful consideration.  During the Summer, the Swedish Government completed an evaluation of its 1999 legislation criminalising the purchase of sex.  Sweden was the first country in the world to introduce such legislation and, more recently, Norway and Iceland have introduced similar bans.</P>
        <P>The Dignity Project recently arranged a visit to Sweden to learn more about the evaluation and the delegation included representation from my Department. Dignity is an EU funded research project examining services provided to victims of human trafficking, with a view to replicating best practice models in partner countries, and is led by the Dublin Employment Pact and the Immigrant Council of Ireland.  My Department&rsquo;s Anti-Human Trafficking Unit and the Garda National Immigration Bureau are partners with observer status.  It is an inter-agency and inter-jurisdictional initiative with partners in Scotland, Spain and Lithuania.</P>
        <P>The visit to Stockholm took place from 14 to 16 September and my officials are preparing a report of the visit, including an assessment of the Swedish legislative provisions.  I will examine the report in due course.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 352 to 358, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Between 1 July, 2009 and 30 June, 2010 there were approximately</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />12,900 invalid applications for certificates of naturalisation returned to the applicant (by virtue of improper and/or incomplete filling out of the application form.)</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />6,200 valid applications for a certificate of naturalisation deemed ineligible as the applicant did not meet the statutory requirements</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />5,700 valid applications for a certificate of naturalisation approved</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />1,400 valid applications for a certificate of naturalisation refused</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Each application for a certificate of naturalisation is examined on its own merits and the Minister decides, in his absolute discretion, whether to grant or refuse the application based on all the information provided. As a result, statistics are not compiled in such a manner as to provide data on the reasons for refusal or granting of applications for certificates of naturalisation. However, I can advise the Deputy that the main negative factors contributing to refusal of naturalisation applications are where I cannot be satisfied that applicants are of good character and/or have not demonstrated that they are in a position to support themselves and their dependants into the future.</P>
        <P>In terms of age and gender of those applications approved in the period in question, approximately 1,100 were minors and the remainder were aged 18 and over: 2,700 were female and 3,000 were male.</P>
        <P>The information in respect of those valid applications which were refused over the same period is as follows; 600 were female, 800 were male, approximately 500 were minors with the balance aged 18 and over.</P>
        <P>Applications for naturalisation for the period in question were received from nationals of over 130 countries.</P>

        <P>At present, my Department is examining ways to further facilitate foreign entrepreneurs and their families who wish to travel to the State for the purpose of establishing businesses.  In addition, as part of the five year strategy &lsquo;Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy&rsquo;, which was launched by the Taoiseach in September this year, my Department has undertaken to ensure that the visa regime here supports the priorities set out in the Strategy. This new regime <Col N="219"/>will be designed to ensure that entrepreneurial, business and tourist travellers to Ireland who can be clearly identified as such are specifically facilitated, and that businesses promoting trade, tourism and investment are not placed at a competitive disadvantage.  Work is already underway in my Department to deliver on this commitment.</P>

	<P>A valid application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy&rsquo;s Question was received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in March 2006.</P>
        <P>All valid applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants. The average processing time from application to decision is now at 26 months. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale. However, I understand that the person concerned is a refugee. In accordance with the Government&rsquo;s obligations under the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, every effort is made to ensure that applications from persons with refugee status are dealt with as quickly as possible.

        <P>The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks.

	<P>The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister for Justice and Law Reform may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled.  In the case of a non-Irish national applicant who is the spouse of an Irish citizen those conditions are that the applicant must: be of full age; be of good character; be married to the Irish citizen for at least 3 years; be in a marriage recognised under the laws of the State as subsisting; be living together as husband and wife with the Irish spouse; have had a period of one year&rsquo;s continuous residency in the island of Ireland immediately before the date of the application and, during the four years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the island of Ireland amounting to two years; and have made, either before a Judge of the District Court in open court or in such a manner as the Minister, for special reasons allows, a declaration in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State. </P>

	<P>A strand of the Intergovernmental Agreement on Co-operation on Criminal Justice Matters provides for North/South co-operation in the area of forensic science with the aim of identifying areas of mutual support and promoting the exchange of expertise and best practice between the Forensic Science Laboratory and Forensic Science Northern Ireland. </P>
        <P>Current priorities for cooperation are set out in the Criminal Justice Co-operation Work Programme 2010-2011 which Northern Ireland Justice Minister David Ford MLA and I agreed and published in July 2010. Specifically, the forensic science priority under the current work programme is to develop a Memorandum of Understanding between the Forensic Science Laboratory and Forensic Science Northern Ireland to provide for mutual support in the event of sudden loss or damage to facilities.</P>
        <P>At my recent meeting with Minister Ford and Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Justice Kenny MacAskill MSP on 27 September 2010 I took advantage of the opportunity presented by the meeting to discuss with Minister Ford plans to develop the Memorandum of Understanding, the preparation of which is being progressed by the Director of the Forensic Science Laboratory and her Northern Ireland counterpart.</P>
        <P>Co-operation with the Scottish Government in the area of forensic science was also discussed and, following on from my meeting with Ministers Ford and MacAskill, representatives of the Forensic Science Laboratory, Forensic Science Northern Ireland and Scottish Forensic Services will meet later this month to explore further possibilities for enhanced operational co-operation and the sharing of expertise and data between the three forensic science services.</P>

	<P>On 27 September at the Stephenstown Pond Conference Centre, Dundalk I hosted the first trilateral meeting with my counterparts in Northern Ireland and Scotland, Minister of Justice, Mr David Ford, MLA, and Cabinet Secretary for Justice, Mr. Kenny MacAskill, MSP. </P>
        <P>The meeting focused primarily on issues of common interest relating to human trafficking, organised crime, forensic science, DNA databases, police training and approaches to reducing offending. We reviewed measures being taken in each jurisdiction to deal with human trafficking and the cooperation of the law enforcement authorities in coping with a crime which respects no borders. It was recognised that there already is a high level of cooperation taking <Col N="222"/>place between the three jurisdictions and we expressed our determination that this be continued and intensified.</P>
        <P>The possibility of including human trafficking as a discrete area of cooperation under the Intergovernmental Agreement was discussed and arrangements are currently being made in this regard. It was agreed that there would be a joint awareness raising campaign in both jurisdictions in relation to human trafficking. It is expected that this will take place in early 2011.  In addition, arrangements are in train for a meeting to take place in December between officials of my Department and the Scottish Government with a view to enhancing existing cooperation arrangements in the field of human trafficking.</P>
        <P>I also took this opportunity to brief my colleagues on developments here in relation to organised crime and the intensive measures, including substantial and wide-ranging changes in the law, which had been undertaken here.</P>

Officials from the three jurisdictions met in the margins of the seminar for initial discussion on how to move forward with such joint cooperation.</P>

	<P>The Garda Adult Cautioning Scheme enables the processing of a minor offence committed by a person, over 18 years of age, with no previous convictions who admits to the offence.  It provides the option of dealing with such an offence, in those circumstances, by the administration of a caution by a senior Garda officer, as an alternative to prosecution in the District Court, where prosecution is not required by the public interest and it is determined that a caution would be an effective response.  The list of offences in respect of which a caution may be administered has been drawn up in consultation with the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The Scheme is kept under review by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Director of Public Prosecutions.  </P>
        <P>Prior to administering the caution, the public interest is taken into account.  The views of the victim are also, if reasonably possible, sought.</P>

No person was identified as a victim of trafficking under the Administrative Immigration Arrangements for the Protection of Victims of Human Trafficking in 2008. 11 persons were identified as victims of human trafficking under the Administrative Immigration Arrangements  in 2009 and 5 have been identified in 2010 to date. The remainder of persons alleging human trafficking had existing permissions to remain in the State based on their application for asylum pursuant to the Refugee Act, 1996 or on other forms of residence permissions and accordingly the Administrative Immigration Arrangements did not apply.</P>

	<P>The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission is a very important part of the institutional architecture of the Good Friday Agreement. It sends a clear message to all communities in Northern Ireland that their fundamental rights will be protected.  I met most recently with Professor Monica McWilliams, Chief Commissioner of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, in Dublin on 9 September.  At that meeting, we discussed a number of issues relating to the work of the Commission, including <Col N="226"/>proposed budget cuts in the context of the UK government&rsquo;s forthcoming comprehensive spending review. The question of funding from Atlantic Philanthropies was also raised. Atlantic Philanthropies have a strong track record of funding a range of initiatives in Ireland and in Northern Ireland relating to rights, social justice and reconciliation.    When I met with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Owen Paterson, on 19 September, I raised the concerns of the Commission in relation to budget cuts, and in relation to funding from Atlantic Philanthropies and expressed the hope that he could look again at this issue. I also underlined the importance that the Government attaches to the Commission and its ongoing work and responsibilities as an institution of the Good Friday Agreement.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>I have on many previous occasions expressed concern at the lack of results of the dialogue between the Dalai Lama and the Government of China.  It is deeply regrettable that reports following the ninth round of dialogue, held in January 2010, indicate that very little progress has been made in achieving a resolution to the situation in Tibet.  As stated on many previous occasions in this House, I am of the view that dialogue between the Chinese Government and the Dalai Lama is the best way to address differences and tensions in Tibet over issues of culture, language, religion and identity. While the Irish Government firmly adheres to the &lsquo;One China&rsquo; policy, I believe that dialogue on Tibet is as much in the interests of China, its stability and its harmony as it is of Tibetans. We avail of every appropriate opportunity to convey these views to the Chinese authorities, along with our concerns about aspects of the situation in Tibet.</P>
        <P>After the collapse of the previous talks in November 2008 following the rejection of a proposal for greater autonomy by the Chinese authorities, the two sides agreed to hold a ninth round of dialogue.  However, in a statement issued following the January 2010 meeting, Vice Minister Zhu Weiqun of the Chinese United Front Work Department expressed sentiments similar to those he had voiced after the previous round.  In essence, he contended that the Dalai Lama&rsquo;s call for greater autonomy for his homeland was in reality a call for Tibetan independence; that it represented a threat to China&rsquo;s territorial integrity and national dignity; that the Chinese Government sees no room for negotiation or concession on this issue; and that the Dalai Lama must &lsquo;redress his mistakes&rsquo; and renounce his calls for &lsquo;independence&rsquo;.</P>
        <P>For their part, the Tibetan envoys, while insisting that the &lsquo;baseless accusations&rsquo; against the Dalai Lama must cease, have reiterated the Tibetan commitment to continuing the dialogue with the Chinese Government.  They have at the same time argued that this dialogue must begin to show some results.  I very much wish to see a continuation of this dialogue which represents the best hope of securing a lasting resolution acceptable to both parties.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin"><TitleTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin</NameTxt>
	<P>Article 29.5 of the Constitution requires that international agreements to which the State becomes a party, with the exception of agreements of a &ldquo;technical and administrative character&rdquo;, be laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann. The policy of my Department is that all agreements, including those of a technical or administrative character, should be laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann as a matter of best practice and in the interest of transparency. This laying procedure is distinct and separate from the requirement in Article 29.5.2 that agreements whose terms impose a charge on public funds be approved by the D&aacute;il before the State may become party thereto.</P>
        <P>The obligation in the Constitution to lay all agreements that enter into force for the State before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann is primarily for the purpose of providing information to the D&aacute;il both as to the fact that the State has become party to a particular agreement and as to the terms of the agreement in question. The Constitution does not specify a timeframe in which agreements must be laid, although it is desirable that they be laid promptly. However, a backlog of international agreements for laying before the D&aacute;il built up over the years, largely due to a lack of resources. For this reason, it was decided not to prioritise agreements about which information was already widely available.  EU treaties, including the Treaty amending, with regard to Greenland, the Treaties establishing the European Communities, were not given priority, as information on these treaties was already well known to the D&aacute;il and accessible.  Prior to its ratification, the text of the Greenland Treaty had been sent to the Oireachtas library and had been the subject of debate in the D&aacute;il during the passage of European Communities (Amendment) Act 1985, which gave effect in Irish law to the Treaty.</P>
        <P>In recent years the Department has sought to ensure that all international agreements that have entered into force for the State since 1937 are identified and laid before the D&aacute;il in a timely manner.  Currently, the Department seeks to lay all international agreements before the end of the calendar year following the year in which they enter into force for the State.  On 31 January 2006, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, informed the D&aacute;il, in reply to a parliamentary question (3159/06), of plans to identify and lay before the D&aacute;il all international agreements to which the State had become party since 1937. To date, some 317 such agreements dating from as far back as 1948 have been identified. Of these, 65 were laid before the D&aacute;il in 2006, 217 in 2007, 10 in 2008, 19 in 2009 and 6 in 2010.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the vast majority of international agreements which entered into force since 1937 have now been laid before the D&aacute;il, but it is possible that a small number of further agreements will be identified and any such agreements will be laid before the D&aacute;il in due course.  Once international agreements are laid before the D&aacute;il they are made publicly available on my Department&rsquo;s website, in the electronic Irish Treaty Series.</P>

	<P>The Lisbon Treaty provided for the strengthening of the role of national parliaments, as set out in Article 12 of the Treaty on European Union and in Protocols No 1 and 2 appended to the Treaty. This was part of the significant measures contained in the Treaty to enhance the democratic legitimacy of the Union.  Last year I introduced to this House legislation which gave effect to a number of these provisions and the European Union Act 2009 was duly enacted by the Oireachtas last October. The Joint Sub-Committee has since then elaborated further recommendations to give full effect <Col N="228"/>to the provisions of the Lisbon Treaty in this area.

	<P>Transnistria is an area of the Republic of Moldova between the Dniester/Nistru River and the Ukrainian border inhabited mainly by Russian and Ukrainian speakers. In the course of the break-up of the Soviet Union, it unilaterally declared independence from the Republic of Moldova, due mainly to fears over a possible reunification of Moldova with Romania. Transnistria&rsquo;s independence has not been recognised by any member of the United Nations and, consequently, Ireland does not have diplomatic relations with Transnistria, nor are there any plans to establish diplomatic relations. This is also the case for other EU member states.</P>
        <P>Ireland recognises the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova and supports the efforts of the Government of Moldova and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to resolve the conflict in Transnistria. Ireland will assume the Chairmanship in Office of the OSCE in 2012 and will carry forward efforts to resolve the conflict in Transnistria, in the event that no progress has been achieved in the meantime.  Transnistria is not currently receiving any post conflict assistance from Ireland. A request for assistance would only be considered in the context of a comprehensive resolution of the conflict.</P>

	<P>Ireland is completely opposed to the use of stoning, a practice which has no place in the twenty-first century. Stoning is a particularly cruel method of execution which amounts to torture.  I have made clear Ireland&rsquo;s concerns about human rights in Iran and our abhorrence of the practice of stoning in contacts with members of the Iranian Government, most recently at a meeting which I had with Foreign Minister Mottaki in Dublin on 9 June.  I have written to Foreign Minister Mottaki on a number of occasions to express my concerns about, and to raise specific aspects of, the human rights situation in Iran.</P><Col N="229"/>
        <P>In my remarks to the United Nations General Assembly on 27 September, I drew attention to the human rights situation in Iran including profoundly disturbing recent human rights abuses.  These include the appalling sentencing of Ms Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani to death by stoning for adultery in Iran which has been the subject of an international outcry in recent months.  The case of Ms Ashtiani has been raised with the Iranian Ambassador to Ireland by officials in my Department.</P>
        <P>Ireland has also been active in raising issues relating to human rights in Iran within the specific UN bodies which deal with human rights. Along with our European Union partners, we have consistently supported the annual Resolution on the human rights situation in Iran which is adopted by the UN General Assembly.  In our national intervention at the fifteenth session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on 17 September, we raised concerns relating to the death penalty in Iran.  I urge the Iranian authorities to introduce a moratorium on executions pending the abolition of the death penalty in accordance with UN General Assembly resolutions 62/149 and 63/168.</P>
        <P>In my view, stoning, even where it is not fatal, amounts to torture.  The prohibition against torture is a fundamental norm of international law. We would continue to urge Iran and any other country which so provides in its laws to abolish the practice of stoning in line with international law. Iran is party to the International Covenant for Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) which contains an absolute prohibition on torture.  I would also strongly urge Iran to become a party to the International Convention Against Torture.</P>

	<P>There are several countries in Africa which are suffering from conflict or food shortages.  I do not propose to go into details on each of them individually.  The international community continues to intervene to address these issues on the African continent, whether on a bilateral or multilateral basis.</P>
        <P>With regard to the issue of hunger and famine, it is estimated that more than a billion people today do not have enough food. Ireland is responding to this challenge, working bilaterally in our programme countries with our EU partners and other donors, and at a global level through the UN agencies.   Since the publication of the report of the Hunger Task Force in September 2008, Ireland&rsquo;s focus on hunger reduction has become a cornerstone of Irish Aid&rsquo;s development programme.</P>
        <P>With regard to Africa, efforts are concentrated on the three priority areas identified in the report, namely: increasing smallholder agricultural productivity in Africa; targeting under-nutrition (especially maternal and infant); and promoting governance and leadership action on tackling global hunger.  Nowhere is this work more challenging than in African countries affected by conflict where it is critically important to move quickly with large-scale emergency food assistance in order to save lives.</P>
        <P>Yet we know that more can be done to address the causes of hunger and famine. To this end, at the Millennium Development Goals Summit last month in New York, I hosted a meet<Col N="230"/>ing with the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, to accelerate action against hunger. At this meeting, Ireland and the US came together to highlight the urgency of tackling undernutrition in pregnant women and children under the age of two and to build new partnerships with global political, business and civil society leaders.  Our two countries launched the &ldquo;1,000 Day&rdquo; initiative to focus on the period from pregnancy to a child&rsquo;s second birthday and to galvanise international action on this issue. We were both very encouraged by the support that we received by the international community, including the UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon, EU Commissioner Georgieva, the World Food Programme, UNICEF and the World Health Organisation. Irish officials are working with their US officials to galvanise action in this regard.</P>
        <P>With regard to security, UN and EU peacekeeping missions in Africa have a role in stabilising former and current conflict zones.  Members of the Irish Defence Forces have participated in numerous UN and EU peacekeeping missions in Africa, including in the Congo, Eritrea, Liberia and most recently in Chad.  In developing a sustainable approach which properly addresses the root causes of conflict and famine, and other problems, African leadership and responsibility are crucial.  This is recognised by the EU and UN, which are both working to build the capacities of African States and the African Union to respond to these challenges.  Ireland is committed to playing its part in this work, and I believe that our comprehensive and inclusive approach to these challenges stands the best chance of facilitating real and positive change in the lives of millions of people in Africa.</P>

	<P>Ireland, together with our EU partners, is committed to enhancing stability in the Western Balkans region.  The EU perspective for the countries in the region, agreed at the June 2003 Thessaloniki European Council, is essential in helping to build and maintain this stability.  The EU&rsquo;s Stabilisation and Association process provides the framework for cooperation on economic, political and legal matters aimed at bringing countries in the region towards EU standards and principles.</P>
        <P>The Western Balkans remains a priority area for the EU and is discussed frequently by Foreign Ministers, most recently at the Foreign Affairs Councils in June and July 2010.  These discussions followed on from the   high-level meeting on the Western Balkans in Sarajevo on 2 June which was organised by the Spanish EU Presidency.  The meeting in Sarajevo was attended by all EU and Western Balkans countries. Minister of State Mansergh represented Ireland.  The meeting took place in a positive and constructive atmosphere and served to build on the positive developments we have seen in the region recently.</P>
        <P>Meetings with my Western Balkans counterparts were a priority in my schedule at the UN General Assembly in New York last month.  I had very useful discussions with the Foreign Ministers of Croatia, Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovina.  I also had the opportunity to discuss developments in the region with the Turkish Foreign Minister while in New York.  In addition, the region was discussed during the EU-Russia and EU-US meetings in the margins of the General Assembly.  My visit to Romania and Bulgaria last week, meanwhile, provided a further opportunity to hear the perspective of some of those closer to the region on recent devel<Col N="231"/>opments.  This followed on from discussions I had with my Austrian and German counterparts in early September.</P>
        <P>The most significant developments in the Western Balkans region in recent months relate to the judgement by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the declaration of independence by Kosovo, and subsequent joint EU-Serbia UN resolution, and the elections in Bosnia-Herzegovina on 3 October.  In July, the ICJ ruled that Kosovo&rsquo;s declaration of independence did not violate international law. Serbia put forward a draft UN General Assembly resolution on the matter which would have been unacceptable to the EU.  Ultimately, however, Serbia and the EU reached a compromise on the resolution, and a joint EU-Serbia text was adopted by consensus in the General Assembly in September.  The EU-Serbia resolution included an offer by the EU to facilitate a dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina.  Discussions are ongoing at official level as to the form and scope of such a dialogue.</P>
        <P>Provisional results for the elections in Bosnia-Herzegovina indicate gains for moderates in the Bosniak-Croat Federation, while the ruling party, the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats, did well in the Republika Srpska.  In its preliminary assessment, the OSCE-led election observation mission (to which Ireland contributed nine observers) reported that the elections were conducted generally in line with OSCE and Council of Europe commitments and represented further progress for Bosnia-Herzegovina.  It is important that now, after the general election, fresh impetus is given to domestic reforms to ensure Bosnia-Herzegovina moves forward on the path towards the EU.  The EU is ready to play its part by encouraging political leaders in Bosnia-Herzegovina to engage in constructive dialogue and by assisting with the reform process.  However, the key to progress lies with the political parties themselves.</P>
        <P>Overall, there has been a marked improvement in the regional dynamic over the past year.  In December 2009, the EU granted the citizens of Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia visa-free access to the Schengen area.  This was a significant boost for the region, and it is expected that it will be extended to Bosnia-Herzegovina and Albania at the end of this year.  Other positive steps towards regional reconciliation include: the appointment by Bosnia-Herzegovina of an ambassador to Belgrade after a three-year hiatus;   the declaration by the Belgrade Parliament last March condemning the Srebrenica massacre; Serbia&rsquo;s handing over of the wartime notebooks of Ratko Mladic to the ICTY in May; and the joint visit by the Serbian and Croatian Presidents to Bosnia for the Srebrenica commemoration this July.  I welcome these forward-looking gestures, which are a testament to how far the Western Balkans region has come over the past 15 years.  The EU will remain engaged in assisting the countries in the region to undertake the reforms necessary to move forward in their path to the EU.</P>

	<P>Along with my EU colleagues, I continue to give a very high priority to supporting efforts to reach a comprehensive peace agreement in the Middle East. The issue is discussed very frequently at the Foreign Affairs Council, and I have made a number of visits to the region myself, to meet with the leaders, learn about the issues, and encourage their efforts.   I have reported in more detail about the current direct negotiations in reply to other Questions on today&rsquo;s Order Paper.</P><Col N="232"/>
        <P Just="Left">The issues of tolerance and human rights are of course at the heart of the conflict in the Middle East, which was characterised for many years by mutually exclusive claims and refusal to accept the rights of the other community. Broadly speaking, the resolution of the political issues is the essential step if greater mutual respect and toleration are to be achieved, and so our main efforts are focused on the resolution of the overall conflict. But Ireland also supports NGOs working for toleration and mutual engagement between the parties, including visits to Ireland by groups from both sides, and faith leaders. Ireland and our EU partners also engage in an active human rights dialogue with most countries in the Middle East, including Israel and the Palestinian Authority.</P>
        <P>There is a concern in this area and in the wider Middle East about growing radicalisation and intolerance, and also about the pressure this puts on minority groups such as the small but ancient Christian communities.  At the same time, many agencies and groups in the region are actively promoting toleration and mutual understanding.  I would point, in particular, to the work of UNWRA in this regard.</P>

	<P>Ireland and other European Union Member States have actively participated in efforts to reform and improve the effectiveness of the EU&rsquo;s humanitarian response capacity, in particular since the Asian tsunami of 2004.  This process is an ongoing exercise which involves drawing lessons from the response to major humanitarian crises and assessing how the EU can improve the effectiveness and coherence of its action, in close cooperation with the United Nations, which has overall responsibility for the coordination of humanitarian affairs worldwide.</P>
        <P>Ireland is presently participating actively in a Lessons Learned exercise being carried out by the EU following a number of recent large scale humanitarian crises such as the Haiti earthquake.  One important element of this process will be an assessment of how the response of individual Member States can be better coordinated. A number of EU States possess significant rapid response capacity which complements those within the United Nations and NGO systems. In Ireland we have the Rapid Response Corps managed by my Department &mdash; a system which is mirrored in a number of other Member States.  The Rapid Response Corps is a roster of highly skilled and experienced volunteers who make themselves available to deploy to humanitarian operations worldwide.</P>
        <P>Ireland supports efforts to improve cooperation and coordination between national mechanisms. We have encouraged the European Commission to base any future proposal for changes to EU arrangements on a thorough review of existing systems, so as to avoid duplication or overlap. Any future proposals should also be made in close consultation with the UN given the latter&rsquo;s pre-eminent role in the humanitarian sphere.</P>

	<P>I refer the Deputy to the answers I gave on 27 April and 6 July to his questions on the matter.  Dr Kian Tajbakhsh is a dual US-Iranian national, arrested in July 2009. Dr. Tajbakhsh&rsquo;s case was heard by an appeals court on 10 February and his sentence was set at five years for a variety of charges linked to the post-election disturbances in Iran. These charges have been strenuously denied by the US government, which has called for his release.  I understand that Dr. Tajbakhsh was released on bail on 13 March for the Iranian New Year and allowed to return to his family. There have also been unconfirmed reports that Dr. Tajbakhsh was only released after payment of a substantial bail. Dr. Tajbakhsh&rsquo;s release period was further extended in early April. It remains to be seen whether he will be permitted to leave the country.</P>
        <P>In a strong statement on Dr. Tajbakhsh&rsquo;s case on 1 December 2009, the EU Presidency reiterated its concerns and described the reports of Dr. Tajbakhsh facing additional charges as &ldquo;deeply worrying&rdquo;. The EU statement urged Iran to comply with all international and regional human rights instruments which it had ratified, and not least with the relevant articles of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights regarding the right to a fair trial, which is also enshrined in the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran.  The case of Dr. Tajbakhsh, as an American citizen, continues to be dealt with actively by the Swiss Embassy in Tehran, which represents US interests in Iran. Our Embassy in Tehran also continues to monitor closely the case. I join the US Government&rsquo;s calls for the Iranian authorities to allow Dr. Tajbakhsh to leave Iran.</P>

	<P>The north-south peace process in Sudan is at a critical juncture as the country prepares for a referendum on self-determination for the South and a separate referendum on the status of the district of Abyei in January 2011.  The referenda are envisaged by the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) between the National Congress Party (NCP) and the Sudanese People&rsquo;s Liberation Movement (SPLM), which brought an end to the north-south conflict in Sudan.  Ireland and the EU believe that full implementation of the CPA is fundamental to securing peace and stability in Sudan as a whole and in the wider region. This is a position shared by a wide range of countries, including the United States and the Member States of the African Union.</P>
        <P>In view of the importance attached to a peaceful and orderly referendum process in Sudan, the international community is paying close attention to developments in the country. On 24 September, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon hosted a high level meeting in New York on Sudan at which representatives of the Government of Sudan and the Government of South Sudan were joined by twelve Heads of State and Government, including US President Obama, as well as representatives of the EU, African Union and other interested parties in reaffirming the importance of full implementation of the CPA. Last week the members of the UN Security Council visited Sudan to review preparations for the referendum and also to assess the situation <Col N="234"/>in Darfur. The Intergovernmental Authority on Development, which groups six East-African states including Sudan, will hold a conference on Sudan next month.</P>
        <P>The EU Special Representative to Sudan, Rosalind Marsden, is playing an active role in encouraging both sides to fulfil their obligations under the CPA to put in place the necessary arrangements and to create the conditions to allow a free and fair referendum next January which produces a credible result that is accepted by all. The EU will deploy an Election Observation Mission to Sudan, to cover both the voter registration process and the referendum and preparations for this mission have already begun.  Nationally, Ireland attaches considerable importance to a peaceful and orderly referendum process. This was one of the pressing issues I highlighted in my address to the UN General Assembly last month and personnel from our Embassy have also recently visited South Sudan to review the situation on the ground.</P>
        <P>The continuing conflict in Darfur and the associated tensions with the international community over the ICC arrest warrant against President Bashir also impinge on the north south peace process.  The CPA calls for a settlement to the conflict in Darfur with the Doha peace process the focal point for international efforts to bring an end to the conflict there.  The negotiations are being led by the joint AU-UN chief mediator, Djibril Bassol&eacute;, whose work Ireland fully supports. While the Doha process suffered a serious setback in May when the Justice and Equality Movement (JEM), one of Darfur&rsquo;s biggest rebel groups, withdrew from the negotiations, following efforts by AU-UN chief mediator Bassol&eacute;, they have agreed to return to the negotiating table.</P>
        <P>The aim of mediation efforts remains a comprehensive resolution to the conflict in Darfur which brings peace, security and development to the people of this region, and Ireland, with its EU partners, will continue to support the ongoing efforts of the AU-UN chief mediator to achieve progress in the Doha talks.  I also welcome the commitment of other regional and international stakeholders to securing peace in Darfur.  At the same time, I believe that it is essential that a unified and coherent international approach is taken.  This approach will continue to inform EU policy on Darfur.  Ireland will also continue through its humanitarian aid programme in the region, which totalled almost &euro;3.5 million since 2008, to provide assistance to the large numbers of people displaced by the conflict.</P>
        <P>Ireland, the EU and the broader international community are strongly committed to support the development of a democratic, peaceful and prosperous Sudan and believe that only through an agreed approach which is inclusive of all Sudanese, can these objectives be met.  Taking into account the interdependent and complex nature of the political challenges facing Sudan, the Union will remain engaged during this pivotal period for Sudan.</P>

	<P>Mozambique is an important partner for both Ireland and the European Union in Africa, and a priority country within Ireland&rsquo;s official development cooperation programme.  Notwithstanding considerable economic and social progress since the conclusion of its civil war in 1992, Mozambique remains one of the poorest countries in the world, dependent on external resources. Ireland, together with EU and other donor partners, maintains an ongoing dialogue with the Government of Mozambique on political, economic and social developments in that country.  Our dialogue concentrates on how donors and the Government of Mozambique can work most effectively to tackle such <Col N="235"/>major challenges as the need to improve standards of governance and human rights, to continue to improve health and education outcomes, to strengthen agricultural productivity and improve access to food and nutrition, and how to most effectively mitigate the effects of natural disasters and other emergencies.</P>
        <P>With regard to the democratic process, in October 2009 the European Union sent an Election Observation Mission (EOM) to Mozambique to monitor Presidential, legislative and provincial assembly elections.  A number of Irish observers took part in that mission.  The monitors found that the election day was very well managed and the electoral campaign was constructive. However, transparency shortcomings and a degree of constraint with regard to political activity and voter choice at a local level were noted, as were certain irregularities which occurred during the tabulation process.  Twenty-five key recommendations to improve the electoral process were set out in the report of the monitors for consideration by the Government of Mozambique, the Electoral Commission and other stakeholders.</P>
        <P>Based on the key recommendations the European Union and other donors have agreed a Governance Action Plan with the Government of Mozambique which will see measures introduced in accordance with an agreed timetable to improve the electoral process and the operation of parliamentary accountability in the country.  The implementation of the agreed Governance Action Plan has begun, with proposals for reform of the Electoral Commission under active consideration, including formal consultation with civil society.  Opposition members of the National Assembly have been given access to resources in parliament.  Provincial level assemblies have been established, and the number of municipalities has been increased by around 50%.  In addition, greater responsibilities and resources are being devolved to provincial and district levels, notably in the areas of health and education, sectors in which Ireland is particularly active.</P>
        <P>Ireland played a key role in driving agreement of the Governance Action Plan, as a member of the leadership troika which led the discussions with the Government of Mozambique.  Ireland, together with other donors, is supporting the change process and actively monitoring the implementation of the Governance Action Plan.  In addition, we continue to work closely with the Government of Mozambique and other partners on wider governance issues.</P>
        <P>Urban poverty and anger over price rises were among the catalysts of two days of civil unrest in Mozambique&rsquo;s capital, Maputo, in early September, which saw at least 13 people killed and around 300 injured.  The disturbances illustrate the ongoing potential for instability in Mozambique, a consequence of poverty.  Amongst other things, the violence underlines the need for greater transparency, accountability and the proper functioning of democratic institutions including the Parliamentary and local Government systems.  Ireland, along with our EU partners, has been monitoring developments in the aftermath of these incidents closely, and will continue to do so.</P>

	<P>In 2005, the leaders of the G8 countries, at their Summit in Gleneagles, agreed to establish the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), with a focus on the cancellation of the heavy debt burden on developing countries.  It was intended to supplement the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries <Col N="236"/>(HIPC) initiative which was launched in 1996 to reduce the debt burden of qualifying countries to sustainable levels.   The MDRI came into effect on 1 July 2006, and provides for cancellation of eligible debt from the World Bank, the African Development Fund and the IMF for many of the world&rsquo;s poorest and most indebted countries, most of them in Africa.  In 2007, the Inter-American Development Bank agreed to provide similar debt relief to the five poorest countries in Latin America and the Caribbean.  The overall aim is to relieve these countries from the burden of servicing debt and assist them in making progress on the UN Millennium Development Goals.   </P>
        <P>To date, the total debt relief provided by the international community to eligible countries under both of these international initiatives has been $106.7 billion, of which $ 30.3 billion has been provided through MDRI and $ 76.4 billion through the HIPC initiative.</P>
        <P>Ireland is recognised internationally for the role we are playing in focusing on the reduction of global poverty and hunger and making international aid more effective for developing countries.  We have strongly supported initiatives to ease or cancel the debt burden.  Importantly, Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral assistance to the developing world is exclusively in the form of grants rather than loans.  Ireland&rsquo;s share of the total cost of debt relief provided by the World Bank under the MDRI is &euro;58.64 million.  The Government contributed this amount in full in 2006.  Ireland has also contributed over &euro;20 million towards the cost of implementing the HIPC initiative.</P>
        <P>In the wake of the devastating earthquake in Haiti earlier this year the Government contributed almost &euro;1 million towards the cancellation of Haiti&rsquo;s debt to the World Bank.  This money is in addition Ireland&rsquo;s contribution to both the HIPC and MDRI initiatives.  The debt cancellation was implemented through a dedicated debt relief trust fund established at the World Bank&rsquo;s Development Association.</P>

	<P>AIDS remains a leading cause of death in many developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa where over 22 million people are infected with HIV.  Addressing HIV and AIDS is essential to the reduction of global poverty.</P>
        <P>Recent data from the UNAIDS World Report is encouraging in that global HIV prevalence and death rates are now declining.  Success in a number of African countries offers hope that, with international support, it will be possible to get ahead of this infection.  In Mozambique for example, where Ireland partners effectively with the Clinton Foundation, over 200,000 people are now on HIV treatment, up from less than 2,000 people at the end of 2002.</P>
        <P>These gains represent major steps to overcome AIDS.  However, for every two persons put on treatment five others become newly infected.  There is clearly a need to improve prevention and Ireland is focused on this challenge.  For example, we are strong supporters of research into the development of an effective AIDS vaccine.  Irish support for actions to combat HIV, AIDS and communicable diseases will continue to prioritise those most affected by the pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa.  This year, under the aid programme managed by the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Government will spend approximately &euro;100 million combating HIV and AIDS and communicable diseases.  This support clearly illustrates the seriousness of <Col N="237"/>our commitment to tackle HIV and AIDS and communicable diseases, in particular in sub-Saharan Africa where our programme is focussed.</P>

	<P>The issue of enlargement features regularly on the agenda of the General Affairs Council which I attend and in my bilateral discussions with EU Ministerial colleagues.  The December 2009 Council adopted detailed conclusions, subsequently endorsed by the European Council, regarding enlargement generally and in relation to the position of various aspirant member states.  It underlined that enlargement is based on consolidating commitments, fair and rigorous conditionality and the EU&rsquo;s capacity to integrate new members, and that each country is assessed on its own merits.  The Council plans to discuss enlargement again in detail at the European Council in December.  Prior to this, the European Commission is due to publish their annual progress reports on candidate countries, in November.  These reports will provide a basis for further discussion and conclusions at the December Council.</P>
        <P>Negotiations with Croatia are well advanced and work on most chapters will be completed by the end of the year.  Currently, 22 of the 35 negotiating chapters have been closed and the work of the Accession Treaty Drafting Group is well underway.  Issues that still require effort concern measures to combat corruption and organised crime, and cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.</P>
        <P>Progress in the negotiations with Turkey has been slow (only 13 of 35 negotiating chapters opened to date).  Turkey&rsquo;s failure to fulfil its obligations under the Ankara Protocol and to normalise its relations with Cyprus remains a key obstacle and these issues are likely again to dominate discussions on enlargement at the December Council.  The European Council in 2006 decided that eight relevant negotiating chapters could not be opened and no further chapters may be closed until Turkey&rsquo;s compliance with the Protocol is verified by the Commission.  September&rsquo;s successful referendum approving constitutional reforms was seen by the Commission as a step in the right direction in general terms, although the Commission stressed that there is much progress still required.</P>
        <P>An intergovernmental conference with Iceland on 27 July marked the formal opening of negotiations and the negotiations are proceeding.  Despite significant concerns regarding domestic opinion towards EU accession, the government is still very much in favour.</P>
        <P>In October 2009, the Commission recommended formally opening accession negotiations with the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.  The December Council welcomed progress made in a number of important areas but stopped short of endorsing the Commission&rsquo;s recommendation to open negotiations.  The key obstacle is a bilateral dispute with Greece regarding the use of the name &ldquo;Macedonia.&rdquo;  No breakthrough was reached at the June General Affairs Council and major progress is not expected over the next six months.  Serbia&rsquo;s application for membership (made in December 2009) has yet to be fully considered by the Council.  The June Foreign Affairs Council agreed that the ratification process for Serbia&rsquo;s Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU could begin.  Although Council stopped short of referring Serbia&rsquo;s application to the Commission for an avis, the conclusions welcomed Serbia&rsquo;s commitment to EU integration&rdquo; and indicated that the Council would &ldquo;return to the membership <Col N="238"/>application&rdquo;.  The matter is expected to be considered at a General Affairs Council in the near future.</P>
        <P>The Commission will continue its work on opinions on Albania&rsquo;s and Montenegro&rsquo;s applications for membership made in December 2008 and April 2009, respectively.  No applications have yet been received from Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina or from Kosovo.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that enlargement is a negotiated process and, as in any negotiation, the eventual outcome and timeframe cannot be predetermined.</P>
        <P>As a beneficiary of past enlargement, and on the experience of more recent accessions, Ireland is broadly supportive of enlargement.  The prospect of enlargement bolsters economic and political reform processes and helps to promote stability, security and prosperity in Europe.  Ireland takes an active role in discussions on the issue, both at Council meetings and in bilateral discussions with existing and aspirant member states.</P>

	<P>The Technical Assistance and Training Scheme allows the Department of Social Protection to provide support to Back to Work Enterprise Allowance recipients who are engaging in self employment projects, to enhance their chances of success to become independent of the social welfare system.  This is a discretionary scheme and there is not an entitlement to the Technical Assistance and Training Scheme as of right.  Where appropriate, the fund can also be used to provide support to other social welfare customers who may require assistance in accessing the labour market or are trying to establish an enterprise and need training or other supports.  Take up of the Technical Assistance and Training Scheme has been very positive in 2010.  The Department has reviewed funding for the scheme for the remainder of the year and the allocation has been increased by over 30%.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 401 and 427 together.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office there are currently 20,781 appeals being processed, of which 1,970 are in respect of Carer&rsquo;s Allowance.  It is a statutory requirement of the appeals process that the relevant Departmental papers and comments by or on behalf of the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal must be sought in each case.  On the return of the papers and comments to the Social Welfare Appeals Office the case is referred to an Appeals Officer who will either make a decision summarily based on the documentary evidence or, if s/he considers it necessary, will list the case for oral hearing.  Dealing with a case by oral hearing adds, on average, 11 weeks to the processing time.  Given the volume of appeals and the foregoing factors, it is not possible to estimate the length of time before a case is determined.  There was a 46% increase in the number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office in 2009 when compared to 2008, which in itself was 27% greater than the numbers received in 2007.  There was an increase of a further 44% in the number of appeals received in the first eight months of 2010.  These increases have caused delays in the processing of appeals. In order to be fair to all appellants, the vetting of appeals and the arranging of oral hearings are being dealt with in chronological order.</P><Col N="240"/>
        <P>A number of initiatives have been put in place to enhance the capacity of the office to deal with the current caseload and inflows.  In that regard:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />2 additional Appeals Officers were assigned to the Office in 2009,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A number of additional staff were assigned to the administration area of the Office,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The organisation of the Appeals Officer&rsquo;s work has been changed so as to increase productivity,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A project to improve the business processes in the office was undertaken which has resulted in a number of improvements being implemented, and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Significant enhancements have been made to the office&rsquo;s IT and phone systems.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In addition, it was decided to use experienced retired staff strictly on a short term basis to supplement the current resources and the services of eight retired officers have now been secured on a part-time basis and have been operating since July.</P>
        <P>I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping current processes under continuous review with a view to achieving a more effective throughput of appeals, while ensuring that any progress does not conflict with due process in terms of the rights of appellants and adherence to the requirements of natural justice.</P>

It is a statutory requirement of the appeals process that the relevant Departmental papers and comments by the Social Welfare Services on the grounds of appeal be sought.

	<P>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that an Appeals Officer, having fully considered all the evidence, disallowed the appeal of the person concerned by way of summary decision.  The legislation provides that an Appeals Officer may decide a case before him/her on the basis of the documentary evidence.  This course of action was taken in the case of the person concerned as it was considered that an oral hearing was not warranted.</P>
        <P>Under Social Welfare legislation, the decision of the Appeals Officer is final and conclusive and may only be reviewed by the Appeals Officer in the light of new evidence or new facts.</P>
        <P>The Appeals Officer has reviewed this case following the submission of further correspondence from the person concerned.  However, the Appeals Officer considered that the corre<Col N="243"/>spondence contained no new facts or fresh evidence which would warrant a revision of his decision.  The person concerned has been notified of the Appeals Officers review.

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the fact that he failed to provide the cost of extending eligibility for the back to school clothing and footwear allowance to include all those families in receipt of family income supplement as requested in a parliamentary question of 29 September 2010; and if he will do so now. </Quest>

	<P>The BSCFA scheme provides a one-off payment to eligible families to assist with the extra clothing and footwear costs when their children start school each autumn. A person may qualify for payment of back to school clothing and footwear allowance if they are in receipt of a social welfare or Health Service Executive payment, are participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and have household income at or below certain set levels.  </P>
        <P>Family Income Supplement is a qualifying payment for back to school clothing and footwear purposes. People in receipt of FIS qualify, subject to the standard means test and any income received by an applicant in the form of family income supplement is not assessable.</P>
        <P>There were approximately 28,000 claimants in receipt of FIS at the end of September 2010. Based on an average claim value of &euro;485 the cost of extending the BSCFA scheme to all FIS recipients in 2010 would be approximately &euro;13.6m maximum. However, given that FIS is a qualifying payment for BSCFA a number of the 2010 FIS recipients may already have received BSCFA payment in 2010.</P>
        <P>As there are no statistics available in the Department on the numbers that were paid BSCFA in 2010 who are also in receipt of FIS it is not possible to estimate the actual cost of extending the BSCFA scheme to all FIS recipients.</P>
        <P>Any improvements to the BSCFA scheme, including automatic entitlement for those getting family income supplement, would need to be considered in the context of the Budget and in the light of resources available to me for improvements in social welfare payments generally.</P>

	<P>Progression in education is a fundamental and constant element of the back to education allowance (BTEA) programme. The operational guidelines for BTEA specify that a participant who fails to complete, or drops out of a course will not be permitted on to the scheme to pursue a different course unless the Department is satisfied that certain circumstances pertain.  </P>
        <P>The person concerned availed of the BTEA programme in 2007 to pursue a one-year FETAC level 5 course in graphic design.  In 2008 she was further approved for BTEA to pursue a three year course at level 7 in tourism.  She dropped out of that course in October 2009 having completed year one.</P><Col N="246"/>
        <P>She again applied for BTEA in September 2010 to pursue a course at level 7 in applied social studies.  This course did not represent progression from the course from which she had dropped out a year earlier and consequently her application was disallowed. This decision was reviewed by a reviewing officer and the disallowance was upheld.</P>

	<P>The back to education programme provides a wide range of second chance education opportunities for unemployed people, lone parents and people with disabilities. The Department&rsquo;s objective in this area is to facilitate people of working age on welfare payments to return to education in order to gain qualifi<Col N="247"/>cations which will help to enhance their employment prospects.  The back to education programmes were introduced to provide a comprehensive range of options from which an unemployed person can choose, or be directed to, the most appropriate for his/her needs.  These options range from basic courses of education, training or development through to third level postgraduate courses of study.</P>
        <P>The education, training and development (ET&amp;D) courses are generally short term courses such as personal development courses, literacy classes or general training courses. It must be clear that the course will enhance the person&rsquo;s employment prospects, be approved by a departmental Facilitator, and be wholly or partially approved by a state agency or area partnership or a voluntary or community group.  The person is deemed to be available for employment for the duration of the course.  To qualify, a person must be over 21 years and getting a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment for at least six months or aged 18 to 20 years if out of formal education for at least two years.</P>
        <P>Under the ET&amp;D option, a person in receipt of a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment may continue to receive the jobseeker payment while attending certain courses provided specific conditions are satisfied.  Where those conditions are satisfied, people who qualify for the ET&amp;D option continue to be paid jobseeker&rsquo;s allowance or jobseeker&rsquo;s benefit at the appropriate rate and payment only continues for the duration of the jobseeker&rsquo;s claim.</P>
        <P>ET&amp;D claims are not recorded as a separate scheme, therefore such statistical information is not collated centrally and comprehensive data is not, moreover, available on the number of applications approved for this option of the scheme nor is there a breakdown of course profiles in the past year.</P>

	<P>The person concerned originally applied for disability allowance on 26 February 2008 . His claim was assessed by a medical assessor who was of the opinion that he was not medically suitable for disability allowance. The deciding officer accepted that medical opinion and further decided that the person in question was not habitually resident in the State. As he failed to satisfy the medical and habitual residence conditions, his claim was refused. A letter issued to him on 7 August 2008 advising him of this decision and of his right of appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  The person applied again for disability allowance on 27 November 2008. While the medical assessor gave the opinion that the medical condition was satisfied on the basis of the medical evidence supplied with that application, it was decided that he was not entitled to disability allowance as he did not satisfy the habitual residence condition. A letter issued to him on 29 January 2009 advising him of this decision and of his right of appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. </P>
        <P>The person subsequently appealed this decision. The appeals officer decided that the person was not habitually resident in the State and the appeal was disallowed on 12 August 2009. An appeal&rsquo;s officer&rsquo;s decision is final and conclusive in the absence of any fresh facts or evidence and, therefore, will not be reviewed.</P><Col N="250"/>
        <P>However, it is open to the person concerned to re-apply for disability allowance and his claim will be examined to see if he currently satisfies the medical, means and habitual residency conditions for receipt of disability allowance.</P>

	<P>In order to qualify for Domiciliary Care Allowance a child must have a disability so severe that it requires the child needing care and attention and/or supervision substantially in excess of another child of the same age. This care and attention must be given by another person, effectively full-time so that the child can deal with the activities of daily living. The child must be likely to require this level of care and attention for at least 12 months.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Eligibility for Domiciliary Care Allowance is not based primarily on the impairment or disease, but on the resulting lack of function of body or mind necessitating a degree of extra care and attention required. As such it is not possible to say in advance if a child diagnosed with autism or indeed any other condition will qualify for a payment under the scheme. Every application is assessed by one of the Department's Medical Assessors and an individual medical opinion, based on the information submitted by the applicant in support of their claim, is offered in each case. The deciding officer then makes a decision having considered the medical opinion provided and all the other information available.</P>

	<P>The Social Welfare Appeals Office has advised me that an appeal by the person concerned against the disallowance of Disability Allowance was registered in that office on 16 June 2010. It is a statutory requirement of the appeals process that the relevant Departmental papers and comments by or on behalf of the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal be sought.  These papers were received back in the Social Welfare Appeals Office on 26 August 2010 and the appeal will be referred in due course to an Appeals Officer who will decide whether the case can be decided on a summary basis or whether to list it for oral hearing.</P>
        <P>There was a 46% increase in the number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office in 2009 when compared to 2008, which in itself was 27% greater than the numbers received in 2007. There was an increase of a further 44% in the number of appeals received in the first eight months of 2010. These increases have caused delays in the processing of appeals. In order to be fair to all appellants, oral hearings are arranged in strict chronological order.</P>
        <P>A number of initiatives have been put in place to enhance the capacity of the office to deal with the current caseload and inflows.  In that regard:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />2 additional Appeals Officers were assigned to the Office in 2009,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A number of additional staff were assigned to the administration area of the Office,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The organisation of the Appeals Officer&rsquo;s work has been changed so as to increase productivity,</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />A project to improve the business processes in the office was undertaken which has resulted in a number of improvements being implemented, and</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Significant enhancements have been made to the office&rsquo;s IT and phone systems.</P><Col N="254"/>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">In addition, it was decided to use experienced retired staff strictly on a short term basis to supplement the current resources and the services of eight retired officers have now been secured on a part-time basis and have been operating since July.</P>
        <P>I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping current processes under continuous review with a view to achieving a more effective throughput of appeals, while ensuring that any progress does not conflict with due process in terms of the rights of appellants and adherence to the requirements of natural justice.</P>

	<P>The person concerned applied for disability allowance on 17 February 2009. He was examined by a medical assessor who was of the opinion that he was not medically suitable for disability allowance. The deciding officer accepted that opinion and refused his claim and a letter issued to the person on 18 June 2009 advising him of this decision and of his right of appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. </P>
        <P>The person subsequently appealed this decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office. Based on the evidence before him, which included all medical reports furnished by the person, the appeals officer was of the opinion that the person had not suffered an illness, injury or disease which has continued, or may be expected to continue, for a period of at least one year and the appeal was disallowed. He was notified of this decision by the Social Welfare Appeals Office on 21 April 2010.</P>
        <P>The person subsequently sent further medical evidence to the Social Welfare Appeals Office and his file was re-examined by an appeals officer. The Social Welfare Appeals Office wrote to him on 31 August 2010 stating that the appeals officer&rsquo;s original decision remained unchanged.  An appeal&rsquo;s officer&rsquo;s decision is final and conclusive in absence of any fresh facts or evidence.  The person concerned reapplied for disability allowance on 11 June 2010. His claim was assessed by a medical assessor who was of the opinion that he was not medically suitable for disability allowance. The deciding officer accepted that opinion and refused his claim and a letter issued to the person on 6 September 2010 advising him of this decision and of his right of appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 442 and 443 together.</P>
        <P>A high-level coordinating group, chaired by my Department, is looking at the opportunities that may arise for Ireland, across the sports, tourism and cultural sectors, from the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games.  The group comprises representatives from F&aacute;ilte Ireland, Tourism Ireland, the Arts Council, Culture Ireland, the Irish Sports Council, the Olympic Council of Ireland, Paralympic Council of Ireland and the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The discussions of the group are taking into account the current economic situation and the findings of the London 2012 Olympics and Paralympics Task Force Report which was published last year.</P>
        <P>In terms of the tourism potential of the event, a number of specific initiatives are being undertaken by the Tourism Agencies to seek to maximise the potential benefits to Irish tourism of having the Olympics in London. These measures include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Working with the official tour operators responsible for co-ordinating the travel arrangements for athletes participating in the Games to ensure that Ireland is included as a destination for pre and post-Olympics packages.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Arranging pre and post-Olympics familiarisation visits for key media contacts who are attending the London Olympics. These visits will showcase the sports facilities and cultural product on offer throughout Ireland.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Targeting tourists from London who may wish to get away from the city when the games are in progress, by offering good value offers and packages linked to other events in Ireland and presenting Ireland as a place to escape to and relax.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Since there will be reduced accommodation and carrier capacity available for visitors who wish to travel to London when the Olympics are on, Tourism Ireland will also be working with UK inbound tour operators to offer alternatives which would fill any gaps in their normal programmes, thereby diverting business to Ireland.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />F&aacute;ilte Ireland supported University College Dublin in their launch as a potential Olympic Training camp venue and also supported the European Triathlon Championships this year in Athlone.</P><Col N="257"/>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The Tourism agencies are also working with Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Bord Bia, as well as their counterparts in the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, VisitLondon and VisitBritain, to identify other opportunities to maximise the tourism potential of the London Olympics for Ireland.</P>
        <P>One of the issues that the London 2012 coordinating group is looking at is Ireland&rsquo;s potential to attract international teams and athletes for training camps in the lead up to London 2012.  The Deputy may be aware that the American Olympic Synchronised Swimming Squad has chosen the National Aquatic Centre as its pre-Olympic Training Base for the London Games.  The squad of over 20 swimmers and team officials will be based in Dublin for three separate periods and will be joined in Ireland by family members and friends at various stages during their stays.</P>
        <P>My Department is also producing a CD which will contain the details of a number of Irish elite sports facilities which are suitable as pre-London training camps.  This CD will be promoted through the network of National Olympic/Paralympic Committees and the Irish Embassies abroad in the coming months.</P>
        <P>These are some of the practical areas of work that are underway. The high-level coordinating group will continue to meet on an ongoing basis over the next two years to maximise opportunities from the London 2012 Games.</P>
        <P>The Arts Council and Culture Ireland is developing proposals for a cultural programme which would include participation in the Cultural Olympiad of Irish culture groups and the organisation of a cultural programme in Ireland targeted at those of Irish descent living in the UK.</P>

	<P>The Local Government (Charges) Act 2009, which introduced the non-principal private residence charge, places the onus on individual property owners to assess their liability for the charge in the first instance.  A person who is ordinarily resident abroad and owns a property in the State which is not his or her main residence would be liable for the charge in the same manner as a person resident in the State.</P>
        <P>On the charge&rsquo;s introduction in 2009, radio and newspaper campaigns were run by my Department to ensure public awareness of the charge.  Local authorities have also undertaken advertising campaigns this year, both locally and nationally.  In addition, a number of local authorities have separately sent reminders to property owners registered with the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB).  In this regard, every effort has been made to ensure that property owners are aware of the charge and any potential liability arising therefrom.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 446, 447 and 455 together.</P><Col N="259"/>
        <P>A complaint was received from the European Commission in May 2009, through the EU Pilot Pre-Infringement process, concerning the regulatory status of the former Irish Ispat site at Haulbowline.  Ireland wrote to the Commission in October 2009 setting out the current position and a response from the Commission is still awaited.  The Commission has recently forwarded to the Government an additional letter of formal notice, dated 30th September 2010, relating to the 2005 judgement of the Court of Justice of the European Communities in Case C-494/01. While it is the case that this letter references the former Irish Ispat site, this site did not form part of original judgement. The reference in the Commission&rsquo;s letter relates to the issue of ensuring that the site is covered by a valid waste authorisation and my Department will arrange for this issue to be addressed in the reply to be sent to the Commission within the two month period provided for under article 260(2) of the EU Treaty.</P>
        <P>In June 2009, the Government decided that the Office of Public Works (OPW) would chair a working group to develop a structured and coherent approach to the further management and development of the former Irish Ispat site.  The group is now established and has held a number of meetings.</P>
        <P>The Terms of Reference of the OPW Working Group include looking at the regulatory requirements for the site and advising the Government on the most beneficial future use of the site. The future use will in itself determine the levels and extent of further works and/or remediation required, as well as helping to clarify the further regulatory requirements which may fall to be met.  It is also understood that the EPA has been in contact with the OPW in relation to the regulatory requirements applicable to the site.</P>

        <Quest> the status of the regional planning guidelines and the democratically adopted Cork county development plan and Cork area strategic plan in the context of a recent An Bord Plean&aacute;la decision regarding development of park and ride facilities at a location (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

	<P>The statutorily-based South West Regional Authority Regional Planning Guidelines 2010 to 2022  , which were adopted by the South West Regional Authority in July this year, replace the 2004 Regional Planning Guidelines and set a strategic planning framework for development plans within the area of the authority over the 12-year period.  The Cork Area Strategic Plan, adopted jointly by Cork County Council and Cork City Council, provides the strategic framework for the development of the Gateway city within the regional and national policy context.  The Cork County Development Plan 2009-2015 was adopted by the Council on 9 January 2009.</P>
        <P>Following a public consultation process during which thirty six submissions were received, my Department is currently reviewing and finalising the Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Spatial Planning and National Roads.  These Guidelines, which are aimed at ensuring that roads planning and policy, and development planning and management processes are appropriately and effectively aligned, encourage a collaborative approach and early engagement, in line with international best practice, between planning authorities and the National Roads Authority with the aim of ensuring that transport and land use planning considerations are taken into account at the early stages of both development plan and development management processes.  This is to ensure that future development at locations on, or in the vicinity of, national roads is guided to the most suitable location and that work on Ireland&rsquo;s national roads network is planned for and managed in a complementary and integrated manner.</P><Col N="260"/>
        <P>Under planning legislation, the decision as to whether to grant a planning application, with or without conditions, is a matter for the relevant planning authority and An Bord Plean&aacute;la on appeal.  In making decisions on planning applications, planning authorities and the Board must consider the proper planning and sustainable development of the area, having regard to the provisions of the development plan, any submissions or observations received, and relevant Ministerial or Government policies, including any guidelines issued by the Minister.</P>

	<P>The Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library, provides for the development of a comprehensive range of new water services infrastructure in the Dun Laoghaire/Rathdown County Council area.  The Dun Laoghaire Sewerage Scheme Phase 1 (Carysfort &mdash; Maretimo Stream Contract) is included in the Programme with the list of contracts in the county to start in the period 2010-2012, at an estimated cost of &euro;5.9m.</P>
        <P>In the course of assessing tenders for the contract, D&uacute;n Laoghaire/Rathdown County Council advised a contractor that the tender submitted by that company was non-compliant.  In accordance with the terms of the tendering process the contractor exercised the right to have the matter referred to my Department for review.  This review is in progress and will be concluded as speedily as possible.</P>
        <P>Separately the council submitted a request to my Department seeking confirmation that funding is available to allow the contract to be awarded.  As this request does not take account of the tender review process currently in train it is deemed premature.  I will make the necessary funding available to allow the contract proceed when the procurement process has been satisfactorily completed.</P>

In particular, it introduces a new provision to provide that a planning authority may take in charge an unfinished estate, at the request of the owners of the housing units, at any time after the expiration of the planning permission, in situations where enforcement actions have commenced or where the planning authority consider that enforcement action will not result in the satisfactory completion of the estate by the developer.  Planning authorities have also been empowered to take in charge part of an estate or some, but not all, of the facilities in an estate.</P>

	<P>In April 2010, my Department issued a circular letter to housing authorities setting out revised arrangements for the funding of land used for social housing and seeking information on local authority residential land holdings for the purpose of land-use strategy planning.  </P>
        <P>For the purpose of this land audit, information was sought on the location, size, title, zoning status, whether the site is serviced or not, and the timeframe for development of each site (i.e. if development is planned to occur within the next five years).  GIS co-ordinates were also requested, if available.</P>
        <P>Housing Authorities were also asked to indicate whether the land was the subject of a Housing Finance Agency (HFA) loan. Where this is the case, information was sought on the original advance amount; start date and term of loan; interest paid to date and the current outstanding principal on the loan.</P><Col N="263"/>
        <P>Following submission of their land audit, local authorities have been given the option to apply to my Department to recoup the cost of outstanding loans that are due to mature before the end of 2010 and where it is considered that the land involved is unlikely to be developed in the short to medium term.  Subject to available funding my Department will pay off the costs of the land and transfer ownership to Housing and Sustainable Communities Ltd.  These lands will continue to be available for social housing if housing projects are advanced by authorities under the Social Housing Investment Programme.</P>
        <P>To date, my Department has received applications, including Council approval, from five authorities seeking inclusion in the Land Aggregation Scheme.  The details of these are set out in the table below.</P>

	<P>Ireland signed the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters on 25 June 1998.  Ratification of the Convention is a matter of the highest priority and my Department is working closely with the Office of the Attorney General in order to finalise this process. Ireland is largely compliant with the provisions of the Convention, although there are some outstanding issues to resolve in the context of the access to justice pillar.  When this work has been completed I, along with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, will ensure that the ratification process is advanced as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>There is no provision in Irish law for the use of &lsquo;Aarhus Certificates&rsquo;.  However, I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the new costs rule set out in Section 33 of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010.</P>

        <P>Revenues from the levies on plastic shopping bags and the landfill of waste are paid into a &lsquo;ring-fenced&rsquo; Environment Fund, established under the Waste Management (Amendment) Act 2001, and can only be used for activities that are of benefit to the environment. The purposes for which the Fund may be used are set out in  section 74(9) of the Waste Management Act 1996 (as inserted by section 12 of the Waste Management (Amendment) Act 2001) and the Waste Management (Environment Fund)(Prescribed Payments) Regulations 2003.</P>

	<P>The operation of a landfill is subject to the requirement to obtain a waste licence from the Environmental Protection Agency under the Waste Management Acts 1996-2010.  The existing waste legislation contains a number of provisions, including the use of legal remedies, to ensure that landfill sites do not damage the environment.  I have no plans to change the existing legislation in this regard.  </P>
        <P>The European Communities (Environmental Liability) Regulations 2008, which came into operation on 1 April 2009, transpose the EU Environmental Liability Directive into Irish law and provide a framework for the imposition of liability on those who cause environmental damage.  It is my position that those responsible for environmental damage should be held fully financially responsible for the damage caused, and I believe that the appropriate legislation has been provided.</P>

	<P>I assume the Question refers to the Water Services Investment Programme 2007- 2009, which outlined 955 schemes worth an estimated &euro;5.8 billion to be advanced over the period of the National Development Plan 2007-2013 and beyond. </P>
        <P>The Exchequer spent some &euro;1.17 billion over the period 2007&ndash;09 in progressing projects under the Water Services Investment Programme.  This expenditure related to both the construction phases on ongoing contracts and the planning costs of future works.  Consequently, a direct comparison cannot be drawn between expenditure in the period 2007-2009 and the overall value of the projects listed for progression in the Programme.</P>
        <P>The objective of the Programme reflected the goals for the Water Services Sector set out in the National Development Plan 2007-2013 and was primarily focused on meeting environmental goals and objectives, while also facilitating economic and development needs.  Good progress was made on achieving these objectives over the 3 year period of the Programme.  For example, continued progress was made on meeting the targets under the EU Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive. Compliance with the end 2005 deadline for the provision of secondary treatment under the Directive stood at some 92% compared to 25% at the start of 2000; all remaining schemes needed to ensure full compliance are included in the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012.  In the period 2007-2009, 125 water and wastewater schemes were completed.  The increase in wastewater treatment capacity over the period was equivalent to the needs of a population of 650,000; the increase in drinking water treatment capacity was equivalent to the needs of a population of 370,000.</P>
        <P>A copy of the Water Services Investment Programme for the period 2010-2012, which was published last April 2010, is available in the Oireachtas library.</P>

	<P>The Irish Heritage Trust was established to acquire for public access major heritage properties where the State does not wish to acquire them directly and where there is an imminent risk to their heritage value.  The Trust is designated as a charity under the Companies Acts.  The staff of the Trust are not public servants and the salaries set are a matter for the Trust. </P>
        <P>The Irish Heritage Trust has acquired one heritage property, to date, Fota House in County Cork.  My Department provided endowment funding to the Trust of &euro;5 million towards the conservation and presentation of the property.  The Trust has also used the provisions of Section 1003A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, as amended, to enable the donation of the Richard Wood Collection of Irish Art and Furniture to the Trust. This collection is now presented in Fota House.  At the Fota House property, the Irish Heritage Trust has established an innovative events programme, guided tour visitor experience, volunteer programme, and an online educational initiative as well as carrying out necessary conservation works to the property.</P>
        <P>In the current economic and budgetary circumstances, the Irish Heritage Trust is focusing on partnership/acquisition projects that will not require State endowment funding.</P>
        <P>The budgetary and other information requested in relation to the Irish Heritage Trust is set out in the following table.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy may be aware the allocation of angling rights is a matter for those who own fishing rights on rivers.  I understand that ownership of fishing rights on the River Sullane is fragmented, with stretches of the river both in public and private ownership.</P><Col N="269"/>
        <P>I am advised that as far as can be ascertained the Macroom Fly Anglers Club is the only established angling club, which has operated on the river since 1922 with the agreement of local fishery owners.  The Department has no role in the allocation of privately owned fishery rights.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>Window replacement works are not eligible for support under the Home Energy Saving (HES) Scheme and the Warmer Homes Scheme, both of which are administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), on behalf of my Department.</P>
        <P>The schemes provide support for attic and wall insulation, efficient boilers and heating controls.  These measures were selected for inclusion in the scheme, with the advice from the SEAI, which has considerable expertise on residential energy efficiency matters.  The SEAI recommended these measures to my Department as most likely to deliver significant energy savings to homeowners, at least cost.</P>
        <P>I am advised that grants for window replacement are available to those over 60 under the Housing Aid for Older People Scheme, operated by local authorities on behalf of my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  This means-tested scheme provides grants to assist older people living in poor housing conditions to have necessary repairs or improvements carried out to their homes.  Eligible works include structural repairs or improvements, re-wiring, repairs to or replacement of windows and doors, provision of water supply and sanitary facilities, provision of heating, cleaning and painting.</P>
        <P>There are undoubtedly other measures not currently included in the HES and WHS schemes that may also deliver strong energy savings.  My Department is keeping the schemes under continuous review and if there is a strong case for adding other measures to the scheme, it will be given full consideration.</P>

	<P>In the case of bays and estuaries into which two or more rivers flow, the expert advice requires that all impacted rivers are meeting their conservation limits before harvest of salmon stocks is permitted. </P>
        <P>At present, the published assessment in respect of the common estuary in Lough Swilly indicates that the rivers Mill, Swilly and Lennan are not meeting their conservation limits.  Accordingly, for conservation reasons, the harvest of fish is not permissible in the area referred to by the Deputy.</P>
        <P>The status of the stocks of salmon rivers is reviewed annually.</P>

	<P>The provision of telecommunication services, including services delivered through fibre optic connections, is primarily a matter for service providers who operate in a fully liberalised market regulated by an independent telecommunications regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg). </P>
        <P>State intervention in the commercial telecommunications market only occurs in instances of market failure.  The National Broadband Scheme and the Government funded Metropolitan Area Networks programme are examples of where such interventions were required.</P>
        <P>There are a number of platforms for the delivery of telecommunications and service providers are now offering broadband by wireless, satellite, fibre, co-axial cable, mobile, or standard telephone copper lines.  All areas of the country are served by at least two platforms (satellite and one other).  Most areas are served by more than two competing service providers.</P>
        <P>ComReg operates a dedicated website www.callcosts.ie where potential broadband customers can ascertain the availability of services from alternative service providers.  The information on availability and pricing is provided by the servicer providers.  All broadband services are subject to survey.</P>

        <Quest>   the policies that have been established by his Department to ensure that natural resource development ensures openness and transparency together with early meaningful consultation and co-operation with local communities; if he will he introduce measures to ensure that the State and semi-State energy companies under his remit make every effort to operate in an open and transparent manner, co-operate and consult with local communities where they propose to develop natural resource projects; and if he will make a statement on the matter.   </Quest>

	<P>The State and semi-State energy companies under my remit comply fully with all statutory consultation processes in regard to natural resource projects.  Over and above the statutory requirements, the bodies, in general terms, have management plans in place for such projects.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act, 1960, as amended, a Plan of Development is required for all petroleum projects.  Applicants requesting consent to develop petroleum projects are required to publish details of the Environmental Impact Statement submitted in support of such an application, inviting written submissions or observations to be made to the Minister within the prescribed timeframe.</P>
        <P>The relevant prescribed bodies are simultaneously consulted.  Submissions received on foot of this consultation process are considered in the course of the overall assessment.</P>
        <P>Should additional information considered to have a potential significant effect on the environment come to light in the course of the assessment, applicants are required to publish such additional information for a further statutory period, inviting written submissions or observations to be made to the Minister.</P>
        <P>Development of minerals under the Minerals Development Acts 1940 to 1999 is subject to Environmental Impact Assessment through the planning acts and regulations.  This involves a major public consultation process and provides an opportunity for planning decisions on mining proposals to be appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  My Department is a statutory consultee in this process.  In addition, my Department complies fully with the public consultation procedures prescribed in the Minerals Development Acts.</P>
        <P>Inland Fisheries Ireland and the Loughs Agency are charged with the responsibility of the development of the inland fisheries resource and relevant provisions contained in the Inland Fisheries Acts 1959-2010 and Foyle Fisheries Act 1952, as amended by the Foyle and Carlingford Fisheries Act 2007 provide for appropriate stakeholder consultation.</P>

        <Quest>   the provisions relating to an agency under his aegis (details supplied) provides for it to engage in wind farming; if wind farming is among the agency&rsquo;s principal activities contrary to the principals of an organisation acting ultra vires; the way the agency derives the legal authority to engage in wind farming as a business activity; if the agency is expanding into areas beyond its original mandate such as those contained in volume two of the report of the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes; and if he will make a statement on the matter.   </Quest>

	<P>The Government&rsquo;s Energy Policy White Paper, &ldquo;Delivering a Sustainable Energy Future for <Col N="276"/>Ireland&rdquo;, which sets out the Government&rsquo;s energy policy framework 2007 &mdash; 2020, endorses the role and remit of Bord na M&oacute;na in supporting the achievement of the energy policy objectives through the development of renewable energy, waste to energy, energy research and development as well as power generation projects.  The Government has also in that context approved Bord na M&oacute;na&rsquo;s corporate strategic direction in diversifying progressively from its core peat business.</P>
        <P>The Turf Development Acts 1946 to 1998 and the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 provide the legislative basis upon which Bord na M&oacute;na derives its mandate to engage in the activities in question.</P>
        <P>Section 5 of the Turf Development Act 1990 provides that Bord Na M&oacute;na may, inside or outside the State, engage in all such commercial activities, whether in relation to the production or marketing of turf or otherwise, as in the opinion of Bord Na M&oacute;na arise out of and can advantageously be conducted in conjunction with any of its functions.</P>
        <P>In addition section 8 of the Turf Development Act 1990, which amends section 20 of the Turf Development Act 1946, provides that Bord Na M&oacute;na may, in the performance and exercise of its functions, develop commercially or otherwise any bog vested in the Bord Na M&oacute;na which is, has become or becomes incapable of commercial exploitation for the production of turf or turf products.</P>

        <Quest>   if his attention has been drawn to the fact that studies conducted by his Department, the Commission for Energy Regulation and EirGrid show that open cycle gas turbines are expected to generate electricity at best, only 2% of the time; if it is possible to direct the Commission for Energy Regulation to refuse licenses for OCGT&rsquo;s in areas with poor transmission grid resources; if so, will he do so unless it absolutely necessary to grant those licenses; and if he will make a statement on the matter.   </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>There are three main types of conventional or fossil fuel generation plant installed on electricity systems worldwide, including Ireland&rsquo;s electricity system.  These are baseload generating plant, flexible/mid-merit generating plant and peaking generating plant.  The Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT) plants are in essence peaking generating plants. </P>
        <P>Peaking generating plants are, in general, relatively costly to operate when they are producing electricity, but are the cheapest form of capacity to install as capital costs are comparatively low.  Critically, peaking plants have the distinct operating advantage of being capable of switching on or off very quickly.  Therefore they are utilised on electricity systems worldwide in order to cater for those periods when electricity demand might exceed the supply available from other generators.  The extent to which such plants generate electricity can be more than 2% depending on the type of plant.</P>
        <P>In scenarios where there is a potential supply/demand imbalance on a given day peaking capacity may only be needed to cover a few hours before switching off again.  Without the back up of peaking plants, systems would be vulnerable to a shortfall in electricity supply at certain periods which would require other forms of generating capacity to be called upon that are not as flexible as peaking plants, resulting in a higher cost to the energy consumer.</P><Col N="277"/>
        <P>In determining generation licence applications including peaking plants the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) requires that each plant has the necessary permits including planning permission and a connection offer to the grid from EirGrid before a licence is granted.</P>
        <P>Electricity generators include peaking plants are required to fund the cost of their connections to the gas and electricity transmission networks themselves so there is no extra cost to the consumer by virtue of where a generator decides to locate.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no legal obligation under either EU or International Energy Agency (IEA) rules for Ireland to hold strategic reserves of natural gas, i.e. reserves that could not be accessed under normal market conditions.  There is such a requirement in the case of oil.</P>
        <P>Analysis by the European Commission, undertaken as part of the Second EU Strategic Energy Review, shows that the cost of strategic gas storage is very high, at five times that of oil storage.  The potential for gas storage facilities is also dependent on geological conditions.  For example, depleted gas fields (such as is the case with the storage facility at Kinsale) or salt caverns are often good options for storage.  This also means that some countries do not have suitable geographical conditions for potentially storing gas.  For these reasons the European Commission has indicated it will not impose EU obligations regarding strategic gas stocks.</P>
        <P>The key objective of the proposed EU Regulation on Security of Gas Supply is to ensure that the market meets the gas supply needs of Member States through commercial gas storage.  The Commission is of the view that strategic storage can by definition only be a national measure and is not seen as adding to the security of gas supply on an EU level.</P>
        <P>The existing commercial gas storage facility at Kinsale has the capacity to hold 198 million cubic metres of natural gas.  Licensed by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER), the facility could potentially supply around 50% of residential and SME gas needs for up to 50 days in the event of a gas disruption.  I welcome the current market interest in developing further commercial gas storage, both in Ireland and in Northern Ireland.  Should these investment decisions come to fruition the amount of gas available could exceed demand on the island of Ireland.</P><Col N="280"/>
        <P>Responsibility for monitoring the security of Ireland&rsquo;s natural gas supply lies with the CER.  Under the EU Directive 2004/67 the CER is required to prepare an annual Gas Capacity Statement, which provides a 10-year rolling forecast of capacity, flows and customer demand on Ireland&rsquo;s natural gas system.  The most recent Capacity Statement, which was carried out on an All Island basis by the two Regulators and published last July, concluded that projected supplies of gas from indigenous sources, imports and storage, are sufficient to meet forecast demand in the medium term.</P>
        <P>The short- to medium-term prognosis for the security of Ireland&rsquo;s gas supplies is relatively secure in light of the projected relative stability of the UK gas market.  Increased global gas supplies combined with reduced global demand has led to the IEA projecting a more benign world outlook for the next few years. It is nevertheless prudent, in light of our dependence on gas imported from the UK, to seek to reduce our reliance on this source.  In this regard, the question of gas storage, including Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG), is being considered on an All Island basis.  My Department is working with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland, and energy Regulators North and South, to examine the medium to long term position with regard to security of gas supply on the Island of Ireland.</P>
        <P>There is currently interest in providing LNG gas storage on a commercial basis. Shannon LNG &mdash; a wholly owned subsidiary of the US firm Hess LNG &mdash; proposes to construct an LNG re-gasification terminal at a site located on the Shannon Estuary between Tarbert and Ballylongford in County Kerry.  The project, which could potentially provide up to 40% of Ireland&rsquo;s gas requirements, is being planned on a &ldquo;merchant&rdquo; basis.  This means that the project is a private sector development which would be run on a commercial basis.  LNG has the potential to improve connectivity to the global gas market, which would be a critical factor in the event of a major supply disruption.</P>
        <P>All these factors underline the strategic importance of diversifying our sources of gas supply &mdash; not least indigenous production &mdash; including the importance of bringing the Corrib Gas field into production.  At full production this field is estimated to meet 60% of our annual demand for gas for circa five years.</P>

	<P>The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) sets out 90 actions that Government is either already taking or will take in the period to 2020 to achieve the national energy efficiency targets of 20% across the economy and 33% in the public sector.  The savings identified in the Action Plan represent approximately &euro;1.6 billion in avoided energy costs for the economy in 2020.  There is a requirement in the Energy Services Directive that all Member States must submit their second Action Plan in 2011 and progress on all savings made will be reported in that context.</P>
        <P>My Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) are setting up a comprehensive monitoring and reporting system whereby all energy usage in the Public Sector will be accounted for and progress will be systematically recorded.  This system will be fully in place next year, which will enable tracking of progress on an annual basis.</P>

	<P>EirGrid applied for planning consent for the Meath Tyrone 400kV Interconnection Development Project in December 2009, under the Planning and Development Act 2000 as inserted by the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006.</P>
        <P>An Bord Plean&aacute;la convened an oral hearing on the matter on 10th May 2010.  On Wednesday 23rd June, it was drawn to EirGrid&rsquo;s and the inspector&rsquo;s attention that there was an error in the newspaper public notice and site notice relating to pylon height ranges for a section of the project.  It is the case that full details of the correct heights of the towers concerned were fully and accurately described in the Environmental Impact Statement and in the accompanying planning drawings, which were submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.</P><Col N="282"/>
        <P>EirGrid has undertaken a review of the circumstances which led to the error in the public notice.  I have been furnished with a copy of this review.  EirGrid informs me that the review is now publicly available on EirGrid&rsquo;s website:<i> www.eirgrid.com</i></P>
        <P>I have already made clear my strong disappointment that EirGrid had to withdraw its planning consent application for this strategically important project.  Following the completion of the review, I have asked EirGrid to ensure that all appropriate control procedures are reviewed and enhanced to safeguard against errors in any part of the planning consent application, both for this project and any future development projects. I have received the requisite assurances from EirGrid that all necessary actions have been taken in this regard.</P>

	<P>The Renewable Energy Feed in Tariff (REFIT) scheme was introduced in 2006 encompassing electricity from onshore wind, small hydro, biomass combustion and landfill gas. I have subsequently announced the expansion of the scheme to cover electricity from offshore wind, wave and tidal energy, biomass CHP and Anaerobic Digestion.  The costs of REFIT are covered through the Public Service Obligation Levy which applies to all electricity customers.</P>
        <P>Companies who are interested in developing geothermal sources for generating renewable electricity have signalled the need for a REFIT tariff for electricity from geothermal sources to underpin future project viability.  My Department, together with Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, are currently assessing the technical and economic feasibility of deep geothermal generation in an Irish context and any possible decision on supporting new technologies can only be considered when such information is available.</P>
        <P>The Geothermal Energy Development Bill currently being drafted by my Department will provide for the licensing of companies to explore for and develop deep geothermal energy resources.</P>
        <P>The prospects for deep geothermal electricity in Ireland are being investigated by several companies.  The introduction of the overall licensing framework is designed to support the development of geothermal potential.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>

        <QRef>[35979/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="EamonRyanGP"><TitleTxt>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Ryan</NameTxt>
	<P>The provision of broadband services is in the first instance a matter for private sector service providers operating in Ireland&rsquo;s fully liberalised telecommunications market.  Broadband services are provided by private service providers over various platforms including DSL (i.e. over telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, fibre and satellite.</P>
        <P>Details of broadband services available in each county, including in County Kerry, can be found on ComReg&rsquo;s website at<i> www.callcosts.ie</i>.</P>
        <P>In cases of market failure the Government will intervene, where it is appropriate and possible to do so.  The National Broadband Scheme (NBS) represents such an intervention.</P>
        <P>In December 2008, my Department entered into a contract with &ldquo;3&rdquo;, a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the NBS.  The company is required to provide services, using a mix of technologies, to all fixed residences and businesses that are located within the NBS Coverage Area and which seek a service.</P>
        <P>Under the NBS contract, all Electoral Divisions (EDs) in the NBS Coverage Area are required to have broadband connectivity by the end of this month. I am happy to report that 3 are in line to meet that obligation.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The table details the EDs in County Kerry that are included in the NBS.  Coverage is now available in all of these areas.</P>
        <P>It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.  I am aware that there continues to be a small percentage of premises throughout the country that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight, etc.).</P>
        <P>The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.  Using this funding, which will be augmented by an Exchequer contribution, I intend to formally launch a Rural Broadband Scheme before the end of this year.  This scheme will aim to provide a basic broadband service to individual un-served rural premises outside of the NBS areas.</P>
        <P>Information in relation to acceptance of applications and the process of qualification under the scheme will be made available in due course when the scheme is launched.</P>

	<P>The objects of our national public services broadcasters, RT&Eacute; and TG4, are set out in the Broadcasting Act 2009. In pursuit of those objects RT&Eacute; and TG4 are charged, <i>inter alia</i>, with ensuring that programmes reflect the varied elements, which make up the culture of the people of Ireland and facilitate or assist contemporary cultural expression.  Radio and television services, additional to those provided for by the national public services broadcasters aforementioned, are matters for the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) an independent statutory body.  Matters in relation to Irish music content on commercial radio are the subject of contractual negotiations between the BAI and commercial radio operators.</P>
        <P>I understand that during the mid-1990s, the regulator attempted to introduce a policy whereby 30% of music played by commercial radio stations would be by Irish artists but was informed by the Commission that the policy would be in breach of EU regulations.</P>
        <P>While I am fully committed to promoting Irish music in our broadcasting services, consistent with EU and Irish regulatory structures, I do not propose to introduce measures of the type raised by the Deputy as they would be inconsistent with EU law.</P>

	<P>Most large buyers of Irish beef require that the cuts they purchase are from animals certified under an internationally <Col N="290"/>recognised Quality Assurance Scheme.  They also have individual specifications in terms of the type and range of cuts required and these may vary from week to week. The Bord Bia Quality Assurance Scheme is valuable as it provides a recognised and accessible Quality Assurance Scheme for producers and processors.  My Department has also provided funding for the initial years of the Scheme for on farm inspection costs, which would normally be borne by producer members of a Quality Assurance Scheme.  There is some evidence that product certified under the Scheme is attracting a premium, however, neither my Department nor Bord Bia has a role in setting prices or returns from sales. </P>

The provisions of this Regulation were extended, as transitional measures for the period from 1 January 2010 to 30 June 2011, under Council Regulation 1288/2009.  Under these regulations gillnetting, regardless of species being targeted, is prohibited in the area.   </P>
        <P>It should be noted that during discussions at the EU Fisheries Council in November 2009 representations were made by Ireland in respect of several amendments to these regulations. The Commission made clear that it would not support a gill net fishery in the protected area because it considered that this form of fishing could be used to target the stocks being protected.  When Ireland&rsquo;s concerns were not taken into account, it was not in a position to support the Regulation, which nevertheless was adopted.  Some progress was made in that a derogation to allow mechanised jigging and handlining for mackerel and pollack was secured.</P>
        <P>The EU Commission has now brought forward a new proposal to extend  transitional technical measures for the period to 1 January 2013.  The measures involve a roll over of the current measures for Area VIa.  Minister Connick is currently consulting industry representatives on the proposal and will be setting out the amendments being sought,  taking account of the industry concerns and scientific advice.</P>

	<P>Unfortunately, I am unable to provide the Deputy with all the specific information he has requested, as the Department does not collate statistics for claims awaiting processing on the basis of local authority boundaries.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that at this time my focus and that of my Department is on ensuring that redundancy payments are processed as quickly as possible.  </P>
        <P>I can advise the Deputy that the latest figures available to end September 2010 indicate that, on a national basis, the backlog of claims is decreasing, reducing from the highest level in November 2009 of 43,608 to a current level of 29,776. I would also point out that in the 9-month period up to the end of September 2010, the number of claims processed by my Department was 58,202, up 81 % compared to the corresponding period in 2009 (32,127), which also exceeds the total number of claims processed for the whole year (50,664).</P>
        <P>It may also be helpful to the Deputy to note that currently the weekly intake of new claims is an average of just over 1,200.  Overall, new claims received in the first nine months of 2010 amounted to 47,587, a fall off of just over 21 % over the corresponding 9 -month period in 2009 when 60,428 claims were lodged.</P>
        <P>The Redundancy Payments Section of my Department is currently processing rebate claims from employers in general dating from March 2010 so that the waiting time is currently between 6 and 7 months.  In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees in instances where employers are unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements, claims dating from March 2010 are currently being processed.  Of course in some instances, where the necessary supporting documentation for lump sum claims is not provided to my Department, or where queries arise, processing of claims can be further delayed until the required documentation is provided and/or outstanding queries are resolved.</P>
        <P>I acknowledge the Deputies&rsquo; concerns in relation to processing times overall given the difficulties which delays give rise to for employees and employers alike but would like to assure the Deputies that my Department continues to make every effort to reduce processing times.  Measures already taken in the Department to alleviate the pressures on the Payments area include:</P>

<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against existing outstanding tax liabilities which those employers owe to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Responsibility for the payment functions arising under the Redundancy and Insolvency payment schemes is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2011.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims. </P>

	<P>As I previously outlined in my replies to Question Number 1742 on 29 September 2010, Question Numbers 296 and 298 on 30 September 2010 and Question Number 312 on 6 October 2010, my officials are working with their colleagues in the Department of Finance, the Credit Review Office, Enterprise Ireland and Forf&aacute;s to address access to credit issues for viable SMEs, including the option of a loan guarantee scheme to assist the working capital requirements of SMEs. </P>
        <P>Substantial progress has been made in identifying the critical elements involved in any further initiatives. However, in developing any further initiatives, it would be important that they would complement, rather than substitute, the main banks&rsquo; lending commitments and activities under the recapitalisation package and that they would represent value for money from the taxpayer&rsquo;s perspective.</P>
        <P>The provision of credit to our enterprise sector, especially SME&rsquo;s, should primarily come from a properly functioning banking sector and any additional initiative on the State&rsquo;s part should not relieve the banks from their obligations in this regard.</P>
        <P>As indicated already, we are looking at options to address known market failures regarding access to credit for SMEs including a loan guarantee scheme.   The report prepared by Forf&aacute;s is part of the ongoing deliberative process and I do not consider it appropriate to publish it.</P>

	<P>I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Finance, who has overall responsibility for the Government&rsquo;s public procurement procedures, the Government Construction Contracts Committee and the National Public Procurement Policy Unit (NPPPU), that this is a matter that would need to be taken up with the relevant Government Departments in respect of the various contracting authorities operating under their aegis. </P>
        <P>I should point out, moreover, that there is a standard clause in the Public Works Contracts requiring a contractor to comply with all applicable law regarding the pay and conditions of employment provisions prescribed therein [sub-clause 5.3 in main contracts PW-CFI and PW-CF5], including the obligation to ensure that workers&rsquo; wages are paid in accordance with the Payment of Wages Act 1991 and are never more than 1 month in arrears or unpaid. The contracting authority may seek information under sub-clause 5.3.3 for the purpose of ensuring that these obligations to persons engaged under work contracts have been properly discharged. This sub-clause also stipulates the remedies available to the contracting authority in the event of a failure by contractors to meet their responsibilities.</P>
        <P>I should point out that if an employer or a trade union is aware of specific instances where public contracts have been awarded to firms that are not paying their workers their legal entitlements, the matter can be investigated through NERA, the Labour Court under the Industrial Relations Acts or the relevant public authority that awarded the contract in the first instance.</P>

	<P>Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy, a Strategy and Action Plan for Irish Trade, Tourism and Investment to 2015, is an integrated strategy that is global in scope and covers both existing and new high growth potential markets.  It has set a number of ambitious targets to be achieved by 2015 i.e. to create 150,000 new jobs (manufacturing, tourism and traded services) with a similar number of indirect jobs; increase the value of exports by indigenous companies by 33%, increase overseas visitors to 8 million and secure an additional 780 inward investment projects through IDA Ireland. </P>
        <P>The overall objective of the strategy and action plan is to marshal and coordinate the resources of the State in a way that best supports Irish firms, of all sizes, in all parts of the country, including County Kerry, which are trying to trade and grow their business overseas.</P>
        <P>Implementation of the strategy and action plan will result in the sustained, concentrated and coordinated efforts of all of the key Government Departments and agencies, including our embassies and consulates abroad, which will in turn increase the effectiveness and efficiency of our support for Irish companies in overseas markets.</P>
        <P>The strategy presents an in-depth analysis of our recent performance across the three sectors and a suite of actions for building on existing strengths and driving trade relations in existing as well as new and emerging economies.</P>
        <P>These actions are aimed at: strengthening Ireland&rsquo;s international image and brand; strengthening in-country presence and support; developing and internationalising our enterprise base; developing Ireland as a hub for global high-technology enterprises and clusters; aligning visa policy with priorities in the strategy; support for SMEs; continuing to develop international trade agreements; joint actions and partnerships with other countries; effective engagement with the business community.</P>

	<P>Access to bank credit for businesses, particularly SMEs, has been central to Government Initiatives in addressing the crisis in the banking sector. Both the 2009 and 2010 Bank Recapitalisation arrangements provided specific commitments from the recapitalised banks to assist SMEs. </P>
        <P>Under the 2010 Bank Recapitalisation arrangement, AIB and Bank of Ireland have both committed to making available not less than &euro;3 billion each for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs in both 2010 and 2011. This must include funds for working capital for businesses.</P>
<?oasys _cl14.5- ?>
        <P>A recent ISME survey shows an improvement in access to bank credit for small businesses in the period from June to August.    58% of companies had accessed credit compared to 45% in the previous quarter.</P><Col N="302"/>
        <P>The Credit Review Office is closely monitoring AIB&rsquo;s and Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s lending policies and their lending commitments in 2010 and 2011. The Credit Review Office is also available to pursue cases where SMEs are refused credit from the recapitalised banks.</P>
        <P>I have ongoing contact with the main banks in relation to their lending to businesses and will, together with my colleague the Minister for Finance, and John Trethowan of the Credit Review Office, continue to ensure that they meet their lending commitments under the 2010 Recapitalisation package in terms of providing sufficient credit to the business sector.</P>
        <P>Finance is also made available to businesses, including SMEs, through the various supports and grant Schemes provided through the Enterprise Development Agencies operating under the aegis of my Department.  My officials are also working with their counterparts in the Department of Finance and the Credit Review Office on potential new credit initiatives for SMEs.</P>
        <P>In relation to payments by Government groups, Government Departments and Public Sector bodies are subject to the European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2002 (S.I. No. 388 of 2002). Under these Regulations, it is an implied term of every commercial transaction that where a purchaser does not pay for goods or services by the relevant payment date, the supplier shall be entitled to interest (&ldquo;late payment interest&rdquo;) on the amount outstanding. In the absence of any agreed payment date between the parties (i.e. specified in the contract), late payment interest falls due after 30 days has elapsed, provided the invoice is not subject to query. Interest applies until such time as payment is made by the purchaser. The current late payment interest rate from 1 July 2010 is 8% (that is based on the ECB rate of 1% plus the margin of 7%). The Regulations also provide for compensation for debt recovery costs.</P>
        <P>In accordance with the Government&rsquo;s decision of 19 May 2009, all Government Departments are now required to pay their business suppliers within 15 days of receipt of a valid invoice. Departments are also required to report quarterly to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation on their performance in meeting the target. To date, four sets of composite returns from Government Departments have been published by my Department. This arrangement applies on an administrative basis.</P>
        <P>The ongoing publication of composite details by my Department provides clarity on the performance of individual Departments in meeting the terms of the Government decision. While there is some variation between the performance of individual Departments and fluctuations across the different quarters, overall performance has been positive, with the value of payments made by central Government Departments within 15 days accountings for approximately 97% of the overall value of payments made. This initiative is helping to ease cash flow difficulties for SMEs.  I believe there is scope to shorten public sector payment periods in areas beyond the central Government Departments.</P>

        <P>Responsibility for the payment functions arising under the Redundancy and Insolvency payment schemes is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2011.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 535 and 536 together.</P>
        <P>The Report of the Innovation Task Force (ITF) provides a road map for positioning Ireland as an international innovation development hub. The report contains many new ideas, as well as calling for a reinforcement and better alignment of existing efforts and programmes. In May the Taoiseach asked me to chair the High Level Implementation Committee, comprising distinguished private sector members along with Secretaries General of key Government Departments, to oversee implementation of the ITF Report.</P>
        <P>I have chaired two meetings of the Implementation Committee to date. Our inaugural meeting on 1 June enabled the Committee to ascertain those issues where it could move immediately to implementation, where it needed, in the first instance, to constitute and deploy expert working groups as specified by the ITF and where close engagement with agencies and other Government Departments to progress implementation was necessary. An immediate development following from this meeting was my appointment of an Intellectual Property Implementation Group charged with developing and realising the intellectual property (IP) related recommendations of the ITF Report and a detailed IP review conducted by Forf&aacute;s for my Department.  The development of a clear IP Protocol will help Ireland maximise the return on public investment and support the commercialisation of Irish research and development.</P>
        <P>At our second meeting on 20 July, I briefed Committee members on the significant progress that had been made in implementing key recommendations in the ITF report, namely:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The &euro;500 million Innovation Fund-Ireland, which had been announced by the Taoiseach on 12 July, will target the development of a vibrant venture capital community in Ireland through attracting top international venture capitalists.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />With the Taoiseach, I had launched Cycle 5 of PRTLI on 16 July, a &euro;296m investment supporting third level research and leveraging &euro;63m private investment.</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />The very positive outcome of my discussions with the Minister for Finance with regard to identifying and securing provision for a number of ITF recommendations in the Capital Envelopes to 2016.  These provisions, which were subsequently published, will enable my Department and its agencies to support innovative companies, grow high performance start up companies, provide more venture capital and develop a portfolio of sector specific Angel Funds and increase Enterprise Ireland supports for commercialisation. They will also enable the retention of a strategic mass of world class researchers who act as a pull factor for foreign direct investment (FDI) in Ireland.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Secretaries Generals of Government Departments and Chief Executives of agencies provided detailed updates on the implementation of recommendations for which their organisations has lead responsibility. In the light of these detailed reports, the Committee agreed nineteen priority recommendations for implementation.</P>
        <P>The Committee will next meet on 21 October when its focus will be on reviewing progress on initiatives commenced and considering how to progress priority areas where significant action has yet to be set in train.</P>

	<P>I am informed by IDA Ireland that IDA&rsquo;s units in Ballyshannon, and Donegal Town together with land holdings in the County are currently being transferred to the ownership of Donegal County Council.  This transfer is part of IDA&rsquo;s rationalization programme, which was approved in 2009.  A list of the various units involved is set out in the tabular statement.  The transfer of these properties to the County Council was consented to by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.  The Minister&rsquo;s consent is required under legislation, when IDA is disposing of assets and the assets can subsequently be used for non industrial purposes. </P>
        <P>I am informed by IDA that the Agency does not own any other buildings in County Donegal, but that it does hold a number of Marketing Leases on Privately owned buildings.</P>
        <P>IDA has undertaken to provide the names of the companies occupying the properties involved within the next week and I will forward these to the Deputy  .</P>

	<P>The Equality for Women Measure (EWM) is a positive action <Col N="311"/>measure to promote equality of opportunity for women, supported by the European Social Fund.  The total amount of funding identified for the Measure over the period 2008-2014 is about &euro;11.5 million, of which half is being contributed by the ESF.  </P>
        <P>Following the initial application phase in 2008, 36 not-for-profit groups received funding of &euro;30,000 each in 2009 for projects which help disadvantaged women to prepare for employment or mainstream training and education.  A second phase of funding was made available in early 2010 to 34 of these groups, while two entrepreneurship initiatives have been allocated funding of &euro;190,000 over a number of phases, bringing total commitments to end-June 2010 to almost &euro;2.3 million.</P>
        <P>A new call for funding proposals was made earlier this year, broadening the scope of the Measure to include additional entrepreneurship initiatives and the advancement of women who are in employment.  Following the appraisal of 190 applications, completed by Pobal on behalf of my Department, 43 projects have recently received funding offers of up to &euro;50,000 each. This funding, totalling &euro;1.903 million per annum, may be renewed for one or more years, subject to projects realising their targets and to the availability of resources in the context of the grave public financial situation. Any new funding initiatives on women and decision-making would also fall to be considered in the context of the public financial situation at the appropriate time. </P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs</askee>
        <Quest> the supports he will offer towards the development of an Irish language centre in west Clare; if he will give approval for a linguistic study in County Clare in order to re-establish a Gaeltacht in the county; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>The Linguistic Study of the Use of Irish in the Gaeltacht, which was published in 2007, sets out a proposed sociolinguistic profile and assessment criteria by which Gaeltacht status might be established. These include the percentage of the population that are daily speakers of Irish, Irish-speaking networks, language planning and policies in the community and youth services.</P>
        <P>Recommendations from the Linguistic Study on granting Gaeltacht status based on linguistic criteria have been incorporated into the draft 20-year Strategy for Irish. Also included in the draft Strategy is a provision for the establishment of regional centres for Irish language promotion and activities.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that the draft Strategy has been under consideration by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Tourism, Culture, Sport, Community Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs, which provided a report in the matter in July last, including a range of recommendations. The Committee&rsquo;s recommendations are currently being assessed by the relevant Government Departments and I hope to be in a position to bring the final draft of the Strategy back to Government for approval in the coming period.</P>

	<P>I wish to inform the Deputy that the information included in the reply to the Questions of 26 January 2010 referred to regarding the funding available under Axes 3 and 4 of the Rural Development Programme 2007-13 (RDP) has not changed.   The main objectives of the Programme are to improve the quality of life in rural areas and facilitate the diversification of the rural economy, and the individual measures under the Programme, including indicative allocations, are as follows:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Diversification into non-agricultural activities for farm families &mdash;  &euro;16.66m;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Support for business creation and development &mdash; &euro;48.26m;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Encouragement of tourism activities &mdash; &euro;45.4m;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Basic services for the economy and rural population &mdash; &euro;49.61m;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Village renewal and development &mdash; &euro;54.2m;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Conservation and upgrading of the rural heritage &mdash; &euro;51.7m;</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Training and information on adapted and new skills &mdash; &euro;29.45m; and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />Implementing co-operation projects  &mdash; &euro;10.7m.  </P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">I am pleased with the progress to date under the RDP, which continues to facilitate access to significant financial resources for rural communities since it started in 2009. This has resulted in the proliferation of innovative and sustainable development projects all over the country, which are providing invaluable support to rural communities in these difficult times, and there is no question of funds being diverted away from the RDP.</P>
        <P>The RDP currently has registered project activity of &euro;72 million, with almost &euro;30 million at an advanced stage of development. Expenditure to date amounts to almost &euro;47 million, which includes funding for a diverse range of projects from support for micro-enterprise in rural areas to the building and maintenance of community infrastructure, and the provision of training in a variety of disciplines for rural dwellers.  I am confident that the activity funded under the RDP to date is contributing to the creation of the right conditions for the generation of sustainable, long-term job opportunities in rural areas.   My Department and I will be working closely with Minister Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe and his Department in the coming months to promote increased co-operation between Local Action Groups and County Enterprise Boards in order to ensure that we maximise the impact of all of the funding available and fully support enterprise and job creation in rural areas.</P>
        <P>I can assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to work with rural communities through their Local Action Groups to explore all possible funding opportunities under the RDP.</P>

	<P>As indicated previously in reply to Questions in this House, the 20-year Strategy for Irish was published in draft form by my predecessor to facilitate a further round of public consultation on the proposals contained in it by the relevant Oireachtas Joint Committee.  The Joint Committee held meetings with relevant interests, including one meeting in the Gaeltacht, and subsequently agreed a submission with a range of recommendations.   I received the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations on 28 July 2010 and these have been under examination by my Department in consultation with other relevant Departments.  I anticipate that these consultations will be completed shortly and that a final draft of the Strategy can be brought to the Cabinet Committee on Irish, and subsequently to Government, in the near future.  </P>
        <P>The question of the resources required by specific public bodies to fulfil their role in the delivery of the Strategy will fall to be considered as part of the annual budget and estimates process for each relevant year.  The Strategy spans a 20-year period and will require a range of integrated actions across a number of policy areas, Departments and other public bodies.  At this stage, the primary emphasis is on ensuring that we will be able to achieve measurable results with existing resources, both financial and institutional.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatCarey"><TitleTxt>Minister for Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>Firstly, may I draw the attention of the Deputy to the fact that the figures set out in the document referred to by him relate solely to the capital allocations for my Department and do not take account of the significant amounts allocated to its currently-funded programmes. </P>
        <P>While the recently published Capital Review does propose a significant reduction in my Department&rsquo;s capital allocation from &euro;105m in 2010 to &euro;86m for each of the years 2011, 2012 and 2013, my understanding is that all of these figures will be subject to ongoing review. In addition, proposed allocations post-2013 will also be informed by a mid-term review. Furthermore, all of the figures are indicative at this time and the 2011 allocations will not be decided until the Estimates process is completed within the framework of the forthcoming Budget.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy is aware, in the current economic circumstances we are faced with difficult decisions. The Government has considered a number of measures to maintain a prudent fiscal outturn, not only for 2010 but also to provide the basis for a sustainable approach to the current financial situation.  Across Government, our approach has been to do this in as balanced a way as possible.</P>
        <P>Within this context, my primary concern is to make every effort to ensure that the daily front-line services provided with funding from my Department are protected, especially those focused on the needs of the most socially deprived communities. In the prevalent financial circumstances, objectives will have to be pursued with less resources than previously. However, we will continue to strive to achieve good outcomes and value for money notwithstanding these constraints.    Notwithstanding these challenges, the Government remains very committed to supporting the Gaeltacht and the Irish language and considers that the 20-year Strategy for Irish will provide an appropriate framework to advance these objectives.  The restructuring of &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta as &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeilge and the broadening of its linguistic remit will be considered in this context, taking account of the recommendations of the Oireachtas Committee on Tourism, Culture, Sport, Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs. In this regard, I hope to be in a position to present a final draft Strategy to Government in the near future, following its consideration by the Cabinet Committee on Irish.</P>
        <P>I would like to restate once again that the Government is very cognisant of the urgency of the situation with regard to the Irish language in the Gaeltacht and it is intended to fully implement this Strategy over the next 20 years in co-operation with Gaeltacht communities <Col N="324"/>and their representatives.  In this context, I would like to say that I am very aware of the positive contribution made by the comharchumainn to the development of the Gaeltacht over many years, a contribution which indeed has been recognised by way of considerable State support.</P>

	<P>The Ministerial Air Transport Service is provided by the Air Corps to facilitate members of the Government in fulfilling their official engagements at home and abroad. The Service is primarily provided by the Gulfstream IV and the Learjet 45 aircraft, which were specifically acquired for that purpose.    The Learjet 45 has the capacity to carry 7 passengers and is mainly tasked with short and medium haul missions to the UK and Europe. The Gulfstream IV has the capacity to carry 14 passengers and can be tasked with long haul missions to destinations such as the United States, Africa and the Middle East, as well as to European destinations.</P>

	<P>The Government decided on 1st July 2003 that the former Magee Barracks in Kildare Town would be among the State lands released to Kildare County Council for inclusion in the Sustaining Progress Affordable Housing Initiative.  The Department had been involved in the process of transferring ownership to Kildare County Council and a final Contract of Sale was sent to the Solicitors for Kildare County Council in 2009.  However, the local authority contacted the Department to state that it no longer wished to take possession of the property.     As a result of this, the Department arranged for security fencing to be erected to prevent the occurrence of anti-social behaviour.  Security fencing has been erected and additional fencing will be installed in the next few weeks to ensure the security of the site.   It is not envisaged that any development will occur on this site for the foreseeable future.  However, the Department is open to negotiate the sale of the property in its entirety with any bona fide purchaser subject to reasonable offers being made. </P>

	<P>A strategy for the replacement of Naval Service Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs) commenced in 2007 and following a two-stage tender competition a preferred bidder, Babcock Marine, was selected last year.  During my visit to the Naval Base at Haulbowline last July, I announced that approval had been granted to proceed to contract placement.    A contract has now been placed with Babcock Marine and that the first new vessel is scheduled for delivery in early 2014.  The second vessel will follow one year later.  The contract value is of the order of &euro;100m.</P>
        <P>The acquisition of these modern new vessels, combined with a continuous process of refurbishment and repair, will ensure that the operational capability of the Naval Service is maintained at a satisfactory level.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The entire Dublin based staff of the Department will shortly relocate to Newbridge, Co. Kildare under the decentralisation programme. I would like to assure the Deputy that I am satisfied that the structure and staffing levels in the Department are appropriate and that I remain committed to ensuring that the delivery of services by the Defence Organisation is as efficient and effective as possible.</P>

        <Quest> the numbers commissioned from the ranks in 2007, 2008, 2009 and to date in 2010 respectively; the respective units involved; if any unit exists from which commissioning from the ranks is prohibited; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>I am advised by the Military authorities that an internal C<i>ommissioning From the Ranks</i> competition was held in June 2007.  Twenty four personnel were subsequently selected from the ranks of Junior and Senior NCO&rsquo;s and, following successful completion of training in the Cadet School, were commissioned as officers of the Permanent Defence Force in June 2008.  A breakdown of the personnel commissioned, according to unit, is provided in the tabular statement overleaf.     All personnel who met the criteria for this competition were eligible to apply.  No unit exists within the Defence Forces from which commissioning from the ranks is prohibited. </P>
        <P>The competition in 2007 captured a lot of personnel who would be eligible and suitable for commissioning from the ranks.  The process was to be reviewed following this competition with a view to determining how the process would be operated thereafter.  However, as the Deputy will recall, the moratorium was introduced in 2009 and this impacted on overall recruitment. While there were no specific <i>Commissioning From the Ranks</i>   competitions held in 2008, 2009 or to date in 2010, 13 applicants with military service were successful in the 2008 cadetship competition and a further 18 applicants with military service were successful in the 2009 cadetship competition. In addition, a further two members of the Defence Forces were commissioned as officers in 2008 from Direct Entry competitions as Engineer Officers.  As such, while there has not been a specific competition for commissioning from the ranks in the past few years, enlisted personnel have been successful in the open Cadet competitions.</P>
        <P>One of my main priorities as Minister for Defence is to provide opportunities for enlisted personnel to advance into the Officer Corps.  This policy forms part of the Defence Force <Col N="328"/>Modernisation Agenda and is a commitment in the Programme for Government.  In the context of future officer recruitment on the basis of an agreed structure for the Defence Forces, I would intend to return to this issue, in due course.</P>
