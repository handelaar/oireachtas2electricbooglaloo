      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>We all know our country has serious economic difficulties, but before I ask my question of the Taoiseach, I am sure the House will join me in expressing the condolences and sympathy of everybody here on the unspeakable grief inflicted on two communities in Ballycotton and Newcastle West.  These are tragedies in respect of which words are not adequate.</P>
        <P>We have been told by the Taoiseach and members of his Government on more than one occasion that the bank bailout, for which the taxpayer has paid, was the cheapest, most effective and best.  We were told time and again that no outside help was needed and that our country could manage its way out of our difficulties.  We had the spectre of not one but two Cabinet Ministers telling us that discussions and talks about technicalities and conditions at European level were fiction.  The Taoiseach knew nothing about it and no Minister knew anything about it; the line was that if it was going on they had not heard about it.</P>
        <P>This morning I heard the Minister for Finance say that where assistance might be forthcoming from Europe it is important that those involved in that assistance should be given the full facts.  This House was never given the full facts nor were the people.  Now we are told it is all about structural deficiencies in the banking system despite the fact that time and again the Government claimed everything was now fine.  We heard about green shoots, coming out of the tunnel, being on the way up and on the way back, and that what was good for Fianna F&aacute;il was good for the country, but we now know the truth.  The white flag has been raised and the towel has been thrown in.  Like the prowler waves off the west coast&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Deputy have a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;they are coming in on Thursday.  They are not coming in here to say: &ldquo;Well done Brians.  Well done lads.  Keep at it.  You&rsquo;re doing a great job.&rdquo;  They are coming here effectively to dictate the terms of a bailout to the Government.  I wish to ask the Taoiseach one straight question.  Does he believe that it is now possible for this country to move on without the assistance of a European bailout?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I join the Deputy in the sympathies expressed to the bereaved families in yesterday&rsquo;s appalling tragedies in Cork and Limerick.  Our sympathies go to the families.</P><Col N="252"/>
        <P>Unfortunately as I was saying yesterday day in and day out there is an attempt to have politics as usual from Deputy Kenny in regard to finding some means&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach should tell the people the truth.</P>

	<P>Deputy McEntee&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;of suggesting there is less than full transparency regarding these matters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ShaneMcEntee"><NameTxt>Deputy Shane McEntee</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach deceived us.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We cannot have a proper discussion on Leaders&rsquo; Questions if the Deputy is just going to carry on like that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>It is hard to listen to this.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Let us just listen to the situation and deal with the matter properly.  The Deputies opposite should try to behave with some degree of seriousness.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Behaviour is a moot point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Regarding the statement yesterday, I want to make it very clear that there has been no dictation to anybody.  What we are involved in here is working with colleagues in respect of currency problems and euro issue problems that are affecting Ireland and other countries, and particularly affecting Ireland at the moment.  Regarding what was said yesterday evening, there is full support from European colleagues in respect of all the policy initiatives the Government has taken to address these issues; that needs to be said.  We now want to concentrate on&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>The truth.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in a focused way over coming days sitting down to see in what way assistance can be provided to ensure that these issues are dealt with properly and appropriately in present circumstances.  There has been no question of the Government &mdash; as was being stated all over the weekend &mdash; being in a negotiation for a bailout.  Those sorts of pejorative terms do not assist either.  Very simply we are working with colleagues in respect of issues that are arising in the euro area and are affecting Ireland.  We want to work with them to see in what way we can address those issues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>So they can bail us out.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the situation we are facing.  If we are not prepared to sit down and deal with those issues and work with them in analysing the structural issues arising and dealing with them we will not be in a position to solve the problem.  The important point about moving on is building on the policy initiatives we have already taken.  On banking, it relates to the guarantee, the capitalisation and the segregation of assets, all of which are supported by the euro area group.  On our fiscal policy and how we can proceed in the context of our four-year plan and the budget, it is about sitting down with them in coming days and dealing with the issues as they arise.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach did not answer the straight question I asked him.  Does he believe it is possible for this country to move forward without assistance now from a European bailout?  He did not answer that question but went off on tangents again about discussions on the economy and all the rest of it.  The point is that the banking policy of the Government and particularly of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has been a catastrophic failure.  The Taoiseach did not tell the people the truth when the Government introduced the banking guarantee here in the first place because it covered every conceivable loss with its blanket guarantee.  The Taoiseach has always told us that he accepts responsibility for his actions in politics.  Does he accept that his banking policy has been a catastrophic failure?  These people from the IMF, the European Commission and the European Central Bank are not coming here on Thursday&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>For a bit of a break.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">&mdash;&mdash;to say: &ldquo;Hello, keep at it.&rdquo;  We know that when moneys such as these become available from the fund, they come with a specific set of policy conditions, a memorandum of understanding, a generally accepted 5% annual interest rate, a 3% administration fee on top of that and strict conditions.  That is what they are coming here to talk about and to dictate to the Government next Thursday.  These discussions will probably continue until the Taoiseach decides to publish the four-year fiscal plan, and the money that will be on offer will be made available whenever he decides to trigger it.</P>
        <P>I asked the Taoiseach if he accepted that the country can manage into the future without this money from Europe, but he did not answer my question.  As I said previously, there is something the Taoiseach can still do.  There is still time to buy credibility and belief in our country.  The people are exasperated and frustrated beyond belief that there is neither clarity nor structure or plan for what the Government is doing.  Two Ministers were on national television in the last few days saying this report was a work of fiction and fantasy.  However, we know the truth, that they are about to arrive in Dublin Airport on Thursday to have real discussions about the facts.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy, there is limited time for Leaders&rsquo; Questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>There is limited time for the country too.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy must ask a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>The country has limited time now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There is still time to involve the people of Ireland in this momentous decision.  The Taoiseach has no mandate to negotiate with the IMF, the European Commission and the ECB in this regard.  He is doing it over the people&rsquo;s heads because he says his way is the only way.  It is not, and it is now proven to be catastrophically wrong.  The Taoiseach can go to the country and let the people elect a Government with a clear majority and a clear plan and strategy to restore hope and confidence.  It will be imbued with the courage and freshness of a Government that wishes to rebuild our country, give our people a future of opportunities and get them away from these waves of disillusionment.  Is the Taoiseach prepared to do that in the interest of our democracy?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been asked by Deputy Kenny to indicate the outcome of discussions which are yet to take place, which I cannot do.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="254"/>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>Given that they were not going to take place.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Discussions will take place as outlined in the statement.  It speaks about engaging in a short and focused consultation with the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF in order to determine the best way to provide any necessary support to address market risks, especially as regards the banking sector, in the context of the four-year budgetary plan and the forthcoming budget.  That is what was agreed last night and those discussions will begin tomorrow.  When those discussions have been concluded people will have had an opportunity to examine and discuss all the issues.  It is important that everybody understands the implications of any proposals and that they are thought through.  That is the Government&rsquo;s position.  The Government will not formally be involved in engaging in a facility or making a decision of that type without that preparatory work being done, so we can consider whether in fact this is an issue that can be resolved in that way.  However, we must work through these issues and that is precisely what we are doing.</P>
        <P>With regard to the Deputy&rsquo;s second point regarding the question of credibility, there is no credibility&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>In you or your Government, that is correct.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;in suggesting that our essential national interests will be served by the uncertainty of elections, subsequent negotiations following the outcome of elections and the fact that there is not a basic agreement between the parties that wish to take control in this country&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>That is not true.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>It is fiction on a Monday and faction on a Thursday.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Can we have ci&uacute;nas for Deputy Gilmore?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I join Deputy Kenny and the Taoiseach in extending my sympathy and that of the Labour Party to the families of the people who suffered the tragedies in Ballycotton and Newcastle West and to the local communities in those areas.</P>
        <P>The Taoiseach heard from me on 30 September 2008, when I told him that giving the blanket guarantee to the banks was handing over the deeds of the country to the banks.  Now we know the truth of it.  The deeds are being called in.  It is time for the Taoiseach to stop the pretence.  All weekend we heard nothing but pretence from the Government and its Ministers.  It was pretence that nothing was happening.  The Minister for Justice and Law Reform said it was fiction.  Another Minister said nothing was happening, while another said that if anything was happening, he did not know about it.  However, it was quite clear that the Government was already engaged in discussions with European institutions in respect of some type of bailout, assistance or whatever term the Taoiseach chooses to apply to it now.</P>
        <P>We are getting more of the pretence today.  We are being told it is not the State that is involved but the banks, even though the banks and the State are virtually one and the same thing as a result of the guarantee.  We are told it is not Ireland that is the issue but the eurozone and that everybody is trying to save it.  All of that is pretence.  We know the officers of the European Commission and the ECB are here and that the officials from the IMF are on their way.  They are not coming to do their Christmas shopping, but to have discussions with the Government, as the Taoiseach acknowledged in his reply.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Deputy ask a question?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I will.  As the Taoiseach put it, they are discussions about the best way to provide support and assistance.  It is now no longer about what they are here for but about the best way to achieve it.</P>
        <P>I have some questions about the process which is clearly under way and was under way even when Ministers were denying it.  What is on the agenda for the discussions with the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF?  Who will conduct those discussions?  Will they be conducted at official level or ministerial level?  If they are conducted at official level, what Departments will be involved?  The Taoiseach said he wished to work his way through this process.  Will he just go with the flow of it or does the Government have an objective?  He said he cannot predict the outcome and I accept that.  He cannot predict the outcome, but he can tell us the outcome the Government intends to secure from this process.  What is its objective in this process and what outcome does it wish to achieve for this country?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I will reply to the issues the Deputy raised <i>seriatim</i>.  The first was the issue of the bank guarantee.  I do not wish to go over that again other than to refer everyone&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Sure, you do not.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No.  I refer everybody to the report of the Governor of the Central Bank.  It is a dispassionate appraisal of the situation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>He condemned the blanket guarantee.</P>

	<P>Now I am interrupted when I make a point.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Burton, can we hear the Taoiseach without interruption?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>He did not.  He made it very clear that an extensive guarantee was required.  He also makes it clear that had I accepted the Deputy&rsquo;s advice on that day in September 2008 and not put the guarantee in place, the banks would have closed in a matter of days and there would have been economic implosion in this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>They are not open now.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I refer Members to the report.  If the Deputy wishes to answer with a quibble relating to the issue of subordinated debt, as he has been trying to do ever since, that makes up 3.3% of the total guarantee involved.  That does not get the Deputy off the hook in terms of what his position was and is.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>Where was the Taoiseach in March 2008?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has derived much political advantage out of the suggestion that it was possible to save our economic and banking systems in the absence of that guarantee.  I do not seek to be involved in an argument every day of the week about this.   I refer to the deliberations of the report of Professor Honohan, the Governor of the Central Bank, in regard to that matter.  It is clear that the argument is very much in favour of the Government, almost to the point that it is beyond dispute.  Yet, because there is plenty of political currency in this country in continuing to go on with the proposal, the Opposition continue to throw it out there because it gets it plenty of popular support.  The fact of the matter is that, whether we like it or not, the guarantee was necessary.  The euro group, in its statement last night, confirmed that the policies that we have taken in an effort to provide the necessary stability is supported by all in the euro group, not by what Deputy Gilmore has to say but by what this Government has had to do.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is clear.  The statement reads, &ldquo;We welcome the measures taken today by Ireland to deal with issues in its banking sector via guarantees, recapitalisation and asset segregation and these measures have helped to support the Irish banking sector at a time of great dislocation.  However, market conditions have not normalised and pressures remain, giving rise to concerns that further reforms&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I will leave that argument there because it is not germane to the questions asked.  It was a prefatory remark put in by Deputy Gilmore, which he often includes, and I wanted to clear that up.  It is supported by the euro group, as distinct from his position.</P>

      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>They would say that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am explaining the situation.  The report is there if the Deputy wants to read it.  In regard to the matters before us today, the people who will be involved from Ireland&rsquo;s point of view tomorrow at an official level will be the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and the Financial Regulator.</P>

	<P>What about the NTMA?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said, those are the people involved.  The NTMA will also attend, if required.  Officials are coming over tomorrow and have been very clear.  There has been constructive engagement with them at all times throughout all the processes on the issues that affected Ireland and the euro area since this crisis began.  That will continue and we will provide all the information needed because it is important that everyone, in terms of analysing the situation and coming up with solutions to the problem, is armed with all the facts.  We will make sure that is the case.  If there are any queries or questions from any of the statutory bodies they will be dealt with.</P>

	<P>What about the Ministers last week?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I said on Monday, there was an ECOFIN meeting last night and there will be discussions following that today which will start tomorrow.  That will go on until such time as they will be able to bring forward proposals over the coming days.  I am not going to put a timeframe on that but they are urgent and focused and will be intensive.  Again, I cannot give an outcome as to the timeframe but it is an urgent issue with which we are dealing.</P>
        <P>In the meantime, from the point of the view of the public I want to make clear that while the technical discussions take place there is no issue regarding their position with the banks.  The banks are fully supported by the European Central Bank.  All our deposits are guaranteed.  There is no problem whatsoever while the discussions are ongoing and people need to know that as a matter of fact.  People need to be reassured on that front, as a practical and pragmatic matter.</P>
        <P>The objective is as set out in the statement.  We are seeking to ensure that we provide the necessary support to address market risk, especially with regard to the banking sector, in the context of the four year budgetary plan and the upcoming budget.  Most countries in the developed world have had to provide bank guarantees and interventions in order to ensure that the financial system was stabilised.  The initiatives we took have been supported by the European Union and approved by it.  In some cases its prior or subsequent approval was required.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Many people went ahead with bank guarantees in the aftermath of what we had to do.  It is important that people understand that the idea that any suggestion of bad faith in the Government is not true.  I was told this last Friday; when I was told I was negotiating for a bailout I <Col N="258"/>said we certainly are not, and we have made no such application.  Other Ministers confirmed that throughout the weekend.</P>

	<P>All of them referred to the fact that discussions were taking place at official level on the euro area issues generally and in preparation for the meetings which are now taking place on Tuesday and Wednesday.  That is the normal function of officials in the engagement which takes place between us and EU institutions and other member states.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The issue for us today arises out of the meeting at which were very ably represented by the Minister for Finance yesterday.  As we have obligations under the euro currency regime we share our sovereignty with these countries.  It is in every country's interest that there be stability in the euro area and that we deal with the market dislocation which has taken place and the need to ensure that banks get access to the markets for the forms which they need in order to continue with the business of banking in this country.  That is important and is what we are trying to address.</P>
        <P>However, that is not to say, as suggested by Deputy Kenny, that the banking policies were catastrophic, far from it.  Without those banking policies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>&mdash;&mdash;we would have had the implosion of this country, in economic terms, in September 2008.  Those are the facts.  The fact is that there is support for the guarantee system because it has been replicated in other countries.

      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">There will be plenty of time for the Taoiseach and me to argue about who was right and wrong in respect of our judgments on the bank guarantee which tied the banks to the State and which has resulted in the State being dragged into the quagmire.  We will come back to that.  We are now in a situation where European institutions and the IMF are knocking on the door; they are on their way.  The Taoiseach is continuing, with the <Col N="259"/>greatest of respect, to treat the Irish people as though they do not understand this . They do understand it and they understand its significance.</P>
        <P>I am trying to establish the Government&rsquo;s position.  I read the statement, I know from where they are coming and I can picture the kind of discussions which are likely to take place.  There is no point pretending this is some kind of an exercise being done by a few PhD students who have come here just tried to establish some information.  This is serious.  I do not want the kind of general exposition which the Taoiseach has just given us.  I want to know the Government&rsquo;s position with regard to the intended outcome of these discussions.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">11 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Is it the case that the provision of additional money for the bank is to be discussed?  If that is the case, were we not told in September that we had received the final figure in respect of support for the banks?  Is it now the case that the final figure is no longer the final figure?  Can the Taoiseach give us some indication as to the extent of the level of assistance which will be required for the banks?  I ask that question because I am aware that figures are already in circulation in the media about the possible extent of the support which the banks require.</P>
   
        <P>Does the Taoiseach expect that conditions will be discussed with the IMF and the European institutions which will apply to the State?  Will the Government and its successors have to be committed to such conditions in respect of public policy and budgetary matters in return for whatever assistance is being provided for the banks?</P>
        <P>Can the Taoiseach tell the House what is the Government&rsquo;s objective?  What is the Taoiseach&rsquo;s intended outcome from those discussions?  What are his bottom lines in respect of those discussions and, in particular, in respect of conditions that might be attached to the State?</P>
        <P>It is bad enough that for the last week we have had an entire pretence from the Government that this was not happening at all, there were going to be no discussions, there was no assistance, nobody was talking to anybody and nobody knew anything about the IMF, the EU or the ECB.  It was all fiction according to the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern.  We have had enough of that now.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>If the Deputy thinks it is in the essential national interest of this country for me, as head of Government, to indicate what our negotiating position is before negotiations have even begun or before we have agreed to enter into them &mdash; pending these discussions that have to take place on a whole range of technical issues including regulation, structure and others &mdash; then he is not very clever.</P>

	<P>The Taoiseach without interruption, please.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy has just agreed that it is not possible for me to give a predication of the outcome of these discussions which have not begun.  If I may, I wish to answer the Deputy&rsquo;s other question on the Government&rsquo;s objective.  As outlined in that statement, the objective is simply to ensure, as quickly as possible, that we have a banking system that can access funds on the open market and that those markets are providing funds to the banking system not only in Ireland but to the euro area generally at prices which are reasonable, affordable and ensure that they can be engines for future recovery on the basis of moneys and interest rates at which those moneys will be provided.  That is clearly the overall macro-economic objective of this Government concerning these matters.  This issue is affecting the eurozone across Europe, for us particularly but for others as well.</P>
        <P>We will sit down with those colleagues in a constructive and open manner to ensure that the analysis is correct and we get an outcome that will ensure that the banking system functions in this country.  It is true, as the Deputy said earlier, that we had a bank guarantee.  He made the point as if it was something that was not correct.  Yes, we did have a guarantee for the reasons I have given &mdash; to avoid an implosion of this economy in September 2008.  The fact of the matter is that other countries have had to do that also.  We are not unique in that respect.</P>

	<P>They are not in the mess we are.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>We have segregated the assets in a transparent manner.  When asked about it in an interview this morning, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said that discussions have taken place in the last couple of days regarding some of these technical issues.  There is a growing acceptance of the validity of the analysis that was done by the Financial Regulator in respect of those assessments.  The stress tests undertaken by the Financial Regulator in respect of the banks in this country were perhaps even more rigorous than what was prescribed concerning European banking generally under the EU exercise.  All of that is accepted and understood by those with whom we are engaged.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>We will know about that next week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Instead of people deciding that these issues are not being properly addressed, they should realise that they are being properly addressed.  I have outlined the importance of the discussions taking place in an urgent and focused manner.  We will conduct that analysis in an open and constructive way.  Our people are available to discuss that with those who will come over from the ECB, the IMF and elsewhere.  Whatever is in the essential interests of this country to do to bring about stability, growth and recovery, and ensure that the banking system will function openly as soon as possible on the market, would be the objective of any Government.  In doing all of that we will seek to protect our essential national interests and to ensure that the outcome is such that the country&rsquo;s sovereignty and sovereign debt is not unduly imposed upon with a burden it cannot bear.  That is what we will do and we will do so because that is the important task facing this Government.</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>As previously stated in the House, my Department has supported the international financial services industry in Ireland since the establishment of the IFSC in 1987, by providing a forum for the exchange of views and the co-ordination of effort through the mechanism of the IFSC clearing house group, supported by working groups in the areas of banking and treasury, funds, insurance, pensions and asset management.</P>
        <P>Since its establishment in 1993, the clearing house group has been chaired by the Secretary General of my Department and its membership includes representatives of industry associations and prominent figures from the international financial services industry.  There are also representatives from my Department, the Department of Finance, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, the Central Bank, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the Revenue Commissioners and the Stock Exchange.</P>
        <P>The IFSC clearing house group identifies and considers issues of major concern to the long-term development of the international financial services industry in Ireland.  These issues include the strategic development of new business areas and opportunities, and the progress of relevant legislation.  From time to time, it identifies the need for responsibility to be assigned for overseeing and reporting to the Government on any appropriate initiatives in this area.  The clearing house group does not deal with issues relating to individual enterprises or institutions, and does not supervise or oversee the industry; that is a matter for the Central Bank in the exercise of its independent functions.</P>
        <P>The spread of membership of the IFSC clearing house group and the IFSC working groups enables discussion to take place in an open way, which reflects a wide range of experience and expertise, so that opportunities to develop sustainable business and employment in the various sectors of the international financial services industry can be achieved.  It is estimated that the industry employs 25,000 directly in international financial services firms, while contributing &euro;642 million in tax revenue to the Exchequer in 2009.  This figure for tax revenue refers only <Col N="262"/>to companies who were within the original IFSC tax regime; it does not cover international financial services companies that commenced trading after 2002.</P>
        <P>In the context of its role in identifying development opportunities, the clearing house group has responded to the report of the high level group on green enterprise, which was published in November 2009 and identified the significant contribution that the development of the green economy can make to restoring Ireland&rsquo;s economy.</P>
        <P>The green initiative concept relates to the repositioning of the IFSC to take advantage of growth in the global green economy and green finance sectors.  It envisages a cluster of financial and support services for the domestic and international green-tech, renewable energy and carbon sectors.  The report stated that potential exists to develop a green IFSC cluster and brand incorporating green investment vehicles, the administration of funds managed under green principles, and carbon trading and associated professional services.</P>
        <P>A feasibility study into the launching of a green finance initiative within the IFSC was undertaken by a steering group operating under the aegis of the IFSC banking and treasury group.  That study, which received support from various industry associations, professional firms, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, was presented to the IFSC clearing house group last May.  Since then, considerable work has taken place regarding the development of more specific proposals to advance the initiative.  It is hoped to finalise the proposals for consideration by Government in the near future.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask the Taoiseach specifically about the proposal for a green IFSC, which was one of the recommendations of the high level action group on green energy.  That group reported one year ago.  The Taoiseach tells us the feasibility study for the IFSC steering group was submitted in May 2010.  It appears we have not heard anything further on it.  A report in one newspaper in September indicated proposals were expected to go before Cabinet in the coming weeks.  Have any proposals been put before the Government in respect of the green IFSC?  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Ryan, stated a project team would be established in 2010 to progress the proposal.  Has that team been assembled?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The memorandum has not yet been circulated.  It is under further consideration at the moment.  Various decisions must be taken by the Government on foot of the memorandum, which refer to various initiatives that await Government decisions.  Then we will be to explain precisely how we want to proceed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>There appears to be absolute lethargy on this proposal.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is no lethargy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>There is.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>There is none, quite the contrary.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>We have over 400,000 people out of work and a report from the high level action group was received one year ago.  The Taoiseach still cannot tell us what is being done in practice, other than that the report of the feasibility study submitted in May is still floating around being considered.  No decisions have been taken by the Government and no project team has been put in place.  The Minister, Deputy Ryan, and the Taoiseach referred to the potential for 80,000 jobs in this area when it was announced.  The Minister said 20,000 of those jobs could be created in the next five to ten years.  We are now one year into it and <Col N="263"/>not a single job has been created.  The project that was to be established this year in order to progress it has not been established and the Government is still considering it.  I do not get the sense there is urgency about developing this area, which has potential for jobs at a time of high employment.  It is another case of official body reports and feasibility studies on the reports, which generates more paperwork.  All we are getting is paperwork rather than action.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>Many jobs have been created in the green sector since the Government came into office.  In some cases this has been stop start.  There have been thousands of jobs in a range of areas.  I remind Deputy Gilmore that this concept is about developing an IFSC cluster and brand, incorporating green investment vehicles, the administration of funds managed under green principles and carbon trading and associated professional services.  Much advanced work has been done on this and the draft memorandum for Government will be brought forward.  Further consideration is required on a number of issues.  We are coming into budget time and some issues arise in this respect.  We will deal with this memorandum for Government in due course.  It has a priority and it is an area in which we can make some progress.  As Deputy Gilmore knows from his party&rsquo;s procedures, once the memo is given to the Government and it makes its decision then we can publicise the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>In May 2007, when the Taoiseach was Minister for Finance, he established the financial legislation advisory forum.  That was to consolidate and modernise legislation governing financial regulation.  The objective was to provide expert advice, support and drafting assistance in the preparation of a Bill that was to streamline the legal framework for financial services regulation.  The Bill was to be published within two years of the forum being established.  When I asked the Taoiseach about this on the last occasion, he said it would be dealt with after the NAMA legislation.  What is the status of the Bill now?  Will it be brought forward or will it be published and brought into the House?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is being dealt with directly by the Department of Finance.  A question to the Minister for Finance will give a precise update on it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach&rsquo;s predecessor spoke at the launch of the Building on Success document and referred to the establishment of the centre for financial services skills before mid-2007.  Does the Taoiseach have a report on the current status of the centre?  The 2008 report said it would not require capital funding and have the full support of financial and academic experts.  Is that the case?  What is the status of it at the moment?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am happy to provide information on that.  The concept of the centre arose during the consideration given to the level of world-class skills, education and training required to sustain and further develop the IFSC in this country.  The expert group on future skill needs was requested by the clearing house group to examine the needs of the entire international financial services industry and to put in place a strategy to ensure a continued and sustainable supply of skills to meet the needs of employers.  It is clear from the study of research undertaken that no one academic institution alone had the capacity to cater for the highly desired skills set identified as being in short supply.</P>
        <P Just="Left">A sub-group on skills was then mandated by the clearing house group to bring forward immediate action to address the findings and the sub-group developed the proposal, referred to as the Fenero initiative, including the key elements of what now forms the Finuas networks programme.  The model involved co-investment by the State and firms that have proven highly successful in the Skillnets training network programme since 1999 in a range of sectors and regions.  Skillnets Limited was appointed by the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment as managing agent for Finuas in late November 2008.  That project was launched <Col N="264"/>in early 2009 in order to provide support for training in the IFSC sector.  It operates on a matching funding model across four industry-led networks, with total public spending of &euro;2 million over the two-year period 2009 to 2010 generally covering 25% to 40% the cost of training.</P>
        <P>Investment in on-the-job training is a central plank of the development of a smart economy.  A skilled workforce underpins both maintaining current employment levels in the IFSC and attracting inward investment in new employment.   The Finuas project operates with the support of the majority funding of the industry and also enables greater training provision by firms, benefiting from the long-term employability of workers and Ireland&rsquo;s competitive position.  The problem runs on very low overheads and has provided high-quality training and excellent value for money.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>Some concern is being expressed that the Financial Regulator does not have sufficient staff to regulate and oversee the IFSC.  Has the Taoiseach received a report on this?  Is he happy the resources are being made available to the Financial Regulator so he can carry out his functions with regard to the IFSC?  Given that the world is moving rapidly and the financial services industry has such potential, does the Government see other opportunities for further development in the IFSC to continue its outstanding progress over the years as a global centre for financial services?  Does the Taoiseach have a view on the future growth prospects of the IFSC?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The IFSC has proved resilient in the face of the international financial crisis that has enveloped us over the past number of years.  It is a matter of regret and disappointment to us all that many governance issues arose in the retail banking sector.  A number of parties were sceptical and had reservations about the IFSC at the time of its initiation.  They suggested that its regulatory regime would not be adequate.  It is of great regret to me to see the domestic banking system is where most of the problem has arisen in terms of governance and policy issues, as distinct from the IFSC companies themselves which have been very successful trading in an area of much financial sophistication and innovation.  To its credit, the reputation of the IFSC has been broadly maintained.  That speaks a lot about the professionalism of the people who work there and the skills they have.</P>
        <P>On how the IFSC itself is working, we have set out in the smart economy programme a range of measures which are needed to reinvigorate the industry, including reform of the legislative framework for financial services in this country.  The update on that can be provided by the Minister for Finance if a question is put to him.  Another measure is support for a targeted up-skilling programme for the industry.  There has been increased support for research, development and innovation activity.  Extending double taxation agreements has been an important feature.  There is a need for vigorous promotion of new opportunities in areas such as specialist leasing, pensions, technology development and sovereign wealth funds.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The IFSC itself has seen the need to market itself and to promote the benefits of locating in Dublin in respect of this area of activity.  In a collaborative venture with the major industry associations, the Institute of Bankers in Ireland and the Stock Exchange have agreed to market the IFSC externally.  As chairman, Mr. John Bruton has a role in promoting Ireland as a location for international financial services.  He is participating in outbound marketing and promotional efforts including trips to the Gulf, London, New York and Paris.  He will work with the IDA and IFSC firms to attract inward investment and support business development opportunities.  That is a valuable resource both for the IDA and individual firms in supporting their efforts to bring investment and employment to this country.</P><Col N="265"/>
        <P>The primary responsibility for marketing this country as a location for international financial services resides with IDA Ireland.  The agency has a dedicated international financial services team with marketing executives based both at home and in overseas offices.  We are extremely satisfied with their commitment to and delivery of their mandate in respect of the international financial services sector.  My ministerial colleague, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe, and I have had the pleasure of meeting many financial services investors accompanied by the IDA.  We have always been impressed by their knowledge of the business and the dedication and professionalism they have demonstrated.  The marketing of this sector for the country is an area of high achievement.  There is a long list of international financial services firms operating in the IFSC and, significantly, in regional locations throughout the country.  That is a welcome development.  This country is now home to more than 200 companies employing approximately 25,000 people.  The sector contains some of the leading names from the world of insurance and re-insurance, fund administration, aircraft leasing, banking, investment management and financial technology.</P>

	<P>Estimates of between 20,000 and 25,000 jobs were suggested as the potential for job creation in a green IFSC.  Does the Government have any particular measure on the real potential of a green IFSC in terms of job creation?</P>
        <P>It was indicated earlier this year that a feasibility study would be carried out and depending on its outcome a launch was signalled for the months of March or April.  Was a feasibility study carried out?  If so, what were the findings of such a study?  Will a launch take place that will give rise to the realisation of what is involved in this project?  Will the Taoiseach give an indication of whether a committee or other structure has been established to oversee the proposals on a green IFSC under the aegis of his Department or any other?  What, in practical terms, does he see as the potential yield in terms of inward investment from the putting in place of a green IFSC?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I outlined in my primary reply the areas referred to by the green enterprise group that examined the matter.  That has subsequently been dealt with by taking the idea forward to the prospect of an initiative being undertaken, identifying niche markets and what areas we could identify a competitive or competence advantage in terms of locating some of the financial services areas in the IFSC proper.  The group identified the potential to develop a green IFSC cluster and brand incorporating green investment vehicles, the administration of funds managed under green principles and carbon trading and associated professional services.  That work has been undertaken by the IFSC Banking and Treasury Group.  Much work has been undertaken as a result of that.  A memorandum for Government is at an advanced stage of preparation.  I hope that decisions could be taken in this area and that a launch will take place some time in 2011 but I do not wish to anticipate Government consideration.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been suggested that legislative changes and other provisions are required in order to facilitate this development.  However, the head of the Bank of Ireland corporate banking group who is also chair of the IFSC, Mr. Padraig Rushe, indicated that he could not disclose what was required or being considered for allegedly sensitive or commercial reasons.  Is legislation or other provisions being prepared for consideration and presentation in order to drive this project forward?  If the changes are to be published, when does the Taoiseach intend to disclose the detail of what is intended?  If, for instance, there is legislation, will the Taoiseach publish the heads of a Bill in order that we can have some idea of where the Government stands and what is intended?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>A memorandum for Government is at an advanced stage of preparation.  It sets out the background and rationale for this country getting involved in and providing an initiative in this area.  Clearly, if there are issues they will be considered presently by the <Col N="266"/>Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners in the context of the preparation of a finance Bill.  The normal avenues of discussion or consideration are being given to issues.  They are being thought through to see whether initiatives or provisions can be brought forward to assist this area consistent with the recommendations that are set out in reports which identified the potential for this to proceed.  It is normal practice that until consideration is finalised by Government in terms of the general policy areas concerned or any specific initiatives that require statutory provision such as, for example, the finance Bill, they would be provided for in the normal way at the time of publication of such legislation.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
        <P>Since the process was inaugurated in February 2007 by my predecessor, general and bilateral meetings have taken place with most of the participants.  I am very pleased with the progress to date and look forward to further meetings with the dialogue partners.  I met with the Church of Ireland archbishops in 2009 as part of the process.  That was my first specific encounter with the church-State dialogue since I became Taoiseach.  Last June, I met with the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland and we discussed the dialogue process.  Contact at official level has continued with various churches, faith communities and non-confessional organisations.  I look forward to meeting with other partners in the process in the future.</P>
        <P>The process of structured dialogue was envisaged from the outset as a flexible channel of consultation and communication on broad issues of mutual concern, which would supplement the normal bilateral and sectoral exchanges with the churches on specific policy issues by individual Departments.  I am satisfied that it will develop in the years to come to be a valuable means of addressing issues of change in society.</P>
        <P>I am confident that the opportunity to exchange perspectives and address issues of mutual concern in this way with key institutions of civil society will be of benefit to all the participants, given the importance of the faith dimension to the lives of so many of our citizens and the greater pluralism of religious affiliation and practice in Irish society.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The last time the Taoiseach answered questions on these matters, he spoke of his separate meetings with the survivors of child sexual abuse within the institutions and also with the representatives of the religious congregations.  That meeting was on 15 April and the Taoiseach gave a detailed response regarding the exchanges with both groups in terms of the additional monetary settlements being requested from the religious orders.  He indicated a figure of &euro;1.36 billion to be paid on a 50:50 basis between the State and the congregations.  He stated the congregations offered an additional &euro;348.5 million.  What is the position in respect of the additional offer?</P><Col N="267"/>
        <P Just="Left">The Taoiseach also stated that more detailed work with the congregations was necessary in respect of their property offers.  One was a monetary settlement and the other was for property.  Has the detailed work signalled in the Taoiseach&rsquo;s response been carried out?  How much of the value of the property will be passed on to the survivors?  Is the Taoiseach not concerned that the realisation of property values now is significantly reduced from what it would have been a short number of years ago?</P>
        <P>In the dialogue with the churches and congregations, has the issue of the Magdalene laundries been directly addressed?  Has the Taoiseach noted that the Irish Human Rights Commission, IHRC, has supported the call for a full and formal inquiry into the State&rsquo;s responsibility for human rights violations against girls and women who were confined in those places under the aegis of Roman Catholic and Protestant churches?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are broadening the questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Will the Taoiseach support the establishment of such an inquiry and indicate in the House his intention to raise this matter, or indeed if he has, with both church authorities?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No, there has not been any specific discussion in respect of that matter.  As I said regarding broader policy issues, normal sectoral exchanges go on between individual Departments and churches on various issues, but that is not an issue with which I have dealt.</P>
        <P>Regarding the broader issue, the Department of Education and Skills is the lead Department handling these matters.  It has been liaising with congregations and various State bodies to determine the potential use of various property offers to determine their acceptability to the State.  I understand that the Department will be reporting to Government in respect of this matter shortly.  Until we have that discussion, I am not in a position to say further where we are at.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>On the first matter, the Taoiseach indicated that he has not raised the issue of the girls and women who were confined within the so-called Magdalene laundries under the control of a number of religious bodies.  Will he undertake to the House to raise this matter, as it is of grave concern?  The survivors of the experience have been calling for a full public inquiry.  As I have indicated, the IHRC has voiced its support for the establishment of such an inquiry.  Will the Taoiseach indicate to the House what his personal views and intentions are in respect of this matter?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We are broadening the scope of the questions considerably.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach stated that further meetings with the religious congregations are expected in light of the additional moneys and properties to be made available to meet the compensation required for the victims.  How soon does he expect those meetings to be held?  Is there an urgency behind the proposal?  There should be, given the ageing profile of many of those who are survivors of institutional abuse at the hands of religious congregations.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>These sound like queries for a line Minister.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I am asking the Taoiseach.  His Department is directly involved in these engagements, as he is himself.  This is the context of my questions.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Does the Taoiseach plan to meet the hierarchy of the Church of Ireland regarding the victims of Bethany Home?  Has he noted the recent discovery of a significant number of previously <Col N="268"/>unknown graves of young children who went through Bethany Home?  The champion of their case, Mr. Derek Leinster, a victim and survivor of Bethany Home, is asking on behalf of that cohort of victims for a full inquiry and full compensation to be provided.  Will the Taoiseach accept that these victims are entitled to inclusion under the redress scheme that is already <i>in situ</i>?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>As I was saying in respect of the matter regarding the religious congregations, the Department of Education and Skills is the lead Department.  I understand it will report to Government on this matter shortly, so we will have to wait to see what proposals come from it as a result of the discussions.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy knows, 139 institutions were approved for the redress scheme, which was recognised from the outset as not being &ldquo;a panacea for every injustice committed on children&rdquo;.  The redress scheme was complemented by the establishment of an independent commission to inquire into child abuse, the National Counselling Service, the Origins family tracing service and the Education Finance Board.  Together with funding for support groups, these initiatives represented a comprehensive and compassionate response to the abuse suffered by so many victims while also allowing a comprehensive review of the causes, nature and extent of abuse.</P>
        <P>The issue of extending the scheme was considered previously, but it was decided not to include Bethany Home.  Following the publication of the Ryan report, there was a range of demands for the redress scheme to be extended to include specific institutions as well as specific categories of institution.  The Government considered those demands and, in its statement on 15 April last, indicated it did not propose to revise the arrangements.</P>
        <P>The general question of the church-State dialogue also relates to matters like the economic situation in the country.  All of these are issues for faith communities as well.  They can take the opportunity to put their views on these matters.  It is not simply a question of a narrow church-State engagement in the traditional sense, but of a broader review.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CaoimhglinOCaolain"><NameTxt>Deputy Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Taoiseach raise the issue of Bethany Home, please?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Government made a decision on this matter back in April.  We considered all of these issues and requests, but we were not in a position to extend the scheme.  That is the position the Government has had to take on those matters.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>The Oblate Fathers have posted a contribution of &euro;20 million online.  The problem appears to be that, while they have assets of &euro;81.9 million and liabilities and commitments of &euro;61.8 million, they are anxious that an independent trust be set up.  It seems this is being delayed for some inexplicable reason.  The residential institutions statutory funding is on the legislative agenda.  However, the heads have yet to be approved by Government and it is not expected to be published until 2011 at the earliest. </P>
        <P>I met the Oblate Fathers recently and they are very anxious that this trust should be established.  Pending the trust being set up, and I know this is a complex initiative, could there be an internal arrangement whereby their contribution, which is now posted, could be used?  In summary, they would like to see the independent trust set up.  It is on the agenda, but the Bill will not be published before 2011.  What can be done in the meantime?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I know what the Deputies had to say about that matter.  The Department of Education and Skills will shortly bring a memorandum to Government as a result of it listening to all the issues.  I recall that particular order made this offer.  The question of establishing a <Col N="269"/>fund on a statutory basis will probably be incorporated into the memorandum for the Government&rsquo;s consideration.  We await the memo from the Department. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The trust fund that was to be established for the survivors of the institutions was to be &euro;110 million, I understand.  That has not yet been established and in reply to a parliamentary question from Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn yesterday, the T&aacute;naiste informed him that about &euro;20 million had been contributed towards that fund to date.  Will the Taoiseach say when it is likely the remainder will be contributed?</P>
        <P>On the wider issue of the structured dialogue between the State and the churches, in respect of the requirement on teachers to teach religion, has any consideration been given to a recent case where a teacher was awarded compensation for losing the offer of a permanent post after she was unable to offer the Catholic certificate to the effect that she could teach religion?  It was compulsory in the teacher education colleges formerly that students should do religious education and qualify for this certificate.  I understand, however, the colleges have now made that optional and while an alternative course may be done, it does not result in the certificate to teach religion.  Given the largely denominational make-up particularly of primary schools, is this an issue the Government intends to discuss with the churches since not all students in the teacher education colleges are now taking religion as a subject, quite apart from the decision of the Equality Authority to award compensation to a teacher who failed to get a job because she did not have the certificate?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not aware of the specific issues raised by the Deputy.  However, I believe this would be part of the normal structured dialogue that takes place in the bilateral exchanges with the churches on specific policy areas by individual Departments.  I expect the Department of Education and Skills would have to look into the legal implications of that to see what precedent was being set and the extent to which it might have to review current arrangements and decide the level of adaptation that might need to be addressed as a result. </P>
        <P>I suggest a specific question from the Deputy to the Minister for Education and Skills might elicit a more accurate reply than I am able to give him.  No item on any agenda is excluded, but I expect this matter would be dealt with in the normal way in the dialogue with churches on issues that arise regarding possible changes of regulations that might be required as a result of legal cases going through the courts.  I am not <i>au fait</i> with the circumstances, but this is the context in which that would take place, that is, the more flexible channel of communication as envisaged regarding broad  issues of mutual concern, and would be supplementary to the normal contacts.</P>
        <P>In relation to the issue of contributions, etc., in addition to the original sum of &euro;128 million under the 2002 indemnity agreement, the Deputy is right that further offers were made, the cash element of which was &euro;111 million that was to be provided within five years.</P>

        <Decision>Question declared carried.</Decision>
      </Vote><Col N="273"/>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Is it intended that as the discussions take place between officials from the Central Bank, the Office of the Financial Regulator and the Department of Finance that the Opposition parties will be kept briefed on what is happening in the discussions or will they continue for a few days to a conclusion after which and we will be informed about what decisions have been arrived at?  I hope they will not be works of fiction, as the Minister for Justice and Law Reform has alluded to.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I have already indicated on the record that the Minister did not say anything that was not in line with what the situation was at the time and I do not see any purpose in continuing with that line of approach.  It was an issue to be addressed and if the Deputy wants to have it dealt with seriously, we should take it seriously.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">12 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>The meetings will begin tomorrow and we should allow those meetings to progress and, until such time as we see what emerges from that, I do not believe we should breach the confidentiality of those discussions other than to let people know in general terms what is involved.  It is important to reiterate that people throughout the country need to know that this is a structural issue that is being spoken about.  There is no issue whatsoever regarding individual issues with banks and people&rsquo;s own accounts, etc.  Those deposits are guaranteed and the ECB stands fully behind those banks.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>To follow up, Opposition parties will not be involved in these discussions.  I know the IMF is party to the discussions and as it is based in America, its representatives would understand the importance of Ireland&rsquo;s 12.5% corporation tax rate.  That may not be shared by some European views.  I expect that this will be defended by officials from the Department of Finance on the instruction of Government in the discussions.  Were the rate to change for some reason or other, it would be seen as a massive breach of trust between this country and those responsible for foreign direct investment here.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not on the Order of Business but it is important to repeat to the Deputy what the Minister for Finance said this morning.  These are treaty matters which have been dealt with and negotiated.  The competence issues are very clear with regard to taxation policy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EndaKenny"><NameTxt>Deputy Enda Kenny</NameTxt>
	<P>We have been told that discussions are taking place between officials who do not have a mandate to negotiate.  As I stated earlier on Leaders&rsquo; Questions, the Taoiseach and the Government does not have a mandate to negotiate an entirely new scenario with this tripartite discussion group which will effectively put the next generation in hock.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is not Question Time but I will make the point again to the Deputy.  There are technical discussions taking place&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>We live in a democracy.  Officials do not negotiate policy.</P>

	<P>Deputy Barrett&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>They are not entitled to negotiate policy on the 12.5% tax rate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Barrett, please.  This is the Order of Business and not Question Time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>It is up to this House and the Government to negotiate the issues.</P>

	<P>I just made the point&mdash;&mdash;</P>

	<P>We should remember that we belong to this Parliament.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Barrett, order will break down if this continues.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I made the point&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>It has nothing to do with officials.  This is a policy issue.  People&rsquo;s futures are at stake.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Barrett, the Taoiseach is in possession.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn"><NameTxt>Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn</NameTxt>
	<P>That is the problem.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>This is the Order of Business.  I made the point clearly that there are technical discussions continuing that will take days&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>What technical discussions?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am entitled to speak without interruption.  That is the position.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach is playing with words.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>If and when negotiations take place&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>These are policy issues</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Barrett.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;this Government will decide on those issues.  The Deputy can be assured of that.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>Unfortunately, we cannot be assured of anything.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett</NameTxt>
	<P>These are policy issues and not technical.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy should listen.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I have two related questions for the Taoiseach.  The first relates to the reply from the Taoiseach to my supplementary question on Leaders&rsquo; Questions.  In the course of that the Taoiseach said he did not wish to reveal the Government&rsquo;s negotiating position with the EU institutions and the IMF.  When did the Government decide on its negotiating position in respect of those discussions?</P>
        <P>The Minister for Finance this morning suggested that the four-year plan might not now be published until the end of the month.  I understood from the Taoiseach&rsquo;s comments yesterday that it would be published next week.  Will he clarify whether it will be next week or the end of the month?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I answered a question asked by the Deputy about our negotiating position.  I said I would not tell him if I had one.  It is not very clever to suggest what it would be in public.  That is what I said.  We should get away from word games and treat the substance of the issue.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not engaging in word games.  I am just trying to get to the point.  It is very hard to get it from the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="275"/>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>It is not.  What is very hard to get from the Deputy is his position on anything without revising it.  It is the same as he has revised his political career every five or ten years.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been absolutely clear.  I asked questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy asked a question on Leaders&rsquo; Questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I told him I would not divulge a negotiating position to anybody if we were in negotiations.  We have not opened any negotiations, as I have told the Deputy.  If the Deputy was prepared to read the statement from the European group, which he is not&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I have read it.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>He will not refer to it because it is supportive of the Government position and everything the Government has been seeking to do in order to achieve stability, in stark contrast to anything the Deputy has had to say in this House regarding the achievement of stability.  He only tries to see if he can get a few votes from it.  That is his game.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>That does not become the Taoiseach.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>Deputy Brendan Howlin</NameTxt>
	<P>It is a ruse.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>We will not have this argument on the Order of Business.  It is not appropriate.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to unduly provoke the Taoiseach but will he answer the second question I asked concerning the four-year plan?  Will it be next week or the end of the month?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I answered that question yesterday.  I said it would be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>The record will show&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>I am only asking a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am making the point.  The Deputy seems to want to outline what I said as well as what the questions were.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>It is only a question.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I am answering the Deputy&rsquo;s question. He suggested that I said yesterday that the plan would come at the beginning of next week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach said it would be next week.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>No, I did not say that.  The Deputy can check the record of the House as he asked the questions himself.  I know from memory what I said.  I indicated that when it was finalised and approved by the Government, it would be published.  It is a matter of priority for the Government.  The Deputy should check to see if that is what I said rather than what he suggested I said.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore"><NameTxt>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</NameTxt>
	<P>When will that be?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="276"/>

	<P Just="Left">What we need is a credible recovery plan, not an EU bailout, so will the Taoiseach accept that he has no mandate for his current negotiating position, the four year plan and the signalled cuts in the coming year?  Will he publish the four year plan, suspend the budget and go to the people so that we can have a Government mandated to address these problems?</P>

Under our Constitution, the mandate of the Government is determined by majority support in this House.

We will bring forward the budget and put it to the House, and I am confident it will command majority support.  That is the position.</P>

	<P>I am glad the T&aacute;naiste is present in the House.  The Student Support Bill first saw the light of day approximately two and half years ago and completed Second Stage.  Amendments have been brought forward for the Bill and were supposed to be with the Deputies in question on Monday this week.  Responses to the amendments are to be received by 19 November.  Will the T&aacute;naiste and the Minister for Education and Skills extend that closing date as the amendments are already three days late?</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrianCowen"><NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
	<P>I understand the debate will take place tomorrow week.  I am sure this is a matter for the Bills Office but if the amendments are being published a little later than expected, I assume Opposition Deputies will be accommodated with a couple of days to put in amendments if required.  I ask that the matter be dealt with by the Bills Office in an appropriate way consistent with the timeframe we have in mind.</P>

	<P>There is a very serious stand-off and disagreement between the Office of the Ombudsman and the Minister for Health and Children, which I believe was exacerbated by the Minister&rsquo;s comments in the House yesterday.  The basis of this concerns the fact the Government has not introduced the eligibility for health and personal social services Bill, which has been promised for a number of years.  It was on the B list at one stage and the heads were agreed but it is now back on the C list.</P>

        <P>I will inquire about a second Bill, with the permission of the Ceann Comhairle.  Ambulance services are currently not subject to HIQA inspection, as far as I know.  There is a situation in Dublin city where there are Dublin fire brigade ambulances and also HSE ambulances.

    <Title>Bank Guarantee Scheme: Motion</Title>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I move:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the terms of the draft scheme entitled Credit Institutions (Eligible Liabilities Guarantee) (Amendment) (No. 2) Scheme 2010, a copy of which draft scheme was laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 16 November 2010.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Yesterday&rsquo;s eurogroup statement on Ireland welcomed the measures taken to date by Ireland to deal with issues in its banking sector, including the bank guarantee, which the eurogroup affirms have helped to support the Irish banking sector at a time of great dislocation.  However, market conditions have not normalised and pressures remain.  These pressures have intensified in recent weeks as market sentiment toward Ireland has become more negative, reflecting concerns about possible implications for the private sector of the design of a permanent crisis resolution mechanism in the euro zone.  While these concerns were addressed by the joint statement of the Finance Ministers of France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK on 12 November last, market sentiment towards Ireland and the eurozone remains negative.</P>
        <P>The State guarantee for bank liabilities provided under the eligible liabilities guarantee, ELG, scheme, which the Government has put forward for approval by the Oireachtas today, continues to provide very significant support for the funding of the banking system.  Were the scheme not extended to the end of 2011, make no mistake, we would be faced tomorrow with difficulties in funding that would jeopardise the financial stability of the State.  We must extend the scheme and, in doing so, heed the advice of the Governor of the Central Bank, who strongly endorses the need to extend the scheme to safeguard the stability of the system and the overall economy &mdash; a position shared by the European Central Bank which has also endorsed the extension to the end of 2011 on financial stability grounds.</P><Col N="281"/>
        <P Just="Left">I refer to the motion to approve the draft statutory instrument entitled the Credit Institutions (Eligible Liabilities Guarantee) (Amendment) (No. 2) Scheme 2010.  The draft statutory instrument amends the bank guarantee scheme known as the eligible liabilities guarantee, ELG, scheme, introduced in December 2009.  Deputies will recall that the Minister of Finance was before the House in September with a similar statutory instrument that extended the ELG scheme from 29 September to 31 December 2010.</P>
        <P>Market conditions have not normalised for credit institutions in Ireland.  On the advice of the Governor of the Central Bank, the Government proposes to extend the issuance period under the ELG scheme beyond the current end date of 31 December 2010, and, on financial stability grounds, the statutory instrument before the House today would enable the issuance period to run to 31 December 2011.  As the House may be aware, the European Commission has already announced the approval of the scheme under State aid rules for six months, the maximum approval period allowed under the Commission&rsquo;s State aid rules.  The guarantee remains necessary because the Irish banking sector is facing ongoing funding challenges.  Recent evidence of heightened fragility in international financial markets has also led to more challenging funding conditions for banks in Ireland.</P>
        <P>The Governor recommended to the Minister that an extension of the guarantee for all liabilities is necessary in the context of ongoing investor caution, pending the normalisation of funding conditions for banks in Ireland and to allow for the transition to a more balanced funding profile as soon as market conditions permit.  This is an important support to the Irish banking system and complements the broad Government strategy to restore fully the banking system and maximise its contribution to overall economic recovery.  The Government is determined to rebuild consumer and investor confidence in our financial system, which has an important role to play in ensuring businesses, and notably small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, can invest for growth and our citizens can plan with confidence for the future.  As Deputies will be aware, the ELG scheme since December 2009 is a more focused scheme and no longer covers dated subordinated debt.  Since 30 September, the scheme also imposes significantly higher fees on participating institutions for the benefit of a State guarantee of their shorter-term liabilities, which I will outline later.</P>
        <P>The draft statutory instrument before the House proposes to amend the ELG scheme 2009.  Under section 6 of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008, the approval of both Houses is required for such an amendment.  The ELG scheme allows the credit institutions that join the scheme to accept all deposits and issue short-term and long-term debt on either a guaranteed or unguaranteed basis.  Eligible liabilities under the scheme are as follows: deposits, senior unsecured certificates of deposits, senior unsecured commercial paper, other senior unsecured bonds and notes and other forms of senior unsecured debt specified by the Minister and approved by the EU Commission.  The institutions that joined the scheme and are thus &ldquo;participating institutions&rdquo; under the ELG scheme are: Allied Irish Banks, AIB; Anglo Irish Bank; Bank of Ireland; the EBS; Irish Life &amp; Permanent plc; and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  Their relevant subsidiaries also joined and are listed fully on the Department of Finance&rsquo;s website.  Institutions may issue debt and take deposits guaranteed under the ELG scheme with a maturity of up to five years.  According to the latest data available to my Department, at the end of September 2010 bank liabilities covered under the ELG scheme stood in aggregate at &euro;147 billion.  ELG liabilities must be incurred within a limited issuance period that currently runs to 31 December 2010.  The main amendment made by the statutory instrument proposes to extend the ELG scheme such that it will now run to 31 December 2011, subject to continuing state aid approval from the European Commission.  This was similar to the mechanism used in the original ELG scheme, when it was introduced in December 2009.  Other consequential changes are made to the scheme by the statutory instrument.</P><Col N="282"/>
        <P>EU state aid approval was granted on 10 November 2010 for the extension of the issuance period to 30 June 2011 for all liabilities, including debt and deposits, and both short and long-term liabilities under the ELG scheme.  The EU Commission approval follows from the recent legal opinion from the European Central Bank, dated 2 November 2010, which endorsed the extension in national law to 31 December 2011 on financial stability grounds.  The extension is subject to continuing Commission approval and has been granted to 30 June 2011, the maximum period allowed at a time under EU state aid rules.  Further state aid approval would be required to extend the issuance period end date for another six months from 30 June to 31 December 2011 and the draft scheme would facilitate that further extension as well.</P>
        <P>Participating institutions must pay a significant fee to the Exchequer for the benefit of the guarantee.  The fee is in line with and in certain circumstances for shorter-term bank liabilities exceeds the fees applicable generally for guarantee schemes approved by the European Commission.  The original fees for the ELG scheme guarantee, when it was introduced in December 2009, were based on the pricing recommendations published by the European Central Bank in respect of guarantees of this nature and were consistent with the fees applicable for similar guarantees provided by other EU States in respect of their credit institutions.  However, from 1 July 2010 the fees that institutions are required to pay under the ELG scheme increased for guaranteed liabilities incurred from that date, in line with the pricing structure outlined in the European Commission&rsquo;s staff working document dealing with the application of State aid rules on Government guarantee schemes covering bank debt.</P>
        <P>The additional pricing in line with the Commission guidelines ranges between 20 and 40 basis points depending on the rating of the institution concerned.  The pricing is set out in the rules to the scheme at annex 7.  From 1 December 2010, an additional 70 basis points will apply to the guarantee under the scheme of short-term liabilities of less than three months, in addition to the 50 basis points that applied from the start of the scheme, and a further 20 to 40 basis points applies depending on the rating of the institution.  This brings the total payable for short-term liabilities to between 140 and 160 basis points.  The real effect of the changes to the pricing regime is that the average fee now paid by institutions under the ELG scheme is approximately ten times higher than the average fee paid by institutions under the original bank guarantee scheme when it was introduced in September 2008.  As at the end of October 2010, a total of &euro;1.3 billion, comprising &euro;760 million in respect of the CIFS scheme and &euro;573 million in respect of the ELG scheme, was collected from the institutions.  The fees collected surpassed the original minimum &euro;1 billion target for guarantee fees, when the CIFS guarantee scheme was introduced in September 2008.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The draft statutory instrument gives legal effect to the time extension to the scheme.  I will provide some further detail on the terms of the amending draft statutory instrument.  The ELG scheme guarantees specific issuances of debt or deposits of up to five years in duration incurred during the period set out in the scheme.  Item 1 includes a definition of &ldquo;financial support period order&rdquo;, an order made under section 6(3B) of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act 2008.  The order which the Minister for Finance will make in conjunction with this scheme sets out the issuance period.  This is the period within which guaranteed liabilities can be incurred and guaranteed under the ELG scheme.  As Commission approval was granted for the period 1 January 2011 to 30 June 2011, this will be the issuance period for the next phase of the ELG scheme.</P>
        <P>Item 2 amends paragraph 3.1 of the Schedule to the scheme, which sets out the period within which institutions may join the scheme.  The amendment seeks to update the application period by substituting 31 December 2011 for 31 December 2010 to reflect the time extension to the scheme.  Items 3 and 4 amend paragraph 5 of the Schedule to the scheme.  Paragraph 5 provides <Col N="283"/>that the Minister shall review the scheme and the rules at six-monthly intervals.  This amendment proposes that the Minister may review the scheme at shorter intervals than six months if so required by the European Commission in accordance with its state aid policies.  This would allow for a future exit strategy on a gradual basis for certain liabilities in line with prevailing market conditions, based on the advice of the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland.</P>
        <P>No. 5 proposes to substitute a new paragraph 11.1(c) in the Schedule to the scheme.  The new paragraph would replace the current scheme end date of 31 December 2010 with an extended scheme end date in national law up to 31 December 2011, subject to continuing EU state aid approval.  Such approval was obtained on 10 November last for the continuation of the issuance period up to 30 June 2011.  Any future extensions of the issuance period beyond 30 June 2011 will require EU state aid approval.  No. 6 amends paragraph 18 of the Schedule to the scheme, which sets out the maximum period the Minister will stand as guarantor of liabilities guaranteed under the scheme.  This amendment proposes to substitute a period of five years after the end of the period specified in the most recent financial support period order as the end date of the scheme instead of the current date of 31 December 2015.</P>
        <P>With regard to deposits in particular, all on-demand deposits over &euro;100,000 are guaranteed under the proposed amendments to the ELG scheme to 30 June 2011 in line with the approval of the Commission.  Furthermore, term deposits of over &euro;100,000 can be guaranteed for a fixed term of up to five years as long as the deposit is made before the 30 June 2011 and the institution is, or was, a participating institution under the scheme on the date of the deposit.  The ELG scheme provides that if a deposit of up to &euro;100,000 is covered under the European Communities deposit guarantee scheme, it is not also covered under the ELG scheme.  The ELG scheme covers the excess over &euro;100,000 or any deposit that does not qualify for protection under the 1995 deposit guarantee scheme.</P>
        <P>In summary, the extension of the ELG scheme to 31 December 2011, subject to EU state aid approval, will continue to support participating institutions in accessing funding in the short term and the longer term, and will provide security for depositors.  The scheme as extended complements the broad Government strategy to restore fully the banking system and maximise its contribution to overall economic recovery.  Market conditions remain turbulent at present.  The relevant State authorities will continue to monitor the funding situation of Irish banks and the requirement for the guarantee in the future to ensure the continued stability of the Irish banking system.</P>
        <P>The EU state aid rules provide that the guarantee can be extended for a maximum of six months on each occasion.  The authorities will therefore review the requirement for the continuation of the ELG scheme before 30 June 2011, in consultation with the European Commission and the ECB, and assess the requirement for an extension on the basis of the then prevailing market conditions and having full regard to financial stability matters generally.  This scheme will allow a further extension to 31 December 2011, and this mechanism is being adopted to provide maximum certainty for the markets in the future.</P>
        <P>I commend the scheme and the motion to the House.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrianHayes"><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Hayes</NameTxt>
	<P>It is quite extraordinary, on the day and week that is in it, that the Government is introducing this statutory instrument for the approval of the House.  The Irish people &mdash; and, I believe, a significant number of Deputies in the House &mdash; do not believe what the Government is telling us.  This statutory instrument, to which the Government hopes the House will give effect, brings the guarantee forward a whole year, from 1 January until 31 December 2011.  The idea that this must come before the House for approval now, in the middle of November, when we have another full month before the House rises, is absurd, particularly in view of the current economic and financial uncertainty and the uncertainty about the Government&rsquo;s position and about what is coming down the tracks in view of the information we received last night.  There is fundamentally an issue of political credibility.  The markets do not believe the Government, nor do the Irish people.  This House does not believe it.  Yet, <Col N="285"/>absurdly, the Minister of State is suggesting that this statutory instrument should be given a free pass in the House today while this uncertainty exists.  I suggest this is ridiculous.</P>
        <P>I regret that the Minister for Finance could not be here.  I understand where he is today and we all know the scale of the challenge he faced yesterday and today, but why could this not have waited another week or two weeks before the deadline of 31 December?  This is the wrong thing to do.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, in his opening remarks to the House this afternoon, stated, &ldquo;Yesterday&rsquo;s euro group statement on Ireland welcomed the measures taken to date by Ireland to deal with issues in its banking sector, including the bank guarantee, which the euro group affirms has helped to support the Irish banking sector at a time of great dislocation.&rdquo;  What else could it have said, given the extraordinary crisis the country now faces?  The suggestion that the European institutions and governments have supported the position of the Irish Government from the start of the crisis until now is fundamentally untrue.  I do not have to remind the Minister of the firm commitments that were given in this House when the guarantee was first proposed.  In answer to questions posed from this side of the House it was stated clearly that it was not an issue of solvency, that the banks were fundamentally sound, and that all that had to be accepted was the necessity to guarantee their position so that liquidity would return to the market and the position of the banks could be upheld.  In the course of that debate in 2008 the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said in reply to Deputy Noonan:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Several Deputies raised the question of solvency.  I have made it clear throughout discussions on this subject that the central issue confronting the Government last Monday evening was the liquidity of the Irish banks, not the question of solvency.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">However, we know that to be wholly untrue.  The House was misled by the Government from start to finish and it has no credibility in suggesting that this measure should now be passed by this House at this stage because the people have no faith in the position.  We know now that effectively the banks were broken and the suggestion that the Government did not know at the time is wholly inaccurate and untrue.  The stem of this problem, as accurately summed up in the past 48 hours, is that the debts and liabilities of the banks are effectively the State&rsquo;s debts and liabilities.  We are now joined at the hip, as it were, because of the fundamental guarantee the Government introduced in 2008.  We were told that once we got through the initial crisis, the alleged wall of cash would be provided to businesses and things would get back on track.  However, instead we have had inertia in the past two years and three months throughout the crisis.  As other countries have got on with the task of rebuilding their economies, we have been stagnant because of the poor decisions taken by the Government in that rushed period at the end of September 2008.</P>
        <P>It is now fundamentally a question of political and economic credibility.  Who is to be believed?  The credibility of the Government has been shot through.  At the time of the debate, the House was informed that the loss in Anglo Irish Bank would be a maximum of &euro;4.5 billion, but look at the price now.  Effectively one bank brought down our economy &mdash; the Fianna F&aacute;il bank, the bank that built Fianna F&aacute;il and the bank that was bankrolled by Fianna F&aacute;il.  Let us consider the exposure we now face through Anglo Irish Bank when were told at the time that it would be &euro;4.5 billion.  At the time the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, told us that this would be the cheapest bank rescue anywhere in the world.  We accept there is always a necessity for a guarantee, but the blanket guarantee proposed was utterly inappropriate in the circumstances.  When we proposed at the time that the exposure of the guarantee should be up to a maximum of &euro;10 billion the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, stated that he would be utterly surprised if the amount was as high as that.</P><Col N="286"/>
        <P>The Government has now come to the House to ask permission to continue with the scheme in place based on its record which is there for all to see.  What is frightening about this crisis is the way in which the people have been betrayed by the Government time and time again.  It is one thing to say that a Government is unpopular, has taken the wrong policy option or has been too long in office.  However, to deliberately mislead the public is an entirely separate argument.  Over the course of the weekend when the BBC, Reuters and others were telling us that discussions had started between officials of our Government, the ECB, the Commission and the IMF, a series of Ministers and Ministers of State told us that was a fantasy and a fiction, and did not happen.  There is a fundamental issue of belief and a sense of complete lack of credibility in the position because the Government has misled the House and the people as late as last weekend as to what needs to happen.</P>
        <P>This morning I heard the Minister speak about the four-year plan.  We were told initially that the plan would be available in the middle of November.  It is quite clear that the plan will not be produced next week despite what the Taoiseach said last week because the IMF now needs to see that plan and see the colour of the money within it.  Where is the bank resolution scheme?  One of the Government&rsquo;s debating points in the past year was that it would introduce a bank resolution scheme, as other countries have done, setting out exactly the terms upon which the Central Bank and regulator could get effectively into the banking system yet we have not even seen a proposal from Government to date.  Taking its own arguments, how are we to accept that when such a scheme has not been put in place?</P>
        <P>When other countries have dealt with this difficulty and have moved on, why are we still in the mire two years and three months later?  People want the answer to that fundamental question.  It is evidently the case that it is down to a series of mistaken decisions on Anglo Irish Bank, recapitalisation and other matters that the Government has taken in the past two years or so.</P>
        <P>The people want to write a new chapter and to move on from this.  They want to get to the bottom of the matter and want some hope that we can rebuild the economy from the ruins left by Fianna F&aacute;il.  The idea at this stage that we would give a blanket guarantee by way of resolution in this House would not be fitting to our parliamentary responsibilities and that is why we will not support it at this time.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joan Burton</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of the Government&rsquo;s motion before the House is in effect to extend the original bank guarantee scheme in a modified way until the end of December 2011.  That bank guarantee applied to six banking institutions, two of which, Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society, were beyond help.</P><Col N="287"/>
    
        <P>Two very big banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB, are important to the functioning of economic life in this country, particularly for small and medium sized businesses accessing credit.  There were two building societies, including Permanent TSB which also has an insurance company attached to it.  They all had a different set of difficulties.</P>
          <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">1 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society, INBS, were basically bust because their business model had come to an end.  They were developer niche banks.  INBS was a building society but the people who ran that institution developed it into a developer bank within a building society.  I do not understand how they could do that under the regulations.  I also do not understand how they could lend mainly to people in the London area of the United Kingdom and abroad.  However, Mr. Fingleton was close to the powers-that-be in Fianna F&aacute;il.  He even succeeded in having a special Act passed in the D&aacute;il relating to his building society.  That is the context.</P>
        <P>As people are doing their jobs, putting money in the bank and taking it out again they feel incredible pain, worry and uncertainty about their businesses, employment, mortgage and their children&rsquo;s mortgages.  Fianna F&aacute;il is telling us today that we are extending the bank guarantee in five year periods for at least another year and a quarter to the end of December 2011.  The European Union has agreed to that up to the end of June 2011, as it can only do so in six month tranches.  What is the amount guaranteed?  It is a staggering figure.  It was &euro;147 billion at the end of September.  The Minister did not enlighten us as to whether that amount has increased since then.  Judging by the very worrying news we have been hearing from different elements of the six institutions under the guarantee I would not be surprised if it had already increased significantly.  The Minister should tell the House at what amount the extended guarantee stood at the middle of November.  What is his expectation for the amounts under the guarantee to the end of December?</P>
        <P>This is important.  Many people talk about burning bondholders, talk with which I have never agreed, and defaulting.  However, the Government created a mechanism from the start of the guarantee and with the extended guarantee whereby, in effect, that became almost impossible.  The Government made the decision on the night of the guarantee to give a blanket guarantee, not the extensive guarantee Professor Honohan writes about in his report.  The blanket guarantee covered everything, regardless of whether it merited guarantee.  Every Member of the House agreed that ordinary depositors merited a guarantee.  I wrote to the Minister two or three weeks before the guarantee was put in place &mdash; the Minister has the letter &mdash; suggesting that the Government had to introduce a guarantee system for ordinary depositors.  At the time the guarantee for depositors only stood at &euro;25,000.  The Minister told me to take a hike, as was the Fianna F&aacute;il style.  The Government did nothing.  On 29 September there was total panic in the ranks.  The Government did not introduce a graduated and thought-out guarantee for different classes of assets, particularly ordinary depositors who should be protected, but a blanket guarantee.  That is the reason Mr. Regling, Mr. Watson and Professor Honohan in their reports have described Ireland&rsquo;s appalling situation with the guaranteed institutions as a home-made catastrophe.</P>
        <P>It is also the reason so many people in Europe are angry and less than impressed with Ireland.  Ireland bounced the other European countries into this form of guarantee by being the first mover.  I was at Kilkenomics last week in Kilkenny and one of the comedians there said we have two Brians and no brains running the country.  It was an interesting take.  The strategy has been a disaster and today we simply confirm that the Government is passing further guarantees for more than five years from the end of next year with regard to at least &euro;147 billion.</P><Col N="288"/>
        <P>It is important to get some of these institutions back to health.  However, if there was a proper bank resolution scheme, some of them would have been wound up.  I raised this with the Minister on numerous occasions both in the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service and in the House.  Initially, he did not even know what a bank resolution scheme was, then he decided to think about it and then did nothing.  Such a scheme allows one to wind up banks that are in default in an orderly and structured way.</P>
        <P>People in Europe talk about Ireland being a source of contagion for Portugal and, worst of all, for Greece.  The Taoiseach said this morning that this is now a eurozone problem, not an exclusively Irish one.  What is the contagion?  The contagion goes back to Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society because they set up this Ponzi pyramid scheme of banking in this country for developers.  The other banks got greedy.  It is famously said that somebody in AIB complained: &ldquo;Those guys in Anglo are eating our lunch, and that has to stop&rdquo;.  That has been AIB&rsquo;s downfall.  Bank of Ireland appears to have been more staid in going after that type of business.</P>
        <P>The fundamental question is how to unravel this.  We can only do so through serious reform of the banking system.  We must wind down institutions that are utterly defunct and destroyed.  We might have to seek people from abroad to take over some of the other institutions and lick them into some type of shape.  There must be fundamental bank reform but we cannot do that without a bank resolution mechanism.  That is not before us today.  What is before us today is a cheque for an initial figure of &euro;147 billion, which Fianna F&aacute;il is asking us to sign.</P>
        <P>The ECB became alarmed at the end of last week about the Central Bank.  Was it because some of the six institutions no longer have collateral to offer to the ECB?  The Central Bank, therefore, was committing itself under its powers to write cheques to some of those institutions.  Can the Minister confirm that?  I understand the amounts of those commitments by the Central Bank to be between &euro;20 billion and &euro;30 billion.  If the purpose of the discussions with the IMF, ECB and the European Commission is to sort that out, does that mean the claim and memorandum of understanding will initially be about that &euro;20 billion to &euro;30 billion?  That is now dead money because it has already gone into banks that had no collateral to offer the ECB.  It is no wonder that the ECB is extremely worried and concerned.  It must be, as all of us would be worried and concerned, because the integrity of the euro currency has been endangered to some extent by what is happening.  Worst still, the House is not being told exactly what is happening so Members can make an orderly judgment.</P>
        <P>Two weeks ago the Minister for Finance had the Opposition spokespersons trooping in and out of the front door of the Department of Finance, with the assembled media waiting outside to see how shocked one could look when one came out of the Department into the freezing cold and wind.</P>
        <P>Commissioner Rehn came to Dublin last week and introduced me to a tall Hungarian man with glasses, who was no Victor Laszlo.  He seemed to be a very dedicated type of Government senior civil servant accounting or finance type.  Since then I have not heard a word from the Department of Finance or the Minister of Finance about opening any more books.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The team, many parts of which have been in Dublin before, will come here tomorrow.  I have seen IMF people in the country looking at our State and institutional assets, such as hospitals, and counting them.  That is what IMF teams do when they come into a country.  They draw up a balance sheet of assets and liabilities in a country.  When they come here, under what structure of the European Union and the IMF will they be operating?  There are agreements on the European stabilisation fund, and the European financial stabilisation mechanism, EFSM, comprises &euro;60 billion.  Mr. Regling, who did a report here, is the boss of the European financial <Col N="289"/>stability facility.  The &euro;60 billion was originally intended for non-euro countries such as Latvia, Hungary and Romania but it is going into the Regling fund or will be used alongside it.  The IMF will also act as a partner.</P>
        <P>The IMF has been in countries for a very long time.  The leader of the Labour Party asked the Taoiseach today what the negotiating position was.  The IMF will have teams, each of which will have a team leader.  There will be somebody from the ECB, the IMF and the European Commission.  Perhaps there will also be somebody on behalf of Mr. Regling, although he may enter the field later.  A memorandum of understanding will be drawn up.  I want to know what its headings will be. Will Fianna F&aacute;il include all State assets in it, down to schools and hospitals?  In other countries the IMF decided there were too many schools or hospitals and it would cut the numbers by X%.  This is serious stuff for the ordinary Irish person on the street because it will affect their children.  The debt will affect not just them and their children but their grandchildren.</P>
        <P>What amounts will be targeted in the memorandum of understanding?  Is it to enhance all of the facilities of the banks?  What was included in it?  The information is in the answers which were provided.  One can use it partially for financial support for banks in accordance with an agreed country programme.  That is what the memorandum of understanding is about.  I want to know if the Government has decided strategically that the memorandum of understanding is simply about a further bailouts of the banks or if it also involves commitments to Ireland in terms of budgetary support.</P>
        <P>I have no problem with the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, as an individual but it is wrong that no senior Minister is here for this very important debate and that the debate was not deferred, as I requested yesterday, until the Minister of Finance became available.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="ArthurMorganSF"><NameTxt>Deputy Arthur Morgan</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I should make a confession to the House, I find the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, an interesting person.  Perhaps one of the reasons why I find him interesting is because of his capacity for understatement.  He told us in his contribution on this motion that the Irish banking system is facing ongoing funding challenges.  That is news.  There are a couple other gems from the same interesting Minister of State, such as &ldquo;Market conditions have not normalised for credit institutions in Ireland&rdquo;.  Who would have guessed?  Other gems include, &ldquo;Market conditions remain turbulent at present&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Government is determined to rebuild consumer and investor confidence in our financial system&rdquo;.  How and when will that happen?</P>
        <P>There is no consumer confidence at the current time and there is no thrust in the way the Government is handling the crisis, in terms of the economy and banking.  The entire focus of Government policy in the past two years has been exclusively on the banking sector.  Where are we now?  We are in a deep black hole.  The Taoiseach is also given to understatement.  He told us today at Leaders&rsquo; Questions, when he was quizzed about the IMF and the EU officials coming in, that the Government will sit down with officials and colleagues to examine the issues that arise.  Perhaps afterwards they will retire to Temple Bar for some refreshments.</P>
        <P>He told us, in regard to Europe and the past few weeks, discussions took place in recent days regarding some of the technical issues.  They were not talking about a bailout.  There was no negotiation with the banking sector.  We are getting some information from this Government.  There were no negotiations on a bailout, rather, there was a discussion about technical issues.  The game is up for this Government because as we speak the hotel rooms and aircraft seats are booked for the IMF officials to parachute into this State and see exactly what is going on.  They are fed up listening to this Government and cannot believe a word that comes from it.</P><Col N="290"/>
        <P>I do not think the EU is asking the Government what is going on, rather, it is acting.  That is why we had the announcement last night that the officials are coming in to slide aside what is left of the corrupt bankers, examine the real situation and put its auditors and examiners into the Department of Finance to see exactly what is going on.  Of course there will be some platitudes.  We heard the Taoiseach read out a statement today from EU officials which commended the Government and so on, which kept everybody happy and tries to keep the market steady because we do not want to stir the troops too much or have Ireland become Greece and have hundreds of thousands of people on the street rioting.  The officials have thrown a few fancy platitudes at the Government to make it look like we are all buddies.</P>
        <P>Meanwhile the officials were told to get on the aeroplane, get into Dublin and sort out what is going on.  That is exactly what is now happening.  The financial needs of the banks far exceed the fiscal capacity of this State which is a serious problem that has not been sorted out.  What is going on?  The Minister for Finance is running around Europe trying to concoct a yarn and project the nonsense that somehow it is the banks that need to be bailed out and Ireland is sound.  It seems to be the case that if he can concoct a story that it is not a bailout for the State and it is just the banks that need a few bob, then the bluff can continue.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Any support of the banks, because of the guarantee scheme, makes it a sovereign issue.  The EU is having none of this bluff from the Minister for Finance and the Government.  It is now telling them that the officials are going in.  Not only did Fianna F&aacute;il ruin the economy of the State, which it did in style, but it also almost ruined the euro as a currency.  If that happened, where would the very structure of the European Union be?  It would have been threatened.  That is some going for what, in relative EU terms, is a small political party, which almost wrecked the entire shop here.  What are the means of the Irish banks?  According to EU officials, they require a further &euro;80 billion to &euro;100 billion to be poured into this black hole, which is way beyond this State&rsquo;s fiscal capacity.  Therefore, there is no option for the Government but to bring in assistance.  This would not be necessary if the proper steps had been taken from day one in September 2008.  I agree with Deputy Brian Hayes&rsquo;s earlier comments that we were completely and utterly misled.  We were misled not just in this House, but also by Department of Finance briefings at the time to the effect that this was a liquidity issue, not a solvency one.  We were told that they just wanted to bring the guarantee in for 12 months so that the liquidity would flow back into the system and we could all live happily ever after.  Of course, we now know all about the merits and veracity of that comment.</P>
        <P>It is amazing that even the Brits are looking in on the job now.  George Osborne is running around, putting his hand into the British exchequer to throw us several billion euro because he thinks that the interest he will charge us for it is good value.  This further diminishes our sovereignty, which was substantially diminished in any event by a whole series of EU referendums.</P>
        <P>Anglo Irish Bank was the cornerstone of this collapse.  We know the running around town that was going on with the bank&rsquo;s senior officials.  We know about their relationship with supporters and members of the Government.  It is incredible that the situation was allowed to prevail as long as it did.  A State bank should have been established at that time, which would have brought some stability to the economy.  It would have offered some integrity to savers, investors and borrowers.  The Government would not consider that option, however, and had no intention of displaying that type of integrity.  It had a different mission.</P>
        <P>Let us look at the implications of the IMF coming in.  I agree with what Deputy Burton said about the IMF&rsquo;s agenda, which would be to slash public services.  She said the IMF would count hospitals and it will not take them long.  The Government has already closed a substantial <Col N="291"/>number of acute hospital beds and the IMF will help with that project because that is its agenda.  It will ensure that public services are slashed and there will undoubtedly be huge tax hikes on low income families, while welfare will also be hit.  Meanwhile, there will be no stimulus package to generate economic enterprise and get people back to work.  There are almost half a million people still on the live register.</P>
        <P>When the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, introduced the original ELG scheme in the House last December, he advised that these provisions enhance the banks&rsquo; ability to discharge their central role in facilitating economic activity in this State.  He advised that allowing institutions to issue unguaranteed debt was &ldquo;key to restoring market confidence in the institutions&rdquo;.  I do not think so, however.  This market confidence today strongly resembles uncertainty and distrust.  Just look at interest rates alone.  Last week, the interest rate attached to ten-year bonds issued by the Irish Government rose to the once unimaginable level of 9.26%.  It was 7.8% after the Government announced that it was front-loading &euro;6 billion worth of adjustments.  A week before, this rate stood at 6.8%, a month ago it was 6.5%, and a year ago it was close to 4.7%.  We have, therefore, a clear trend of Government incompetence and its consequences on international markets.</P>
        <P>What is now happening is that the dire state of the Irish banking system and its inability to recover is making an EU bailout a reality.  The Government is providing money to banks in previously unimaginable quantities, but it has done nothing positive to get those banks functioning.  In the first instance, it should have let Anglo go.</P>
        <P>If the banking policy is working, and we are told that it is, and if deficit reduction through a policy of cuts is working, why is it becoming harder for this State to avail of international funding?  That is something the Minister cannot answer, although I hope he will try to do so when replying to this debate.</P>
        <P>To the international media, the Minister for Finance has made a distinction between the State, which was insolvent but liquid, and the banks, which were both broke and cashless.  We are supposedly experiencing a banking crisis rather than a national one.  However, having underwritten the banks two years ago with a deal that guaranteed virtually all the bondholders&rsquo; risk, the Irish taxpayer has seen the cost of the bank bailout rise to between a quarter and a half of GDP.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s open-ended commitment to cover bank losses plainly exceeds the fiscal capacity of the State.  The losses of the banking sector have become those of the taxpayer.  Bank debt has become sovereign debt and that is the problem because ordinary citizens are suffering for these failings.</P>
        <P>An Irish bailout costing at least &euro;100 billion has not been sufficient to save the banking sector and now the threat of an EU bailout looms.  Barclays Capital said that any aid package intended to stabilise the situation in Ireland would require at least &euro;85 billion.  EU governments are only likely to grant emergency funds in exchange for conditions set and enforced by the European Commission and the IMF.</P>
        <P>Such a bailout, as was seen in Greece, will force greater, harsher budgetary measures on Ireland and will diminish our economic sovereignty.  Like the Greek bailout, this will come at a crippling cost not for bankers, developers or politicians, but for ordinary people struggling to survive.  Even then, it is highly unlikely that it will benefit the economy.  Just look at Greece now.  On Monday, it said it would miss a target to reduce its government deficit to 8.1% of gross domestic product this year, which was set after Greece took a bailout from eurozone countries and the International Monetary Fund.  Instead, Greece now says the deficit is likely to be 9.4% this year and that government debt will total 144% of GDP at the end of 2010.</P><Col N="292"/>
        <P>The current situation concerning bond yields feels eerily similar to what happened months ago in Greece.  In Ireland, however, banking troubles lie at the root of what many in Europe are now calling a solvency crisis, reflecting long-term concern over Ireland&rsquo;s ability to repay its debts, as opposed to the lack of short-term funds that forced the Greek rescue last spring.</P>
        <P>Ireland is beyond fiscal plans as long as there remains a bottomless pit of losses in the banking sector.  The credibility of the Government&rsquo;s banking strategy is shot.  The lender of last resort is closing its doors to Irish banks and it is clear that the Government&rsquo;s failed banking strategy is leading Ireland down the path of EU/IMF intervention.  They will arrive tomorrow.</P>
        <P>As I said earlier, the dire state of the Irish banking system and its inability to recover is making an EU bailout a reality.  We are being told that any bailout would be for the banks, but the State is tied to the banking sector.  This bailout will be dressed up as a bank rescue and so the mess continues.</P>
        <P>I appreciate that some of the contributions in this debate are designed around the general banking system, as opposed to the specifics of the guarantee scheme.  I think that is inevitable, however, given the state we are in.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest>   if he has received a report from the Garda Commissioner on the policing of the student demonstrations that took place outside Leinster House and in the vicinity of Leinster House on Wednesday 3 November 2010; the number of garda&iacute; injured as a result of objects being thrown at them and the nature of the injuries sustained; if he has received or is aware of any complaints made by students who participated in the demonstration and if he has any concerns regarding the approach taken by An Garda S&iacute;ochan&aacute; in dealing with some demonstrators; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[42917/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>In the policing of demonstrations, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, while respecting the right of legitimate protest, has a duty to ensure as far as possible that peace is preserved and public order maintained, and that lives and property are protected.  The safety of the garda&iacute; involved is also an important consideration.  In preparing for demonstrations, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must take into account a number of important factors, including the anticipated numbers, the profile of those likely to be involved and any intelligence relating to the event.  Once a protest starts, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na must constantly monitor and evaluate the situation and be ready to make tactical decisions based on the prevailing circumstances.</P>
        <P>Public order training forms part of normal training and additional specialised training is provided for members selected for duty with divisional and regional public order units.  Further training is provided for officers in the management of incidents requiring the deployment of public order units.</P><Col N="293"/>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is the statutory body charged with the independent oversight of policing in this jurisdiction.  To date, it has received 36 complaints regarding the policing of the demonstrations.  Of those 36 complaints, 20 have been determined to be admissible, 15 have been determined to be inadmissible and one complaint has been withdrawn.  Admissibility is simply a neutral determination that a complaint meets the statutory criteria for investigation but has no other significance.  A senior investigating officer has been appointed to oversee the investigation of these complaints.  The Ombudsman Commission is fully independent in the exercise of its functions and it would be inappropriate for me to make any further comment at this stage.</P>
        <P>As regards injuries sustained by garda&iacute; during the protest, I am advised by the Garda Commissioner that one member required treatment in hospital for a broken nose, while a second member was hit in the face with a bottle.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree the maintenance of peace and public order when demonstrations take place is of crucial importance?  Does he agree that any person who injured a garda at a demonstration deserves condemnation?  It is of particular importance that respect is shown to members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na exercising their policing duties on behalf of the public.  Does the Minister acknowledge that the overwhelming majority of students participating in the demonstration behaved perfectly properly, demonstrated in a peaceful manner and made known their views on the subject matter of the demonstration?  Does the Minister acknowledge that some of the events that occurred that day are reason for genuine public concern?  Some of the incidents and events are contained on images accessible on YouTube and are cause for concern.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I concur with Deputy Shatter in his views regarding the duties and responsibility of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to police events such as this in a reasonable way.  I also concur that they represent the greater good in maintaining order in marches such as this.  I concur with the point that the majority of students were well behaved.  The president of the Union of Students in Ireland, Mr. Gary Redmond, said on the day that he was saddened by the actions of a minority of protesters.  It is clear there was a strong effort by a number of people who are not students, or if they are, were associated with a number of groups there to cause trouble.  I completely concur with Deputy Shatter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Does the Minister agree that in demonstrations such as this, where there appears to be a minority intent on creating trouble, it is of enormous importance that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is conscious of who these people are, that there is no overreaction and that innocent individuals behaving correctly do not find themselves confronted in an aggressive manner so that they feel threatened or are unnecessarily manhandled?  It is of great importance that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in maintaining order, is not a cause of disorder and fear on the part of those lawfully demonstrating.  In the context of the manner in which this event was policed, aside from the issues investigated by the Garda Ombudsman, is a review of policing methods being carried out and is further consideration being given to a different approach to future demonstrations?  Has the Minister sought such a report from the Garda Commissioner?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>There is ongoing training of Garda personnel, normal personnel and specialised units with regard to public order.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na reviews and learns from the situation every time an event such as this takes place.  Each situation dictates the type of response from the moment it occurs.  Due to a number of incidents, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na had to engage with those causing trouble but it did a great disservice to those who were there legitimately and peacefully to protest.</P><Col N="294"/>
        <P>I discuss these issues on a regular basis with Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na management.  I will be liaising with the Garda Commissioner when he has an overview of the incident that took place.</P>

        <asker>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</asker>
        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest>   if he will confirm that just three anti social behaviour orders have been placed on young offenders since the legislation was enacted in 2006; the reason this power has been used so little having regard to claims made at the time the legislation was published of the role they could play to reduce anti-social behaviour; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[43091/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Children Act 2001 was amended by Part 13 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 to provide for civil proceedings regarding anti-social behaviour by children.  These provisions, which were commenced on 1 March 2007, set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by children.  They are just one element of the Government&rsquo;s policy on youth crime, which is set out in detail in the national youth justice strategy 2008-10.  The approach adopted by the Government involves an incremental process of diversion from the formal criminal justice system, community sanctions as alternatives to custody and detention as a last resort.  In the case of anti-social behaviour, the diversion process includes the use of warnings, good behaviour contracts and anti-social behaviour orders where appropriate.  In the event that the behaviour warning or good behaviour contract fails to change a young person&rsquo;s anti-social behaviour, it is only then that further measures such as the anti-social behaviour order or other diversion approaches might be used.</P>
        <P>For this reason the number of anti-social behaviour orders should not be considered in isolation but must be viewed as part of a wider incremental process to deal with anti-social behaviour.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that, up to 30 October 2010, 1,541 behaviour warnings have been issued to children, 15 good behaviour contracts have been made with children and three behaviour orders have been issued by the courts.  It was always the intention that this approach to anti-social behaviour would operate as part and parcel of the Garda diversion programme.</P>
        <P>The diversion programme operates in accordance with Part 4 of the Children Act 2001, as amended, and under the general superintendence and control of the Garda Commissioner.  The aim of the programme is to deal with children who offend, by way of administering a formal or informal caution, thus diverting the offender away from the courts and minimising the likelihood of further offending.  The programme has proven to be successful in diverting young persons away from crime and anti-social behaviour by offering guidance and support to juveniles and their families.  In the event that warnings or good behaviour contracts prove inadequate to deter a young person from anti-social behaviour, the next step is to use the structures of the diversion programme before resorting to behaviour orders or criminal prosecution.</P>
   
        <P el="10" Just="Left"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></P>
        <P el="0">The 2009 annual report of the committee appointed to monitor the effectiveness of the Garda diversion programme showed a reduction of 13% in the number of incidents referred to the programme and a 14% reduction in the number of children referred, compared to 2008.  Alcohol offences were down by 22% compared to 2008.  I commend the work of An Garda <Col N="295"/>S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, in particular, juvenile liaison officers and community garda&iacute; on their excellent work with young people.</P>
   </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Why does the Minister think the anti-social behaviour orders have been such a complete and abject failure?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not believe they are.  We have had this discussion already.  A hallmark of the success of the anti-social behaviour orders is that so few children have been brought to court.  The idea behind the system is to divert children away from the courts and to engage with them in an incremental way.  As the Deputy can see from the figures, that is the strong advice from the experts in this regard, especially the Garda.  They say that when they engage with young people who come to their attention for anti-social behaviour, and when they deal with their wider family, in particular in the context of the contracts, and contacts before they enter into the good behaviour contract, those children do not again come to the attention of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Is it not the case that since the law was invoked in 2007 three anti-social behaviour orders have been made?  Is it not the case that the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not in reality operate the system?  The Minister has referred to 1,541 warnings.  Is it not the case that they are entirely meaningless?  Since the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was established in 1922 garda&iacute; warned young fellows.  What does that have to do with it?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Minister is getting a reputation for saying whatever comes into his head.  He said the bank situation was a fiction.  He has a habit of just staring the facts in the face and denying them.  Is it not the case that the most serious problem in my constituency, and in most urban constituencies, is low-level anti-social behaviour by young people in communities who are torturing law-abiding citizens in their own homes?  Those youngsters target vulnerable people.  They attack their homes and insert obscene and lighted material through their letter boxes, damage their cars and pester people who live alone, especially women and immigrants.  That is happening everywhere.  Three ASBOs have been implemented since 2007, yet the Minister has informed me the system is an outstanding success.  What is the point in having Question Time with him?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Rabbitte seems to think the more anti-social behaviour orders are made the more successful is the system.  I disagree on the basis that the concept of this procedure is that it is used in an incremental way.  Fewer orders and a reduction in the number of occasions the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na brings young people before the courts is a hallmark of the success of the system.  Deputy Rabbitte is trying to encourage the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to serve ASBOs on every child who comes before it, whereas if the Garda interact with them and their families before it gets to the stage of bringing children to court the situation will be improved.</P>
        <P>The idea was to prevent children from going into the criminal justice system.  This is a civil procedure designed to allow a little more flexibility in terms of how one interacts with children.  I am very supportive of the fact that we should divert children away from the criminal justice system and not bring them to court, penalise them or put them into prison and to use anti-social behaviour legislation to interact with them in a much more holistic way.  It goes against the philosophy Deputy Rabbitte&rsquo;s party sometimes espouses for him to say that the more ASBOs that are implemented the more successful is the system.  I disagree with him.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>What I am trying to do is provide protection to communities and persons who are adversely affected by anti-social behaviour.  For the Minister to say I am trying <Col N="296"/>to encourage the Garda to apply an ASBO to every child when three have been applied since the system was introduced is fantastic and ridiculous.</P>
        <P>Is it not the case that the Minister committed to a range of measures in this area in the programme for government but that he has not implemented any of them?  It is very easy to introduce legislation on ASBOs, in the same way it is easy to enact legislation in other areas.  There is a commitment to providing a community pay-back scheme that will require offenders who are not subject to automatic long terms in prison to provide real services for communities they have damaged.  Another commitment is to provide a system of parental responsibility for criminal damage.  A further commitment is to create anti-social behaviour action teams.  There is also a commitment to legislate to allow garda&iacute; to issue restriction orders.  There are 29 other commitments.  Is the programme for government to have any credibility or is it just for the optics?  The Minister has outlined a range of commitments but he has not implemented any of them.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Deputy should know we have funded a number of very successful restorative justice projects that are up and running.  Over time I would like to see more use of them across the various courts.  Equally so, since I became Minister I introduced significant reform in terms of trying to use community service orders as an alternative to prison in order to allow pay-back to communities.  I refer to community service orders to assist tidy towns groups in graffiti removal and other such tasks.</P>
        <P>To return to ASBOs, I implacably disagree with the Deputy on what he, in effect, is trying to do.  I accept there is a problem with anti-social behaviour in the country.  There are other laws, apart from the ASBO legislation that could deal with the matter and no doubt they are used by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in that respect.  The principle behind the legislation is, in effect, that the fewer orders made and the fewer occasions on which children are brought to court, which is the ultimate sanction, the more successful the scheme is because one has already intervened with the children and their parents and they do not come to the notice of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na any further.</P>

        <Quest>   if his attention has been drawn to the call made by the family of Fr.

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 40 together.</P><Col N="297"/>
        <P>The incident to which the Deputies refer was the subject of investigation by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which resulted in the submission of an investigation file to the law officers, who directed that a person be charged with manslaughter and assault occasioning actual bodily harm.  At the subsequent trial, directions to acquit were given by the judge.</P>
        <P>Following representations which I recently received, I requested a report on the matter from the Garda authorities.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that, following the publication of the article referred to by Deputy Shatter, representations were also made to the Garda Commissioner requesting an investigation of the matters raised in it.  The Commissioner arranged for a detective superintendent to meet the persons making the representations, particularly in the context of an assessment of whether there is new information or evidence available which could be pursued.  I expect to receive a further report from the Commissioner when that assessment is completed.</P>
        <P>The Criminal Procedure Act 2010 introduced a significant change to our laws governing the status of acquittals, by providing that an acquittal can now be set aside and the person re-tried where new and compelling evidence emerges.  Previously, an acquitted person was entitled to an irrebuttable presumption of innocence.  However, the Act&rsquo;s provisions do not apply to historical cases &mdash; they apply only to persons tried and acquitted on or after the date on which the provisions were commenced, that is, 1 September this year.  This absence of retrospective effect stems from our constitutional framework.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Could the Minister indicate to the House when the meetings that are to take place as arranged through the Garda Commissioner will occur?</P>
        <P>Does the Minister agree that the recent revelations are disturbing and indicate the possibility that the integrity of the investigation into the death of Fr. Molloy was compromised, and second, that serious question marks arise about the manner in which the matter was dealt with at trial in the context of the judge directing that the charges be dismissed on the possibility that Fr. Molloy died as a result of a heart attack in the context of the Coroner&rsquo;s Court establishing that he died as a consequence of a vicious assault?</P>
        <P>In addition to interviewing those from whom representations have been received and additional information furnished, will the Minister ask the Garda Commissioner to examine the manner in which the original investigation was conducted because there are now substantial concerns that crucial evidence was not taken account of, and in at least one instance was not made available in the context of any prosecution that did take place?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am not aware of when the discussions with the two people will be held, but I understand one has already been interviewed and the other, who is a third party and a relative of some of the people involved in the incident, will be interviewed in due course.</P>
        <P>There was serious concern in and around the time of the trial and subsequent to it.  There were also suggestions that it be re-opened.  If any new compelling evidence comes forward, it will be a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I cannot intervene in the re-opening of a criminal file by the Garda.  If there is any new evidence, I would urge people in whose possession it is to come forward and give it to the Garda.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Does the Minister not agree the story published in the <i>Irish Independent</i> by a reputable journalist is profoundly disquieting and ought to be a cause for concern for the Minister for Justice and Law Reform of the day?  I thank him for the minimal information he has given Deputy Shatter.  It is a great deal more and different in character from the information contained in the written reply he gave me approximately ten days ago when he essentially washed his hands of the matter.  I welcome the change of heart over there, but it raises <Col N="298"/>questions about written parliamentary questions and the way they are treated by Ministers and Departments.</P>
        <P>Is the Minister not concerned that an inappropriate direction was given to the jury in this case, one that warrants the Garda&rsquo;s re-opening of the case?  Nothing prevents him from expressing an opinion as to whether the facts as set out in the story justify the Garda re-opening the investigation to determine whether a new prosecution might be mounted.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">The issue goes back as far as 1985 or 1986.  At this remove and due to the separation of powers, it would not be appropriate for the Minister for Justice and Law Reform to comment on the holding of and procedure followed in the trial by the judge in question.  In the aftermath of the acquittal and the closing of the criminal trial, significant efforts were made to re-open it.  On 9 December 1986 in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, former Deputy Michael Keating asked the then Minister for Justice whether he intended to accede to the request of the relatives of the late Fr. Niall Molloy for a sworn inquiry into the events surrounding his death.  The then Minister, Mr. Alan Dukes, stated. &ldquo;This case has already been the subject of a Garda investigation, a criminal trial and a coroner&rsquo;s inquest, which is, in effect, a sworn public inquiry.&rdquo;  He also stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The holding of a further sworn inquiry could be justified only if there were some likelihood that some new facts would be brought to light.  As there does not appear to be any such likelihood in this case I do not see how any further inquiry could be justified.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">As a result of the recent publication in a newspaper, the Garda is in the process of discussing the issues with the people involved and those who have made representations, including the journalist.  It will be a matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to re-examine the question.  It is not something in which I can intervene.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>I want to allow further supplementary questions.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister assure the House that, in the context of the Garda re-examining the matter, the discussions and interviews to be conducted will go beyond the journalist and the second individual?  The Garda should interview other individuals who are available and who may have information that could assist in determining whether a further criminal prosecution is warranted.  If the Garda re-investigates the matter and it emerges that someone other than the individual who was originally prosecuted is appropriately brought before the courts and has charges pressed against him or her, does the Minister agree that no obstruction in the context of the 2010 Act would prevent that from occurring?  Does he agree that the mere interviewing of two individuals is not an adequate re-investigation?  Given the revelations now available and which contain different and additional information from that available to the former Minister, Mr. Dukes, is it not appropriate that the Garda would engage in a far wider investigation than merely speaking with two individuals?  Will he assure the House the Garda will do so?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It would be entirely a matter for the Garda to decide.  It has received representations from two people.  The Garda Commissioner has appointed a detective superintendent to prepare a report and interview the people concerned.  If the detective superintendent believes other people should be interviewed as a result, I have no doubt he will do so.</P>
        <P>Deputy Shatter is correct regarding the prosecution of someone else.  The Criminal Procedure Act 2010 is not relevant in this respect.  However, the prosecution of another individual is a <Col N="299"/>matter for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and is not something the Minister can direct.  It would be done only on the basis of new evidence being available.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Is it not the case that the difference between the answer given in December 1986 and today&rsquo;s situation is that such new facts as referred to by the then Minister for Justice have emerged?  For example, these new facts relate to the time lag between the death occurring and the Garda being called, the fire in the Offaly coroner&rsquo;s office and the destruction of the file, and the retired sergeant who was first on the scene proffering new information, if not new evidence.  Are these not the new facts in respect of which the Minister for Justice in 1986 seemed to say the case would be re-investigated?</P>
        <P>I am not asking the Minister to make a judgment or to interfere inappropriately.  Rather, I am asking him to say there is sufficient information surrounding this affair for him to say he is disquieted.  I am not asking him to refer to the trial that took place, although a member of his party who was then a journalist wrote a timely paean of praise to the judge in that trial despite the fact the decision to direct acquittal caused uproar at the time.  Could the Minister be more forthcoming?</P>
        <P>Does the Minister not believe this would be an appropriate case for a commission of investigation under the recent Commission of Investigations Act?  The facts are so disturbing and profoundly disquieting that the family, which is only looking for the truth, deserves to have the allegations, new information and new evidence, if it be new evidence, tested.  Is the fastest and cheapest way to do this not a commission of investigation?  Is this not a matter for the Minister rather than the Garda Commissioner?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The appropriate authority is the Garda where the investigation of criminal aspects is concerned.  Regarding the investigation at the time, the then Minister stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">I wish to make the point that the State took every possible step to ensure the full facts of the case emerged at the inquest.  Senior and junior counsel were appointed to represent the State and all of the statements made to the garda&iacute; and Garda maps and photographs were made available to the coroner.</P>
     
        <P>Again, the reopening of this case is a matter for the Garda authorities.  It is not for the Minister for Justice and Law Reform to give an opinion in relation to this.  I do not have the luxury that Members of the Opposition have.  I see they have already committed themselves, if they get into Government, to a full review of this issue.  Perhaps Deputy Rabbitte will have a different power when he is on this side of the House, but I have to adhere to the separation of powers principle regarding the investigation.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The commission of investigations is a matter for the Minister. </P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, but there is already a request for a reopening of this issue by the people concerned to the Garda Commissioner and the Garda authorities.  A process is now in train and a detective superintendent has been asked to produce a file.</P>

      </Qst>
       <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">3 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The issue of upward only rent review clauses, and the difficulties which rigid adherence to such clauses is causing for the retail sector in current economic circumstances, has been raised with me by various retail and tenant groups.  I have been very consistent in espousing the view that there is a need for a flexible and pragmatic approach to rent review negotiations arising in the context of existing contractual arrangements.  It is self-evident that it is not in anyone&rsquo;s interest that vacancy rates increase to an unacceptable level because of a reluctance to offer sensible concessions to traders who are in difficulty. </P>
        <P>The Deputy will be aware that I have legislated to prohibit upward only rent reviews in leases entered into on or after 28 February of this year by way of section 132 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009.  Similar action in relation to existing leases was not possible for legal and constitutional reasons.  There are indications that the commencement of that section has had some persuasive effect in relation to those lease arrangements, although I am sure that there is further scope for additional flexibility in this area.</P>
        <P>In March of this year I established a working group to look at certain issues around the arbitration process and the adequacy of the information available to all parties in the context of rent reviews.  The report of the working group was published on 17 August last.  The group recommended the establishment of a public database containing relevant details of letting arrangements and rent reviews in the commercial property market.  An appropriate amendment is being developed within my Department for inclusion in the Property Services (Regulation) Bill 2009 which would see the property services regulatory authority being given responsibility for the management of the database.  The precise operational details pertaining to the database are in the course of finalisation.</P>
        <P>Also among the group&rsquo;s recommendations is the adoption, by landlords and tenants alike, of the rent review arbitration code which was appended to their report and which is intended to achieve a uniform and transparent procedure for the resolution of disputes in the sector.  I have publicly endorsed the group&rsquo;s recommendation in this area and have been in contact with bodies which were represented on the group to encourage them to commit to the code.</P>
        <P>During the course of its deliberations, the group noted the potentially distorting effect which agreements made between landlords and tenants which are outside the terms of the lease may have on the letting market.  These so-called side agreements can include matters such as rent free periods and contributions to fit out costs.  In certain cases, such agreements can mean that the true value of the rent agreed may, in reality, be less than that appearing on the face of the lease.  The need to ensure that the parties to a rent review have access to all relevant information was a key motivating factor in the recommendation for the establishment of a database, which I am fully committed to implementing.</P>
        <P>I am satisfied that concerns in this area are being addressed as far as possible.  While I can say that the operation of the law will continue to be reviewed in my Department, I do not think that criminal sanctions of the kind referred to by the Deputy are necessary or feasible.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister acknowledge that there is a continuing problem in this area, in particular with institutional landlords in the context of retail outlets seeking to address issues of rent reviews?  To maintain the capital value of their balance sheets, they are resisting any type of new arrangement, other than one that involves a rent increase, or at the <Col N="301"/>very minimum rents remaining at current levels despite the collapse of commercial rental values. </P>
        <P>Will the Minister also accept that it is a substantial difficulty in the context of any arbitration work, where an arbitrator in determining rents has to look at comparators, for example, with an individual shopping centre or town centre?  If the only comparators of recent vintage available are those which show substantial rent increases, with secret incentives having been provided to tenants to agree to those rent increases, does he agree that this is distorting the market, putting other tenants in a very unfair position and rendering the arbitration process practically impossible?</P>
        <P>I suggest two things to the Minister.  The first is that this sort of conduct, an incentivised rent increases so as to artificially inflate rents, should be criminalised.  Since the legislation he mentioned was enacted, there is an alternative legal opinion from a very eminent senior counsel indicating that in the current market situation, amendments of current leases by statute to allow for rent reviews downwards, or I should say amendments of leases concluded prior to 28 February last, would be constitutionally permissible.  Is the Minister willing to bring forward legislation to facilitate this on the basis that, if necessary it would be a Bill the President might determine should be sent to the Supreme Court for a constitutional decision?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I would be loth to criminalise the giving of incentives regarding leases because that, in effect, would be to criminalise contractual discussions and negotiations between two people who have free will and are probably well advised.  I suggest that criminalising that type of activity, even though people might not be too happy with it, would be very detrimental to the property market, which is in difficult circumstances as it is.  To introduce criminal sanction in that respect would make matters even more difficult. </P>
        <P>I have been looking at the property pages over the last while and I know from own area that many landlords renegotiated substantial reductions with tenants, but that did not seem to happen in certain parts of Dublin.  Nonetheless, it happened elsewhere in the country.  I accept that for whatever reasons landlords were not willing to reduce the rents, but by and large the vast majority of them did because half a loaf is better than none.  They are better off getting something from tenants, if not the full rent.  However, there may be other issues involved.  Bank institutions, in particular, for example, would require the rent as originally intended.</P>
        <P>Regarding legislation, the Labour Party introduced a Bill and we looked very carefully at it and at senior counsel opinion produced by one of the organisations involved in this area.  I went back, time and again, to the Office of the Attorney General and spoke to him about this on many occasions.  It boils down ultimately to the fact that the Oireachtas cannot intervene in a contract previously made between two individuals, who no doubt were independently advised.  It would be totally unconstitutional for us to pass an Act on that basis.  If that were the case we could re-write every contract made by private individuals right across the country.  The Attorney General&rsquo;s office has looked into the minutiae of this and concluded that we could not retrospectively change contracts previously entered into.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased the Minister has indicated he is going to make an amendment in the Bill when it comes before the House on Committee Stage.  Will that database prescribe that the address of premises be included, as well as the rent and the date it was fixed, together with other arrangements relating to the organisation of a new rent for an existing lease, including those agreed before February 2010, or where new leases are entered into, the additional arrangements made such as six-months free rental or where a landlord agrees to spend a substantial sum on refurbishing a property in return for an increased rent? </P>
      </Speaker><Col N="302"/>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The purpose of the database is to ensure as much information as possible is made available publicly thus ensuring a transparent process which will provide individuals with relevant information in regard to the vicinity of the particular location wherein they intend to rent.  We believe the property services regulatory authority is the relevant authority to provide this database.   The Deputy will be aware that enabling legislation in this regard is passing through the House.  Ultimately, as much detail as possible will be made public.</P>
        <P>It is indicated in today&rsquo;s newspapers that Abercrombie and Fitch will shortly open a store in Dublin city centre.  Last week, there was a clear indication in the property supplement that rents in respect of new leases have decreased because of recent legislative changes made in this House, which is to be welcomed.</P>

        <Quest>   the number of prisoners in each of our prisons and penal institutions, for which latest figures are available, and the approximate average annual cost per prisoner in each such institution  </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>On 15 November 2010, there were 4,416 prisoners in custody as compared to a bed capacity of 4,430.  This represents an occupancy level of 100%.  A table detailing the numbers in custody in each prison is being provided to the Deputy. </P>
        <P>It should be noted that the Irish Prison Service does not record or breakdown costs per individual prison, rather figures are based on three categories, namely, open prison, closed prison and high security prison.  Loughan House and Shelton Abbey are open prisons.  Portlaoise Prison is the only high security prison in the jurisdiction.  The cost per available staffed prison space in open prisons in 2009 was &euro;50,521, representing a 16% decrease on the cost in 2008, which was &euro;60,150.  The cost per available staffed prison space in closed prisons in 2009 was &euro;79,308, representing a 13% decrease on the 2008 figure, which was &euro;90,837.  The cost per available staffed prison space in the high security prison was &euro;75,892, representing a 51% decrease on the 2008 figure, which was &euro;155,306.  The average cost of an available staffed prison space during 2009 was &euro;77,222,  representing a decrease of 16.7% on the 2008 figure, which was &euro;92,717.</P>
        <P>The decrease in average cost is attributed to the following two factors, namely, a decrease in total costs of &euro;17.7 million, of which &euro;15.5 million relates to pay costs and an increase in bed capacity of 495, from 3,611 as at 31 December 2008 to 4,106 as at 31 December 2009.  I am sure the Deputy will agree there has been a substantial increase in the number of beds in the system.</P>
        <P>Consistent with calculations in previous years, costs which are not under the direct control of the Irish Prison Service have been excluded.  Teachers&rsquo; salary costs are, therefore, excluded from this exercise as these costs are not provided for under the prisons budget allocation.  Similarly, capital expenditure, including building-equipment assets and small works, is excluded from the calculations in the interest of facilitating comparison between prison types.</P>
     
        <P el="10" Just="Left"><i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i></P>
        <P el="0">The Irish Prison Service has been engaged in an extensive programme of investment in prisons infrastructure involving the modernisation of the existing estate and the provision of extra prison spaces.  Since 1997, in excess of 1,930 new prison spaces have come on stream in the prison system.  These include the new prisons in Castlerea, the Midlands, Cloverhill, the <Col N="303"/>D&oacute;chas Centre and new accommodation in Limerick, Portlaoise, Castlerea, Mountjoy and most recently Wheatfield prisons and at the open centres in Shelton Abbey and Loughan House.  In addition, the Irish Prison Service has completed the renovation of an unused landing in Limerick female prison which has provided an extra 14 cells with in-cell sanitation.</P>
        <P>The Irish Prison Service plans to commence construction later this year on a new accommodation block in the Portlaoise-Midlands prisons complex, which will provide 300 prison spaces in 2012.  Also in the short term, work is due to commence on converting an administrative building on the D&oacute;chas site into a new accommodation block which will provide 70 spaces in the near future.  The Government is fully committed to developing a new prison campus at Thornton Hall, County Dublin.</P>

	<P>On the number of people in our prisons, do I get the impression that there is an inexorable rise in the number of people going to prison, which impacts on lowering the average cost?  Is it a cause of concern to the Minister that these figures appear to be increasing and what steps, if any, are being taken &mdash; I accept the Fines Act was introduced but I do not know how operational it is &mdash; from the point of ensuring that minor offenders are not sent to prison, in particular in respect of non-payment of minor fines such as having no television licence and so on?</P>
        <P>Perhaps the Minister would update the House on other proposals in this area.  Does the Government propose to progress the disastrous Thornton Hall project, in regard to which &euro;30 million was wasted on the purchase of land worth approximately &euro;5 million or &euro;6 million at the time and which may now only be worth half that amount?  Is that project on hold or is this to be more money down the drain?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy O&rsquo;Keeffe&rsquo;s second question has broadened the scope of the question tabled.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>A response in regard to a later question deals with the issue of Thornton Hall.  I have tried to deal with the issue of prison committals in the long, medium <Col N="304"/>and short term, the long term response being Thornton Hall.  A response to a later question in regard to Thornton Hall clearly indicates that the Government is moving on Thornton Hall.  It is expected that, all things being equal, the first prison cells in Thornton Hall will be available in 2014.  The access road is almost complete and a contract in regard to work on provision of the on-site facilities will shortly be put out to tender.  Further information on this matter is provided in the response to a later question.  Also, a contract for the perimeter wall will be put out to tender some time in the new year.  We will then commence construction of the first of three phases, which will provide 400 cells which, as the cells are big, will provide accommodation for 700 people.</P>
        <P>On the medium term response, significant progress has been made in regard to the extension of the Midlands Prison, which will provide 300 extra cells.  It is hoped that construction will commence later this year on a new accommodation block at the Portlaoise Prison complex, which will provide 300 spaces.  I recently opened a new wing at Wheatfield Prison, which is a credit to all concerned.  It is the most modern prison facility in Europe.  As far as I can recall, the wing provides more than 100 new spaces.  The conversion of an administrative building on the D&oacute;chas site into new prison accommodation will provide 70 extra spaces and renovation of an unused landing at Limerick female prison has provided an extra 14 cells with in-cell sanitation.</P>
        <P>In the short term, we have changed the legislation to try to prevent people being sent to prison for non-payment of civil debt and fines under the Fines Act.</P>

	<P>Leaving aside Thornton Hall and whether the Minister or I will ever see it completed, is the Minister satisfied that it is the correct thrust of policy to seek to continue to provide more prison cells?  Why are we not dealing with the situation of minor offenders not being incarcerated in prison?  Why are we not dealing with the situation of more prisoners being incarcerated in open prisons, which are significantly cheaper per prisoner than is the closed prison regime of which the Minister has spoken?</P>

	<P>It is the case that numbers have risen exponentially during the past number of years.  This is as a result of there being more Garda and Garda activity on the streets.  Garda numbers have increased from 11,500 to 14,600.</P>
      </Speaker>

	<P>Perhaps Deputy Rabbitte is dense.  The fact that there are more Garda on the streets means there is more Garda, court and judicial activity.  The increase in the number of cases before the District Court is as a result of increased activity and investment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>

	<P Just="Left">Ultimately, if a young person commits a crime he or she will be sent to prison.  Plans are progressing on the provision of a new detention centre for those under 18 at Oberstown.  How many prisoners who should currently feature in jail as part of the figures the Minister has given Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe are absconding?  There were 401 absconding prisoners as of September as far as I can recollect.  Is that still the number?</P>
        <P>Why was a new circular issued by him to the Prison Service indicating that when people were brought to prison and arrested for non-payment of finds, they should literally be taken in the front door, their names and addresses taken and then released without ever being placed in a cell in order that they would not feature on the list of those on temporary release?  Does the Minister agree that such an approach says to any person in this State on whom a fine is imposed with the alternative of a prison sentence that whether he or she pays it in full, partly pays it or pays none of it, there will be no consequences and he or she has complete impunity?  The Minister&rsquo;s actions in this area have brought the criminal justice system into disrepute, they are a waste of time for the Garda, the courts, court clerks and the Prison Service and they are a total and utter disgrace.</P>

        <Quest>   his views on the establishment of a missing children&rsquo;s helpline; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is responsible for the investigation of persons, including of course children, reported missing in circumstances which give rise to concern.  The Garda emergency numbers, 112 and 999, are available for this purpose.  In line with a commitment in the Programme for Government 2007, I asked the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate to examine current Garda practice with regard to missing persons.  The inspectorate found overall that Garda systems for handling missing persons cases are in line with international best practice.  It made 18 recommendations on how these systems can be further enhanced, and their implementation is well advanced.</P>
        <P>The recommendations did not include the establishment of a helpline of the kind referred to by the Deputy, although I do not suggest that the inspectorate would be opposed to such a development.  A missing persons helpline is operated by Missing in Ireland Support Services, which can deal with cases of missing children.  The Deputy may have in mind the telephone number 116000, which has been reserved by the European Commission as a common number for missing children hotlines in EU member states.  Member states are obliged to reserve the number and promote it, encourage the provision of the service, ensure that citizens are adequately informed about it and make every effort to ensure that citizens have access to a service.  They are not, however, obliged to ensure the service is provided.</P>
        <P>In fulfilment of these obligations, the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, has advertised on a number of occasions, inviting prospective service providers &mdash; in effect <Col N="307"/>voluntary organisations &mdash; that feel they are qualified to offer the service to apply for allocation of the number.  They have not been in a position to allocate the number so far.  I have asked my Department to keep in contact with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources about this matter.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>In expressing disappointment at the Minister&rsquo;s reply, I remind him of his statement on 14 April 2009 when announcing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin"><NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

	<P>He can summarise.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>I remind the Minister of his statement wherein he announced he was giving the go-ahead to what was described as the amber alert system in respect of missing children.  This has resulted in inaction on his part since the announcement.  On the matter of emergency numbers, why did the Minister not refer to the setting up of the 116000 helpline, which is common in other EU jurisdictions?   The aim of this would be to provide an emergency alarm number that would be known by the citizens not only of this jurisdiction but also of jurisdictions throughout the EU but the Minister has failed in that regard.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the inspectorate&rsquo;s recommendation on the amber alert and I gave the go-ahead for the establishment of an alert system.</P>

      </Speaker>

	<P>The Garda is currently exploring options to achieve the most appropriate structure to give effect to the recommendation taking account of progress at international level in the development of alert systems for missing children that will explore cross-jurisdictional dimensions.</P>
        <P>With regard to the issue of the European number, ComReg has allocated that number and it has invited&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>There has been no take-up.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps it is safer to say that ComReg has not been able to allocate it and this matter will be kept under review by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and ComReg.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister confirm there is a designated officer in each Garda division in which there is situated a residence in the form of a care home for children dealing with missing children?  If not, why not?</P>
        <P>How many children are currently missing in this jurisdiction?</P>

        <P>With regard to the issue of missing children, there is a joint Garda-HSE protocol on the roles and responsibilities of both agencies in regard to children missing from care.  It was agreed in April 2009 and it relates to the establishment of a Garda local liaison role with HSE placements and this is working extremely well.  The role includes a mechanism to identify children in care who are reported missing frequently and raises the possibility of referring such cases to the appropriate level of authority in both organisations.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan"><NameTxt>Deputy Charles Flanagan</NameTxt>
	<P>Is there a designated officer?  That has not been confirmed.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Yes, there is a local liaison role, which is that of a designated officer.  The HSE has commenced a process to change its model of care for separated minors such that they can avail of foster care and residential arrangements across a broader spectrum than previously available.  A protocol which provides for a review of its implementation is currently ongoing between the Garda and the HSE.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to be able to inform the Deputy that my proposals are to include in the criminal justice (legal aid) Bill, referred to in the Government legislation programme, provisions to enable the transfer from my Department to the Legal Aid Board of responsibility for the administration and management of criminal legal aid.  Drafting of the Bill is in the course of being finalised with a view to publication in this session.</P>
        <P>My aim in the Bill is to strengthen the system of granting legal aid.  It will, among other matters, better regulate the taking of statements of means, increase the sanction for false declarations and allow the board to verify the means of applicants and to prosecute cases of abuse.  The board will be in a position to explore the method by which legal services are delivered.  I am in consultation with the Attorney General with a view to making as many changes as possible in the system of criminal legal aid, consistent with the requirements of the Constitution.  The details of my final proposals will be announced by way of the publication of at least the heads of the Bill in the near future.</P>
        <P>The transfer to the board of responsibility for criminal legal aid should not result in any additional cost to the Exchequer.  Moreover, the overall effect of the Bill when fully implemented should result in savings.  Having regard to its very significant cost to the Exchequer, I am determined to achieve a system of criminal legal aid that is subject to more stringent checks and balances.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>Will the Minister advise us on what the calculated savings will be, as he said this will result in savings?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>We will not know until the Bill is implemented but criminal legal aid has risen exponentially over the past number of years.  It is a demand-led scheme and the Bill will put in place checks and balances relating to the granting of it under the Constitution.  There is case law relating to it showing clearly that if a person coming before the courts does not have proper means, he or she will be entitled to representations.  That was confirmed <Col N="309"/>recently in the Carmody case.  This will legislate for scenarios like the Carmody case and also put in place new systems, including one I proposed to my officials.  I understood it was not the practice of the existing criminal legal aid system for a defendant to be asked to produce a PPS number but that will be a requirement under new legislation.  That is one small changes but there are other major changes to bring it under the remit of the Legal Aid Board, which is willing to take on this work in order to have better administration of the overall scheme.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="AlanShatter"><NameTxt>Deputy Alan Shatter</NameTxt>
	<P>The Minister is aware that the current criminal legal aid scheme operates on the basis that application is made to the court, usually at District Court level.  Legal aid would be granted and the District Court judge would make a decision.  That does not involve a large bureaucracy in administering the system.</P>
        <P>Will the Minister outline how many additional employees will be required in the Legal Aid Board to administer a criminal legal aid scheme?  Has he calculated within the cost savings the likely adjournments that will take place of criminal trials while the Legal Aid Board processes criminal legal aid applications?  Is he aware of the fact that in dealing with civil litigation, particularly in the family law area, within the existing law centres there are often substantial delays before legal aid applications are processed, which result in cases being delayed in coming to final hearing in the courts?  Has the Minister factored in the cost impact of this with regard to Garda time and the delays in criminal proceedings being heard, with the possibility of individuals who are repeat offenders being on bail longer than is desirable, continuing to offend while awaiting determination of legal aid applications?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As Minister I am very conscious of the need to ensure that savings are made in this budget, which as I stated has increased exponentially despite the fact that the level of fees paid has reduced over the past two years by 8% and by a further 8%.  The bill continues to rise.  This comes back to the earlier point that there is more activity in the courts.  Under the Constitution it is the case that somebody is entitled to representation if it is shown that the person does not have means for representation.</P>
        <P>There is some disquiet in the general public for the way in which it is sometimes perceived that people are getting criminal legal aid but not entitled to it.  I do not say this in any disparaging way with regard to administration by judges but I am trying to ensure that those who require criminal legal aid from the taxpayer are deserving of it.  I suggest that the Deputy wait until the heads of the Bill are published and he will see that we are very conscious of the need to ensure it does not increase adjournments and the process will not dramatically change the system.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I was trying to reply to Deputy Shatter.  It is anticipated that a number of existing staff in my Department will be moved to the Legal Aid Board.  The board may have additional requirements contracted in but I do not anticipate a significant increase in staff because of the way in which we intend to administer the scheme through the Legal Aid Board.  We are somewhat constrained by the constitutional requirement to ensure that somebody who does not have means is represented in court.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest>   in light of the ten different community sanctions that have been imposed by the courts as part of the provisions of the Children Act 2001, if these community sanctions are available nationwide; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  </Quest>
        <QRef>[43041/10]</QRef>
      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Deputy may be aware that the ten community sanctions listed in section 115 of the Children Act 2001, as amended, include a range of measures which would normally involve a level of supervision of the young person by a probation officer.  These may include, for example, involvement of the young person&rsquo;s parents or attendance by the young person at a specified training course, residential supervision or mentoring.  They also include restriction on movement order, which is effectively a curfew overseen by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>Young persons probation, YPP, is a specialised division of the probation service with dedicated resources to work with children aged 12 to 18 who come before the courts.  It was established to implement the sections of the Children Act 2001 relating to young persons probation in conjunction with the Irish Youth Justice Service.  The young persons probation division of the probation service was extended in 2008 to provide a national service from bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Drogheda and Sligo.  This has allowed for the community sanctions to be made available nationwide.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that the imposition of any particular sanction is a matter for the courts.  YPP assists the court through making recommendations which outline the most appropriate community disposal for consideration, based on a full evaluation and risk assessment.  At a local level managers and officers liaise with the sitting Judiciary and Courts Service staff in regard to the provision of community sanctions.</P>
        <P>Information on sanctions imposed by the courts on young offenders is published each year in the annual report of the Courts Service.  These reports are available on the Courts Service website and in the Oireachtas Library.  The most recent such report is in respect of the year 2009.  Related information is also available in the probation service annual report, the most recent of which is also in respect of the year 2009.  This report is available on the probation service website and also in the Oireachtas Library.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Minister for his reply and welcome that these services have been extended nationwide.  The implementation of anti-social behaviour orders has been a complete failure, with three handed down to young people over three years.  That is one per year.  Does the Minister feel the legislation relating to such orders should be reviewed as it is a failure?  Will he give a commitment to review that legislation?</P>
      </Speaker><Col N="311"/>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">Every piece of legislation is reviewed.  If the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na brings to my attention some unease with regard to any piece of legislation we will have a look at it with the Attorney General.  In this regard, there are approximately ten community sanctions, including the community service order, day centre order, probation order, training or activity programme order, intensive supervision order, residential supervision order, a suitable person care and supervision order, a mentor family support order, a restriction of movement order &mdash; which is, in effect, a curfew &mdash; and a dual order.</P>
        <P>With regard to ASBOs, there was a discussion in the House earlier and I beg to differ with anyone who suggests that because only three orders were granted, this is in some way an indication of a lack of success.  Some 1,541 behaviour warnings have been issued by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The principle behind ASBOs is that of an incremental process in order to ensure as much as possible that children are not brought to court.  The was to prevent them going to court under a criminal sanction and the graduated approach to ASBOs is to ensure they do not end up in court under another procedure.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCarey"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Carey</NameTxt>
	<P>I accept that.  It is proper that young people would be dealt with in that way and that they would be given a chance.  Three ASBOs have been handed down.  Is it the same position with behaviour orders?  Do the courts hand them down?  How many community service orders, day care orders, day centre orders or training and activity orders have been handed down by the courts in this period?  If so, what will happen?  How will the Minister stop young people terrorising vulnerable old people in their homes?  ASBOs are not having an effect and this activity is continuing.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">To suggest that ASBO legislation is the only implement used by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to prevent people being interfered with in their homes or in regard to anti-social behaviour is not correct as there are other means.  The question put down by the Deputy in regard to the ten community sanctions clearly indicates that this is another <i>modus operandi</i> in regard to intervening with young people who commit crimes.</P>
        <P>The Courts Service annual report of 2009 states that 30 juvenile defendants were given community service, 280 received probation orders and a further 560 received non-supervised sanctions, which included fines, peace bonds and disqualification.  However, when considering the effectiveness of community sanctions, a key issue is the number of detention orders given.  In 2009, 405 defendants received a detention order compared with 537 in 2007, which shows a significant reduction in the proportion of defendants receiving a detention order.  Some 16% of juvenile defendants received a detention order in 2008 compared with 20% in 2007.  The probation and welfare service annual report of 2009 shows that a further 418 young people were given orders for probation supervision during deferment of penalty.</P>

    <Title>Bank Guarantee Scheme: Motion (Resumed)</Title>
        <P>The following motion was moved by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Martin Mansergh, on Wednesday, 17 November 2010:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">That D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann approves the terms of the draft scheme entitled Credit Institutions (Eligible Liabilities Guarantee) (Amendment) (No. 2) Scheme 2010, a copy of which draft scheme was laid before D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann on 16 November 2010.</P>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I am grateful for the opportunity to comment in regard to the extension of the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme.  This debate comes at a fundamentally important time for our country, when we are about to embark on very important discussions with the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF in an effort to resolve the ongoing difficulties in the international money markets.  In that regard, I wish the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, his colleagues in Government and the officials who represent us every success in the discussions which commence tomorrow in Dublin.</P>
        <P>We all accept that the over-riding objective is to wean the banks off the life support machine that is the State guarantee.  Unfortunately, due to the ongoing pressures in the market, it is clear that we are not in a position to take them off life support at this stage.  They are effectively unable to raise funds on the international money markets and, when they are able to, they do so at rates that are so exorbitant the impact would be that they would have to pass on very high interest rates to both personal and commercial customers in Ireland.  Clearly, that is a point of major concern.  When Bank of Ireland raised money on the international markets in recent weeks, the cost was approximately 5.5%, which is a very significant cost, and it must add its margin to that, resulting in high interest being charged to the end customer.</P>
        <P>Before I deal with the extension of the ELG scheme, I want to go back to the original guarantee decision in September 2008.  To pick up on some of the comments made at the outset of this debate in the House today, the impression was given by Fine Gael spokespeople, for example, that the Government knew there was a fundamental insolvency issue with Anglo Irish Bank.  That is not the case, as the record shows.  For example, there is the report which Merrill Lynch submitted to the Government on the eve of the Government guarantee, which was e-mailed at 6.43 p.m. on 29 September 2008 to the Secretary General of the Department of Finance, Mr. Kevin Cardiff.  On the first page of that memo, Merrill Lynch stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The liquidity issues facing Irish banks are compounded by investor concerns with regard to the high concentration of commercial property risk in their respective asset portfolios . . .  The three institutions where these liquidity issues have been most pronounced have been Irish Nationwide, Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Life &amp; Permanent . . .  It is important to stress that at present, liquidity concerns aside, all of the Irish banks are profitable and well capitalised.  However, liquidity for some could run out in days rather than weeks.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">This was the summary of Merrill Lynch, which had been commissioned by the Government and sent a summary of its work to the Government on the day before the guarantee.  Those words could not be clearer &mdash; liquidity concerns aside, its view, based on the information it <Col N="313"/>had been able to access, was that all of the banks were profitable and well capitalised.  We know now that this was not the case, and Merrill Lynch was not able to get to the bottom of the issues in the banking system, in particular in regard to Anglo Irish Bank, in the time it had to do its work.</P>
        <P>I make the point to highlight the fact it is simply incorrect to state that the advice available to the Government leading up to the guarantee at the end of September 2008 was that the Irish banks were insolvent.  This was the professional consulting firm commissioned to advise the Government and to prepare a report, and that is essentially what it found on the eve of the guarantee.  It is important we are at least honest and put forward the true position.</P>
        <P>It has also been said by earlier speakers that the guarantee was in many respects a disaster for the country, and many politicians have put forward this point of view.  It is important to reflect on what the Governor, Professor Honohan, said when he examined this issue as part of his preliminary banking report.  He stated that it was hard to argue with the view that an extensive guarantee needed to be put in place since all participants correctly believed that we faced the likely collapse of the Irish banking system within days in the absence of decisive and immediate action.  Given the hysterical state of global financial markets in those weeks, failure to avoid this outcome would have resulted in immediate and lasting damage to the economy and society.  He went on to criticise the inclusion of subordinated debt, which accounted for in excess of 3% of the total liabilities guaranteed at the end of September 2008.  That was a fair criticism which can be debated in a legitimate manner.  However, the substance of the guarantee was strongly supported by the Governor in the report he brought forward upon request by resolution of this House.</P>
        <P>The important objective which we are trying to achieve is to move eventually from a situation where the banks are completely reliant on the State guarantee and on the European Central Bank for ongoing funding requirements to a position where they can access funding on the international money markets at reasonable rates and which will not effectively cripple their ability to serve the needs of the economy here, including personal customers seeking mortgages, personal loans, the crucial small and medium-sized enterprise, SME, sector and the corporate sector generally.</P>
        <P>Some of the comments and concerns expressed in recent days regarding the security of people&rsquo;s deposits in Irish institutions are most unhelpful.  We must be crystal clear on this point.  The money people have in Irish institutions is safe at several levels through the deposit guarantee scheme, which covers up to &euro;100,000 per person in each institution.  As the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is aware, this is underpinned by the European directive.  The eligible liabilities guarantee, ELG, scheme is also in place, which we propose to extend until the end of next year.  If seeds of doubt are sown in people&rsquo;s minds about the security of their money in the Irish banks, they will simply move their money and the problems of the banks in terms of their funding and capital bases will be significantly worsened, an outcome no one wishes to see unfold.  We must reassure people that their money is safe and the passage of the motion today will help to copper-fasten this position.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Minister&rsquo;s confirmation earlier today of the amount of money which has been collected on foot of the parent guarantee and the eligible liabilities guarantee amounting to &euro;1.3 billion at the end of October.  The average fee charged under the ELG scheme is approximately ten times more then the fee charged under the original guarantee from September 2008, which is important.</P>
        <P>Important discussions will begin here tomorrow between the Government, the European Central Bank, ECB, the European Commission and the International Monetary Fund, IMF, on issues fundamental to the country&rsquo;s future.  If the outcome of those discussions is that funding is <Col N="314"/>needed for the Irish banks, then the taxpayers and citizens of the State should not be asked to take on the bill.  We have already committed up to &euro;50 billion to rescue the Irish banks and the burden of any further funding which may be extended to the Irish banks should not be put on the shoulders of this generation or any future generations of the people.  This point should be emphasised and it should form the cornerstone of the Government&rsquo;s handling of the discussions that will take place in the coming days.</P>
        <P>I welcome the statement last night from the eurogroup, which gave its full support to the efforts the Government has taken and continues to take to face up to the fiscal challenges in the country.  The group gave its full support to the achievement of a 3% deficit target by 2014, the four-year plan and the &euro;6 billion front-loading in the forthcoming budget on 7 December.  Everyone in the House agrees that we must have as much support as possible in the weeks and months ahead to resolve the outstanding issues such that we can secure proper recovery and growth in the economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">This debate on the extension of the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme should not be taking place today.  We should have a debate but the Minister for Finance should be here.  We must establish exactly the position regarding the IMF, the European Commission and the ECB.  I am unsure whether the men from Washington, Frankfurt and Brussels are coming here out of the goodness of their health or for a social call.  Deputy Michael McGrath referred to &ldquo;discussions&rdquo; but the correct term is &ldquo;negotiations&rdquo;.  The people are looking on at the moment and are very worried.  They must be given confidence regarding the security of their deposits.  The schemes are in place but the position must be explained to them in black and white to the effect that their money is secure in Irish banks.  This is a significant concern for ordinary people.</P>
        <P>This morning, the Taoiseach treated the people with contempt.  I do not say as much lightly nor do I indulge in attacking people on a personal basis.  The Taoiseach must have been living in <i>Alice in Wonderland</i> when he referred to there being no negotiations.  My understanding is that officials from the IMF, the EU and the ECB are already in Ireland.  Will the Minister of State confirm this?  Are they here on an unofficial basis at the moment?  They will be here tomorrow on official basis.  I note that this afternoon following the ECOFIN meeting, the Commissioner, Olli Rehn, stated that their focus would be on two main areas: the fiscal situation, including the four-year budgetary plan, and the banking sector.  Clearly, this is a negotiating position.  We are in a very difficult situation.  The Taoiseach must state emphatically and exactly what is taking place.  We must know who exactly is coming tomorrow although we are aware of the organisations involved.  What are their terms of reference?  What instructions have they been given?  What position will the Government take up?</P>
        <P>My concern is that we are in negotiations but the outcomes of negotiations are only as good for a participant as his or her negotiators.  The Government has neither the financial nor the moral capacity to negotiate what is best for the people.  The institutions, including the IMF, the European Commission and the European Union do not believe the figures provided by the Government or the stated losses within the Irish banking system.  Deputy Michael McGrath made an interesting observation.  I am unsure whether it is Government policy but he stated that the taxpayer should not have to take any further burden in respect of the banking sector.  My understanding of the rules of the European bailout fund is that any funds provided are provided in the first instance to the Government, which then passes them on to the banks.  Effectively, it is a case of sovereign debt taking on board bank debt.</P>
        <P>Let us reflect back on the time of the bank guarantee.  The Government spent much time justifying the grounds for the guarantee.  At the time, Professor Honohan did not agree with a <Col N="315"/>blanket guarantee.  The Government side continually refers to the fact that 3% of the liabilities are made up of subordinated debt.  How much of this figure relates to the losses of the banks?  It is already the case that we are sharing the pain with Anglo Irish Bank.  The Government side is great at rounding up figures but they must be put in context.  The Government side referred to the question of liquidity versus solvency.  These were the two principal issues at the time of the guarantee.  In the previous two years, the former chief executive of the National Treasury Management Agency, Mr. Michael Somers, stated he held concerns about placing deposits in Anglo Irish Bank.  Why?  It was because the bank was overexposed in the property market.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">4 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>If he was concerned about the NTMA&rsquo;s deposits with Anglo Irish Bank, he clearly had concerns about its solvency.  Furthermore, in documentation that was given to the Committee of Public Accounts on the lead-up to the establishment of the guarantee, the former Secretary General of the Department of Finance stated that further work should be done on the potential losses of the banks.  Losses are related to solvency, not liquidity.  It is clear that this issue existed in advance of the guarantee.  The Government did not need to bring in such a wide-ranging blanket guarantee for a two-year period.  It could have introduced a guarantee that excluded subordinated debt and, alongside that, a bank resolution scheme.</P>
        <P>When the current Financial Regulator, Matthew Elderfield, recently came before the Joint Committee on Economic Regulatory Affairs, of which I am a member, I asked him whether he believed the Irish Government should have been considering a bank resolution scheme prior to the introduction of the guarantee, and he agreed that it should have.  A resolution scheme would have allowed the Government to separate national debt from bank debt.  Instead, the Government coupled these.  They should have been separated, and the way to do that was through a bank resolution scheme, specifically in respect of Anglo Irish Bank.</P>
        <P>To compound the issue, the Government came up with NAMA, and accepted the figures from the banks.  No due diligence was carried out prior to the development of the business plan, so it was done on the basis of inaccurate information.  NAMA was supposed to stabilise the market but, in fact, it destabilised it.  It resulted in enormous holes in the banks.  Anglo Irish Bank became a lightning rod for the bond markets, which caused them to consider the fiscal situation in Ireland in greater depth and conclude that the risks were too high.  Now the three wise men &mdash; the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF &mdash; are coming to Ireland at the same time as the original three wise men made their journey, and effectively laying down the law because they do not feel the Government is sufficiently competent to deal with the situation itself.  They are protecting their interest, which is the euro.  When did the Government protect the interests of taxpayers?  We still do not know about the decision making process that took place before the introduction of the bank guarantee.  Professor Honohan&rsquo;s report stated that the records of what happened the night before were sketchy.  The Irish people are entitled to know, but they still do not know.</P>
        <P>Fine Gael will not support this motion for one simple reason.  We feel the discussion should be deferred until we have a better idea of what is happening and until the Minister for Finance can be here for a proper debate.  Then the Irish people will be able to look at us and say that this House is taking care of their interests.  At the moment, they do not believe that.  People are petrified about losing their deposits, which they need to realise are perfectly safe, and about their mortgages.  The expert group on mortgage arrears and personal debt has issued its report today, which states that it expects further losses.  There is &euro;115 billion on the banks&rsquo; mortgage books, and I have no doubt this is one of the first things the IMF will consider.  We must <Col N="316"/>decouple our banking debt from our sovereign debt.  A bank resolution scheme should be on the floor of the House today so that we can show we are being proactive.</P>
        <P>We have an incompetent Government, and I do not say that lightly.  That is not a personal accusation but a conclusion based on its policies.  The Government&rsquo;s banking policies have failed miserably.  The bank guarantee scheme was too wide and effectively coupled sovereign debt with banking debt.  The NAMA legislation was a theoretical exercise that has proven in its application to be a disaster.  In that there was no proposal to introduce a bank resolution scheme, the Taoiseach was ignoring the issue, perhaps because he does not understand it.  Such a scheme needs to be brought in with immediate effect.  We need to show leadership to the Irish people.  They deserve no less.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My final concern is that we are now in a negotiating process with the IMF, the ECB and the European Commission.  We must get a result for the Irish taxpayer, but I do not think the Government is capable of doing that.  It is part of the problem.  The European Commission has spoken about the structural problems of the banking sector.  There is a structural problem with the Government and it needs to acknowledge that fact.  The Irish people deserve no less.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The main reason I want to speak on this is that I have had numerous telephone calls over the past week or so from individual depositors with different institutions.  Because of the statements that have been made by members of certain political parties, they are afraid their deposits are not covered.  I was glad to hear Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell emphasise that deposits up to &euro;100,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="KieranODonnell"><NameTxt>Deputy Kieran O&rsquo;Donnell</NameTxt>
	<P>The Taoiseach needs to come out and say that.  He has not done so.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>It has been said numerous times by the Minister and the Taoiseach that deposits of up to &euro;100,000 are covered under the deposit guarantee scheme and that amounts higher than this are covered under the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme.  It is important to get that message out to individual depositors.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have heard a number of Opposition spokespersons say that what the Government did in 2008 was totally wrong.  It is easy to look back a couple of years and say that such and such should not have been done, but in the heat of the night the Government had to make a decision to ensure there would not be a massive run on the banking institutions, and advice was given by Merrill Lynch that there should be a guarantee scheme.  That was supported subsequently by the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, in his report to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, although he raised a question about the fact that the guarantee covered subordinated debt.  Deputy Michael McGrath mentioned that subordinated debt accounted for more than 3% of the total liability guaranteed at the time, but I think there was about &euro;5 billion or &euro;6 billion in Anglo Irish Bank, of which Anglo Irish Bank bought some back at a profit.  There is now about &euro;3 billion, and I understand negotiations are going on in that regard.  I am sure it will be bought back with a substantial haircut.  If the guarantee had not been established at the time, we would now be worse off than we are today.</P>
        <P>Members of the Labour Party have been saying we should have let Anglo Irish Bank go to the wall, but this would have cost an estimated &euro;70 billion to &euro;75 billion.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Where would we be today if we had done that?</P>
        <P>We must also remember that although the Government provided the guarantee to the banks, it was not free.  As the Minister of State said, &euro;1.3 million has been received from the banking institutions in this regard.  It is important to get that message across.</P>
        <P>In August and September of this year, &euro;10 billion in deposits left Bank of Ireland, and I do not know how much left the other institutions.  If there was no guarantee or if there was not likely to be one, I believe there would be a run on our banks, but this guarantee scheme will help to forestall that and maybe there will be no need for the guarantee in due course.</P>
        <P>As Deputy O&rsquo;Donnell said, I believe the ECB should act as a proper central bank and take full control of the Irish and other banking systems throughout Europe.  We should take that step at this stage so that the ECB could operate in the same way as the Federal Reserve in the US and the Bank of England in the UK, and decouple our economy from the banking scene.  Our economy, as is evident, is doing very well in this time of recession, with exports 10% to 12% ahead of the exports in the equivalent period last year and foreign direct investment holding very strong.  So the fundamentals in this economy are very strong and I believe they should be decoupled from the banking system.  I hope progress will be made in that regard.</P>
        <P>I listened to the contribution of Deputy Brian Hayes earlier when he said that Anglo Irish Bank was the bank that built Fianna F&aacute;il.  I think the Deputy must be suffering from some form of amnesia.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan"><NameTxt>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am so sad for the Government frontbenchers, backbenchers and Members in general because they seem to have been injected with some kind of delusionary serum that is causing them to ignore all the factors that stare them in the face.  They seem to have failed for the past three years to take any action that other governments in other jurisdictions took and got information quickly.</P>
        <P>We hear much at the moment about expert advice.  The Taoiseach, the former Taoiseach and various Government backbenchers have quoted expert advice from various quarters.  The job of Government is not to follow expert advice but to question the advice, determine the basis on which it was reached and thereafter come to a conclusion, otherwise known as a judgment call.  Having listened to and seen the expert advice, Government is supposed to act having regard to it, but not necessarily following slavishly in the same direction.</P>
        <P>It is obvious to all and sundry in this country and outside it now that information available to the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Government in general at the inception of the economic downturn should have been made available within 24 hours.  In any other country in the world that could be done, but for some reason it was not available here.  The information that should have been readily available from the lending institutions was not available.  Why did the information on the full extent of indebtedness not emerge?  As the information that was made available then was insufficient, inadequate or unsoundly based, no Opposition can now back the proposal because we do not know what the true information is.  It has taken almost three years to get the information we have got, drip by drip, bit by bit.  That is why the European institutions and our backers across Europe are concerned.  They are worried because they know it took a long time to get the necessary information out of the institutions that are receiving protection.</P>
        <P>The people will now need to carry the burden of responsibility for this lethargy that has affected Government and the financial institutions.  There is no response coming back from the banking institutions despite all the guarantees and support.  Those institutions are telling customers what they always told them, namely, that if they do not pay up the institutions will pursue them in the courts.  I can state that with authority because I have been there in the past two years on numerous occasions and we are told the same thing all the time from the same financial institutions that have received these guarantees over the past two years.  Those same financial institutions have formed an abyss into which the various supports are now being poured.  It is no wonder our European backers are asking where that money is going and whether we have found the bottom of that pit yet.  It would appear that we do not know.  The European institutions are taking a wise decision now by asking questions.</P>
        <P>I was looking at a list of questions that were disallowed in this House &mdash; for very good reasons I am sure, a Cheann Comhairle.  However, the culture that has affected and afflicted this House in the past five or six years is now one of the causes of the serious problems we <Col N="319"/>face.  In other words nobody wants to answer a question directly or take responsibility.  The same has applied to this crisis; nobody wishes to own up and take responsibility in respect of action other than the ever-unfortunate taxpayer.  The innocent victims are the taxpayers, those who are born and those who are not yet born, those who have worked and have contributed to the economy over their working lives and are now being asked to pay once again.  Nobody knows to what extent they will need to pay.  So there are serious questions about the credibility of what we are running here.</P>
        <P>Germany is often singled out as a country that seems to be dictating the pace.  In 1991 the German people took on enormous extra responsibilities for which they had to pay a price as they knew and they made those sacrifices.  While it is true that interest rates were low not just in Europe, but across the globe, the German people took full advantage of that situation to reunite their country and rebuild its economy, and they came out of it with flying colours.  By the same token each other European country had the same opportunity and had the ability to avail of the same low interest rates, but they did not always put it to productive use.  The criticism has been that because of the inability of each individual member state to dictate its own interest rates, it was impossible to control the situation, which is absolutely wrong.  It was within the ambit of each member state to exercise that control by way of credit controls and restrictions &mdash; the same kinds of restrictions that apply today.  There is no good in various commentators saying that if only we had been outside the eurozone we would have survived, which is absolute rubbish.  It is about time we confronted ourselves and recognised that.  We can count ourselves very lucky at present.  If we were not within the eurozone, I wonder where we would be.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The critical issue now will be the terms of the next support package.  Given what the European institutions have already indicated to those of us who went there over the past month or six weeks to get information and the comments of Commissioners who came here to seek information, the situation is quite clear.  The issue facing the Government and people is how much any rescue plan will cost in interest.  The interest rate to be applied is the critical issue.</P>
        <P>Everybody knows there was a worldwide recession but we still have Ireland&rsquo;s recession, which was created by ourselves in pursuing recklessness and stupidity.  We are told officials and technicians are conducting the negotiations, with Ministers conducting them from time to time.  I honestly do not know who is conducting them but it is very important that recognition be given to a simple fact, namely, whenever a company, household, business or country is in financial difficulty, the rescue package that has a huge interest or penalty burden will not succeed.  The danger is that there will be default.  Should that occur, a worse situation will emerge.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Members of the House have often commented on the seriousness of the recession of the 1930s.  Even the former US President Roosevelt, who was no slouch in this business, repeatedly spent time addressing the issue encouraging and cajoling people and sometimes  threatening them, but at all times bringing the people with him.  That is the next most important political issue.  The serious issue affecting people in this country, and many people have been bashed, kicked about, scared and worried by the system, is the degree to which they can rely on authoritative support and leadership.  Whether that emerges remains to be seen.  I am not certain it will emerge from the Government side of the House.  It is very important because otherwise the people are in danger of becoming totally depressed and worse things can happen in that type of situation.</P>
        <P>I hope those involved in the negotiations know what they are doing.  I hope they do not focus solely on one aspect of the situation or rely on spin.  Spin has become the order of the day but substance and performance are what we seek now.  The time for spin is gone; spin is for when <Col N="320"/>one is losing and we have been losing for long enough.  I hope the Government knows what it is doing now, although its performance to date has not shown that it does.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>Under the terms of the banks bailout Act of 2008 the Minister is required to get the approval of the D&aacute;il to amend the eligible liabilities guarantee.  He is also required to get the approval of the European Commission, and he is required to do so every six months.  This particular approval is to continue to guarantee an aggregate figure of &euro;147 billion.  It is not clear why the Minister seeks approval to the end of 2011 when he only has EU approval to the end of June 2011, unless it is to avoid coming back to the House before the summer recess.</P>
        <P>We are in such chaos with the banks because the Minister&rsquo;s 2008 unimaginably costly bailout did not work.  Now we are embarked on a further bailout.  How many bailouts can there be?  Is this the last?  Whatever emerges from the discussions with the IMF, the talks had better ensure that this is the last bailout, unless the Government is going to permit the banks to cannibalise the State.  The Government has one last shot at this and it had better get it right this time.  Unfortunately and tragically for our citizens, the track record could scarcely be more dispiriting.</P>
        <P>The Government has been found wanting at every stage.  It failed to supervise the regulation of the banks, to intervene as the credit bubble inflated or to act when alerted by the failure of Northern Rock.  It failed to use the period between the collapse of Northern Rock and 28 September of the following year and to enact a bank resolution Act.  This leaves the State virtually helpless in the face of the ongoing malfunctioning of a reckless and dysfunctional banking system.</P>
        <P>A great deal has been said in this debate that does not particularly relate to this statutory instrument.  That is scarcely surprising in the climate in which we find ourselves this afternoon.  The instrument is essentially about enabling the Commission to tighten up its supervision of the scheme, for example, the six month review now has the phrase &ldquo;or shorter&rdquo; in brackets after it.  In other words, the Commission is moving to get the matter under control.</P>
        <P>It is clear now that the State bit off more than it could chew with the blanket guarantee.  I have heard the arguments from both sides of the House, and I have heard the misrepresentation of the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Patrick Honohan.  When in trouble, the Government side tends to quote the Governor as having given his blessing to a blanket guarantee.  He did not do that at all.  It is true that the Governor concluded, when talking about the night of 28 September 2008, that a guarantee was necessary, but he did not say it should be a guarantee such as the one drawn up by the Government.  It appears that the Government took the view that the State was big enough to take on the markets in terms of a guarantee that, if invoked, would bankrupt the country.  It now appears that the markets have been proven right.  Unfortunately, we are not big enough to take on a guarantee of &euro;440 billion and to suffer a dysfunctional banking system.  As a result, we are where we are.</P>
        <P>I must give credit to the Minister for Finance who, like King Canute, is somewhere on the mainland presenting this as Ireland coming to the rescue of Europe.  One must hand it to the man; he is immensely skilled in that area.  However, it is surreal to present our situation as Ireland somehow coming to the rescue of Europe.  Of course, that is not what is happening.  Consider the remarks of the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh.  He said: &ldquo;Yesterday&rsquo;s euro group statement on Ireland welcomed the measures taken to date by Ireland to deal with issues in its banking sector, including the bank guarantee, which the euro group affirms have helped to support the Irish banking sector at a time of great dislocation&rdquo;.  It really is a tribute to whoever writes these scripts.  Here is Ireland with the heels of our partners in the European <Col N="321"/>Union on its neck because of our reckless profligacy in the past, and the Minister comes into the House with a script saying that the euro group welcomed us and the measures we have taken.  The euro group did not do anything of the kind.  If the Minister of State is not happy with me saying that I will quote what Professor Honohan said, given that he is so fond of quoting him.  He said:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">No other country had introduced a blanket, system-wide, guarantee, though this had been a relatively frequent tool in previous systemic crises.  As such, the Irish guarantee caused considerable waves, upped the ante for other governments struggling to maintain confidence in their own banking systems and placed some direct competitive funding pressure on banks in the UK where the liquidity position of some of the leading banks was much more critical than was known to the Irish authorities at the time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk"><NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
	<P>Perhaps the Deputy could advise the House of the reference.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte"><NameTxt>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</NameTxt>
	<P>The reference is the Honohan report, paragraph 8.38, page 127-8.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State told us today that the euro group is delighted with the moves we took.  It was horrified at the time and the Minister of State and the Government ploughed ahead.  It may have been the case that on that fateful night the Minister and Taoiseach did not have the expertise available to them.  We have all learned a bit about banking since then.  However, whereas some of us can be excused for our level of ignorance before 28 September one can scarcely excuse the people who were supposed to be available to advise the Minister.  Some &euro;7.2 million was paid to Merrill Lynch for advice immediately before 28 September.  It got a number of things wrong, presumably because it was relying on what the regulator and other sages told it, but its advice on a blanket guarantee was not wrong.</P>
        <P>It pointed out the grave implications it would have for the creditworthiness of this State and made that very plain.  Paragraph 8.39 of the Governor&rsquo;s report states, &ldquo;The scope of the Irish guarantee was exceptionally broad&rdquo;.  A serving Governor of the Central Bank could scarcely be more blunt than that.  It also states,</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">Not only did it cover all deposits including corporate and even interbank deposits, as well as certain asset-backed bonds and senior debt, it also included certain subordinated debt.  The inclusion of existing long-term bonds and some subordinated debt was not necessary in order to protect the immediate liquidity position.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Could he have been any clearer than that?</P>
        <P>I ask the Ceann Comhairle to permit me to draw attention to what I understand to be driving this, namely, the changes that the ECB has made in terms of its supervision.  Under the heading &ldquo;Risk Control Measures&rdquo; on its website it states, &ldquo;Such exclusion may also be applied to specific counterparties, in particular if the credit quality of the counterparties appears to exhibit a high correlation with the credit quality of the collateral submitted by the counterparty.&rdquo;  What that means in English, as I understand it, is that the ECB was no longer satisfied with applications coming from the banks in this country if the collateral was not up to scratch.</P>
        <P>It has said it is no longer prepared to accept collateral in the form of NAMA bonds and that they are effectively the Irish State, and therefore regards this as one whole.  The bank debt is on top of the State debt.  Therefore, the ECB called a halt and the Irish Central Bank had to come to the rescue, providing more than &euro;20 billion in liquidity to the Irish banks and had to go to Merrion Street to underwrite that.  The question is with what was Merrion Street underwriting it.  That is why we are under pressure.  The ECB has had enough of this and is telling us to clean up the mess but the Minister of State came into the House and presented it as some <Col N="322"/>kind of pat on the back for us from Europe when the opposite is the case.  It is an absolute tragedy that we have been plunged into this situation.  Fianna F&aacute;il, which is an honourable party in so many ways, has sold out our economic sovereignty by its reckless mismanagement of the economy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>One of the things which stuck in my mind about the period in late September 2008 was the Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies and Ministers who asked others to look at what they had done and said they had saved the whole system and that other jurisdictions would copy structures it put in place.  We have found out that was incorrect.  To follow on from Deputy Rabbitte, in June 2007 when I was elected to the House, the national debt was &euro;35 billion.  At the end of this year, according to the NTMA review in July 2010, the expectation is that it will be &euro;95 billion, made up primarily of the collapse in taxation and running a deficit of approximately &euro;20 billion, which would lead the &euro;35 billion to increase to &euro;95 billion.</P>
        <P>In that same period the State accepted the liability and converted what was a capitalist liability into national sovereign debt of another &euro;50 billion.  On top of that there will be a transfer of loans from Irish banks to NAMA and a significant haircut will be applied to the &euro;81 billion worth of loans.  The haircut has been greater than anticipated but it is somewhat relevant because while the amount of the haircut may be reduced the equivalent amount has to be increased capitalisation.  That sets the scene.  The rating agencies gave no valuation of the assets which is a little unfair.  The total sum involved is in the region of &euro;40 billion.</P>
        <P>The Irish banks have no liquidity and we have no source of credit.  That is the long and the short of it.  Not alone have we no source of credit but the European Central Bank has said, &ldquo;Stop&rdquo; and wants its money back because it is terrified that 1% of the population which holds 25% of the European Central Bank&rsquo;s emergency liquidity is bordering on being reckless.  They are not satisfied that this can be allowed to continue. I could not disagree with it.  What do we do about it?  There is only one option, namely, to call upon others to help us out in our time of need.</P>
        <P>As a first time Deputy in this House, I find there is a most appalling lack of honesty with the people of this country who will end up picking up the tab.  Where was the honesty on Sunday and Monday when Minister after Minister said no negotiations were taking place?  We then got clarification to the effect that nothing was happening here regarding the national sovereign debt of &euro;95 billion.  However, negotiations were taking place on the underwriting of the Irish banks which are, as we know now, mostly owned by the State.  We can try and fool the people or we can be honest.  There is no honesty any more from the Government side of the House.</P>
        <P>Some people may say that the Government did not know about the impending crisis, but it was told.  Early in 2009, the economist Peter Bacon told the Government that the size of the banks&rsquo; debt was approximately &euro;150 billion.  He also told the Government that there was no way out of it because that sum of money would be coming down the tracks at some future stage.  The Minister for Finance told us that this would be the cheapest bank bailout in the world.  Not alone has it not turned out to be cheap, but it has also brought this nation to the brink of bankruptcy.  In addition, it has brought the euro currency to the brink, thus setting the scene for other countries to be attacked, in the way that George Soros attacked currencies in the early 1990s.</P>
        <P>When Commissioner Rehn visited here last week he said the authorities here do not accept what is happening and that a reality check was needed.  When he went back to Europe after saying all the right things that is required of a former finance Minister in a delicate position, <Col N="323"/>he said that the lack of realisation of what is happening cannot be allowed to continue.  It is now recognised that in the conditions required for the Irish banks there will be a default on the subordinated bondholders because Irish taxpayers are not capable of paying.  How much more can we bleed the taxpayers of this country?  Not very much.</P>
        <P>The representatives of the European Stabilisation Fund and the IMF are coming here.  We have had sacred cows for far too long in our society and in politics.  In the 1920s, Ernest Blythe took a shilling off pensioners and Fianna F&aacute;il spent the next 80 years telling everybody that Fine Gael had reduced the old age pension.  The IMF and the ESF, however, will not be concerned about those sacred cows.  They will slaughter them and will then move on to the next sacred cow.  The State finds itself in that position because of what Fianna F&aacute;il did for electoral gain.  It sold out and gave money away.  The Charlie McCreevy mentality was, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll spend it while we have it&rdquo;, but by God we do not have it anymore.  Not alone did he spend the current generation&rsquo;s wealth, he also borrowed and mortgaged their children&rsquo;s future.</P>
        <P>What do we do now?  Are we to slaughter other sacred cows?  Do we get rid of AIB and the Bank of Ireland?  Will we give them away for nothing, together with their liabilities?  For so long we heard about the country&rsquo;s pride in its powerful banks, but they were built on nothing.  They were built on a falsity and were allowed to do whatever they wanted by the former Financial Regulator who was not in a position to do anything because he was only a puppet of the State.  There was no separation of powers involved.</P>
        <P>Last night, I watched the BBC world news reportage of the EcoFin meeting.  It was not lost on me when the Dutch Finance Minister said there would be no grey areas in this respect.  He said they would not be allowed to pretend that this is only a bank bailout.  This is also a sovereign debt bailout.  There will be one bailout and they will not be coming back here in two years&rsquo; time.  What will happen will be obligatory and the people in this House will have to get on with it and carry the can.</P>
        <P>Fianna F&aacute;il crashed the economy and abandoned our financial and fiscal independence for its own electoral gain.  It is ironic, however, that the British Chancellor of the Exchequer says he will pony up funds to underwrite the Irish economy.  I do not know if Fianna F&aacute;il Deputies really accept what they have done to this country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputies for their contributions on this important motion.  It is a Government motion, not a Fianna F&aacute;il one.  The Government comprises more than Fianna F&aacute;il members.  There will be many other opportunities in the near future to talk about wider issues concerning both the past and future.  We are debating the extension of an existing scheme, not a new one.</P>
        <P>More than ever before, this is a time for realism and an objective assessment of the situation.  As stated by the Taoiseach earlier today on the Order of Business, the necessity for the bank guarantee arrangements was compelling.  As the Minister for Finance stated at the time the scheme was extended at end-year on 29 September 2008, had that guarantee not been introduced we would scarcely have an economy today, never mind a banking system.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some reference was made to the misgivings of the former head of the NTMA, Dr. Somers.  As he has admitted himself, however, he did not pass that on, or certainly not at a political level.  Some of the criticisms suggest that the Government should have taken in the whole situation and all the future consequences on or before the end of September 2008.  The Government was not able to foresee all that has developed since, but at all times it has acted in good faith.  The entire banking system faced collapse at that time and funding for our banking system has all but dried up.  In other words, there was a liquidity issue at least in the short term and the banks faced closure within days.  This is starkly illustrated in the report by the Governor of <Col N="324"/>the Central Bank, Professor Honohan.  In the first chapter of the report, referring to the discussions that took place on the night of 29 September 2008 &mdash; he was not Governor of the Central Bank at that time &mdash; Professor Honohan stated:</P>
        <P LI="1" el="5">It is hard to argue with the view that an extensive guarantee needed to be put in place since all participants rightly felt that they faced the likely collapse of the Irish banking system within days in the absence of decisive, immediate action.  Given the hysterical state of global financial markets in those weeks, failure to avoid this outcome would have resulted in immediate and lasting damage to the economy and society and there would have been additional lost income and employment surely amounting, if it could be quantified, to tens of billions of euros.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Unfortunately, some commentators have chosen to ignore Professor Honohan&rsquo;s conclusion entirely.  They have obscured and confused it in the public&rsquo;s mind by relying on criticisms the Governor made to the scope of the guarantee &mdash; for example, the inclusion of dated subordinated debt.  The Minister for Finance has responded to and addressed these points on many occasions.  Even in today&rsquo;s conditions, we see the treatment of subordinated bondholders is still capable of causing some turbulence, as I think one speaker accepted by implication.</P>
        <P Just="Left">There have been blanket guarantees in the past, notably in Sweden, which is often regarded as a template for dealing with a banking crisis.  That country provided a blanket guarantee in the 1990s.  It could be argued that we were exceptionally vulnerable in the situation that had developed.  A comprehensive guarantee of bank liabilities was an established part of the standard tool-kit for responding to systemic banking crises internationally, and it continues to be so today.  As I have said, other countries such as Sweden in the 1990s and Denmark in the current crisis, have introduced extensive guarantees of bank liabilities.  The UK authorities provided a broad guarantee to existing senior bondholders in Northern Rock.  Guarantees are a facet of the response of EU member states to the ongoing financial crisis.  Ireland has not been alone in providing a guarantee to underpin the funding position of its banking system.  We were the first to introduce a guarantee but we were quickly followed by other EU member states.  Recent figures from the European Commission suggest that since the onset of the crisis in 2008, under state aid rules the Commission authorised some &euro;3.6 trillion in guarantees.  In total, some 21 guarantee schemes were approved by the Commission and 12 of them remain in force today.  The latest figures indicating some &euro;147 billion of liabilities are guaranteed under the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme, which equates to 4% of the amount authorised by the Commission.  Member states implementing guarantee schemes include Austria, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal and Poland.  Commissioner Almunia, the Vice-President of the European Commission who is responsible for competition policy, indicated in a speech earlier this month that his current idea is to extend the European Union&rsquo;s financial crisis regime, which will include national guarantee arrangements, until the end of 2011.</P>
        <P>We must understand the distinction between what was necessary to stabilise the situation and what is sufficient.  The steps taken from September 2008 were certainly necessary.  To date, that has not been sufficient to provide normalisation of the banking system, far from it.  However, it does not follow that because of the lack of sufficiency, all or many of the earlier measures were not necessary.</P>
        <P>Along with the eurozone as a whole, Ireland remains in stormy financial waters.  The prolongation of the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme is a key element of the Government&rsquo;s response to the broader systemic challenges facing the banking system.  I reiterate the State&rsquo;s commitment to safeguard the interests of depositors in Irish banks.  The objective is shared by <Col N="325"/>the eurogroup and supported by the European Commission, the ECB and all authorities with an interest in continuing to maintain the stability of the Irish banking system.  In that regard the European Central Bank continues to meet the liquidity requirements of the banking system.  This scheme guarantees the security of all deposits in the participating institutions, along with that of other bank liabilities guaranteed under it.  The scheme complements the protection afforded to all deposits up to &euro;100,000 under the permanent deposit guarantee scheme, which has no expiry date.  As the Taoiseach stated yesterday, the protection of depositors remains one of the overarching priorities of the Government in responding to the difficulties in the Irish banking system.</P>
        <P>In response to Deputy Brian Hayes, the urgency of approving the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme and providing certainty about its extension should be evident to all.  Failure by the House to approve the scheme would exacerbate uncertainty regarding the future funding of Ireland&rsquo;s banking system.  At this time of market turbulence, a decision now on the extension of the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme is not only necessary, but also a responsible action for the State to take to underpin the funding position of the institutions.  Delay would only fuel uncertainty and weaken the banking system.  In addition to the eurogroup statement, I draw attention to the European Commission state aid approval and endorsement of the guarantee by the ECB on financial stability grounds.</P>
        <P>Deputy Brian Hayes, Deputy Burton and possibly others raised the question of a bank resolution regime.  The Minister for Finance recently indicated in the House that he was examining options for the introduction of a legislative regime to deal in a systematic way with distressed financial institutions to ensure the State has a range of tools to address problem institutions effectively in the interests of maintaining financial stability, minimising reliance on public money and ensuring continuity of key banking activities.  In view of the central role performed by central banks in resolution frameworks for financial institutions, the Department is consulting with the Central Bank to develop the necessary legislative proposals.  The Minister expects this process will lead to the introduction of an appropriate legislative framework for bank restructuring in line with what the House wishes to see.</P>
        <P>Several Deputies raised the involvement of outside parties.  The Irish Government has expressed its determination to work with its EU colleagues and specifically to work with the ECB, the Commission and the IMF to address these market turbulences, to see where there are credit risks to Ireland in the market and how they can be addressed.  Talks will begin at official level in Dublin this week, with a delegation from the IMF, the European Commission and the European Central Bank on the possible use of EU and IMF funding to deal with the banking crisis.  I welcome the statement by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer.  In 90 years of independence I do not believe there has been such a statement made of the degree to which the British economy depends on the Irish market.</P>

It is important that structural problems identified in the market reactions are addressed in a systematic manner.  That is what this intensification of engagement is about.</P>
        <P>Regarding Deputy Burton&rsquo;s request for more up-to-date figures, it takes some time for end of month figures to be finalised.  That work is ongoing by the banks and the Central Bank.

    <Title>Local Government (Mayor and Regional Authority of Dublin) Bill 2010: Second Stage (Resumed)</Title>
        <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Deputy Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>I will be taking the rest of Deputy Tom Hayes&rsquo;s slot.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Deputy Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>This Bill has been a damp squib since its publication.  As a former lord mayor of Cork city, I have been a supporter of the provision of an elected office of lord mayor for the city of Dublin.  I suggested that this provision be extended to other cities because it is a valuable proposal.  We were told it would be similar to the strong mayoral offices in London and Barcelona.  In New York, for example, we saw how well former mayor Rudy Giuliani performed following the terrorist attack of 9 September 2001.</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">5 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>However, the Bill is a damp squib.  It offers nothing of ambition for the proposed office.  Indeed, the D&aacute;il&rsquo;s timing in debating the creation of the position of a directly elected mayor is bizarre and out of kilter with ongoing events, given the financial situation.  I am sure people are watching us and wondering whether we have anything better to do than to discuss such a proposal at a time when the country&rsquo;s economic affairs are in dire straits.  Our nation has triggered a crisis across the eurozone and our banking policy is seen to be in tatters.  Businesses throughout the country are under severe pressure and businesses in Dublin are closing daily.  Many operators are wondering from where they will get funding to keep going and pay staff and commercial rates, which are an excessive demand from local authorities, yet an office like this is being loaded onto them.  It will need to be paid for by increases in taxation or in charges on businesses or households.</P>
        <P>The powers of the mayor will be limited under the Bill.  We were promised the mayor would have power over day-to-day transport operations and water services, yet this is not the case. <Col N="329"/> We need complete electoral reform in this country, for both Houses of the Oireachtas and as regards local authority structures.  An office such as this could be described as another quango and is just another layer of consultation that will have no power.  It is useless and is not what is needed at this time.</P>
        <P>The Bill proposes an election in 2011, six or seven months from now, which is out of synch with local authority elections which are not due again for another three and a half years.  It would have been sensible to have held the election for mayor at the same time as the local and European elections.  The proposal to have an election for this office within the next year does not make sense.  The fact of establishing new bureaucracies and layers of consultation will not go down well with the electorate.  People will wonder whether we have anything better to do.</P>
        <P>The funding of this new office is also being questioned.  I am speaking to councillors in both Cork city and county at the moment who are in consultation with their managers as regards the Estimates, and find themselves in a very difficult situation.  They have to consider whether there will be a forced reduction in the commercial rates being collected by their local authorities, for example.  I have heard the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley both indicating there would be good news for businesses with regard to reductions in commercial rates in the forthcoming budget.  Therefore, local authorities are having to plan on that basis.</P>
        <P>The local authorities in Dublin have had to build into their plans the possibility that they might have to fund the office of mayor in the coming year.  The issue of costing has been raised but it is not very clear.  Fingal County Council estimates that it could cost &euro;10 million the first year and &euro;8 million in subsequent years.  I believe Deputy Gogarty indicated it could cost up to &euro;5 million for one local authority alone, in Dublin, and we are dealing with four.  The cost will ultimately be borne by businesses because the local government contribution to local authorities is, if anything, reducing.  It will not be increased to accommodate this office.  Therefore, the costing does not make sense at this time.</P>
        <P>One of the areas within which a mayor can normally operate is in directing transport policy.  We have seen this in London with regard to the underground and congestion charges.  Deputies were under the impression that this office was to have a major role in directing transport for Dublin but from the contents of the legislation it seems to go far short of what was promised.  We thought the mayor would chair the Dublin Transport Authority but that has been replaced by the National Transport Authority.</P>
        <P>The Bill seems to be struggling to find a role that the mayor can play with regard to Dublin transport policy.  I should have expected that such an office would have a stronger role and be able to intervene in the operations of bus and rail services in the capital.  The office should have a role to play in the cost of public transport fares, to encourage the public to use this method of travel rather than depending on cars.  It should have a strong role to play on the issue of taxi ranks and how they operate and also on the question of congestion charges.  However, the proposals in the Bill fly in the face of all the promises that were made on transforming the transport infrastructure of Dublin city and the greater Dublin area.</P>
        <P>The Bill is a damp squib in terms of the powers and opportunities that might have been allocated to an office such as that of mayor in terms of playing a leading role in the development of transport policies for the greater Dublin area.  The powers are limited and the mayor will only have an opportunity to oversee the preparation of the transport strategy for the greater Dublin area.  The National Transport Authority will prepare a draft transport strategy directed by the council and then submit this to the local authority for approval.  The Minister for Transport will still have the power to issue any directives in regard to Dublin transport policy. <Col N="330"/> That is the way it was before publication of this Bill, and sadly, that is how it will be after its enactment.</P>
        <P>Once the transport plans are set the council can only monitor their implementation.  Again, the opportunity that existed to give somebody a leading role in the development of transport in the capital has been missed.  Transport in Dublin is very important, particularly in the greater Dublin area, if we are to make the city a leading European capital, to which people want to come and do business, a place where citizens can live in relative comfort, knowing they can get easy access to its facilities whether by bus, rail, DART or Luas.  In this projection, people could fly into Dublin Airport and have ready access to the city centre and use any of the main rail stations to get access to and from the regions.  There was an opportunity for the office of mayor to play a strong role in this regard, in keeping the city moving.  However, perhaps the Minister did not have sufficient confidence in any of the individuals who proposed to put themselves forward for the position.  Now, what we have is a totally missed opportunity and we are left merely with a mayor who will preside over yet another quango and rubber stamp proposals from the council.</P>
        <P>The other area of concern is planning.  Again, there is no change in terms of planning.  The regional authorities of Dublin and the mid-east regional authority will continue to make the planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area.  The balance of power in regard to planning will remain with the regional authorities and the Minister, not with the mayor.  The mayor will have the power to initiate the regional planning guidelines but this is merely a consultative role in terms of giving public notice and inviting written submissions.  This covers the provision &ldquo;to consider all submissions&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>This power is similar to the powers that exist for members of local authorities in terms of the chairing roles in such bodies.  However, there is no fundamental change in terms of planning, no opportunity for somebody with ambition in the office of mayor to prepare a draft manifesto spelling out how he or she believes the city can operate in terms of planning, improved transport, waste policy, water policy, etc.   There is no opportunity whatsoever for an individual to put his or her stamp on it.  What we wanted from this legislation was a mayor with strong ambition for the city, a person who would put his or her manifesto to the people, get their approval and therefore have the authority to implement that manifesto.  However, that is not what we got.  What we have is more of the same old rubber stamping, overseeing and opportunities to initiate consultation.  The power remains where it lay before publication of this Bill and where it will be when it is enacted.  This legislation is merely the Government pushing a Bill through the Houses attempting to establish the office of mayor of Dublin.  It is in fact only establishing another quango with little power, adding to the expense of running the city and these authorities.</P>

	<P>I do not know where to start.  There has been so much misinformation thrown around in the contributions of some Opposition Deputies that one could spend hours refuting them.</P>
        <P>I will start with the context of this debate and when it is being held.  The legislation took longer than expected to draft.  Whereas normally one person would allocate half his or her time to drafting legislation, two people were assigned to drafting this Bill.  In setting out the roles and functions of the mayor, one must also set out the specifics in terms of how the mayoral election will be held.  As a result, the legislation was delayed.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Even at this time of economic uncertainty, it is not wise to pooh-pooh a progressive idea.  This is the first phase of a radical transformation in terms of how local government carries out <Col N="331"/>its functions.  During the next couple of years we will, as agreed in the renewed programme for Government, see far-reaching reforms in this area.  The easiest and therefore first item on the reform agenda was the Dublin mayor because there is already <i>in situ</i> a Dublin regional authority.  The White Paper on local government, when released, will set out the other half of the equation in terms of the potential to elect mayors for a five year term in each of the local authority areas and to make the local authorities more powerful by subsuming their power upwards where practical to create regional authorities as opposed to little town councils.  Town councils as they currently stand will become district councils.  The hope is that real decisions will be made about areas and that we will no longer have a system which is the legacy of the British Empire.  We wanted a new way of looking at local government and this is part of our response in that regard.</P>
        <P>I was unable to participate in the debate earlier on the economic situation we are in.  However, let us be blunt.  There are speculators who are trying to bring Ireland down, following which they will move on to other European countries.  In that context, the Government is fighting an action to protect our sovereignty and to stand up for us.  We do not need a bailout.  Reference has been made in the news to a banking bailout under the cover of a broader bailout.  We do not want a bailout.  We do not want to take the medicine and we should not, therefore, be prescribed conditions.  That is the battle we face.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have full confidence in the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, doing his best on behalf of the country.  I believe we should all stand together on this issue.  However, the fact that our economic sovereignty is under threat does not mean we cannot examine other areas.  I attended a committee last week which discussed the vision for the arts and how arts could benefit the country.  I referred at that committee meeting to the Wexford Opera Festival which was started from scratch in the 1950s.  It is now an internationally renounced festival which brings jobs to the south-east region and tourists to Ireland.  The Wexford Opera was started at a time when Ireland was a semi-medieval country with no facilities of which to speak, a time when people thought bigger and had vision.  This is what we are speaking of in the context of this legislation.  We might be in the economic mire but that does not mean we must all wallow in it and paint all the bad news stories.  I accept the situation is tough.</P>
        <P>I recently said on radio &mdash; I make no apologies for this &mdash; that people need to be afraid.  It is only when presented with a reality check that one realises the tough situation one is in.  I also said on that occasion that there is light at the end of the tunnel.  That light is in part us having faith in ourselves as a people to get out of the mess we are in.  I believe the right type of Dublin mayor can assist Dubliners in creating jobs and bringing tourism and investment to the country.  This legislation is about looking beyond the current economic recession.  It is about looking to the future and being bold, decisive and brave about it.  We should not wait until 2014 to do this.  We should plan it now because it might not be until 2014 that the real positive benefits of this position <i>in situ</i> will be achieved.  Whoever is the mayor of Dublin at that time will ride on the crest of the wave of progress made.</P>
        <P Just="Left">This legislation does not hamper someone with the right mindset, vision, tools and ability to communicate and interact with people making Dublin a better place.  The reasons for this are clear.  This mayoralty is about bringing the power in terms of how Dublin is operated back to the people.  We currently have four Dublin city and county authorities.  These were set up under the British system.  Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown and South Dublin-Fingal were split from the former Dublin County Council into individual entities not because of any vision for great progress in local authority, but because of the corruption that was going on, the dodgy deals done in Conways and the type of people who attacked former Green Party leader, Deputy Sargent, and waved a cheque in front of him.  That is the type of bull that was going on in our <Col N="332"/>county.  The authorities were split up because it was believed doing so would make them more manageable.  Since that split, we have seen the same rezoning frenzies from, in particular, the two largest parties.  We have had the same politicians happy to take money from developers and happy to have pro-development policies.  While there is nothing wrong with pro-development policies, if one is taking money the question, &ldquo;Why did you take it?&rdquo;, will always be asked.</P>
        <P>A Fine Gael councillor in my area was given &pound;1,000 for supporting the rezoning of a piece of land in Lucan.  The councillor said she supported the rezoning of that land and that the fact that she took &pound;1,000 from the developer had nothing to do with it.</P>

	<P>I did not mention a name.</P>
        <P>The point I am making is that if there is in place a directly elected Dublin mayor, allowing for the fact that it is incompetence or stupidity rather than corruption leads to the rezoning of ghost estates around Dublin, he or she, if worth their own salt, might be able to question the reason housing estates or retail parks are being built in, say, Fingal, where they are not needed, rather than in Dun Laoghaire where they are needed, or <i>vice versa</i>.  One must have strategic vision in terms of the type of proper planning that has not happened in Dublin for a long time.  In that context, the mayor can impact in a positive way on the city and county.</P>
        <P>As far as I can see the Green Party is the only party that is trying to engage with the public on this issue.  It is doing so through the <i>www.Mayor4Dublin.ie </i>website and by distributing leaflets around the city and hubs.  The other parties appear to be rubbishing the idea and saying it will cost more money.</P>

	<P>So be it.  Let us all get behind it.  Do not be afraid to do so.  It has been stated that other issues are more important.  Earlier this summer, Deputy Broughan had the balls and courage not to support the flip-flop policies of his party leader on the issue of animal rights.</P>

      <Speaker pid="CyprianBrady"><TitleTxt>Acting Chairman</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Cyprian Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I ask Deputy Gogarty to refrain from using unparliamentary language.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>Deputy Broughan did not on that occasion suggest that because the economy is in tatters we could not talk about animal rights, civil partnership or child abuse.  We can talk about everything in this House.  This is the forum where issues can be discussed.  Just because we are overshadowed by a pressing fiscal crisis does not mean we cannot talk about other issues, including issues of vision that can get us out of the mess we are in.  I make no apologies for doing so.</P><Col N="333"/>
        <P>Let us address some of the issues.  Fine Gael used the Fingal example saying this will cost &euro;8 million.  That report was discredited and Fingal County Council, FCC, admitted this.  It then tried to drive a wedge between my party leader and myself.  Deputy Gormley said it would not cost anything and I mentioned a cost of &euro;5 million.  I was referring to the running cost of an office, staff and so on.  Most of the 30 employees will come from within the existing staff complement and, therefore, the cost will be much lower.  The Dublin Regional Authority has offices in Swords and even if it relocates and the offices are sold, the cost will still not be great.  The authority has staff and under this legislation, it will become a more powerful authority with 16 rather than 13 members who initially will be appointed from the constituent local authorities.  However, it is part of the vision for local government reform in the programme for Government that these regional representatives will eventually be directly elected and they will have clout working in consultation with the mayor.</P>
        <P>If the regional assembly does not set in train the strategic plan, the mayor will have the power to implement it.  That is clear in the legislation.  Currently, city and county managers are at odds with each other regarding how Dublin should be developed.  The city manager is trying to the fight the change in Government strategy on incineration and councillors from various parties are saying, &ldquo;This is terrible.  Why isn&rsquo;t Minister Gormley stopping the incinerator?&rdquo;, while knowing full well that they voted for the damn regional waste policy in the first place several years ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>Language.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>The mayor will have an opportunity to take the bull by the horns and to say this is a national strategy and we have the opportunity to get rid of an incinerator.  That would be a clear power.</P>
        <P>Deputy Hogan asked why the Minister will not wait until 2014.  Within six months of the establishment of this new office, the mayor has to set out a strategic plan and, after two years of operation, there will be an opportunity to examine the powers, review them, see if more powers are needed and, if so, in what areas.  If one started this process in 2014 when a new constituent council is elected, it would not make sense because the office would not be up and running until halfway through the mayoral term and people would not be able to get a grip on it.  It makes much more sense when the election is held next year for the mayor to set out his or her stall and have it finely tuned in order that when the first five-year mayoral term begins in 2014, everyone will know the powers, positions and opportunities that exist.</P>
        <P>The opportunity is available to provide for proper planning.  I mentioned the issue of where development should take place or where Dublin Port should be located.  FCC proposes to move the port further up the coastline.  Does that make sense?   There was a major issue in the media recently about a retail park in D&uacute;n Laoghaire.  Was that a good decision?  Perhaps, members of South Dublin County Council, SDCC, or FCC want to put a conference centre on some of Jim Mansfield&rsquo;s land.  A mayor would consider all these issues and recognise that the hub of software development is in the digital hub in the city centre but our pharmaceuticals expertise is in south Dublin.  Our greatest tourism potential is in south Dublin and D&uacute;n Laoghaire, our market gardening centre is in Fingal and there are cultural and heritage sites throughout the county.  How do we strategically manage them?  If four councils are competing against each other, that means additional costs.</P>
        <P>Having clarified the issue of the running costs of the mayor&rsquo;s office, I refer to the opportunities for savings.  The McLoughlin report on local government estimated that up to &euro;40 million could be saved through greater efficiencies in this sector.  In the context of the current public service debate, it is not unfair to say that may involve a number of job losses but, <Col N="334"/>crucially, it will create an opportunity to deploy staff where they are best needed rather than each council having a set complement.  A mayor could oversee that in consultation with county managers and the regional authority and move staff around.  For example, SDCC, of which I am a former member, has six litter wardens trying to cover illegal dumping and a multitude of litter problems.  We, therefore, need more litter wardens and higher fines and we need to ensure the cost of running the service is met through fines.  The mayor could examine this in consultation with the constituent councils.  A proposal could then go to the Minister about national fines for littering.  It could well be that there are too many employees and, in that context, some would have to be redeployed or lose out in the current economic climate.  That is where the mayor could save money.</P>
        <P>The issue of transport was mentioned.  Deputy Clune referred to the Dublin Transport Authority and National Transport Authority, NTA.  The NTA considers the national issue.  Much as we like to think it, Dublin is not an independent city state that tells the rest of the mullahs what to do.  That is not the way it operates.  Dublin is part of Ireland.  It may be the capital city and the commercial centre but, at the same time, transport must be planned on a national rather than a regional basis.  In that context, the mayor can never control the authority.  However, he or she will chair the Dublin transport council and will have great power.  For example, Dublin City Council manages most of the traffic operations, including motor taxation, on behalf of the other local authorities in Dublin.  With the input of the mayor, the existing powers of the city council could be expanded and issues such as congestion charges, if deemed necessary, or other specific proposals to enhance transportation within the region could be set out.  The powers may be relatively limited, as stated by other Members, by dint of the mayor not being in charge of a national body but he or she will be the only directly elected representative of that stature on the Dublin transport council and on the national body.  Representing more than 1 million citizens, he or she will have great clout and if her or she is not listened to, nobody will be listened to.</P>
        <P>The mayor could provide for greater coherence in the provision of waste and water services.  There were water shortages in parts of Palmerstown, Clondalkin and Lucan earlier this year because Dublin City Council was taking water from the SDCC area because it controls the water supply in the greater Dublin area.  In a fairer system, there would be a fairer way to allocate water throughout the city and county.  Those living in the three county council areas feel they are not considered to be part of Dublin because Dublin City Council rules the roost and controls how things go.  I hope the new mayor will ensure the county is represented in an integrated way.  An audit of sports facilities could also be beneficial in attracting international events such as the Olympics, which Deputy Mitchell has mentioned on a number of occasions.  That is something a mayor could push successfully, similar to the mayor in Barcelona.  Tourism is another area in which a coherent strategy could be employed.  Dublin has a great deal to offer other than the Molly Malone statue, Trinity College and the GPO.  Significant attractions are not being marketed properly because Dublin is not seen as an entity in its own right.</P>
        <P>This new position presents the best opportunity for job creation.  Industrial units throughout the city and county are under-utilised.  They can become centres for incubation and development of new business opportunities.  There is an opportunity through the mayor&rsquo;s office to ensure rates are maintained at a reasonable level.  This is why the proposal is supported by the business community in Dublin.  Businesses see the office as a way to make Dublin more attractive for business and creating jobs.  Industrial units could be targeted in a better fashion and used where they are vacant as art hubs.  As I indicated in the committee dealing with the arts last week, there is under-used potential in the city and county which the mayor could co-ordinate, which is the idea.</P><Col N="335"/>
        <P>The mayor will not be a panacea for the ills of the economy or Dublin but the position will not be a damp squib if the right person with the appropriate political experience and understanding of planning and other issues is involved.  The unelected county and city managers will be instructed where to go if they do not find the proper strategies by dint of the popular mandate of the mayor.  That is important.  Councillors often complain they have no power over local authorities and are overruled by managers but now is the time for a mayor to indicate to a manager how Dublin will operate.  If the manager does not like it, he or she can lump it.</P>
        <P>I hope people will continue to contribute to the mayor for Dublin website and send in ideas that can feed into legislation.  This legislation is not finished and even when the mayor is in office the Act will be reviewed after two years.  It will be a work in progress but we should have the vision to get it started now rather than pooh-poohing a good idea for political expediency.</P>

	<P>That is where we are here and now.  I poked some harmless fun at the Greens when they went into Government and I hoped it would be taken in good humour.  I quoted Groucho Marx &mdash; not Karl Marx &mdash; in saying that the Greens would not worry about &ldquo;those&rdquo; principles as they had others.

	<P>I thought I was being a little funny but by God they found other issues.  This legislation is an indulgence and trophy piece that is not required.  Deputy Gogarty spoke about people acting in ways that would be distasteful to this House, setting out conditions that would be difficult.  It would be impossible to implement those conditions because if we are to continue paying salaries to doctors, nurses, garda&iacute; and schoolteachers, we will be obliged to start in this House with reform.  Such reform will eliminate structures, perhaps even those involved in the State like the Seanad or presidency.  To bring forward legislation like this now is extravagant.</P>

	<P>It is inspired.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>I will refer to other issues.  We can talk about Deputies being out of touch.  It has been mentioned that the mayor of Dublin could be a focal point in consideration of an Olympics bid.  Olympics costs tens of millions of euro and this is a time when we face bankruptcy.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>It would create jobs.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>I do not want to be too critical of Deputy Gogarty but we in this Chamber must wake up and realise the reality facing the State.  With regard to the cost of the <Col N="336"/>mayor&rsquo;s office, we are considering paying the mayor more than the President of the United States at a time when&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Gogarty</NameTxt>
	<P>Is Fine Gael considering that?</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>&mdash;&mdash;we could be facing reduction in the old-age pensions, children&rsquo;s allowance and public sector salaries.  Those are the likely conditions that will be insisted upon by the European Stabilisation Fund, the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and others in order to ensure we continue to pay our State salaries.</P>
        <P>One aspect relating to postal voting should be considered.  We have not given enough consideration in this jurisdiction to making it more convenient for people to cast their ballots.  The Government certainly does not want to make this convenient, as we can see from the by-election to be held tomorrow week.  It is to be held on a Thursday instead of giving people the opportunity to vote on a Friday, Saturday or Sunday, when students or other people return to the constituency.  There are many opportunities to vote in the United States through postal ballots, and approximately 40% of the votes there in the mid-term elections two weeks ago were cast before election day.  If we are to go ahead with this and the Greens insist on the office being established, with Fianna F&aacute;il rolling over to facilitate this indulgence and extravagance, we should at least use the opportunity to consider a postal ballot for what is a rather irrelevant office.  We could then consider it for general elections or by-elections.  I am trying to take something positive from this but I am finding it very difficult.</P>
        <P>We touched upon how the election could potentially cost &euro;1 million and the per annum cost of the regional authority being &euro;8 million.  We have the opportunity not to spend that money.  There are approximately 900,000 people on the voting register and we should take this opportunity to tidy up.  It is a difficulty not just in Dublin but around the country and we must ensure the register is sorted out.</P>
        <P>There is the matter of reimbursement of donations.  A minimum of &euro;33,140 will be reimbursed if somebody achieves a certain percentage of the quota.  We would be giving out money from the Standards in Public Office Commission, and in these economic times paying money of that magnitude is just madness.</P>
        <P>It is ironic that we will establish a regional authority of Dublin, RAD, while dissolving the Dublin Regional Authority, DRA.  We will replace the DRA with the RAD; there is a word which comes to mind for this, which is M-A-D.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulNicholasGogartyGP"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Gogarty</NameTxt>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MichaelWDArcy"><NameTxt>Deputy Michael D&rsquo;Arcy</NameTxt>
	<P>This should not continue.  This is the craziest legislation I have seen in a long time.  The figure quoted in the document is &euro;8 million and there will be a CEO, staff and other cronies.  I ask the Minister not to continue with this as it will not fly at a time when Commissioner Rehn is not long gone from our shores.  He has left Ireland thinking there is no way the Government is accepting the reality for our nation.  Our State should not continue to waste money.</P>
        <P>There was some discussion about rates.  Businesses are hard pressed currently and rates should not be wasted in the current manner.  I would make the positive suggestion that if we are to spend money, we should not spend it on the mayor.  The Minister for Finance has the power within the Finance Bills to reduce rates by 10%.  In the past, the opportunity has been taken by the Minister for Finance to reduce the grant from the Department of the Envir<Col N="337"/>onment, Heritage and Local Government to each local authority.  That might save tens or perhaps hundreds of millions of euro for the great black hole that is the Exchequer.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">6 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>I ask that, instead of cutting the grant, the Minister would consider cutting the rate.  If he does so, the sum of the reductions that will be obliged to be made by the local authorities will not go into that great black hole of the Exchequer but to the ratepayers.  If the Minister wants to give hard-pressed businesses the opportunity to have some small reduction in what is paid, this is an opportunity.  The rates bill is a little over &euro;1 billion and the Minister has the power to cut it by 10%, which would mean &euro;100 million going directly back into the pockets of ratepayers and businesspeople throughout the country in 2011.</P>
        <P>This is a waste of time.  While I am trying not to be overly political and trying to be positive, it is difficult.  It is wrong to continue wasting money in this way.  As I said, the gentlemen from the IMF and the European Stabilisation Fund will come here and slaughter a few sacred cows.  Those sacred cows will have to be found in the Oireachtas first, whether it is in regard to the Seanad, the Presidency or otherwise.</P>
        <P>This Bill will never be enacted.  I know Fianna F&aacute;il is playing the game with its partners in government that it will continue with this, move it through Second Stage and on until it goes to Committee Stage for further consideration, but it will never be enacted.  As long as we continue to play the old political game in this Chamber, we will not get the people to support what is required to save the State.  That is where we are nationally and internationally.  It was where we were over the weekend, with Reuters and the BBC reporting that the negotiations had begun with State officials regarding a bailout, which they had.  Nonetheless, in the old way, the Ministers stepped up to the plate on Sunday, including Deputy Batt O&rsquo;Keeffe on the one o&rsquo;clock news and, later, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who said on &ldquo;The Week in Politics&rdquo; that there were no negotiations.  A couple of days later, it was admitted there were negotiations, not in regard to the sovereign debt but only in regard to trying to find a solution to the liquidity of the banks.  I heard the same words from the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, when he said we did not have a capitalisation problem, purely a liquidity problem.</P>
        <P>The old way of politics and the way things used to be done will die in the coming general election, rightly so.  It is that way which has our nation in the state it is in, with others from Frankfurt, Washington and Luxembourg about to come in.  They will not ask for permission, consensus or the agreement of all parties.  They will set down the preconditions, which will be difficult and distasteful.  What the public will not accept is the indulgence and the extravagance of this House playing a game that has to end.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe"><NameTxt>Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Keeffe</NameTxt>
	<P>I sometimes wonder if we are living in the real world at all, and I certainly think it today.  Here we are, with the IMF at the gates of the city and the limousines ready to pound their way in from the airport, past the D&aacute;il and into Government Buildings.  Those from the IMF will no doubt be interested in what we are discussing here.  In their minds will be the notion of all-night debates on the state of the banks, the enormous sum of &euro;130 billion in funding from the ECB and the efforts to stabilise the finances of the country.  Instead, what are we talking about?  We are talking about an office which, in the current context, is utterly irrelevant to the situation of the country.</P>
        <P>Whatever about the gnomes of Zurich, as they once were, we now have the gnomes of Frankfurt and Brussels.  What are the people of this country thinking?  Although I do not know how long more we will be sovereign, this is the sovereign Parliament yet what we are talking about in this moment of crisis in the history of our country is reminiscent of guild halls, gilded <Col N="338"/>coaches, ancient titles and the establishment of an office that is utterly irrelevant to the problems confronting the country.</P>
        <P>Is this because the Government wants an election?  That cannot be so.  The Government turned and twisted for so long to try to avoid a by-election in Donegal South-West and ultimately had to be forced by the courts to live up to its constitutional duty.  Is it because the Government is interested in the whole issue of quangos and the views that emerged from An Bord Snip Nua?  Our attitude to quangos should be cut, cut, cut.  What do we do?  The Government, allegedly representing the will of the people, comes along with this unnecessary and irrelevant office at this time.</P>
        <P>Great efforts are being made to suggest this whole process will be cost free.  Who does the Government think it is codding?  No matter what one sets up will cost money, and whether that money comes directly or indirectly, it comes from the people.  The suggestion it is cost free is a joke as it cannot be cost free, whether it is &euro;5 million or &euro;10 million a year.  I do not know the true sum as we have not been told.  In reply to a parliamentary question, the Minister, Deputy Gormley, said it was impossible to estimate as precise costing is impossible at this time, yet we are going ahead with the creation of this office when every bob, shilling and cent takes from the stabilisation of our finances.</P>
        <P>There is generally a case for an overall review of local government that might involve the merger of bodies, including in this area.  There may be a case for elected mayors and, in general, in the context of such an overall review, it is something we should consider.  However, to superimpose an extra layer at this stage is pure madness and utterly out of order.  It is thumbing the nose at the suffering and disillusioned people of this country to even have the temerity to introduce it to the Chamber at this time.  Very simply, the onus of proof is on the Government to suggest that this is necessary and that we must have another mayor on top of the four mayors in Dublin at present.  That onus has not been discharged and my clear message from the heart of west Cork, although I have spent much of the past 33 years in Dublin while attending the D&aacute;il, is to stand back from this for the moment as this is not the time to have such legislation on the Statute Book.</P>
        <P>As a final point, I make a genuine plea to the Government, as a long-standing Member of the House, to review the situation in regard to this legislation, which is utterly unnecessary at this time.  I understand that if the legislation goes ahead and there is this unnecessary election for an additional mayor in Dublin in the short term &mdash; what we want is a general election to clean out the stables &mdash; there is a proposal that the situation would be reviewed in two years time, perhaps at a time when there should be local elections.  I have one simple suggestion, namely, park this legislation for two years.  Let us deal with the genuine and serious crisis in the country at this time, bring forward whatever proposals we want, debate the issues and consider the full facts, which we do not have before us as yet.  Let us try to find some common purpose in resolving these problems.  However, the Government must not fly in the face of the people and proceed with this utterly unnecessary and irrelevant legislation.  For that reason, I am totally opposed to proceeding with it at this time.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="NoelAhern"><NameTxt>Deputy Noel Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I was a member of a local authority, Dublin City Council, for 17 years.  Generally, I regard that period as a positive time for me.  I began to get involved in and learn the ropes of politics.  It often surprises me when I hear people of all sides criticising, lamenting or complaining about their time in local authorities.  Before the dual mandate was done away with many of us served on a local authority.  It baffles me that people criticise their time on the authorities and the local authority system.  I am a strong believer in the local authority system and I have held such views for several years.</P><Col N="339"/>
        <P>I realise it is different and perhaps easier now in some respects with the advent of area committees.  When I first joined the local authority I had developed a good view of some of the issues it addressed from being on residents committees and sports clubs.  However, I was exposed to other issues which had not arisen in my background.  Among the city council standing committees were the cultural committee, which I recall sitting on and from which I made on-site visits to places to which tourists to the city went but where I had never been in all my years; the planning committee; the general purposes committee; and the housing committee, which is relevant to my constituency.  I found this work interesting.  The general debate at local authority level is satisfying and there is more debate and interaction than standing up here and talking to the four walls for 20 minutes.</P>
        <P>I am an absolute and strong believer in the local authority system.  However, I am underwhelmed by this legislation.  I have examined the Minister&rsquo;s speech and the memorandum but it is difficult to get the hang of it.  One keeps reading and searching for the real meat and the great issues.  There are many sections and the Bill is large enough but it is difficult to find the real issues of substance.  Perhaps I should read it from cover to cover but I found it hard to come across the body of it.  The Bill is high on aspiration and hope and perhaps it will develop in time but it is low on content and it is difficult to grasp the key issues involved.</P>
        <P>Members of local authorities will point out the difference between reserved and managerial functions.  Local authority members always complain of the lack of power they have and maintain they would prefer to have more reserved functions etc.  When some of them complain, they do not realise the powers they have and if they studied and worked harder they would realise they have more powers and could do more if they worked with what they have.  While I express my support for the general local authority system I do not maintain it is perfect or that it could not be improved &mdash; of course it could.</P>
        <P>From listening to Deputy Gogarty and others discuss places outside the city and the other three local authorities, it appears the structure in the city works rather well and we should be slow to change it or, at least, we should reflect deeply and long and be sure of what we are doing.  People may seek a change in the political structures, to reform local government and the way Dublin city and county work, then report back to the effect that issues have been transformed and great new legislation has been introduced and claim they are wonderful because they have grasped the nettle.  That is all very well but let us hasten slowly and ensure what we are doing is right and serves the city.</P>
        <P>The most fundamental need for reform involves the transfer of some power from the manager but I cannot find reference to this in the legislation.  There is much aspiration, the mayor will be involved in this and that, he or she will chair meetings and consult with various groups and influence people and so on but I cannot see it.  Will the Minister indicate in his closing remarks or on Committee Stage what is envisaged?  I realise the City and County Management (Amendment) Act dates back to 1924 or 1927 and that the county managers are a powerful body but was there any attempt to take power from them?  Did we back off or chicken out or did we deal with the issue?  I do not foresee the management structure handing over any of its power to the new mayor, which, we hope, will be all-powerful and develop into an important role in future.  I am doubtful whether this aspect has been sufficiently covered.</P>
        <P>There are many references in the Minister&rsquo;s speech to the effect that Dublin is now a region, that it is not competing with Donegal or Galway but with other cities in Europe and worldwide and that we must have someone to champion Dublin and give leadership and I go along with this thinking .  We have dealt with that, we have done it and we continue to do it on a day-to-day basis.  Previously, Dublin was under one authority.  The county council was under the city council and under the control of an assistant city manager.  Therefore, there was integration <Col N="340"/>and co-ordination at one stage.  However, change was foisted on us for reasons related to the what took place in the county.  There were no zoning problems in my time on the city council.  There may have been re-zoning decisions but they were taken for the good of the city as we perceived it and they were not controversial in the context of other places.</P>
        <P>As Dubliners and regardless of whatever role we have undertaken in the past, whether as Deputies, councillors, Lord Mayors, Ministers or Ministers of State, we act and speak in whatever forum or platform we are given to promote Dublin.  We have done this in the past and if one wished to formalise this in some way there are other ways to do so.  There could be a Minister of State for Dublin.  I realise there are some Ministers of State from Dublin and I believe that when they travel throughout or outside the country, in addition to carrying out their role in their Departments, whatever it may be, they also represent their country as well and they push the right buttons for their city.  I refer to the Minister of State with responsibility for trade in this regard.</P>
        <P>We could have done this in a more economic way.  I have heard some of the comments from across the floor.  It is amazing how some people manage to discuss other crises and problems when what is at issue is this legislation.  However, we must be aware of public opinion as well.</P>
        <P Just="Left">We must be sure of what we are doing and not simply introduce a whole new system that does not really work.  We are trying to streamline the political system, to give better value, to cut costs and we must watch out and be careful in this regard.  We have no wish for this to become another HSE whereby it would be set up with the hope to reform it subsequently by introducing cuts here and there; the intention would be to do things in an efficient manner later but then one might lose it.  Having elected a lord mayor one should leave him or her to begin his or her work.  We must be careful about what we are doing.  Dublin has a long record and the position of lord mayor has been in place for several hundred years.  I am unsure whether Isaac Butt was the first lord mayor because I have not seen the list for some time.  I should go to the Oak Room to see it.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In recent years the trend has been that the lord mayor is only in the role for one year but that has not always been the case nor is there any obligation for this to be the case under the existing legislation.  If the colleagues of the lord mayor on the council wish to put him or her in place for two, three or five years, it can be done.  If one looks at the list in the Oak Room, one will see there have been lord mayors in the past who represented the city for a number of years.  This notion that we could not have a mayor in office for a number of years is mistaken.  It could happen.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Some sections caught my eye.  There is one that states that the mayor shall personally appoint five people to his or her office.  According to the Minister&rsquo;s speech, the mayor&rsquo;s office will be a tightly knit group of about 30 people.  In view of this, five people appointed by the mayor seems excessive.  I wonder deeply about that.  We all know that Ministers have two staff and Deputy Gormley, as a party leader, perhaps has four or five.  They are in a big Department over at the Custom House.  Whatever the number of staff over there, it is big enough that five appointees would be sufficiently spread around.  However, five appointees by the mayor &mdash; who is in office for one year &mdash; in an office of 30 is crazy.  Somebody should have talked to senior people &mdash; and those not so senior &mdash; in the HSE, which is a body of around 10,000 people.  I hear lots of stories about the five or six experts brought in by the previous chief executive over the last five years, who totally destroyed morale and ruined the bloody place because they undermined other senior staff.  I am glad to see the new chief executive has not repeated that mistake.  It is one thing to bring five people to an organisation of 100,000; to bring five people from outside to an office of 30 people would be inappropriate.  There would <Col N="341"/>be no continuity from one five-year period to another.  It is wrong and it should be reconsidered.  It is nothing to do with who the mayor is &mdash; nobody knows who he or she will be in any year &mdash; but it does not seem proper.</P>
        <P>I have serious concerns about the whole process of a direct election for mayor.  I do not think it will fit into our existing system.  We do not have a directly elected Taoiseach.  We do not do our business in that way.  Whether one is in this House or any local authority chamber, the Taoiseach or mayor is the person who has the support of his or her party or a coalition of parties.  That is how this country is structured and we should be careful about moving away from it and having some form of dictator, who may, in an office of 30 people of whom five or six have been appointed by himself or herself, feel that great work is being done.  If he or she does not have alliances with and the co-operation of colleagues up and down the chain, I do not see how anything can happen.</P>
        <P Just="Left">I have major reservations about the nomination process for mayor as described in sections 94 and 95.  It needs to be tightened and the process needs to be controlled.  It is fine to say that any recognised party of a reasonable size can nominate somebody, but to say that independent candidates can be nominated by 60 voters is crazy.  It is looking for trouble.  We cannot do that.  Anybody can be elected to a city or county council as an Independent; maybe one can come in here as an Independent, but one is not coming in as Taoiseach.  The city council has 52 members and the others have, I think, 24 each.  There are probably 110 or 120 councillors across the four council areas.  Perhaps the approval of 10% of these &mdash; that is, 10 or 12 councillors &mdash; should be required.</P>
        <P>I do not want to suggest that it be so tightly controlled that small parties and those who come together independently do not have a chance of nominating anybody, but a process in which anybody can walk in off the street with 60 signatures and get a nomination is too loose.  It is all right to say that people are very intelligent and we cannot control who they wish to vote for.  However, I see groups in the media and elsewhere that love the challenge of putting up somebody who has no knowledge of politics, not to mind anything else.  We need to manage it in some way so that the man or woman who attains this office has some knowledge of politics and some influence with the other councillors in the regional authority and the city and county council.  I am just saying that it needs a lot of consideration on Committee Stage.  Some people will see this as another layer of management, and we must make sure this is not the case.</P>
        <P>I am surprised at what I see in some of the sections of the Bill.  Section 165 specifies a maximum campaign expenditure of &euro;200,000.  That is big money.  We need to be careful about what we are doing here.  The section also mentions expenditure in the 45 days coming up to an election.  There are many sections in this Bill &mdash; I suppose they have to be there &mdash; that appear to be transcribed from electoral legislation generally.  In recent years we have become very good at putting such things into legislation, but I wonder whether anyone observes these rules.  I remember, at the time of the last general election, driving around different constituencies and noting the number of posters put up by some of the candidates.  I knew I had a thousand posters up, but I felt these candidates must have had 10,000.  Nine months afterwards, when people lodge the details of their expenditure, they claim to have had only 500.  If we have all these rules and regulations, there must be a system implemented by the Department, the local authorities or the Standards in Public Office Commission under which they are enforced.</P>
        <P>I also have concerns about the provisions pertaining to the regional authority, and we should consider some amendments in this regard.  The new regional authority will be smaller than the old one, with the mayor and 15 ordinary members.  Although we are trying to achieve continuity, four of those ordinary members will be changing every year because they will be the cathaoirligh of the individual councils.  The Dublin Regional Authority sometimes sits in joint <Col N="342"/>session with the Mid-East Regional Authority, which is not being touched by this legislation.  Only one of the eight regional authorities &mdash; the Dublin one &mdash; will be affected.  When the Dublin and Mid-East Regional Authorities sit in joint session, the Dublin one will have fewer members, although it represents three times the population.  I do not think we have considered the nitty gritty of some of these provisions, or the follow-on effects they will have.  These issues need to be discussed.  In this case, the provisions may result in the Mid-East Regional Authority having 22 members at a meeting, representing a population of half a million, while the Dublin Regional Authority, representing a million and a quarter, has significantly fewer members.</P>
        <P>I have a number of concerns about the regional authority and there are several things that need to be tightened up.  One of these concerns is funding.  We have to sort out all these things; we cannot just rush ahead, have an election and elect a mayor.  We could say there will be three years for things to settle down, but that is not the way to do things.  Once a person is elected, he or she will want to get things up and running, and the time to sort out all these things is before the election.  While I have major reservations about the Bill, I hope that, with appropriate amendments to make it relevant to our current system, it will be a success.  The model should be the way we do our business in this country and not looking at mayors in other countries.  It will need much consideration and time; rushing into passing this Bill and rushing into an election will lead us into a mess down the road.  I urge that we take our time.</P>

	<P>It is with a heavy heart that I speak on the Local Government (Mayor and Regional Authority of Dublin) Bill because I find it impossible to support the Bill in its present format.  The fundamental lesson I learned from more than 12 years on Dublin City Council is that the city and county managers system must be abolished.  It is impossible to have democratic and efficient local government without democratically elected leaders with a clear mandate at local level.  As the Minister, Deputy Gormley, well knows, I have repeatedly proposed a Dublin regional mayor elected by and answerable to all the people of the greater Dublin region.  I believe that similar democratic, decentralised and regional leadership should be established for Cork and Munster, Galway and Connacht, south Leinster and our three Ulster counties, with the latter increasingly integrating with the rest of Ulster as the two Irish administrations move closer together.</P>
        <P>I led the Labour Party and Rainbow Civic Alliance on Dublin City Council for approximately eight years and I always articulated the idea of a directly elected mayor and strong local administration focusing on the needs of the Dublin region.  The Dublin region is the critical economic and social dynamo for the entire State, but greater Dublin is a great region and deserves a great mayor, its own leader.  Members should think of the iconic past and present mayors, both famous and notorious, who have led and promoted similar great cities throughout the world, including Ken Livingstone of London, Willy Brandt of West Berlin, Richard Daley of Chicago, Yuri Luzhkov of Moscow, Michael Bloomberg of New York and Joan Clos i Matheu of Barcelona.  In all of those cities the buck stops with the mayor as even the great Ken Livingstone found out in the last London mayoral elections.  Unlike the barren, bureaucratic stagnation presided over by successive city and county managers, those cities have been often blessed with dynamic democratically elected leaders with impressive achievements in planning and design, housing, public transport, water and waste facilities and other key urban services.</P>
        <P>The legislation the Minister, Deputy Gormley, has produced, however, will simply not deliver a mayor that can achieve similar results because this legislation is grossly deficient.  As a former <Col N="343"/>colleague of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, on Dublin City Council, I am very disappointed to see the totally watered down proposal for Dublin mayor that the Minister has presented to the House.</P>
        <P>A key governance issue for Dubliners and the Dublin region is its sheer size compared with the rest of Ireland.  Quite clearly an elected mayor with real and significant power will create a new major power centre, as is the case in London, Barcelona and Moscow, which could and will rival the power of the national government.  For that reason Fianna F&aacute;il and Fine Gael have been always bitterly opposed to real devolved government in Dublin.  Thus it was no surprise to me that Deputy Hogan opposed the office of the Dublin mayor from the word go and other Deputies, including Deputy Creighton, are fiercely opposed to it.  Likewise Fianna F&aacute;il will not tolerate a strong and viable Dublin mayoralty and prefers, as Professor Damien Kiberd famously expressed it years ago, that Dublin should remain a &ldquo;centre dominated by a periphery&rdquo; unlike all of the other great cities of the EU.  As I have always been conscious of the vicious bias against the greater Dublin region of the two conservative parties, I believe a new office of the Dublin mayor might be placed in the context of strong regional government for the entire Republic.  The federal model of Austria with its large capital Vienna and eight other states and regions might be a useful exemplar.</P>
        <P>It is surprising and shocking, however, that the Green Party and the Minister, Deputy Gormley, would acquiesce with the anti-democratic agenda of the two conservative parties and provide the people of Dublin with little more than an empty suit.  It is clear that the Minister knows the writing is on the wall for himself and his utterly discredited Green Party and is now desperately scrambling around for anything to shore up its devastated reputation before it departs the Irish political scene forever.</P>
        <P>The core of the Bill is the section on the powers and responsibilities with which the Dublin mayor would be mandated under this legislation.  I welcome the role given to the mayor under Part 3, Chapter 2 on waste management plans and under Part 3, Chapter 3 on bringing forward a new water services strategic plan for the Dublin region, for example.  I also believe the power of the mayor to direct a local authority in Part 3, section 1, that it is not acting in accordance with a regional planning guideline is positive.</P>
        <P>Overall, however, there are major and insuperable deficiencies in the type of mayoral system the Minister, Deputy Gormley, proposes under this legislation.  The mayoralty that the Minister wants to establish will be able to make endless recommendations and comments on central and local government policies, but it is clear the elected mayor will have little or no real power to make life and the city work better for all residents of the Dublin region.  I passionately believe the creation of an effective office of Dublin mayor is a critical necessity for the revival and reinvigoration of the Republic, but the legislation does not give us such an office.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Part 4, Chapter 2 deals with transport, which is one of the most critical policy areas for the mayor of any city.  Transport and traffic matters need a clear overarching directly elected official who has the power to knock heads together and get things done and the city moving.  As a former transport spokesperson, I invigilated the legislation establishing the Dublin Transport Authority and National Transport Authority on behalf of the Labour Party.  It was intimated through all of those debates that the new Dublin mayor would be the chairperson of the Dublin Transport Authority and hold a powerful traffic and transport Czar-type role like the mayor of London.  Yet, the Minister&rsquo;s proposed mayor will now merely be the head of a 12-person greater Dublin area transport council to make recommendations on transport and traffic matters in the greater Dublin area.  Ultimate power under this legislation for transport matters still rests with the unelected National Transport Authority rather than with a mayor who answers directly to the people of Dublin.  During the debate on the Dublin Transport Authority <Col N="344"/>Bill, I submitted a number of amendments on behalf of the Labour Party that would have facilitated the direct election of members of the DTA board by the people of the greater Dublin area.  Unfortunately, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, and all of his Fianna F&aacute;il and Green colleagues voted me down.</P>
        <P>Similarly, the mayor&rsquo;s proposed role under Part 4, Chapter 1, on housing issues is exceptionally poor.  The Bill allows only for the regional authority to make recommendations to the four local authorities in terms of their housing policies.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, should know there is an unprecedented housing crisis across the Dublin region in terms of homelessness and there are perhaps up to 50,000 individuals and families on social housing lists even though there are approximately 2,000 empty apartments in my constituency.  Why can the mayor not be given the lead role to direct housing policy and sort out the unacceptable homeless and waiting list situation once and for all?</P>
        <P Just="Left">The Bill, as proposed, is therefore a near-total sell-out by the Minister, Deputy Gormley, and once again unfortunately in this Government, the Greens have turned yellow.  For example, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government of the day appears to be able to overrule the mayor on practically every single issue if he or she so wishes.  It is depressing that the Minister, Deputy Gormley, of all people would go along with the creation of a mayor for Dublin that could end up being so weak, pliable and ineffective.</P>
        <P>The most ridiculous document that was produced in the recent debate on the Dublin mayoralty was produced by officials of Fingal County Council.  The document seems to have been the basis for Deputy Hogan&rsquo;s ludicrous statement referring to an &euro;8 million figure for the essential costs of the office.  That document also had the brass neck to state that &ldquo;the vesting of such incredible authority in a single individual as is proposed in the new mayoral proposals is without precedent in the State.&rdquo;  Of course the direct opposite is true.  There are many such precedents and they include the offices of city and county managers established under the 1929 legislation which copied US law when it was felt best that apparatchik-type business leaders should run local government without the messy involvement of the people.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The cost of running the mayoral office in terms of the salary of the mayor and the financing of the regional authority, for example, is outlined in Chapter 2 of Part 1.  The mayor and the authority will be funded primarily through the budgets of the four local authorities involved, Dublin City Council, Fingal County Council, South Dublin County Council and D&uacute;n Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.  Yet all of the local authorities are already under severe financial pressure to provide even some of their most basic services to local residents.  Will Dublin residents face even more cutbacks to their local services because of the funding model the Minister, Deputy Gormley, is imposing?</P>
        <P>The Minister should have introduced a self-financing, cost-neutral model for financing the mayor.  In my own original mayoral proposals, which I made a number of years ago, I called for a review of the more than 50 directors of services and senior executive manager positions across the local authorities, which needs to be greatly streamlined.  I also strongly believe that the profoundly anti-democratic city and county manager positions should be abolished and the savings on both of these reforms used to fund a truly democratic elected mayoral-led local government system.  The administration of each of the four counties could be simply headed by the senior director of services concerned.</P>
        <P>One of the key problems with the Bill is the lack of an all-Dublin assembly, unlike the local assemblies of the other great cities I mentioned earlier.  I am a former member not only of Dublin City Council, but also of the Dublin Regional Authority.  That the members of the new authority are indirectly elected is a serious weakness of the Minister&rsquo;s model in contrast with <Col N="345"/>the London Assembly.  Why not simply make the mayor answerable to all 127 councillors of the four Dublin counties meeting as one body perhaps four to six times per year?  No extra costly structure would be necessary with such an arrangement and all elected Dublin councillors would have a fundamental role in approving the mayor&rsquo;s strategic plans and policies.</P>
        <P>I come from the rural part of south Dublin outside Clondalkin.  I represented Coolock-Artane and Donaghmede-Raheny on Dublin City Council for 12 years, where I was the leader of the council.  I live in Fingal and have many relatives in D&uacute;n Laoghaire Rathdown.  I would passionately favour strong regional autonomy for Dublin, at least analogous to that of London, Paris or Barcelona.  Indeed, that Dublin requires some form of autonomy is my firm view after nearly 20 years in representative politics.  I and the Labour Party are strongly committed to making the administration of the Dublin region more democratic, effective and responsive.  For those reasons I cannot support the Bill.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoannaTuffy"><NameTxt>Deputy Joanna Tuffy</NameTxt>
	<P>This legislation is premature and has not been thought through properly.  These are also the sentiments expressed by Deputy Noel Ahern, as I understood him.  It is interesting that the concerns he expressed are, according to reports, held by many other Fianna F&aacute;il backbenchers and possibly some Ministers and Ministers of State.  It indicates that this legislation is being pushed because the Green Party wants it.  I do not believe the Fianna F&aacute;il Party wants it but is just supporting it to keep the Green Party on board for the budget and so forth.  It will be interesting to see whether the legislation will be a deal breaker.  If there is a vote on it, will Deputy Noel Ahern adhere to the principles he has just expressed or will he simply go through the lobbies with his colleagues?  I believe he means what he says.  I was a county councillor at the same time as Deputy Noel Ahern and was on the Dublin Regional Authority with him as well.</P>
        <P Just="Left">It is not good if this Bill is going to be railroaded through just to keep the Green Party in the Government and at the expense of local democracy.  There are fundamental problems in this Bill with regard to local democracy and a number of them have been raised in this debate.  No local government reform is being discussed.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government promised local government reform and a White Paper on local government.  He was due to bring forward proposals a couple of years ago but they have not been produced.  If there was local government reform, what would happen to the present structures of county, city and town councils?  This legislation is brought forward before any of the other work has been done on local government reform.  For that reason it is premature.</P>
        <P>It is also being superimposed.  The example of the HSE was mentioned by another speaker.  The HSE was imposed on the health boards.  It is the same in this case in that this position is being imposed on the existing local government structures, which might or might not be reformed in the future.  There is an imbalance in proposing the new Dublin regional authority to replace the existing one and a new position of directly elected Dublin regional mayor.  The seven or eight other regional authorities will not have directly elected mayors.  There will be a disproportionate number of representatives on the Dublin Regional Authority compared with the other regional authorities.  What will be the relationship between the two?</P>
        <P>If we decided in the future to devise a hybrid of town, county and city councils to try to make local government more local and based around organic local areas, where will this new Dublin Regional Authority and the mayor position fit into that?  The Labour Party supported the concept of a directly elected mayor but not what is being proposed in this legislation.  The party would never have imagined that something could be just plonked down in this way, without being properly thought through or subject to consultation.  That is the other concern.  The original proposals were brought forward last February.  The party consulted at that stage <Col N="346"/>but it was very much presented as a <i>fait accompli</i>, to which some minor amendments were made subsequently.  That is not proper consultation about what a directly elected mayor would entail.</P>
        <P>I have my doubts about introducing this for only one region, and leaving out the other regions.  There should have been a framework.  In Britain, for example, I understand legislation was introduced to allow a local authority to decide to have a directly elected mayor and to hold a referendum on it.  Some areas in Britain voted not to have a directly elected mayor.  I will discuss that further later.</P>
        <P>I do not accept there is such an urgent need for this legislation that it should be rushed through.  I attended a presentation by Dr. Aodh Quinlivan in UCC about the experience of trying to introduce this model in other countries.  It has not always been like the experience with Ken Livingstone in London or the other places that have been mentioned.  It has gone wrong in many areas.  Many people have voted against having a directly elected local authority mayor when the option was put to them.  The voters have said &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  That is one issue.  Second, some areas have had to abandon it and reverse the decision to have a directly elected mayor.  In some areas, joke candidates have been elected.  There have been many bad experiences with this process but none of that has been taken on board.  There is a terrible political correctness, particularly coming from the Green Party, that one must agree to something and must not question these great wisdoms, such as with regard to a directly elected mayor for Dublin.  One must do this and one must do that.</P>
        <P>I do not necessarily agree with my colleague, Deputy Broughan, regarding his dislike of the arrangement that exists at present between the councillor and the city manager.  This is something that exists in other countries, such as America, and many places have decided to continue with it.  Very often it works quite well.  It is a fact that councillors often have more power on local authorities than Government backbenchers or Members of the Opposition have in the D&aacute;il.  They can get things done that make life better for the people they represent in the locality.  Deputy Gogarty spoke very cynically about local councillors.  He was a councillor with me on South Dublin County Council and he achieved things on that council, as I did.</P>
        <P>Very positive work is carried out by local authorities such as South Dublin County Council.  They are trying to deal with unemployment by setting up local jobs task forces, devising campaigns to encourage people to buy in local businesses and housing Travellers.  There are often campaigns against Traveller accommodation but councillors are doing the right thing.  The Adamstown strategic development zone was adopted by South Dublin County Council when Deputy Gogarty and I were on that council.  It was a major step forward in planning local towns.</P>
        <P>We need to stop doing ourselves down and doing down the value of the work that is done by representatives and institutions.  It is a general issue.  I read an article by Conor Brady in <i>The Irish Times</i> yesterday.  At last, somebody has said we have a relatively stable political democracy and stable institutions in this country.  We take that fact for granted at our peril.  We have come out of a civil war, solved another war on the island and many positive things have been delivered by our politics and our elected representatives over the years.  We have not had a fascist party rise to prominence or a fascist dictator in power.  We must think about that and the direction in which we are headed.  This Bill is about more centralisation; it is about one figure who is supposed to be benign and wonderful, a messiah for the future.  I have my doubts about that type of approach.</P>
        <P>Many questions have been raised about the Bill.  The Dublin Regional Authority has raised many practical questions that will have to be examined on Committee Stage.  What will happen to the existing staff of the regional authority?  The mayor can appoint five staff members.  I believe that could be patronage or cronyism.  It could be totally anti-democratic.  Would they <Col N="347"/>constitute a cabinet and where would that leave the other members of the Dublin Regional Authority?  The Bill leaves out lots of the current responsibilities.  The Dublin Regional Authority has outlined that and I am sure the Minister has a copy of its comments.</P>
        <P>The Bill is a damp squib.  The powers are very weak and the functions do not seem to be different from what is already in place.  However, the mayor would have some very draconian powers.  For at least a year before the end of the mayor&rsquo;s term, if he or she vacates the office the Minister can appoint a mayor without holding an election. That is neither right nor democratic but the very opposite.</P>
        <P>The mayor will be able to make directions to transfer property from one local authority area to another and, as far as I can see, will have great powers in regard to the regional panelling guidelines, even if he or she disagrees with other local authorities or those on the Dublin Regional Authority.  There are serious problems.  If this is so urgent why is it not urgent to the Green Party?  We are all elected on an equal basis.  We were founded in 1922 and every person in this country gets to hold us all accountable and vote for us.  It is not important to the Government that the four vacant seats in this House are filled yet this Bill is being given priority.</P>

	<P>I listened to the previous speakers.  I am sorry I do not agree with my colleague, Deputy Broughan, who gave a very impassioned speech and warmed to the subject.  We agree on many things but I would be more inclined to agree with Deputy Tuffy.  This Bill is a sham and a distraction brought into the House at this time to distract people from other issues and direct them to something which they can say is wonderful and could be good for the country.  It is another tier of administration and expense for the poor unfortunate people of the country at a time when they cannot afford extra costs.</P>
        <P>Since I came into the House every reform I have seen has resulted in less of what was wanted by the people or desirable.  For example, the City and County Management Act and the Local Government Act were the relevant Acts, but lo and behold we began to say they were no longer relevant and fit for purpose and would have to be changed.  The better local government initiative was introduced by a Minister on the other side of the House who is still here.  It became an appalling disaster and excuse for democracy and accountability and means absolutely nothing.</P>
        <P>Members of the Oireachtas are virtually barred from having any meaningful dialogue with officials in local authorities despite the fact that two Ministers gave firm undertakings in this House that there would be no change, exclusion and lack of accountability.  There has been an appalling abdication of responsibilities and an attempt is being made to do nothing other than pretend something new is coming down the tracks which is beneficial to the people.</P>
        <P>Deputy Tuffy referred to centralisation and she was absolutely right.  The whole idea nowadays is to centralise everything and have power in the hands of one person who of course has to be an expert and will call on other experts.  The attitude of some people seems to be: &ldquo;To hell with that old thing called democracy; it does not make any difference any more.  What you need is a real hitman that will do the job in the way that it should have been done.&rdquo;  They are wrong, have been proved wrong many times in the past and will be proved wrong again.</P>
        <P>Other speakers mentioned the cost of the current administration.  I have examined the Bill and listened to the proposals.  There is an amazing dearth of Green Party Members, who are the natural fathers of this Bill, in the House.  I cannot understand it.  I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State; he would not have put forward the proposal.  I thought the Green Party would be represented in the House for the duration of the debate since the Bill comes from its stable.</P><Col N="348"/>
        <P>I wonder how waste management and disposal would operate in the new mayoralty which would have control over the whole region.  Would it be the case that one could not have waste disposal procedures within the new territory of the mayoralty?  I presume it would be the same as the current proposals.  I am not in favour of incineration, however it is remarkable that it is totally barred in the city but there is nothing wrong with it being transported to country to us poor rural folk and dealt with it in environmentally sensitive areas such as the Bog of Allen.  It is a crazy idea.</P>
        <P>Incineration has the greater potential to do irreversible environmental damage.  That is an important question.  What is the current position?  Will it be the same or will the sponsoring Minister say we will take responsibility for this ourselves and look after our own from here on?  Will we be open and decide that we will treat all of the people equally?</P>
        <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">7 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>It is true that modernisation of legislation is required from time to time.  Like Deputy Tuffy, I would be of the opinion that a lot of improvements need to be carried out on so-called better local government legislation.  We need to go back to the old ways.  I listened to a group of experts recently at a meeting in Brussels which a senior major player on the scene addressed.  The heavy hitters in the worlds of business, academia, journalism and high finance were all there.  The conclusion was that the whole economic crisis which has befallen the globe came about because the old ways did not work and new ways had to be found.  Some of the new ways they suggested smacked of old ways which had failed dramatically in the past.</P>
        <P>For example, they said that people had lost confidence in the political system.  It is a dangerous comment which one should always think about.  What happens when the people lost confidence in the political system in the past?  We had a serious war.  A man decided to respond to the meeting and said: &ldquo;Messieurs, you are all wrong.  There were ways that were true and tried and tested but they are ignored and you introduced new methodology that failed, only now you know.&rdquo;  It was interesting.  Let us be very careful about what we do about this Bill.</P>
        <P>This legislation has the potential to put another huge burden on the backs of the people in the city of Dublin and the local authorities which are already in existence and become powerful, unwieldy, unwilling to change or unwilling to bow to anybody&rsquo;s democratic view.  It is a very serious mistake, in particular at this moment in time, to introduce a Bill on the basis that it will reform or improve the existing system because it will not.  That is not its intention.</P>

      <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose"><NameTxt>Deputy Willie Penrose</NameTxt>
	<P Just="Left">I commend Fine Gael on bringing this important motion before the House in Private Members&rsquo; time.  More particularly, I salute the Ombudsman, Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly, for having published an excellent and comprehensive report which investigated the operation and provision of long-term care for the elderly by the health boards, the Department of Health and Children, and the HSE.  The Ombudsman has described the system as a largely chaotic and <i>ad hoc</i> one where confusion was sown about rights and entitlements.  People were subjected to huge bills which necessitated the extraction of financial security from the elderly because of the deliberate failure of the system to clarify these people&rsquo;s right to public care, let alone provide it for them.</P>
        <P>The introduction of the fair deal or nursing home support scheme in 2009 has helped things somewhat.  In her Magill School lecture, Ms O&rsquo;Reilly correctly pointed out that by using this mechanism the State now believes it has divested itself of the responsibility to provide nursing home care.  The principle now being proposed is that responsibility for long-term care rests with the applicant and his or her family, which is qualified as usual or dependent upon the availability of resources.  It is not a demand-led scheme so there are no guarantees and if no resources are available, the applicant is placed on a waiting list.  No great improvement is derived from that, however.  In effect, we are witnessing the advent of mass privatisation of nursing home care provision, with a 150% increase in the number of private nursing home places over the last 12 years.  This represents a rush to privatisation, which is what the Government&rsquo;s policy is all about.  It is about subjugating public health care provision at the expense of tax breaks for the provision of private nursing home care.  I have seen it at work in my own area where for many years excellent health care was provided at St. Mary&rsquo;s Hospital.</P>
        <P Just="Left">In her thorough investigation into the right to nursing home care in Ireland, I am glad the Ombudsman has brought to the fore an argument which dates back 40 years since the 1970 Act was passed.  She referred to rights arising under the clear and precise words of the relevant sections of the Act.  The Government allowed this situation to continue over the past 15 years despite numerous reports, including the Travers report.  The latter report succinctly stated it was remarkable that, in the context of health service provision in Ireland, huge sums of money were expended on a system that was somewhat confused from a statutory perspective and where the practice was in fact somewhat dislocated from the statutory theory.</P>
        <P>It is from that perspective that I would like to review some of the issues involved, particularly the legal ones.  What the law provides for is characterised as a state of flux surrounding the provision and more importantly the obligation to provide long-term State care facilities for our elderly population.  For up to four decades, the State through the vehicle of the old health board structure and latterly the HSE, has dodged, weaved and refused to comply with the letter of the law, which was plain and unambiguous in this regard.  However one tends to construe or interpret this &mdash; either by way of literal, schematic or teleological methods &mdash; one can only conclude that the State purposely disregarded the law that applied in this area.  That law imposed an obligation to provide nursing home care for our elderly citizens.</P><Col N="351"/>
        <P>The starting point for the construction of a statutory basis is the Health Act 1970.  The problem is that the State vehemently disputed the impact of that Act by availing of the oft-employed economic considerations or the availability of resources provision.  The latter served to confuse or complicate the issue of eligibility.  Over the years, the State and, more importantly, the Department of Health and Children, were allowed to park key requirements of the Act concerning the provision of in-patient services and thereby side step their clear statutory obligation to provide specific services.</P>
        <P>Section 51 of the Health Act 1970 unambiguously defines in-patient services as institutional services provided to persons while maintained in a hospital, convalescent home or home for persons suffering from physical or mental disability or an accommodation ancillary thereto.  This clearly incorporated the care provided in a nursing home and the Supreme Court clarified this in the McInerney ward of court case in 1976.  In my view, this confirmed in an unequivocal fashion an elderly person&rsquo;s legal right as a geriatric patient to receive in-patient services free of charge.  This clear statement of the law continued to be disregarded for the next three decades, notwithstanding the fact that it was handed down by the highest court in the land.  The various health boards continued to charge medical card holders, notwithstanding the fact that it was clearly illegal to do so.  This practice was abruptly ended by the introduction of the statutory health repayments scheme, which set up a mechanism for repaying those who were charged illegally for their care.</P>
        <P>Section 52 of the Health Act 1970 reinforced this view and obligated health boards to make in-patient services available for persons with full eligibility and persons with limited eligibility.  It is notable that there were no ifs, buts or maybes; the obligation was unequivocal in its mandatory imposition.  It was reinforced by the fact that during the same period people had an entitlement and eligibility for in-patient services in public hospitals.</P>
        <P>The Department articulated the view &mdash; unsustainably, in my opinion, given the mandatory nature of the legislation &mdash; that the statutory provision distinguished between eligibility and entitlement.  One is compelled to the viewpoint that this was a rear-guard action to stave off the inevitability of the fact that the health boards were statutorily obliged to provide in-patient services.  One would support the Ombudsman&rsquo;s description of the stance adopted by the Department as being of a tortuous construction, which was neither necessary nor plausible.</P>
        <P>Part 6 of the Health Act 1970, which deals with the provision of health services, sets out a range of services to be provided, and to whom and on what terms they could be provided.</P>
        <P>Section 60 of the Health Act 1970 provides that, as regards nursing home provision, a health board shall in relation to a person with full eligibility and such other category of persons and for such purposes as may be specified by the Minister, provide a nursing service.  Eligibility is the term used solely as an identifier of those to whom the service shall or may be made available.  There is no room for confusion as to the meaning of &ldquo;eligibility&rdquo;, or that it is equivalent in meaning to &ldquo;entitlement&rdquo;.  Eligibility is used to identify the categories to whom a service shall or may be provided.  It is not utilised for the purposes of defining the extent to which services must be provided.  Indeed, the Ombudsman advised the Legislature that any perception, contention or confusion arising from the interchangeability of these terms &mdash; &ldquo;eligibility&rdquo; and &ldquo;entitlement&rdquo; &mdash; could have been avoided by the adoption of neutral terminology in delineating the various categories of health entitlements.  She indicated that one could do so by naming them as categories 1, 2, 3, etc.</P>
        <P>In the Tierney <i>v</i> North Eastern Health Board case, which dealt with another section of the Health Act, Judge Denham observed that statutes should be construed according to the intent expressed in the legislation.  The words of a statute declare best the intent of an Act and consequently those words should be given their ordinary meaning and the court is bound to <Col N="352"/>give effect to the clear meaning of the statute.  Thus any construction of section 52 of the Health Act 1970, among others, clearly confers a statutory obligation on the health board, the HSE, etc., and confers enforceable rights on relevant individuals.</P>
        <P>The Government had a choice concerning the provision of services as set out in the 1970 Act.  By a deliberate political act, it opted to favour the provision of care for the elderly by way of private operations rather than public ones.  The Boston versus Berlin debate was at its zenith in the pursuit of the privatisation of health care provision.  The private argument went out clearly and obviously.</P>
        <P>The argument for the universal provision of health care is always made in two main areas: births and young people, and care for the elderly.  Variations may be made regarding the capacity argument between these two specific and clear areas.  The elderly are not in a position to increase their income in any meaningful way.  They are generally confined to fixed incomes.  We may wonder where the funding can come from, but in a country where 80% of tax relief for private pensions goes to 20% of recipients, even reducing these to a standardised tax rate would save the State in excess of &euro;1 billion per year.  This is where it should be applied.</P>
        <P>In the context of public health care provision for the elderly, we have a State validation system for qualifications and competencies, whereby the provision of important services for elderly citizens is based not solely on the cost of the service but on the adequacy of same.  Every single social survey suggests that people want to live in contentment where possible in their own home environment for as long as possible.  That possibility needs to be supported by the provision of services.  Residential care should be seen as a last resort.  Where services are not provided, however, people are compelled to avail of institutional care, which under the policy of this Government is essentially in private nursing homes.</P>
        <P>I recall the efforts I made as Chairperson of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs in this regard.  I authored a report on carers, which brought significant improvements for them, including the payment of the half-carer&rsquo;s rate to people in receipt of other specific social welfare payments.  I have always unashamedly and fearlessly advocated the rights of carers because I recognise their contribution to ensuring that those they care for can remain within their own home environment where they will be most contented.  In doing so, they save the State billions of euro.  This is why it is important not to roll back these advances.  We should recognise the role of carers as real employment.  The caring economy is an important sector and full PRSI recognition in terms of their contribution should be considered.</P>
        <P>I was always, and still am, a great supporter of St. Mary&rsquo;s Hospital, which is the local public health hospital in Mullingar.  It provided accommodation for the elderly and disabled people, particularly in mid and north Westmeath.  In the early 1980s, when we had significantly fewer people in terms of age profile and dependency, up to 200 beds were available through public provision.  Some 200 beds were available in straightened financial times with a smaller population base.  It has now been reduced to fewer than 100, which is where this matter has gone wrong in providing private health care.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MargaretConlon"><NameTxt>Deputy Margaret Conlon</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to share time with Deputies Dooley, Johnny Brady, Power, O&rsquo;Brien and O&rsquo;Rourke.  </P>
        <P>The majority of our older people want to stay in their homes for as long as possible with their independence, dignity and family and community support.  We wish that for ourselves and for the older members of our families but in some cases that is not possible and it is then incumbent on us to ensure there is equality and fairness in getting access to quality nursing home care.  The nursing home support scheme, the fair deal, means a uniform system of finan<Col N="353"/>cial support for individuals in public and private nursing home beds.  It ensures individuals and their families do not face financial hardship.  There has been widespread acceptance of that by most Members in this House and by people outside the House.  They see equity and fairness in the scheme.  Many people have made such comments to me and recognise what is available in the service.</P>
        <P>It is important that the standards of such care are of the highest quality.  Nothing else can be acceptable.  If we have learned anything from the harrowing documentaries we saw on our television screens, it is that it is often traumatic for elderly people to move from home to residential care.  It is a difficult decision for families to make and when people move into residential care, the care must be of the highest standard.  They deserve nothing less.  The Department of Health and Children accounts for one of the three highest spending Departments, along with the Department of Education and Science and the Department of Social Protection.  Like any Department, it has finite resources.  There is not an unlimited amount of money in the Department and in that respect it must live within its budget.</P>
        <P>In providing residential care to the elderly, we have a mix of private and public facilities.  In my constituency, we are fortunate to have an excellent quality of care.  That is much more important than the physical buildings.  In St. Mary&rsquo;s Hospital, Castleblayney, we have a residential public facility that has achieved ISO standard.  It is a centre of excellence where the patient is at the heart of everything that goes on in the facility. My life in the town where I am based would be much easier if we had two or three more of these facilities, such is the demand for places.  Recently I visited a facility outside Carrickmacross with the Minister for Health and Children where the McCoy family have developed the concept of a home away from home.  The first thing that struck me when I entered the facility was that each unit has its own front door, doorbell and letterbox.  One walks into a very inviting sitting room and kitchen and there is no need to go to the bedrooms.  I was struck by the fact that people felt at home in their new place of residence.  The McCoy family has made major investment in this facility and they make every effort to ensure the needs of their patients are met.</P>
        <P>We are quick to give a negative rather than a positive view.  We must recognise the good work carried out by many people working in the HSE.  No organisation of that size could be without difficulties in dealing with so many people.  We must live according to our means.  I would like nothing more than to have an unlimited amount of money in the Department of Health and Children but the reality is something different.  It is very easy to be on the sideline, shouting and knowing everything, but when one is asked to don the jersey and come onto the pitch and play one&rsquo;s part, it is a different reality.  I commend the Minister and the Department on the increases in funding over the years and on the delivery of the fair deal.  I am happy to support the amendment.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="TimDooley"><NameTxt>Deputy Timmy Dooley</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  We are here to discuss the findings of the report of the Ombudsman.  The Minister for Health and Children and the Department have come in for a considerable amount of unfair criticism.  It is appropriate that the Minister should have sought to defend and protect the interests of the State as she saw fit.  There is an issue of jurisdiction, which was challenged by the Minister on the basis of legal advice.  It was appropriate to defend the interests of the State.  Going through the detailed correspondence between the Ombudsman and the office of the Minister, it is clear there was great co-operation between the two.  However, the analysis of the report seems to suggest otherwise.  It is unfortunate that the Minister has been drawn into this debate when clearly her role is to defend the interests of the State against future litigation that may arise.</P>
        <P>One need only look back to how we got to where we are.  There is little doubt there was continuous failure by successive Governments to address the lacuna that existed in the law in <Col N="354"/>respect of charging patients with medical cards for residential units run by the State.  I was one of the few who spoke out against the rush by some to seek recompense for a damn good service provided to their loved ones at a time when they were unwilling or unavailable to do so.  Sadly, many people queued up to take the bounty and run.  It was appropriate to face up to the situation and deal with it constructively.  Congratulations are due to the Minister for Health and Children.</P>
        <P>My experience of the system now in place, commonly referred to as the fair deal scheme, is that it is universally accepted.  It is a good scheme that assists many people in a uniform way.  The previous subvention scheme provided different rates in different parts of the country.  Someone living in Dublin did better or worse than someone living in Clare and that is not the way a system of administration should be allowed to continue.  I do not direct these comments at the Ombudsman.  In that era, when a system of inequity existed, there was justification for a negative finding from the Ombudsman.  We did not have one to the best of my knowledge.  Therefore, it is unfortunate that the Minister comes in for criticism when people across successive parties failed to address the issue for their own reasons.  Now the Minister is pushed out by the Ombudsman when she was the first to grapple with a complex problem and resolve it conclusively.  It is to the benefit of many families who had to deal with the situation as it existed.  A good level of service is provided and the current system encourages the public and private sector.</P>
        <P>The constituency with which I am most familiar has a fantastic necklace of service providers in the public and private sectors.  I am very familiar with one close to where I live, Raheen Community Hospital, which provides an excellent residential service for people with longstay requirements.  In conjunction with that, daycare service is provided through daycare centres in areas such as Kilmaley, Clarecastle, Miltown Malbay, Kilrush and Lisdoonvarna.  These facilities work well.  They support the Government policy of retaining people in their homes and communities for the longest possible time.  The building blocks exist in various home care packages, the public health nurse facility and home help to ensure people can continue to stay in their homes for as long as possible.  Studies demonstrate that people&rsquo;s existence and longevity are enhanced by retaining them in a home setting around their family for as long as possible.  It is unfortunate that we are addressing some extent an historic problem, one which will be dealt with in the courts at a later stage.  It is wrong that we are now reflecting on one of a number of things that have been gotten right in more recent times in the delivery of health services.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnnyBrady"><NameTxt>Deputy Johnny Brady</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to say a few words on this most important issue.  Care and support for the elderly has been always a priority for Fianna F&aacute;il in government.  It is regrettable and unfair that the Ombudsman produced such a negative report.  One of the most certain things in life is that we will all need care at some point in our lives.  If we are honest, every one of us is concerned about how that care may be provided.  We may also have concerns about how our parents or other loved ones are cared for.  I commend all of the people who commit to the care of a loved one on a 24/7 basis.  The care needed may be personal care, meal preparation, assistance to walk and transport for appointments  That type of care is vital for many older people.</P>
        <P>The policy of this Government is to permit those in need of care to remain in their homes for as long as possible.  Through a variety of supports people are enabled to remain independent for longer and can continue to live in familiar surroundings among family, friends and neighbours.  Nursing home care becomes necessary when this support is no longer sufficient to safely meet their needs.  Community and home-based care is vital and is a major support to families <Col N="355"/>who require support with the demanding work of caring.  Home help, home care packages and day care are all community-based services that are vital to supporting people to continue living in their homes.</P>
        <P>In 2010, a total of 12 million home help hours and more than 5,000 home care packages will be provided by the Health Service Executive.  Day care facilities across the country also play a major role in the lives of those who may require care.  I compliment the Minister on the introduction of the nursing homes support scheme and the Health Information and Quality Authority.  Those schemes have received widespread welcome and support.  We now have a uniform system of financial support for both public and private beds in nursing homes.  This new scheme ensures that no one has to sell his or her home to pay for care, that no one has to borrow to fund this cost and that no family will have to find the money elsewhere or mortgage their home to access funds to pay for care.  It is regrettable that the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report is so negative.  Heretofore, nursing home care was not affordable for many people.  We now have a fair system.</P>
        <P>Today those who need care and all of us who will require care into the future can look forward to care of a high quality and high standard in public and private nursing homes alike.  This Government has maintained its continued commitment to older people.  I compliment the Minister on her efforts to balance co-operation with the Ombudsman and her own legal advice.</P>

	<P>Tonight&rsquo;s motion deals with nursing home care for the elderly.  Having served in the Department for a period as a Minister of State with responsibility for services for older people, I have a particular interest in tonight&rsquo;s debate.  During my time in the Department a policy decision was made to introduce the fair deal scheme.  The scheme was an honest attempt to deal with what has been a difficult situation.  As public representatives, we are all familiar with the difficulties many families encountered when their loved ones were forced to move to private nursing home care.  Even in cases where the application for subvention might have been successful there was always a shortfall that had to be met.  For many families it was like taking on a second mortgage.  It is difficult enough to have a loved one moving out of home into nursing home care &mdash; it is a big decision for a family to allow someone else to look after a parent, other family member or relative &mdash; but the financial burden that often went with that was an enormous challenge for many families.</P>
        <P>As the Minister outlined last night, since the fair deal scheme was introduced more than 16,500 applied and more than 12,250 people were approved.  It is welcome to see such a level of take up.  One criticism of the scheme however is that people are encountering hidden charges.  They go into care on the understanding that their medical and accommodation needs &mdash; bed and board &mdash; will be looked after, but there are charges for activation programmes, incontinence wear and even laundry services.  Those are basic requirements that one would assume would be included.  It is important that in future patients and their families know exactly what they are paying for when they go into a nursing home.</P>
        <P>We have introduced a number of measures.  HIQA has responsibility for the inspections that take place.  The quality and standard of nursing homes has improved throughout the country.  The regulations on the registration of nursing homes and the care and welfare of residents has resulted in a significant improvement.  RTE exposed some of the terrible treatment patients in nursing homes had to endure.  That forced the Government to take action.</P>
        <P>I single out one Member of the House for the role he played and the interest he took in nursing homes.  As a result of the good, solid groundwork he did we took action and brought about a number of improvements.  I refer to Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd who is not present tonight.  I was on the receiving end of his contributions on a number of occasions but as an Opposition spokesperson he served a great purpose at the time.</P><Col N="356"/>
        <P>The setting up of the Office of the Ombudsman was a progressive development.  I felt very uneasy while watching the television debate a few nights&rsquo; ago where the Ombudsman and the Minister for Health and Children were at loggerheads.  One would assume the two of them would have the same goal and would be working towards improving the lot of older people.  Perhaps we can learn from the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report and that in future we will see greater co-operation between the Department and the Office of the Ombudsman.</P>
        <P>The Minister indicated that the budget this year in respect of long-term care for the fair deal scheme and for those remaining in public long-stay facilities and receiving subvention in private facilities would be more than &euro;979 million.  Regardless of what is said, unless we deal with the financial crisis we will not be able to provide that level of funding in future years.</P>
        <P>I have never seen the public so despondent and angry as they are at present.  They have almost lost hope.  This country is facing a serious financial crisis.  The people are crying out for leadership.  Just like the markets they want to be assured that the Government has a credible plan to get us out of this hole.  People deserve to be given the full facts and to get an explanation of the exact position we are in, no matter how bad it is.  At this stage people are prepared to make the sacrifices and they are expecting the worst.  We cannot continue treating people they way we have done.  We often speak about our educated electorate, yet on occasion we treat them like fools.</P>
        <P>Last week was a poor one for the Government.  We failed the people and treated them as if they could not understand the complexities of the financial situation.  We engaged in a game of semantics.  We started trying to play a cute game about words and what they meant or might mean instead of using the opportunity presented to us following a number of statements on television and radio about the state of the nation and the difficulties we are experiencing.  We should have taken that opportunity to explain to people the nation&rsquo;s problems and the way in which we were trying to tackle them.  It was the least the people deserved.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DarraghOBrien"><NameTxt>Deputy Darragh O&rsquo;Brien</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to be given this opportunity to speak in support of the counter-motion tabled by the Government.  Deputy Se&aacute;n Power raised a number of points that I might address towards the end of my contribution.  Regardless of political party, I hope we would all be in agreement that there have been vast improvements in the care of the elderly in recent years.  I am not putting this down to political parties.</P>
        <P>Day in, day out in my constituency of Dublin North, which I share with Deputy Reilly, access has been given to the fair deal scheme and financial burdens and worries have been removed from families who, because they could not afford to do so previously, have only now had the chance to place their loved ones in nursing homes of their choice.  Given that more than 12,250 of 16,000 applications have been approved, the scheme is important.  The cornerstone of any political party and mine in particular must be respect and care of the elderly and those in need.</P>
        <P>As mentioned by other Deputies, there have been expos&eacute;s on how care has not met the required standards.  This situation cannot recur.  The ongoing debate between the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office and the Department of Health and Children and the HSE has been distasteful.  We should all have one goal in mind, that is, to offer and provide access to the best care available for elderly people.  This provision is predicated on our being in a financial position to continue to fund such schemes, funding which amounts to &euro;979 million this year.</P>
        <P>That the D&aacute;il is discussing this matter is important.  Fine Gael might view this as an opportunity to row back on a disastrous interview conducted by its leader in respect of the HSE two weeks ago in which he effectively put forward a slash-and-burn vista of HSE job cuts all over the place.  I know hundreds of workers in the HSE, as I am sure Deputy Reilly does.  They <Col N="357"/>provide home care and work in nursing homes and we need to do our best to support them.  We will fall down on some matters, which is the reason we should not just throw out reports like the Ombudsman&rsquo;s.  We must consider the issues that have been raised irrespective of whether we agree with the points.</P>
        <P>Since we are discussing the HSE and the Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, is present, I wish to mention care of the elderly.  I am concerned that there is a threat hanging over my area of Dublin North as regards the Swords Dublin fire brigade ambulance service.  Last year, it carried out 4,500 emergency calls, 30% of which were critical.  I hope the HSE and Dublin City Council can reach a financial resolution to ensure this crucial service for the people of Swords, Malahide and surrounding areas receive this ambulance service.  Like Deputy Reilly, I took the opportunity to meet the station&rsquo;s crew and staff in the past week or so.  The work they do is exceptional.  Petty squabbling between the HSE and the city council over funding the service is not on.  A sizeable portion of the patients and people the Swords ambulance D134 looks after are elderly, the very people we are discussing.  If we cannot provide this emergency service, it does not reflect well on us or the HSE.  I do not mean to be too parochial, but this is an example of front line services being important.</P>
        <P>I am pleased by the interest that has been shown in the HSE&rsquo;s early retirement and voluntary redundancy schemes for administrative grades.  This is not a question of telling people to get out the door.  Instead, it is about people making their own choices as to whether they wish to retire early.  Our focus must be on the front line, continuing to provide care for the elderly and listening to and taking on board criticism.  It is important that we retain the Swords ambulance service for the people of Dublin North.</P>

      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>I am glad to have a few minutes to speak to this important motion and to commend the work that has been done in caring for the elderly and the improvement in recent years.  I was a bit alarmed by the debate between the Ombudsman and the HSE.  We do not have to believe the Ombudsman is God and that everything she says is perfect.  I understand there was great communication between her, her office, the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister&rsquo;s office.  Little would separate them, but there was certainly no conspiracy to keep information from the Ombudsman or to shut her out.  The Minister needed to take legal advice, as any Minister would, and I understand she followed the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice.</P>
        <P>I wish to take the opportunity to discuss a facility in my town, Loughloe House, which Deputy Reilly visited some time ago.  He did not tell me he was coming.  Otherwise I would have laid out the red carpet.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I must get Deputy O&rsquo;Rourke&rsquo;s telephone number.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="MaryORourke"><NameTxt>Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke</NameTxt>
	<P>He will visit again and we will welcome him.  Loughloe House was built in 1979 as a public home for the elderly supplied by the health authorities.  The Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, found grave problems.  In approximately six weeks, many of the errors HIQA had discovered in its infrastructure had been remedied and Loughloe House is now right in every respect.</P>
        <P>Only eight residents remain.  It was built for 39, then the number of residents dropped to 29.  Everyone got a place wherever they wished inasmuch as they could.  It was not always possible, but it was in most instances.  The residents&rsquo; relatives are good and visit them often and they are in receipt of a good quality of care from nursing and visiting medical staff.  Thankfully, the deadline for Loughloe House&rsquo;s closure was lifted.  Its residents are happy to be there.</P><Col N="358"/>
        <P>While I have the floor and the Minister of State is in attendance, I will mention how there are many idle beds in that fine facility.  Nursing home places in the Athlone area are fast running out.  Most of the people in question are from Athlone or its hinterland and there is a need for a place that has spare beds.  I worked with others to ensure the deadline was lifted and Loughloe House remained open, a situation about which I am glad.  While it remains open, it is proper that the elderly who are looking for respite or long-term accommodation be accommodated there.  It is a homely place that was built in a modern fashion in 1979 &mdash; a square around a quadrangle, which is how it is expected people in elderly accommodation would live.  They have views of people in the little bays and wings.  It was lovely to be there during the summer and to see those people so happy.  I hope we can use the spare beds and that the happy existence of those of the original residents who remain will continue to be accommodated while they live out their lives with daily visits from relatives.</P>
        <P>A great deal of good work has been done for the elderly.  Every effort is being made to ensure that the good work continues.  The fair deal is a great package.  It has brought ease of mind not just to many older people, but to their relatives and the wider families who were under a great deal of pressure with regard to what to do with their loved ones.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JohnOMahony"><NameTxt>Deputy John O&rsquo;Mahony</NameTxt>
	<P>I am pleased to be able to contribute to this Fine Gael motion, and I commend Deputy Reilly for bringing it forward.  There are many issues I could speak about but I will concentrate on a couple. </P>
        <P>I happened to see &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; last week on the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report regarding nursing home care in Ireland and the rights and entitlements of people accessing that care.  The message from the programme to the people was to the effect that there is no accountability by this Government and that we are as well not to have an Ombudsman because no account is taken of her views.  The Ombudsman has been seen as a fair referee and adjudicator when members of the public are denied their rights by the State.  This office has been a great source of comfort for thousands of people all over the country, after other avenues had been exhausted.  The then Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald appointed the first Ombudsman, Michael Mills, in 1984 and since that time all Governments for the most part have, until recently, accepted the findings of this independent voice and that office&rsquo;s recommendations.</P>
        <P>The lost at sea scheme was voted down earlier this year in the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on the instructions of the Government.  Then we had the spectacle last week of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, telling the Ombudsman, Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly on live television that she was operating outside her jurisdiction, and justifying the non-co-operation of the Department of Health and Children and the HSE with the investigation.  The Minister went on to sing the praises of the nursing home support scheme introduced last year as a way of addressing the issue for the present and into the future.  She did not deal with the denial of rights to the elderly in the past nor did she clarify the difference between eligibility for nursing home care and entitlement to it for applicants.  This has not yet presented problems because the scheme is only in its early stages and the resources allocated this year have been sufficient to meet the needs of eligible applicants.  The number of eligible applicants, however, will mushroom in the coming years as Ireland&rsquo;s population grows older but this does not make elderly people entitled to it if the resources are not in place, so there is another major crisis coming down the tracks.</P>
        <P>Therefore, the Government scheme that is being praised by it from on high ignores the injustices of the past while failing to recognise that it is not going to be a solution for the future.  With reference to last week&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme, I would urge that the country cannot <Col N="359"/>continue like this.  The Ombudsman&rsquo;s recommendations are either accepted or they are not.  Both the Minister and the Ombudsman must consider their positions, following what the public saw on live television last week.  Either we have a dictatorship in which we are all told what to do or a democracy where there are checks and balances and within which justice is provided in the system.</P>
        <P>The Ombudsman took on the Minister, the Department of Health and Children and the HSE last week on behalf of the senior citizens of Ireland and she was told it was none of her business and advised not to be acting outside her jurisdiction.  There has been much talk recently on the need to reform politics and how it is administered in this country inside and outside these Houses.  This investigation into the history of how our elderly have been treated and the subsequent report and its handling by Government is a good reason why there has to be a fundamental review of how political business is done in this State, to address the imbalance between the powers of Parliament and the Executive under the Constitution.</P>
        <P>There are many issues that I have not time to address, such as the way the State is defending cases being brought by members of the public.  No explanation or clarity has been given in that regard, but some of my colleagues have dealt with this already.  I want to come back to the fundamental point of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report and the Department&rsquo;s response.  It is startling.  The Department said the Ombudsman had exceeded her jurisdiction, failed to abide by fair procedures, displayed prejudice, objective bias and arrogance, while purporting to interpret the law.</P>
        <P>On the other hand there is the damning conclusion in the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report which refers, in terms of to access to nursing home care over four decades, to confusion, uncertainty, misinformation, inconsistency and inequity.  That is not the view of politicians, but rather the Ombudsman&rsquo;s view.  I commend this motion to the House.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton"><NameTxt>Deputy Paul Connaughton</NameTxt>
	<P>I have heard some great debates in this House over the years, but it is seldom one sees a very senior Minister take on an Ombudsman in the manner it happened here last night.  I was not actually in the Chamber, but I was listening to it on the monitor upstairs.  One would nearly believe the Minister for Health and Children was somehow or another injured or was being libelled in some manner as regards what the Ombudsman had to say.  It is very difficult to understand the rationale behind this. </P>
        <P>Everybody is now asking about the purpose of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office, based on this episode, and why it was instituted many years ago.  In simple terms, it was to help people obtain their rights under law and to ascertain what people were entitled to.  Every public representative that represents a constituency, whether as a Member of the Oireachtas or of a local council spends a great deal of time trying to do just that but we do not have the type of complex powers the Ombudsman has.  Only in a rarity of cases will a Minister come in to the House and disown the Office of the Ombudsman.  One might get the impression there is a personal type of vendetta against the Ombudsman, given the manner in which the Minister spoke last night.</P>
        <P>If there is nothing to hide why would the Minister, the Department and the HSE not stand up and be counted, and open the books?  Is it not transparency we are calling for in everything we do, and is it not this very lack of transparency that has landed us where we are today, with the banks gone under and the country in a terrible state?  It is because of the lack of transparency and people not coming up to the plate to do what they were supposed to and paid to do.</P>
        <P>The same principle applies in this.  What shocks me altogether is the apparent gulf between a senior Minister and the Office of the Ombudsman, which is there to protect the rights of <Col N="360"/>every single citizen.  That is what the debate is about.  I do not know where all that leads to, as such, but one might certainly expect that the questions that were asked should be answered openly and honestly on behalf of every one of the 4 million people in this country.</P>
        <P>The big question over the years was what a medical card entitled its owner to.  Did it mean, in effect, that he or she was entitled to be a long-stay patient in a public nursing home?  In the event that the nursing homes were filled or space was inadequate, what did the medical card entitle its holder to in a private nursing home?  These are fundamental questions about which there was no clarity in the past.  Even at this stage, people are entitled to be given the answers and to be told where they stand.   There are many other issues on which I would like to comment in this vein.  This issue has created havoc for families down through the years.  As Deputy O&rsquo;Mahony stated, people need clarity in regard to the law as it stood.  For this reason, 300 people have taken actions before the courts.  Many more cases may be taken to the courts in order that people can get clarity on this matter.</P>
        <P>I was present with Deputy Reilly when the current nursing home support scheme, more commonly referred to as the fair deal legislation, was going through the House.  There are many aspects of that scheme I like.  However, problems are only now beginning to emerge.  It has been brought to my attention that there is a lack of clarity in regard to the eligibility of people aged under 65 years.  This matter needs to be clarified.  Some people are deemed to be eligible while others are not.  It is incumbent on the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, and the Minister to explain the position to the people concerned.</P>
        <P>The standard of care in our public and private nursing homes is increasing year on year.  The nursing homes with which I am most familiar are staffed by caring people who provide an excellent service.  As I have previously stated, the Health Information and Quality Authority controls in this area are useful in terms of ensuring our nursing homes are well run.  Those nursing homes which are well run have no problem with inspections, irrespective of whether they take place during the day or night.  We must ensure we have in place controls, such as provided by HIQA, which will ensure every elderly person committed to a nursing home is given the best service available.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DeirdreClune"><NameTxt>Deputy Deirdre Clune</NameTxt>
	<P>Since publication of the Who Cares? report commentary has been dominated by the controversy and dispute between the Office of the Ombudsman and the Department of Health and Children and Health Service Executive.  It is important we bear in mind that the Ombudsman has stated that this report is based on more than 1,000 complaints she has received since 1985.  It is important we keep that to the fore in this debate.  The complaints relate to care in nursing homes, care for elderly patients, complaints from families and patients and those dealing with their affairs in terms of who was providing their care, what were their entitlements and the level of confusion in this regard.</P>
        <P>It is difficult to understand what these people were and are entitled to now.  There is no clear statement from the Government on how the system will operate in terms of nursing home care.  It is understandable, given the role of the Ombudsman, that complaints would be directed towards her from frustrated individuals and that these complaints would be acted upon.  The Ombudsman&rsquo;s report is littered with stories from individuals in regard to their financial situation, the distress this has caused and the fact that they found it so difficult to get answers.</P>
        <P>Having to find long-term care for one&rsquo;s elderly relatives is difficult for many families.  As mentioned by a previous speaker, there are many families who must do this for relatives who are not so elderly but who are incapacitated and must be cared for in a long-term setting.  The Ombudsman in her report outlines the difficulties she encountered in getting information from <Col N="361"/>the State and the tardiness with which the State operated in addressing the concerns she raised.   The Ombudsman&rsquo;s report, in terms of what followed when the report was published and the relationship between the Health Service Executive, the Department and the Office of the Ombudsman, outlines important issues in regard to the independent role of the Office of the Ombudsman and how the person holding that office should discharge his or her role.</P>
        <P>I deal regularly with people facing these issues.  Having read the report,  it is not clear to what people are entitled.  This issue needs to be addressed, particularly given that we are dealing with vulnerable people who rely on others for information.  The Ombudsman raised the question of whether there is any enforceable entitlement to be provided when it comes to long-term care.  We need clarity and certainty not legislation that is open to different interpretations.  It now appears that one&rsquo;s statutory entitlement will not be provided if the resources required to do so are not available.  While this is not clearly stated in the legislation, perhaps it should be.  We have been promised time and again that the eligibility for health and personal social services Bill, which is at an early stage of drafting, will be published.  We need clarity in regard to what people are entitled to in this State when it comes to services provided for them by the HSE, the Department of Health and Children or the State.</P>
        <P>Whether one is speaking to someone in the HSE south, HSE south east, HSE national or the Department of Health and Children, the story surrounding the care of elderly people in our nursing homes or hospitals is littered with conflicts and contradictions.  The position is not clear.  A similar situation prevails with home care packages, in regard to which a completely different approach is taken in different areas.  It appears that one&rsquo;s address is often an indication of the type of service or entitlements one can expect to get in one&rsquo;s area.</P>
        <P>The nursing home support scheme was introduced 12 months ago.  The Ombudsman states in her report that she is aware of much concern in regard to how the scheme is operating.  Of particular concern is whether people under 65 years of age in need of long-term care have a right to avail of the service.  This issue needs to be clarified.  The future of nursing home care is of concern to us all.  Will the State provide funding to support the needs of these homes?  In 2010, &euro;979 million was allocated for long-term residential care, of which &euro;97 million was released to the fair deal scheme to cover all applicants this year.  However, the Minister has stated that given the economic situation, of which we are all aware, she needs to take &euro;1 billion next year from HSE services.  Will this result in a reduction in funding to the nursing home support scheme?  Are we likely to see a return to long waiting lists, a concern raised in a recent document published by Age Action Ireland?  This issue must be addressed.</P>
        <P>There are currently a number of legal actions outstanding before the courts.  I understand that more than 300 actions have been taken on behalf of people who claim their right to long-term nursing care has not been honoured.  What is surprising is that at this stage, none of these cases has gone to a hearing in the High Court despite many of them having been taken more than five years ago.  I understand that settlements have been reached in at least a dozen of these cases, the details of which have not been disclosed.  This sends out mixed messages and raises questions.  Why were these cases settled out of court?  Is it an acceptance by the State that these individuals should have been provided with nursing home care by the State and that the costs involved in providing that care should have been funded by the State?  How much by way of compensation was paid to the individuals whose cases were settled out of court?  What is the position in regard to the hundreds of outstanding cases?  Will they be defended or settled out of court?  We need answers to these questions.  More important, we need clarity in regard to the provision and cost of nursing home care and where individuals stand in terms of their relationship with the State.</P><Col N="362"/>
        <P>I heard part of the Minister&rsquo;s response to this matter last night.  It is clear she is at odds with the Ombudsman on many issues.  The Ombudsman provided a detailed response tonight to what the Minister had to say last night.  While I have not yet had an opportunity to read it in detail I will do so.  The Ombudsman is acting on behalf of individuals.  The Office of the Ombudsman is an independent body to which people can make complaints and from whom they can seek redress when they believe the State is not providing them with the services to which they are entitled.</P>
     
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="FergusODowdFG"><NameTxt>Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd</NameTxt>
	<P>I congratulate Deputy Reilly on tabling this important motion.  The right and entitlements of nursing home residents has been a key issue in previous contributions and I would like to address the issue in my own constituency.  I have been approached by people over the past few weeks whose relatives are in nursing homes and who have had problems with the nursing home support scheme, NHSS.  There are significant weaknesses in the legislation and issues that must be addressed.</P>
         <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">8 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt><P>HIQA does a first-class job.  Its staff are professional, focused and good at their work and the vast majority of nursing home owners also do an excellent job but, unfortunately, in the recent past, I have been contacted about two nursing homes in counties Louth and Meath in which significant issues have arisen for a number of my constituents.  They are in total conflict with the scheme regarding individual entitlements.  The difficulty is no official is in place to vindicate the rights of individuals.  HIQA cannot act as an advocate for an individual complainant.  The authority has a process under which it will take on board a complaint and send out inspectors but it cannot vindicate an individual&rsquo;s rights.</P>
        <P>A citizen of County Louth who is terminally ill is in a nursing home.  The man is bed ridden but he is being charged, along with everyone else in the home following a round robin letter to family members, for &ldquo;outings, social events, music performances, physiotherapy clinics, exercise classes...&rdquo;.  The man, unfortunately, will not last much longer, yet his relatives are faced with a bill for more than &euro;1,000 extra per annum for his so-called care.  He cannot benefit from these activities.  Many other patients in the home with different medical conditions are faced with this demand for &euro;1,000 on top of what they are paying, which is disgraceful.</P>
        <P>Another nursing home in County Meath states in its contract of care that services are not covered by the NHSS standard fee.  An additional fee of &euro;40 per week covers a number of costs, including personal laundry.  There is a dispute as to whether clients should pay for their personal laundry.  A letter from the principal services officer for older people to the chief inspector of HIQA states clearly that laundry services are expressly included in the NHSS and, therefore, this charge should not apply.  The family of the resident to whom I refer has been instructed to take him out of the nursing home.  He is being kicked out of the home because his family is contesting an additional fee for something they are paying for.  I am deeply concerned about this because these people are being ripped off.  The patients are unwell and they are being put under significant emotional and financial pressure.  They are supposed to be cared for properly, yet the nursing homes that have been brought to my attention are breaking the law.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State needs to provide a new mandate in legislation whereby HIQA can hold nursing homes to account on the basis of individual complaints.  I am informed by the authority that its staff can only take on board what they see and hear during inspections.  Immediate action is need to stop this appalling rip-off of sick and terminally ill patients.  These are not two isolated cases.  The letter from the principal officer in the Department states:</P><Col N="363"/>
        <P LI="1" el="5">The Department has recently received a number of queries from families of residents in nursing homes.  These also centre on uncertainty regarding the fees due and payable by residents of nursing homes.  The Department is concerned that a number of nursing homes may be breaching both the regulations and the standards.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">It is over to the Minister of State to act and to amend the law.  We will facilitate that but he must vindicate the rights of the sickest and most vulnerable in our society when they are being ripped off in such an appalling manner by unscrupulous nursing home owners.</P>

      <Speaker pid="AndrewDoyle"><NameTxt>Deputy Andrew Doyle</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Reilly for bringing this important issue to the attention of the House.  It addresses two issues, the integrity of the Office of the Ombudsman and the right of vulnerable people and their families to use the facility of this office in the belief that they will secure a fair determination.  We have witnessed a concerted effort by the Government, the HSE and the Department of Health and Children to undermine the Ombudsman.  If this was a one-off event, we would say we have to do something about this but this is a case of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i> in the context of the behaviour of the Government towards the Ombudsman.  Recently, I proposed, as Fine Gael agriculture spokesperson, that the lost at sea scheme report by the Ombudsman be accepted by the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  Unfortunately, the Government sought to kill it and to bury it once and for all even though the facts are quite clear.</P>
        <P>The Ombudsman has defended her position in so far as she was asked to ascertain the difficulties that families had in getting long-term residential care for family members; to determine the stress that caused; to outline and highlight the tardiness in the way they were deal with by the Government; and to see if there is any onus on the Department or the HSE to recognise their level of governance was inadequate.  Unfortunately, we have had a concerted attempt to undermine the Ombudsman, who forwarded a rebuttal document to us this evening.  It is lengthy and it was impossible to digest it before the debate.</P>
        <P>However, her original report has come at an inconvenient time for the Department and the HSE.  There is a plan, which is not stated anywhere in policy, to take care of the elderly out of the public sector.  There is a determined effort to wind down the service using HIQA to starve excellent nursing homes all over the country of the resources they need to bring their facilities up to standard.  The authority is being used as the cannonball to close them down.  I witnessed a belt and braces job in this regard in Wicklow town in my constituency.  After years of working in consultation and co-operation with local people, who had raised hundreds of thousands of euro to support the local nursing home, a policy initiative was taken to close it.  A recently published HIQA report and a fire safety report confirmed there was no rationale behind this decision.  There was no communication with the residents or their families.  The final patient was removed last week following considerable distress, given the nearest facility is 10 km from the town.</P>
        <P>We were informed the fair deal scheme would be a wonderful panacea for everybody but it does not compare like with like.  Issues have not been addressed and, for example, Deputy O&rsquo;Dowd outlined hidden charges.  While many of the nursing homes are good, everything is up for grabs and they provide facilities on a pay per use basis.  No effort was made to refine and reform public service provision, which could provide every bit as good a service, if it was addressed.</P>
        <P>At the end of the day, this comes down to the public&rsquo;s belief that the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office can be used to determine whether the State has been fair regarding issues they have.  If it is to be rejected because it is inconvenient, we must question the point of having an Ombudsman at all.</P>

	<P>At the outset I thank all Deputies who contributed to the debate.  A number of Deputies have recognised the contribution of Deputy Fergus O&rsquo;Dowd and I will also do so.  I also recognise the number of years in which he has had an interest in the area.  I ask Deputies to consider the involvement and interest of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, in the care of the elderly.  The debate is not about the fair deal scheme or HIQA standards but it is worth remembering that whenever the Minister came before the Oireachtas committee dealing with health, they were the main issues on her agenda.  The fair deal scheme has been an answer to a very difficult problem.</P>
        <P>Many people this evening have based their thinking and speeches on the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme, using words such as vendetta, personal animosity and others which belittle the debate.  In this context I recognise the significant ability of the Minister for Health and Children and the Ombudsman.  By coincidence, the Ombudsman&rsquo;s mother hails from my hometown &mdash; I know the lady quite well &mdash; and the first Ombudsman also came from Mountmellick.  Notwithstanding such facts, it is very important to deal with this evening&rsquo;s issue.</P>
        <P>Many Deputies feel this is an attack on democracy and people have even suggested it is a dictatorship.  To my mind the Minister was purely refuting the allegations made by the Ombudsman that her Department failed to co-operate with the investigation.  I will use the few minutes I have to respond to this.</P>
        <P>Anybody who reads the Department&rsquo;s submissions and correspondence with the Ombudsman, which are freely available on the Department&rsquo;s website, will see that the Department made it clear on many occasions that it was available to fully co-operate with the Ombudsman in respect of any investigation within the parameters of the 1980 Act.  It is worth repeating the concerns outlined by the Minister to the House last evening regarding the content, scope and language of the report, as well as the way the investigation was undertaken and how its conclusions were disseminated via the media.  That is a very fair position to take and does not seek to diminish the Ombudsman&rsquo;s report; importantly, it brings clarity to the Government&rsquo;s position.  I underline that it was not an attempt to hide, as has been alleged.</P>
        <P>In order to bring balance to the debate, the Government at all times sought to balance co-operation with the Ombudsman with legal advice, as advised by the Ombudsman in other contexts.  There was also the issue of a right to defend the State against any litigation.  Many people have made the point that the Ombudsman is somehow above the State in the defence of citizens but surely the Minister has equal entitlement by way of defending the State against litigation.</P>
        <P>It is unfair that the Ombudsman would seek to portray this in such a negative and conspiratorial light, and that is where our difficulties lie.  There was no attempt to be conspiratorial and, importantly, there was an attempt to be open.  The Government made the point that the Ombudsman followed fair procedures in notification of subsequent investigations of the matter.  There was a refusal to supply the Department with a full report or, initially, anything more than a five page summary.  Comments made during the investigation by the Ombudsman clearly showed judgments had been reached and opinions formed prior to any final report or request for response from the Department.</P>
        <P>The report states that in a letter to the Department of 25 September 2009, the Ombudsman clarified that the actions being investigated did not include the Department&rsquo;s handling of the litigation concerning the right to be provided with inpatient services.  The Ombudsman rejected any suggestion that she acted outside her jurisdiction in undertaking this investigation and in defence of her own view she refers to what public sector ombudsman offices in other countries do, although I do not see the relevance of that, as well as what Irish Ombudsmen have done <Col N="365"/>for years.  As with the nursing home charges issue, a long-standing practice may still be <i>ultra vires</i>.  Regarding what the Ombudsman states is implicit in the ombudsman model adopted by the Oireachtas in 1980, the position seems somewhat at odds with her contention that the Department has disregarded the plain meaning of the wording of the 1970 Act.</P>
        <P>It is important to make the point that the Ombudsman has stated her investigation is based on many complaints received over 25 years.  There were an average of 48 complaints per year on nursing home type care.  It is important that this be seen in the context of an average nursing home population in excess of 20,000 in recent years.  I wish I had more time to put further explanations but I am thankful for my opportunity to contribute.</P>

      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="CatherineByrne"><NameTxt>Deputy Catherine Byrne</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Reilly for bringing this motion before the House this evening.  I commend the Ombudsman, Ms Emily O&rsquo;Reilly, on her investigation into the rights to nursing home care in Ireland.  She provides a voice for those people who find fault with the State&rsquo;s service and want answers, and she must be allowed to question Government policy in this and other areas.  It is very worrying that the Department of Health and Children and the HSE did not fully co-operate with the investigation.</P>
        <P>In 2004 there was a major scandal where elderly medical card holders had been illegally charged nursing home fees for many years.  The new report shows that once again the elderly have fallen victim to the bad management and administration of the health service.  This report, suitably titled Who Cares? An Investigation into the Right to Nursing Home Care in Ireland, examines the case of more than 1,000 older people who since 1985 could not access State nursing homes.  These people were forced to go to private nursing homes to avail of care at significant cost to themselves and their families.  It is appalling to read that so many people were denied the basic right to nursing home care in their communities in the State.</P>
        <P>Making the decision to place a loved one in care is very difficult, and none of us wants to see elderly parents or relatives having to move to a nursing home, likely not to return home.  We want our loved ones to be kept close to us, where we can care for them surrounded by neighbours and friends.</P>
        <P>When things go wrong, difficulties can arise, with illnesses involving dementia or physical disabilities in particular becoming so serious that help is required.  People seek the best place to ensure loved ones receive the best of care so that they do not become just a number in a nursing home.  We want these people to feel comfortable and treated like real human beings rather than left sitting in a chair all day.  We want our loved ones to be included in activities if possible and remain suitably alert and active for the time spent in these facilities.  Above all, they should not feel institutionalised or left alone.  We want to be able to visit them often and preserve a sense of family.  We should not forget those elderly people who do not have extended family to visit them, and who are at risk of being isolated because they have been removed from their home and community, where neighbours and friends call in on a regular basis.  Such people are especially vulnerable.</P>
        <P>Currently there are approximately 23,000 people in long-stay residential care in Ireland, with a third of them in public homes.  Public long-stay beds have dwindled in numbers, as indicated by other speakers, and are being replaced by private nursing homes.  They have lost funding and many have had to close.  The future of public nursing homes seems very bleak and I want to know what the Minister, Deputy Harney, is planning for their future.</P><Col N="366"/>
        <P>Like many people who work in communities and who care for people in their own homes, I believe the way forward is independent living.  We must keep elderly people at home in the area where they live or have grown up, where there is a link with families and friends.  Many elderly people only need a little helping hand to live well enough in their homes into their 80s and 90s.  Most elderly people want to be close to families and friends and be part of the community.  They like to be able to keep independence and dignity above all.  However, to properly support these people living at home we need the necessary services on the ground, such as public health nurses, social workers, physiotherapists and, above all, home help.  These services have been cut throughout the country and it is having a devastating impact on community care.  The Government needs to realise that investing in vital services in our communities at the level we want will save the State millions of euro.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DanNeville"><NameTxt>Deputy Dan Neville</NameTxt>
	<P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute and congratulate Deputy Reilly for introducing the motion.  The Government has ignored the rights of the elderly.  It does not recognise their contribution and the treatment of the Ombudsman&rsquo;s office reflects this.  The Office of the Ombudsman was set up as an independent, objective voice on behalf of the citizen.  When the Bill was introduced, I remember that Fianna F&aacute;il resisted it at every turn because it did not want an objective response and evaluation of the decisions made.  The office gives an objective opinion and recommendations outside of politics but the Government is threatening the status of this office, which it wants to undermine.</P>
        <P>The Ombudsman has highlighted the difficulties experienced by the families of people in nursing homes, including financial difficulties.  Many in nursing homes have been failed by the State.  The health boards and the Department have failed these people and their families in regard to their duties under the law.  This is the focus of the motion.  The criticisms of HIQA and the standard of inspection of nursing homes are misplaced.  It is one year since the inspection regime was set up and two of its objectives are to change the culture of care and to raise standards in nursing homes.  A nursing home should be a home from home, not a geriatric ward.</P>
        <P>On the issue of restraint, many nursing homes never use restraint but some do.  Raising the standards of the HIQA inspection process will improve standards throughout the nursing home regime, which will contribute to a better quality of life and more of a home from home atmosphere in our nursing homes.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, must consider the issue of brain injury and mental health impairment among young people resident in nursing homes.  These people are conditioned to respond like geriatrics in their latter years.  It is inappropriate that young people with brain injury or intellectual difficulties should be in nursing homes.  There should be dedicated services for people in such a position.  Nursing homes should meet people&rsquo;s needs rather than seeing them only as an investment for the proprietor, although the trend is moving in that direction.</P>
        <P>On the issue of the geriatric elderly in mental institutions, it is totally inappropriate that those who are elderly and require nursing home care are in psychiatric institutions.  I understand that at present there are 1,000 people &mdash; I say &ldquo;people&rdquo; as they are probably no longer patients &mdash; in long-stay psychiatric homes who should effectively be in a nursing home environment because they no longer need the psychiatric intervention they previously needed.  Many are elderly, long-term patients and in some ways they are in the homes for social reasons.  This also applies to intellectually challenged people who are in long-stay psychiatric nursing homes.  It is an issue that needs be addressed.  I have costed the saving to the mental health services, in <Col N="367"/>which I know the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, is interested, and this would be well over &euro;35 million.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrJamesReilly"><NameTxt>Deputy James Reilly</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank all those who contributed to the debate.  From what the Minister said yesterday, I would like to know what information the Ombudsman sought in 2009 but which was not supplied and was <i>ultra vires</i>, according to the Minister.  The Minister also referred yesterday to the good people working in the Department of Health and Children, of whom I know there are many.  However, I would like a reassurance that none of those in the Department of Health and Children who dealt with this issue were those who dealt with the medical card issue, as they certainly did not serve the public in a manner in which they should have in colluding with successive Governments to deprive people of care to which they were entitled.</P>
        <P>Deputy Mary O&rsquo;Rourke referred earlier to Loughloe House, which I visited.  As I recall, a HIQA report itemised ten issues around that situation, many of which concerned staff and management, not the building itself, yet it was used as an excuse to begin to move people out of it, despite the fact that they considered it to be their home and without consideration for the relationships they had formed.  I have a clear memory of one man who shares my name who suffered a stroke not long afterwards due to the stress he was put under, yet the HSE continued to move out the people.</P>
        <P>One of my colleagues raised the issue of privatisation in regard to the Dublin fire brigade service.  That is the approach of the HSE.  When HIQA identified problems with a service, instead of fixing it, the HSE closed it down.  On the Dublin fire brigade issue, it is a question of money being paid over for the services provided by Dublin City Council and, instead of fixing it, the answer is to close it down and deprive people of an essential service because the State will not pay the money.  Other speakers made the point that 20 years ago there were twice as many people in public facilities as in private but it is now the reverse.</P>
        <P>I congratulate the Ombudsman and her office and I commend her courage.  Equally, however, I abhor the Minister&rsquo;s attack on the Ombudsman and her office, in which she engaged again yesterday.  It is an office that defends people against this opaque Government and its servants.  All we need do is look at the extraordinary behaviour of the Taoiseach and his Ministers in the past week, denying the reality of the economic mess the country and the rest of the world sees reported but which the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, sees as fiction.  It is fiction on a Sunday and fact on a Thursday.  He and his buddy, the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, decry any knowledge of the impending bailout by the ECB and the IMF of the country&rsquo;s economy, which has been wrecked by the Tweedledee and Tweedledum of the two Brians.</P>
        <P>The Ombudsman&rsquo;s office is one of the few remaining champions of the people.  She highlighted in her report the lack of clarity in the law as it stands, and stated that while the nursing home support scheme might clarify eligibility, it does not clarify the situation regarding entitlement.  She continued by stating that poor legislation will be exploited in the courts, and the 400 cases before the courts are evidence of this.</P>
        <P>Questions remain.  Will the nursing homes support scheme fund of &euro;970 million remain untouched by this year&rsquo;s budget?  Will we again see waiting lists for nursing home care if the money runs out?  Other speakers referred to the nearly 2,000 people under the age of 65, such as those with early dementia, brain injury and other debilitating illnesses, whose entitlements are not clear.  We must get clarity on the entitlements of such people.  This can be done through legislation.  There is a Bill dealing with eligibility for services which could address this and it should be brought before the D&aacute;il as soon as possible.</P>
        <P>Ireland and its people face the darkest hour since the foundation of the State.  Our people are anxious and worried, and many are not sleeping due to great uncertainty created by the <Col N="368"/>disastrous policies of the Fianna F&aacute;il-Green Government.  They are flabbergasted by the self-delusion of the Taoiseach and his Ministers and their denial of the truth.  They become more disheartened when they see a people&rsquo;s champion, the Ombudsman, attacked and denigrated by Government.</P>
        <P>I have a message of hope for the people.  We will regain our Republic, rebuild our economy and get our people back to work but we need a general election to put in place a new Government that will give the leadership to do this, leadership that is clear and committed to the good of the country.  Such a Government would protect the office and independence of the Ombudsman, the rights of older people and all those who need long-term care.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <sTitle>Flood Relief</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="ChristyOSullivan"><NameTxt>Deputy Christy O&rsquo;Sullivan</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for accepting this matter on the Adjournment.  In November and December 2009, Skibbereen was hit by a series of floods which devastated the local community.  The effect of these events was threefold.  There was a major impact on the businesses of the town with some premises destroyed.  It resulted in the closure of some long-established family businesses and it is estimated that it cost the town approximately &euro;6 million.  Insurance obviously then became an issue, and within the town some businesses and residential holdings are finding it impossible to get cover, which is having a significant impact.  There is also the emotional toll.  Confidence is low as there is a fear that with each heavy fall of rain or high tide we could again experience the events of last year.  The local hospital was completely cut off.  The COPE Foundation building was damaged and it is currently looking for other premises.</P>
        <P>Since the flooding of last year the Minister of State, Deputy Martin Mansergh, has visited the town on more than one occasion.  He has been more than willing to meet and reassure us that the OPW will not be found wanting when it comes to funding.  The Minister of State is due to visit Skibbereen again this weekend to address the national flood forum, which is appropriate.  There is no doubt that he is committed to providing funding that will address this situation.  He has announced funding for Cork County Council to conduct a study that will identify the flood relief measures that will alleviate the flooding issues of Skibbereen.  We realise that the new sewerage scheme has made this necessary.  While this funding is welcome, my concern is about the amount of time this will take and what can be done in the interim.</P>
        <P>To the people of Skibbereen it appears as if nothing has happened since the events of last year and no work has been done on any section of the River Ilen this year.  This brings me to the main point of tonight&rsquo;s motion &mdash; that funding for minor flood relief works be provided immediately.  I understand that Cork County Council has made an application for an early warning system.  While I accept this is a necessary step, it will provide little relief to the people of Skibbereen because there is no work going on in the river.</P>
        <P>While the study to identify the major works is vital, I am confident along with the people of Skibbereen that there are at least three physical improvements that could be carried out prior to the results of any survey as follows.  There should be the selective removal of gravel, built up in the realigned channel between Kennedy Bridge, New Bridge and the Curragh Bridge.  This is high priority and would cost approximately &euro;100,000.  Improvements should be made to culverts crossing Mardyke Road at an estimated cost of &euro;10,000.  Existing culverts across Townshend Street should be extended and a new inlet chamber and screens upstream of Townshend Street should be constructed which would cost an estimated &euro;150,000.  The total cost of these the works would come to &euro;260,000, which is well within the figure announced by the Minister of State, Deputy Mansergh, for minor flood relief works.</P>
        <P>I have spoken at length with members of Skibbereen flood committee who are confident these works would make a significant difference and go a long way to reducing the risk of flooding.  It is reported that in a meeting between the OPW and Cork County Council it was stated that these measures would not be considered, but I urge the OPW to revisit this possibility.</P>
        <P>Throughout Munster, towns are benefiting from minor flood relief to complete necessary work which is testament to the OPW&rsquo;s commitment to flood relief.  I am asking for similar <Col N="372"/>flood relief measures to be carried out in Skibbereen immediately.  I am asking for the OPW to re-engage with Cork County Council and address the three issues I have outlined.  I would like to know if the relief schemes in Munster are being fully funded by OPW and if it is true that for Skibbereen it is suggested that 90% funding should come from the OPW with the additional funding coming from Cork County Council.  I want to know what is the status of the study that has been undertaken and if the three suggestions I have made will be given serious consideration.  It is vital that the people of Skibbereen can at last be confident that their plight is being addressed.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="DrMartinMansergh"><TitleTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Martin Mansergh</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Deputy for giving me an opportunity to update the House on the flooding issues in Skibbereen since I last spoke in the House on the matter in October.</P>
        <P>In the wake of the flooding of November 2009, I travelled around the Cork area to see at first hand and discuss the impact of the severe flooding.  I visited a number of locations in the county in January, including Skibbereen.  Having seen the damage and talked to many of the town&rsquo;s residents and business owners, I am acutely aware of the distress they suffered at that time and their concern that steps be taken quickly to prevent a recurrence.  I would like to assure them again of my determination to provide every assistance in that regard.</P>
        <P>The Office of Public Works is continuing to work in partnership with Cork County Council &mdash; as it is with most other local authorities &mdash; to assess, manage and find a solution to the flood problem experienced in the Skibbereen area.  The objective is to develop effective long-term flood relief works which will provide the required level of protection while also addressing any environmental issues.</P>
      <TimeSt down="4" idown="4">9 o&rsquo;clock</TimeSt>
        <P>In the aftermath of the November 2009 flood event, Cork County Council took the lead in addressing the flooding problem in the town by commissioning an initial scoping report from consultants.  The consultants reviewed and analysed the conclusions of previous works and reports on the problem and identified channel capacity and tidal factors as likely contributing factors.  A key recommendation of their report was that further, more detailed, analysis be undertaken which would take account of recent changes in the area, including urban development and climate change.</P>
        <P>As I explained previously, the council subsequently submitted a number of applications for funding in February of this year in respect of Skibbereen under the Office of Public Works minor flood mitigation works scheme, which provides funding for interim works to address minor localised flood problems where a solution has been identified or can be identified readily.  To qualify for funding, proposals must be economically viable and environmentally sustainable and should cost not more than &euro;500,000 in each case.  Deputy O&rsquo;Sullivan is correct that 90% of the funding is provided by the Office of Public Works while the local authority must put up 10%.  That applies throughout the country.  The applications submitted by the council for Skibbereen were in respect of, first, a study focused on the River Ilen; second, interim flood mitigation works; and third, a flood warning system.</P>
        <P>Following an assessment of the applications submitted by the council, the Office of Public Works allocated funding of &euro;120,000 in 2010 for a comprehensive flood risk and management study of the Ilen catchment for the purpose of determining the cause of the flooding problem in the town and to identify appropriate, cost effective solutions.  In addition to providing funding, the Office of Public Works provided substantial assistance for the council in developing the brief for the study.  The council has issued tender documents requesting submissions from consultants to carry out the study, and tenders are due at the end of this month.</P><Col N="373"/>
        <P>The council expects to be in a position to appoint the consultant in January 2011.  The study could take up to eight months to complete.  The council also invited separate tenders to undertake surveys of the river channel and flood plains.  The tenders received in this regard are currently being assessed and it is expected that the contract for this element will be awarded in the coming weeks.  An aerial survey of the study area has also been completed by the Office of Public Works.  The applications made by the council for interim mitigation works were assessed by the OPW, which found that the proposed works would be premature in the light of the forthcoming study and would not have a significant impact in reducing flood risk.  It remains the view of the Office of Public Works that the proposed study will provide the basis for developing effective permanent flood relief measures for Skibbereen.</P>
        <P>The issue is not political will or funding, as there is ample funding for minor relief works, but a technical assessment of what is the most effective way to proceed.  The weather in November so far has underlined the dangers at this time of the year.  In fact, I attended a budget Council meeting in Brussels on Monday and there had been severe flooding in Belgium over the weekend in which four people died.  There was also a consequential suicide.  I have also received reports this morning of severe flooding in Cornwall, which is much closer to Skibbereen.  The dangers and concern are well understood but we are anxious to prepare a thorough and effective scheme for Skibbereen as well as for Bandon.  People in other parts of the country that are prone to flooding understand that full protection will not be available until planned works are carried out and completed.  Unfortunately, the more ambitious and thorough the scheme, the longer the delay.</P>
        <P>As regards the issue of a flood warning system, Cork County Council earlier this year commissioned UCC to examine and report on the feasibility of a such a system for Skibbereen.  Based on the findings in UCC&rsquo;s report, the council has recently submitted a revised application under the minor works scheme for funding to implement a system in the town in advance of any significant structural works.  The UCC study identifies a number of system options which are currently being examined by OPW engineers, in consultation with the council as necessary.  A decision will be made on the application as soon as this assessment is complete.  At this stage it is not possible to give a definitive timescale for the implementation of any works or other measures recommended by the study.  The timescale would be influenced by a number of factors, including the scale of the proposed measures and the associated statutory or other consent processes.  Every effort will be made to progress their implementation as quickly as possible in line with normal procedure.</P>
        <P>Pending the implementation of any major flood relief scheme the study may recommend, it is still open to the council to develop and seek funding from the Office of Public Works under the minor works scheme for alternative proposals for minor mitigation works which the council considers worthwhile.  Any such applications that meet the criteria of the scheme will be given favourable consideration by the Office of Public Works.  I remain confident that the approach adopted the council and Office of Public Works offers the best prospect of identifying effective, viable and sustainable solutions to the flooding in Skibbereen.</P>
        <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I will be in Skibbereen on 20 November, at the invitation of the local flood committee to attend a forum on flooding which it has organised on that date.  That forum has a wider scope than just Skibbereen.  At the forum I will outline the role of the Office of Public Works in flood risk management as well as the various measures in train to address flooding issues throughout the country.  I will avail of the opportunity to engage with the residents and listen to their concerns.  As I said previously any suitable interim proposals put forward by the council will be given full consideration by the Office of Public Works.</P>

    <sTitle>Medical Cards</sTitle>
      <Speaker pid="MattieMcGrath"><NameTxt>Deputy Mattie McGrath</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter of huge importance.  It is a problem in the HSE primary care reimbursement service system that is preventing medical card patients from accessing their care and medication.  It must be rectified as a matter of urgency.</P>
        <P>I was shocked recently when a medical card holder informed me that she was charged by her doctor for visiting him as she was told her medical card was invalid.  She was then told by her chemist that she would have to pay for her medication.  Luckily, she had enough medication to last a few days until this problem was dealt it.  This patient was a medical card holder whose card was due for renewal.  A number of months ago she submitted all her documentation but due to the large backlogs in the local medical card office her review had not yet been dealt with.</P>
        <P>The medical card office has a policy that if a number of medical card reviews remain unprocessed on the last working day of each month, the unprocessed applications are rolled over into the next month.  This extends the medical card expiry date for another month to allow the review be finalised.  However, due to a glitch, it takes approximately four days for the primary care reimbursement service system to be updated and during these four days, the patient&rsquo;s medical card will be shown as &ldquo;card expired&rdquo; in the system.  That is a worrying and most unsatisfactory situation, particularly for the elderly.</P>
        <P>Unfortunately, my constituent was obliged to attend her doctor within these four days.  If she had not, she would not have been aware of this situation.  Her medical card was rolled over on the last day of October and when she attended her doctor four days later, she was told her card was expired.  This was just one of the 2,300 reviews rolled over in south Tipperary last month.  There were thousands more throughout the country.  I have great respect for the local health board officials who do their best but there is a glitch in the system which must be rectified.</P>
        <P>Having checked with the primary care reimbursement service I was informed that it was not its problem.  I then spoke with staff in the local office who informed me that they had updated their system on the last day of the month, four days previously, and that the primary care reimbursement service had not yet updated its system.  I was also informed that this was a very common problem.  I ask the Minister to examine this issue immediately and to try to rectify it.</P>

	<P>The medical card is a matter of life and death for many people.  Not having a medical card can have a very serious effect on a person&rsquo;s health.  The changes the Minister introduced recently with regard to the medical card, the general practitioner, GP, card, the centralised system for processing renewals and fresh applications and the new prescription levy for medical card holders have added to the confusion and delays in the system.  Why is it the case that the health system, above all else, has constant delays, queues, confusion, bureaucracy and waiting lists?  It is almost as though it is a purgatory which sick people have to endure before they are able to access medical care and their rights.  I find that many more people have come to my clinics in recent months regarding medical cards than I ever experienced before.  Much of that is a result of the new changes the Minister introduced.</P>
        <P>The situation is very depressing and worrying for people who have difficulties with applications and renewals.  The current system is such that it can take months to process them.  There are regular requests for additional information.  The official average time for appeals is now two months.  Documents go missing on a regular basis.  The elderly and the chronically ill suffer most and they have immediate needs which should be addressed.  A centralised system now operates on the north side of Dublin in a compound that is worthy of Fort Knox because it is impossible to get in and out of the place.  It created a bureaucracy that results in everybody <Col N="375"/>being put on the same conveyor belt when a local system with local information and local knowledge would produce instant results.</P>
        <P>In addition, the system does not do what is supposed to do, namely, provide a level playing field.  Rather, it discriminates against the elderly and chronically ill as they are most likely to have difficulty with filling out the application, renewal and appeal forms.  The Minister must realise that she is dealing with the most vulnerable of citizens.  An application processing system should reflect that rather than creating a centralised bureaucracy and pretending that all is well.</P>

	<P>I thank Deputies McGrath and Costello for raising this Adjournment matter, which I am taking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.</P>
        <P>Medical cards are provided to persons who, in the opinion of the HSE, are unable without undue hardship to arrange general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants.  The HSE, through its service plan for 2009, advised the Department of Health and Children of plans to introduce a centralised national processing centre for medical cards and community drugs schemes as part of the executive&rsquo;s value for money programme.  The decision to centralise the processing of all medical card and GP visit card applications and renewals to the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, in Dublin was in the context of the executive&rsquo;s requirements to make efficiencies in business practices that could realise savings in a very challenging economic environment and provide a modern service to the public within sustainable levels of expenditure.</P>
        <P>The initial phase of the centralisation process commenced in January 2009 with the PCRS processing all medical card applications for persons aged 70 or over.  The second phase commenced in September 2009 with the transfer of the case load from two local health offices in Dublin City to the PCRS.  The phased implementation has allowed the situation to be continuously monitored and, if required, modified to address any issues arising.  Under the centralisation plan, the HSE&rsquo;s local offices will continue to provide the public with assistance and information locally on medical card eligibility and making an application.  They will also provide information on the current status of their application or review.</P>
        <P>In June 2010 the HSE introduced a new website,<i> www.medicalcard.ie</i>, which enables people anywhere in the country to apply for a medical card through a simple and efficient application process.  Phased implementation of the centralisation project will allow the situation to be continuously monitored and, if required, modified to address any issues arising.  To date, the central PCRS office processed over 232,461 medical card applications and reviews of which 7,023 were unsuccessful, 186,512 medical cards were issued and further information is awaited in respect of 14,141 applications.  Some 7,534 applications are currently being assessed.</P>
        <P>The Minister for Health and Children in her letter to all members of the Oireachtas on the 19 January 2010 stated she fully supports the HSE&rsquo;s decision to centralise the medical card and GP visit card application and review process to one location.  The HSE has advised that when fully implemented this measure will deliver a number of improvements for medical card applicants.  Under the new arrangements, the HSE will improve turnaround times for the processing of applications.  The aim will be a turnaround time of 15 working days or less, with provision for emergency applications to be dealt with immediately.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB"><NameTxt>Deputy Joe Costello</NameTxt>
	<P>That is what the Minister said six months ago.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanConnick"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Connick</NameTxt>
	<P>The centralisation of applications will deliver consistent and equitable application of eligibility and service provision.  This measure will provide clearer governance and accountability, as well as improved management information.  Finally, the process will lead <Col N="376"/>to a reduction in the overall number of staff required to process medical and GP visit card applications, thus freeing up staff for other service needs.</P>
        <P>The decision to centralise the medical card application and review process to a central office will, when fully implemented, enhance the delivery of services provided to the public. It will also realise overall savings through the greater usage of shared services.  This decision is in line with the Government policy Transforming Public Services programmeannounced by the Taoiseach in November 2008.  The HSE has indicated that procedures are in place to ensure that gaps in eligibility, as described by Deputy McGrath, do not occur.  Each month the HSE PCRS updates the central national database on the day that the data is provided to them by local health offices.</P>
        <P>In cases where the local health office considers that a review of eligibility will require additional time to complete, then eligibility should be extended prior to the last month which prevents any gap in eligibility for the medical card holder.  The HSE is not aware of any such problems and if the specific details of the issue in question are passed to it, it will investigate the matter.  If the Deputy has information that a gap in eligibility has occurred in an individual case, the details should be forwarded to the HSE who will investigate it.  These individual cases suggest that the procedure to prevent eligibility gaps has not been uniformly implemented.  This problem does not arise in regard to the 39% of the medical card population that are being managed directly by the central office at PCRS.  This error will be eliminated altogether when the centralisation process is completed early next year.</P>

	<P>The Northside Community Law Centre was founded 35 years ago in Coolock to provide legal information, advice and representation, to protect and develop the human, social and economic rights of individuals and groups and to empower the northside community is through education, research and campaigns.</P>
        <P>The centre, known as the Coolock Community Law Centre until 2003, was modelled on community law centres which started in the United States as part of President  Johnson&rsquo;s war on poverty.  A key part of empowering local communities was to give control of such law centres to a management committee containing a built-in majority of community representatives.  The Northside Community Law Centre is governed by a voluntary board of directors, headed by the distinguished former county councillor Mr. Tom Brennan PC, with a majority of local directors.  For many years I was also a member of the centre.</P>
        <P>The centre, led by solicitor in charge Mr Colin Daly, provides a wonderful and invaluable range of services to constituents across its operational area of the constituencies of Dublin North-East and Dublin North-Central.  These services are freely and widely made available to citizens and families living on low wages and social welfare benefits.  In 2009, for example, the centre made its services available to 3,267 clients, including 975 information contacts, 1,639 advice contacts, 123 court representations, 267 community education contacts and 263 mediation cases.</P>
        <P>This onerous and impressive workload is set to be surpassed in 2010.  Like the other Deputies representing Dublin North-East and Dublin North-Central I regularly refer constituents to the centre for essential information and legal assistance.  The mediation service offered by the service, Mediation Northside, has been developed in an innovative manner by the centre and offers a critical mediation and conflict resolution service to families, communities and all our local agencies, including Dublin City Council.</P><Col N="377"/>
        <P>As with the mediation service, the centre has also long had a national profile for its pioneering community legal initiatives.  Among the more recent groundbreaking and successful cases on behalf of its clients are Caroline McCann <i>v. </i>Judge of Monaghan District Court and others of June 2010, and Pullen and others <i>v.</i> Dublin City Council of October 2009.  As a result of the McCann case the law relating to imprisonment for the failure to pay a civil debt was declared unconstitutional and the Pullen case established that the then eviction process for local authority tenant infringed the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
        <P>The centre has a very small and dedicated core staff, led by Mr Colin Daly and two other solicitors.  A feature of the centre&rsquo;s history has been the<i> pro bono</i> voluntary services of legal professionals and volunteers.  More than 40 solicitors and barristers volunteer with the law centre to help staff meet demand and volunteers also carry out the important work of the mediation service.</P>
        <P>There are grave concerns among my constituents that funding for the centre will be cut in budget 2011.  The centre&rsquo;s 2009 annual report shows a serious reduction in income of more than &euro;150,000 from a then 2008 budget of under &euro;700,000.  This time last year, there were fears that the 2010 budget would further reduce the centre&rsquo;s department of social protection grant.  Thankfully, at the time the Minister accepted the strong case made for the law centre&rsquo;s vital work made last November.  In recent years, as I saw on my recent visit to the Northside Community Law Centre, costs have been cut to the bone.  Any reduction in grant income for 2011 would imperil the fundamental role and service of the centre.  Given its hugely dedicated and much appreciated service to the people who sent me to the D&aacute;il, and my colleagues, I urge the Minister, Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v, to ensure that the Department of Social Protection&rsquo;s grant to the law centre will not be cut for 2011 and that the service will be protected as a key instrument of public policy for the people of these two D&aacute;il constituencies.</P>
        <P>I agree completely with Mr. Jonathan Friedland who, in today&rsquo;s <i>Guardian</i> newspaper, castigated the savage Tory and Liberal Democrat government&rsquo;s cuts to legal aid in England.  Mr. Friedland said that equality before the law has to mean equal access to the law.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanConnick"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Connick</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy Broughan for raising this matter.  The Northside Community Law Centre is an independent, community-based legal centre.  Its mission is to protect the rights of individuals and groups from within the Dublin North-Central and Dublin North-East areas.  It does this by providing free information, advice and legal representation services to individuals and groups in its community who may otherwise not be able to get legal services.  The centre also works to support its local community through education, research and campaigns.</P>
        <P>Operating since 1975, the NCLC was the first community law centre in the State.  It is not part of the State civil legal aid scheme.  The centre is currently located in the Northside civic centre, Bunratty Road, Coolock, Dublin 17.  The centre is a company limited by guarantee and is a registered charity.  It is governed by a voluntary board of directors elected from the membership of the centre.  It employs a number of full time solicitors and support staff.</P>
        <P>Since its establishment the Northside Community Law Centre has, at various times, been funded by a number of separate agencies, including the Department of Justice and Law Reform, the Eastern Health Board and the Combat Poverty Agency.</P>
        <P>In 1995, the Department of Social Protection, as it is now, assumed responsibility for funding the centre at a time when its future was in jeopardy.  Funding is provided to the centre under the scheme of grants for the development and promotion of information and welfare rights.  Applications for grants are made by way of completing and submitting an application form annually.  The Department has invested significant funding to the Northside Community Law <Col N="378"/>Centre over the years in support of the services it provides within the Dublin North-Central and Dublin North-East areas.  To date in 2010, funding of some &euro;386,000 has been approved to the centre.</P>
        <P>In considering previous applications for funding, the Department of Social Protection advised the centre to secure funding from more appropriate revenue sources in the public and private sectors.  While acknowledging that progress has been made by the centre in developing additional revenue streams through its own work in recent years, the Department remains the primary funder.</P>
        <P>In 2009, the centre raised additional funding of some &euro;135,000 from sources such as the Law Society of Ireland, Dublin City Council and fees generated from community education and mediation-related courses.  With regard to continued funding by the Department of Social Protection, applications for funding in 2011 will be considered early next year, giving due consideration to the financial resources available to the Department at that time.  Officials from the Department of Social Protection will meet the Northside Community Law Centre to discuss this further at that time.  In this regard the Department will contact the organisation shortly.</P>

      <Speaker pid="PadraicMcCormack"><NameTxt>Deputy P&aacute;draic McCormack</NameTxt>
	<P>Real fears have been expressed about the possibility of diseased oyster seed being imported into the country from contaminated oyster hatcheries abroad, particularly from France.  The marine environment and food safety services in the Marine Institute at Oranmore have confirmed that the oyster herpes virus has been found in up to 17 locations in various coastal areas around the country.  There is therefore genuine concern in my constituency of west Galway about the possibility of contaminated oyster seed being brought in.</P>
        <P>The oyster beds in Streamstown Bay, Kill Bay and the Claddaghduff, Cleggan areas of County Galway &mdash; on the north-west Connemara coast &mdash; are free of the disease, even though there was contamination in the nearby Mannin Bay area, with which I am familiar.  There are a number of small oyster farmers in that north-west Connemara area who generate hundreds of thousands of euro worth of oysters every year.  France is the main export outlet for our mature oyster crop.  Even though there is a local hatchery in the area, some oyster seed may still be imported because of the trade links that have been built up over years in that area.</P>
        <P>Controls are in place concerning the importation of oysters.  While not totally prohibited any such importation is subject to certification by the relevant competent authority in the country of origin of the disease-free status of the consignment.  I am not happy with that and neither are the oyster farmers.  It amounts to self-regulation by the exporting country.  Notwithstanding this provision, the Marine Institute also encourages producers to avoid importing oysters from contaminated areas.  Furthermore, in the case of importation of oysters from abroad generally, producers are strongly advised to submit samples of the oyster to the Marine Institute for testing prior to importation.</P>
        <P>That is all very well but it is a voluntary system.  If possible, however, the Minister should make it compulsory to certify such samples at the Marine Institute in Oranmore, County Galway.  The institute is competent to undertake that type of work and already does so on behalf of oyster farmers in the area.</P>
        <P>It has been confirmed that a number of bays have been affected this year.  Mannin Bay was temporarily closed and was only reopened approximately a month ago.  It caused real concern to other fisheries in that area, however.  Meanwhile, Streamstown Bay and Kill Bay in the Sky Road area have not been affected by the herpes virus and farmers who are cultivating oysters <Col N="379"/>there want to keep it that way.  They want the Government and Brussels to put controls in place to protect bays that have not yet been hit by the herpes virus.</P>
        <P>I make it clear that the herpes virus has no impact on the health and safety of humans through consumption.  It kills oysters and could wipe out 50% to 100% of the oyster beds where such contaminated seed is imported.  At least 20 people are employed in that area of north-west Connemara as oyster farmers or helpers.  If the disease gets into that area it will have a devastating effect on the livelihood of a large number of people where there are few other employment opportunities except farming and fishing.</P>
        <P>The Minister of State should endeavour to put in place compulsory testing of imported oyster seed by environmental experts in our Marine Institute.  This would solve the problem entirely, thus satisfying people that the disease cannot be brought in here.  As the Minister of State acknowledged, it has occurred in up to 17 oyster farms in coastal areas throughout the country.</P>
      </Speaker>
      <Speaker pid="SeanConnick"><NameTxt>Deputy Se&aacute;n Connick</NameTxt>
	<P>I thank Deputy McCormack for raising this issue, which we have discussed on several occasions.  Prevention and control of the oyster herpes virus is a matter of high priority for my Department.  Our current approach to this matter is to take all appropriate steps to minimise the risk of infection, while allowing trade in oysters to continue.  This approach is supported by the aquaculture industry.</P>
        <P>The importation of oyster seed is integral to the Irish oyster growing industry as there is not enough Irish seed to support the industry.  The industry relies on imports, mainly from France, but also from the UK and the Channel Islands.</P>
        <P>The European Commission has made a regulation, No. 175 of 2010, in line with the Fish Health Directive No. 88 of 2006, specifying measures which must be taken by member states to deal with the oyster herpes virus issue.  It is important to note that the oyster herpes virus has no impact on human health, but can cause significant mortality in Pacific oysters.  The Marine Institute is the competent authority in Ireland for the implementation of the fish health directive pursuant to Statutory Instrument No. 261 of 2008 and was involved in the negotiation of the regulation on the oyster herpes virus which came into effect on 15 March 2010.  The regulation requires a surveillance programme to be established for the early detection of the virus in areas that have not previously been affected.  It also requires containment areas to be established once the virus is detected in an oyster growing area, until such time as the mortalities subside and two mortality checks, 15 days apart, demonstrate that mortality has ceased.</P>
        <P>There are currently four containment areas in Ireland: Caherciveen-Valentia, County Kerry; Carlingford Lough, County Louth; Cork Harbour, County Cork; and Sherkin, County Cork.  Over the course of 2010, 14 areas were affected that are now out of containment, that is, the increased mortalities have ceased in these bays.  These are Loughras Beg, Donegal Bay, Dungloe Bay, Lough Swilly, Lough Foyle, Trawbreaga Bay and Trawenagh Bay, all in County Donegal; Clew Bay and Achill Sound, both in County Mayo; Mannin Bay, County Galway; Cromane, County Kerry; Ballymacoda Bay, Youghal, County Cork; and Dungarvan Harbour and Woodstown Bay, County Waterford.  The legislation allows oysters to be traded between containment areas.  In order to import oysters to an area not previously affected by the virus the oysters must come from another area of similar health status.  Under the legislation, oysters can also be imported from a containment area or an area previously affected by the virus provided they test negative in line with methods in the regulation and certified by the competent authority.</P>
        <P>Controls are in place on the importation of oysters from containment areas, such as diseased areas in Ireland or abroad, to areas not previously affected.  While not totally prohibited, any such importation is subject to certification by the relevant competent authority in France of <Col N="380"/>the disease free status of the consignment.  In other words, before any stock can be imported, testing as laid down in the regulation must take place, and be certified by the competent authority in France, and the resulting certificate must be provided to the Marine Institute before a movement can take place.  Any movement outside these parameters is illegal.</P>
        <P>In addition, the Marine Institute also encourages producers to avoid importing oysters from containment to surveillance areas.  Furthermore, in the case of importation of oysters from abroad generally, producers are strongly advised to submit samples of the oysters to the Marine Institute for testing prior to importation.  I strongly encourage producers to avail of the offer from the Marine Institute to test the oysters when they arrive in Ireland prior to stocking.  My Department, in conjunction with the Marine Institute, will continue to take all appropriate measures to protect Irish oyster stocks from this virus.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 46 and 50 together.</P>
        <P>While An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has made significant progress in the investigation of a number of killings, the reality is that there can be considerable difficulties in obtaining evidence in shootings which are the result of gangland activities from associates of a victim of a gangland killing, or indeed from gangland figures even when they themselves are the victims of violence.  It has also to be accepted that there is often no connection or personal association between the victim and the perpetrator, which makes it very difficult for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in their investigation of such a murder.  Witnesses may also be subject to high levels of intimidation not to come forward, and it is to assist such witnesses that the Witness Protection Programme is in place.  I am including in my reply a tabulated statement showing the figures by year. Figures are operational and liable to change.</P>
        <P>I am, of course, deeply concerned about the incidence of gang related murders and I deplore all such killings.  All killings, regardless of the circumstances involved, are the subject of rigor<Col N="382"/>ous investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and will continue to be so.  In setting the policing priorities for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2010, I asked the Commissioner to continue the focus of the force on serious crime, in particular organised crime.  This priority is also reflected in the Garda policing plan for this year, and specific initiatives, including under Operation Anvil and involving members of the Emergency Response Unit, have been put in place.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that multi-agency approaches have been and continue to be used where Garda National Units &mdash; the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Garda Technical Bureau &mdash; are used to combat serious crime, including gangland crime.  These Units are also supported by the Security and Intelligence Section which assists with intelligence briefings and timely information.</P>
        <P>This integrated approach adopts best practice in implementing a coordinated use of Garda resources and using available criminal legislation to its fullest extent.  Operations are reviewed on an ongoing basis to ensure their effectiveness.  These specific initiatives are in addition to the activities of all members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in implementing and enforcing the criminal law.</P>
        <P>It was in that overall context that I introduced greatly strengthened legislation in the area of organised crime which is being fully utilised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009, the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the Criminal Procedure Act 2010.  To date, eight individuals have been charged under the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act of directing the activities of a criminal organisation or participating or contributing to certain activities.  Other offences against the legislation are under investigation.</P>
        <P>I have introduced further significant legislative proposals in the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Bill, and I will not hesitate to introduce additional measures if that becomes necessary.<b>  </b>In addition, I have secured Government approval to commence work on a new Bail Bill to consolidate and update bail law with a view to presenting a clear, accessible and modern statement of the law.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest> the total number of members of the Garda Reserve recruited to date; the stations to which they have been allocated; the total number of applicants for the reserve currently training; if he is satisfied with the rate of recruitment; when he expects that the full complement of 1,500 will be in place; if any restrictions have been placed on recruitment to the reserve arising from budgetary restrictions; his plans to undertake the review of the operation of the Garda Reserve, as recommended in the Report of the Garda Inspectorate on Resource Allocation; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that the personnel strength of the Garda Reserve, on the latest date for which figures are readily available, was 623 with a further 184 in training. The stations to which these Reserve members are set out in the table below.</P>
        <P>The Government has set a target strength for the Reserve at 10% of the full time strength of the Force.  While recruitment is ongoing, the Garda Reserve depends on volunteers who undertake their training and other duties during their free time and it is therefore difficult to predict how many people will commence training in any particular period. However, I can assure the Deputy and the House that the Garda Commissioner is continuing recruitment with the objective of reaching that target and over 80 members of the Garda Reserve are due to graduate in the Garda College in Templemore next Friday 26th November.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that the moratorium on recruitment and appointments in the public service does not apply to the Garda Reserve, as members are volunteers and do not draw a salary.  I am very satisfied with the current rate of recruitment and there has been a significant increase in the number of expressions of interest lodged with the Public Appointments Service.</P>
        <P>The Garda Commissioner is responsible for determining the range of powers and duties of Reserve members, and I am sure that he will keep these under review in line with the recommendation of the Inspectorate.</P>
        <P>The Government is strongly committed to the development of the Reserve.  It has been a very successful initiative and I am confident that it will continue to flourish into the future.</P>

        <Quest> his views on whether staffing levels within the Probation Service are sufficiently adequate to deal with any increase in the service&rsquo;s workload following the passing of the Fines Bill or other proposed legislation which will impact on their work and to cope with the increased use of community service orders into the future. </Quest>

	<P>The Probation Service  of my Department is the lead agency in the assessment and management of offenders in our communities.  In common with the rest of the Civil Service, the Probation Service is subject to the Government&rsquo;s moratorium on recruitment and promotion and its staff also have access to the Incentivised Career Break and   Early Retirement schemes.  Where vacancies do arise, the Probation Service is required to further prioritise its workload.</P>
        <P>When the Probation Service was restructured five years ago, emphasis was placed on working with higher risk offenders and juvenile offenders and in developing the Community Service system as an effective alternative to custody.  These remain the priority areas for the Probation Service.  Indeed, I understand your party colleague and Justice spokesman received a detailed briefing from the Probation Service very recently on the work of the Service.  I trust this gave the Deputy a good overview of the important work which the Probation Service undertakes.  I am on record as commending the important work they do which includes a strong emphasis on enhancing public safety in the community.</P>
        <P>As part of this re-focussing of its work, the Deputy will be aware that the Probation Service benefited from the provision of an increased level of resources during the restructuring period.  This has meant that despite the impact of the Moratorium and other associated measures the number of staff working in the Service is still greater than at the end of 2006 and only marginally less than at the end of 2007.  The overall number of staff in the Probation Service increased by more than 15% over the years 2007 and 2008 following a targeted programme of recruitment on foot of a Government Decision to approve an additional 71 professional and administrative posts for the Service.  The majority of these posts were professional positions at Probation Officer level or higher.</P>
        <P>I can inform the Deputy that my Department has obtained Department of Finance sanction to recruit 8 Probation Officers and 3 Community Service Supervisors.  This followed the making of special cases for these front-line posts to be treated as exceptions to the current Moratorium on recruitment in the civil and public service.</P>
        <P>The independent Value for Money Review of Community Service published by me in October 2009 found that  the Scheme was not being used to the extent that it had been in the past. Furthermore, it found that the Community Service Supervisors then employed, operating at full capacity, could provide supervision services to three times as many offenders as were then on Community Service Orders.</P>
        <P>Based on this, and other recommendations contained in the review, the Probation Service of my Department is leading the drive to substantially increase the number of persons that could potentially be placed on Community Service. The Probation Service has restructured the delivery of Community Service nationally under the governance of a dedicated Community Service Unit and has piloted a new model of delivery of Community Service in the Dublin area between January and September 2010.</P>
        <P>The recruitment of the new Probation Officers and Community Service Supervisors, which is currently underway, is further evidence of the priority attention being given to the important work of the Probation Service generally and will serve to bolster the delivery of its front-line services.</P>
        <P>Probation Service management prioritises its workload and allocates its resources in such a way as to maximise its efficiency and effectiveness.  This prioritisation includes particular focus on the delivery of front-line services and the supervision of Community Service Orders.  The Deputy can be assured that my Department and Probation Service management are keeping <Col N="388"/>the situation under constant review to ensure that the resources at the disposal of the Service are managed as effectively and efficiently as possible.</P>

        <AskConj> asked the </AskConj>
        <askee>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest> the reason the creation of 900 civilian posts within the garda&iacute; has resulted in the release of only 144 Garda personnel for frontline policing duties, as highlighted in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General; the steps he will take to ensure greater use of civilian personnel, as recommended in the recent report of the Garda Inspectorate on Resource Allocation; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As the Comptroller and Auditor General report acknowledges, increased civilian support for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does not exclusively take the form of one-for-one replacement of individual Garda&iacute; by civilian staff. Of course, in some instances, civilianisation does indeed enable the direct replacement of Garda&iacute; who are engaged in exclusively clerical, administrative or technical duties by civilian staff. In a great many other cases, however, it allows Garda&iacute; who would otherwise have to devote a substantial part of their working day to performing administrative duties to focus exclusively on front-line policing duties.  Civilian staff may also be recruited to perform new or expanded administrative, managerial and professional support roles in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, for example as crime analysts or IT specialists. This in itself can indirectly free up Garda&iacute; for operational duty.  </P>
        <P>The report also notes that the recently established Garda Information Services Centre in Castlebar, which is staffed by civilians, has freed up as many as 265 Garda&iacute; on a daily basis, as they no longer have to personally input details of incidents onto PULSE.</P>
        <P>It is also the case that some of the additional civilian staff, for example those allocated to the expanded Garda Central Vetting Unit in Thurles, are performing a vital role which would otherwise have had to be undertaken by Garda&iacute; redeployed from operational duty.  This also needs to be factored into any calculations.</P>
        <P>Of course I want to see the maximum number of Garda&iacute; allocated to frontline operational duties, and I know that the Commissioner fully shares this objective.  In that context, it is helpful that the whole time equivalent number of civilians in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has increased from 1,688 at the end of 2007 to approximately 2,100 at the present time.</P>

	<P>As  I have indicated to the House on more than one occasion, my Department has met with representatives of Justice for the Magdalenes during which there has been an exchange of views.  My Department has offered &mdash; and will continue  to offer &mdash; every assistance possible to allow access to the limited available <Col N="389"/>records in the normal way.  It behoves all of us to have regard to the age profile of the group of women who spent time in Magdalen Laundries and for this reason my Department remains open to considering any further assistance by, for example, the continued sharing of records that might be provided to the many elderly survivors and/or the families of people who were in these institutions. <b></b></P>
        <P>Section 9 of the Human Rights Commission Act, 2000 provides a statutory mechanism where the Human Rights Commission may conduct an enquiry into any relevant matter.  I understand that in June of this year, the Justice for Magdalenes (JFM)) group formally requested the Commission to carry out such an enquiry into the treatment of women and girls who resided in Magdalen Laundries.  The Commission published their assessment of that request on 9 November, 2010.  The Government has noted that the Human Rights Commission decided not carry to out a statutory enquiry itself as requested by the Justice for Magdalenes group and as it is entitled to do under the legislation which established it.</P>
        <P>Subsequent to its publication, the report was the subject of an Adjournment Debate in this House on that same evening (9 November, 2010) .  As outlined to the House in that Debate, the report raises issues for consideration by a range of Government Departments.  My Department has begun a preliminary analysis of the report.  I am sure the House and the Deputy will appreciate that it would be wrong to pre-empt the findings that will emerge from this analysis.</P>

	<P>Earlier this year I sought the views of the Garda Commissioner, in light of experience gained in current and past investigations of white collar crime, on what changes in the law which might be beneficial in this area.  The Commissioner&rsquo;s report contained a number of proposals which have implications for various areas of the law.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I am precluded from giving details of discussions which have taken place at Government on the subject of white collar crime, but I can tell him that a Group of Ministers &mdash; myself, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation and the Minister for the Environment &mdash; as well as the Attorney General have met with the remit of considering the report from the Garda Commissioner and general issues relating to white collar crime.  We have issued directions to our Secretaries General and Director General about taking forward these matters and reporting back to the group.</P>
        <P>It may also be of interest to the Deputy that I published a discussion document entitled Organised and White Collar Crime on 22 October, 2010, as part of the consultation process leading to a White Paper on Crime.  This followed consultations with other relevant Departments.</P>
        <P>My colleagues and I, both in the format of the Group which has been established, as well as bilaterally and at Government, will, of course, continue to pursue these issues.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Annual Report on the Garda Diversion Programme for 2009 indicates that there was a reduction of 13% in the number of incidents referred to the Programme, and a reduction of 14% in the number of children referred to it, during that period. As regards alcohol-related offences, there was a reduction of 22% in the number of such offences compared with 2008. This suggests that the Government&rsquo;s approach to tackling alcohol-related offences, and associated anti-social behaviour, is proving effective and I want to congratulate the Garda&iacute; for their work in this area.</P>
        <P>The sale of alcohol products to underage persons is already prohibited under licensing law. It is an offence under section 31(2) of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988 for a license holder to sell or deliver, or permit another person to sell or deliver, intoxicating liquor to a person under 18 years. This applies equally to premises with off-licences, including supermarkets, convenience stores and similar outlets, and those with on-licences such as public houses. The penalties for selling or delivering alcohol products to under-18s, originally set out in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988, were substantially increased in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008. On conviction for a first offence, a mandatory closure order of between 2 and 7 days will be imposed together with a fine of up to &euro;3,000. The penalties for a second, or subsequent, offence is a closure order of between 7 and 30 days and a fine of up to &euro;5,000. In addition, the licensee is required to continue to pay staff for the duration of the closure period.</P>
        <P>The Intoxicating Liquor Act 2008 also provided the Gardai with significant additional powers to address the problem of alcohol sales to underage persons. Section 14 contains provisions which allow a Garda who believes with reasonable cause that such a person possesses a bottle or other container containing intoxicating liquor which is being, or is intended to be, consumed by him or her to seize and remove the container.</P>
        <P>Section 14 of the 2008 Act also makes provision for the test purchasing of alcohol products. The primary objective of the scheme, which entered into force on 1 October 2010, is to enable the Gardai to target those licensed premises which are suspected of engaging in illegal sales to young people. This scheme will provide them with an additional instrument in their overall enforcement programme.</P>
        <P>As regards additional measures to combat home deliveries of alcohol products to underage persons, I have already announced my intention to make it an explicit offence in the forthcoming Sale of Alcohol Bill for a third party, e.g. courier or taxi, to deliver alcohol to an underage person. I am also considering the possibility of introducing a &lsquo;test delivery&rsquo; scheme to complement the test purchasing scheme. It would cover both home deliveries to under 18s and deliveries to any person where, contrary to the law, payment for the alcohol product is accepted on delivery.</P>
        <P>As regards the labelling of alcohol containers, section 22 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 already provides for the making of regulations to specify particulars to be displayed on containers which are adequate to enable the licensee and the licensed premises concerned to be identified. However during consultations between my Department and the Attorney General on implementation of section 22, the Attorney expressed serious doubts about the evidential value of possession of a labelled container by an under-18 year old. For example, the container might have been taken from the home by the underage person, or legally sold to a person over <Col N="391"/>18 years and passed on to the underage person. This has cast serious doubt on the benefits to be gained from any regulations that might be made under the 2003 Act.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The report of the Working Group on transparency in commercial rent reviews was published on 17 August.  The Group which I established had representatives from all of the key stakeholders in the commercial property market.  They have all signed up to the Report and I am confident that there is a willingness to implement its recommendations.  </P>
        <P>The Working Group recommended the establishment of a public database containing relevant details of letting arrangements and rent reviews in the commercial property market.   As I indicated during the course of the recent Second Stage debate on the Property Services (Regulation) Bill 2009, an appropriate amendment is being developed within my Department for inclusion in that Bill which would see the Property Services Regulatory Authority being given responsibility for the management of the database.  Work is ongoing in relation to finalising the precise operational details pertaining to that database.</P>
        <P>Also amongst the recommendations is the adoption, by landlords and tenants alike, of the rent review arbitration code which is appended to the report and which is intended to achieve a uniform and transparent procedure for the resolution of disputes in the sector.  I have publicly endorsed the Group&rsquo;s recommendation in this area and I have been in contact with bodies which were represented on the Group to encourage them to commit to the code.  I am happy to say that a number of those bodies have already done so.</P>
        <P>I am very much aware of the problems which confront the retail and small business sectors and I am determined to do all that is within my power to improve matters for those sectors, insofar as my particular areas of responsibility are concerned.  The Deputy will be aware that I introduced legislation, Section 132 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009, the effect of which is that   future rent review clauses will be construed as providing that the rent can go up, down or remain the same by reference to the rent payable immediately  prior to the review date.  For legal reasons the provision does not have retrospective effect.  I have no plans for further legislation in this area.</P>
        <P>My colleagues in Government are also fully committed to taking such measures as are within their powers to allievate the burden on the retail sector.</P>

	<P>I am now considering a report from my officials on a proposed policy for the better regulation of gambling.  Following my consideration of the report, I will make the necessary arrangements to bring it before the <Col N="392"/>Government.  I have previously stated that it is my intention to publish the policy proposals which will be based on an examination of the submissions received as a result of the consultation process, as well as the recommendations contained in the Report of the Casino Committee, <i>Regulating Gaming in Ireland</i>, and, of course, consideration of modern gambling regulation.  Pending a decision on the matter by the Government, I do not intend to make any further comment on the substance of the document under consideration.</P>
        <P>I have not had any discussions with my officials in relation to the specific proposed venture in Co Tipperary.  Neither have I had any discussions with any lobbyist for the developer, or indeed with the developer himself.  I have been scrupulous in any dealings I have had in this matter since launching the review of gambling in May 2009.  I am extremely conscious that there are strong views held on all sides; those who feel the market only should dictate how, where and when people might choose to gamble, on the one hand, to those, on the other hand, who quite legitimately point out the dangers associated with problem gambling.</P>
        <P>As I have said more than once, my objective is to arrive at a code that recognises the fact that adults do gamble, that for many of them, indeed for the majority of them, gambling is an enjoyable past-time.  However, problem gambling is also a fact and has the potential to ruin lives.</P>
        <P>We must live in the real world: no gambling would mean no problem gambler, but that is not a feasible proposition as it would simply be driven underground.  It is much better that gambling is regulated, that it is fair, that it is conducted honestly, and that children and the vulnerable are protected.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that in 2010 (to 12th November) there have been 181 incidents involving suspected grenades, pipe-bombs or other improvised devices nationwide at which a Defence Forces Explosive Ordnance Device team has attended, with 196 such incidents recorded in 2009, 180 recorded in 2008 and 98 recorded in 2007.  I am further informed that in respect of the incidents that occurred between 2008 to 2010 (to 12th November), a total of 27 cases are currently before the courts.  In addition, a further 46 investigation files have been submitted to the DPP.</P>
        <P>The use of explosive devices and firearms by criminal gangs is a matter of ongoing concern both to me and to the Garda Authorities.  Garda strategies in counteracting these activities are very firmly focused on disrupting the criminal groups which are involved and, where sufficient evidence is available, proffering charges and bringing such persons before the Courts.</P>
        <P>I have also put in place strong legislative measures to further strengthen the law dealing with those involved in criminal organisations.  The Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 created the offence of directing or controlling a criminal organisation with a penalty of a maximum sentence of life imprisonment and increased the maximum penalty for the offence of partici<Col N="393"/>pation or involvement in organised crime from 5 years to 15 years imprisonment.  The Act also increased the penalty for witness and jury intimidation, provides for expert Garda opinion evidence on the existence and operations of criminal gangs to be admissible in evidence and provides for organised crime offences to be tried in the Special Criminal Court.</P>
        <P>Other significant legislation introduced to target organised crime includes the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009, which provides a statutory framework for evidence obtained by means of covert surveillance to be used in criminal trials, and the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 which further tightens the legislative provisions relating to guns and knives and similar weapons.</P>

	<P>I am aware of a paper published by the Health Research Board in January this year which analyses the National Drug Treatment Reporting System (NDTRS) data including records of the number of people in treatment for problem drug use (including heroin) in 2008. I am also aware of the recent publication of the 2010 Annual Report of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) for which the Health Research Board provided Irish data in respect of heroin use and treatment take up. </P>
        <P>It is the case that heroin use remains a serious problem.  All the indications are that, while the use of the drug is relatively stable in the Dublin region, it has in recent years become more widely dispersed around the country, particularly in the major cities and in towns across Leinster.</P>
        <P>The Government&rsquo;s approach to tackling the problem of drug misuse, including heroin use, continues to be a priority and our response is being pursued through a co-ordinated and integrated approach under the National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016. The Strategy tackles the issue under pillar headings of drugs supply reduction, education and prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research.</P>
        <P>In terms of drugs law enforcement, drugs and organised crime are being prioritised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as a core focus for 2010, through the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Policing Plan, which reflects Government strategies contained in the National Drugs Strategy.</P>
        <P>Drugs units are in place in every Garda Division and work in partnership with the Garda National Drugs Unit in tackling and targeting drug-related crime. Divisional and District Policing Plans also reflect the focus of the Policing Plan in terms of drugs law enforcement. In addition, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has strong and strategic partnerships in place at international level targeting drug trafficking.</P>
        <P>The links between organised crime and the illicit drugs trade continue to be actively pursued. The Garda National Drugs Unit, working with other national units, including the Organised Crime Unit and the Criminal Assets Bureau, are targeting persons involved in the heroin trade who are the subject of intelligence-led operations aimed at detecting and prosecuting offenders.</P>
        <P>An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is satisfied that, in addition to the considerable volume of drugs seized to date in 2010, a significant impact has also been made by arresting and prosecuting a number of major players involved in the trafficking of drugs, including heroin.</P><Col N="394"/>
        <P>Finally I can assure the Deputy that my Department, and all the agencies under its aegis, remain fully committed to the approach adopted in the National Drugs Strategy and to its implementation.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The treatment of sex offenders is centred in Arbour Hill Prison where sex offenders undertake the Building Better Lives (BBL) programme.  The programme comprises group interventions in three modules and allows responsive and flexible delivery of rehabilitation services which take account of individual risk, needs and capacity.</P>
        <P>The BBL programme commenced in January 2009, replacing the Sex Offender Programme, which was initiated in 1994 and concluded in 2008.  The programme allows more responsive and flexible delivery of rehabilitation services to a greater number of offenders.  The interventions take greater account of individual risk, needs and capacity, with priority given increasingly to higher risk offenders.  Of the 78 offenders who have participated in the programme since January 2009, 58 are classified as medium to high risk category.</P>
        <P>The programme is provided by a team of psychologists, including clinical and counselling psychologists, who have developed specific expertise in clinical practice including assessment <Col N="395"/>and therapeutic work with men convicted of sexual offences.  There are currently 21 psychologists employed by the Irish Prison Service, five of whom are assigned to Arbour Hill.</P>
        <P>In Arbour Hill and other prisons, sex offenders also participate in other group programmes which while not specifically designed for sex offenders are aimed at addressing their needs, including stress management, anger management and cognitive skills training, as well as interventions by visiting psychiatrists.  Not all sex offenders are suited to group programmes therefore other prison-based therapeutic interventions including one-to-one interventions are available.</P>
        <P>Of the 320 sex offenders in custody on 11 November 2010, 92 have been or are engaged with the Irish Prison Service Psychology Service in relation to their sexual offending.  At the end of October 2010, 24 prisoners were participating in the Building Better Lives programme and another 30 were engaged with the Psychology Service in work related to their offending behaviour.  In the context of participation in this programme, priority is given to higher risk offenders with prisoners transferring into Arbour Hill for intervention purposes.</P>
        <P>I would also like to advise that the Probation Service engages with sex offenders in individual work throughout the course of their sentence.  This work primarily focuses on reducing the risk posed by the individual following release and also on child protection issues which may arise.  Therapeutic interventions post release are made available through the joint delivery with the Granada Institute of the community-based Lighthouse Programmes in Dublin and Cork.</P>

	<P>The granting of sentence remission is a feature of many prison systems worldwide and has been a feature of the Irish criminal justice system since the foundation of the State. Our Courts are aware of the statutory entitlement to remission when passing sentence. </P>
        <P>Most prisoners are entitled by law to remission of one quarter of sentence provided they are of good behaviour during their time in custody.  The European Court of Human Rights has held that a loss of remission requires a specific finding of a breach of prison discipline.  In <Col N="396"/>practice therefore, a prisoner will normally get 25% remission unless they have breached prison discipline and a sanction of loss of remission has been imposed.</P>
        <P>Any measure which would retrospectively affect the time spent in custody after a sentence has been passed is open to challenge.</P>
        <P>I will continue to keep under review what measures (including remission) are appropriate to maintain effective participation rates in therapeutic programmes by sex offenders.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy will be aware the development of the new prison campus at Thornton Hall, Kilsallaghan, County Dublin is now proceeding on a phased basis.  Phase one, which is currently in progress, comprises essential preliminary works to facilitate the prison development including the construction of a dedicated access road, the installation of off-site services and the construction of the perimeter wall of the prison.  The second phase of the project involves the provision of 400 cells along with related support facilities suitable to accommodate up to 700 prisoners. Subsequent phases of the project will see the provision of the balance of the 1,000 cells providing a total of 1,400 cells when completed with operational flexibility to accommodate up to 2,200 prisoners, thus future proofing the development.</P>
<?oasys _cl14- ?>
        <P el="10"><i>Access Road</i></P>
        <P el="0">I am pleased to advise the Deputy that a contract for the construction of the access road to serve the prison development was awarded to SIAC Construction Limited in July 2010 and construction work is already well underway in relation to this phase of the project.  The access road and underpass are scheduled to be completed during February next year.</P>
       <P el="10"><i>Off-site Works</i></P>
        <P el="0">A procurement competition for the installation of the off-site services to serve the prison development issued to companies on the Irish Prison Service Construction Framework in <Col N="397"/>August.  The evaluation of the tenders by the Irish Prison Service and its technical advisors has been completed and the arrangements for the award of the contract to the successful tenderer is at an advanced stage.  Subject to contract award, work on the installation of the off-site services is scheduled to commence next month and will take approximately eight months to complete.</P>
      <P el="10"><i>Perimeter Security Wall</i></P>
        <P el="0">The procurement process for the design and construction of the perimeter security wall of the prison is already in progress.  A pre-qualification competition for the design and construction of the perimeter security wall of the prison and related works issued on the E-tenders web site in August 2010.  Twenty submissions were received and the evaluation of these submissions has been completed.  Five companies have been short-listed and these contractors will be invited to tender for the construction of the perimeter security wall and ancillary works later this month.  Construction of the perimeter wall is scheduled to commence in the first quarter of 2011 and will take just under a year to complete.</P>
       <P el="10"><i>Prison Buildings</i></P>
        <P el="0">As I mentioned previously in the House, my priority is to provide good quality, regime focussed prison accommodation at Thornton Hall prison campus as quickly as possible.  A phased development of the prison campus is now being pursued.  The next phase of the works will see the procurement of prison accommodation blocks and related support facilities commencing in the New Year using traditional procurement methods.</P>
        <P>In relation to expenditure on the project, the total expenditure to end October is &euro;42.5 million.  This sum includes the site cost of &euro;31.2 million.</P>

	<P>The issue of the proceeds of crime seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau being used to fund community projects and drug services in disadvantaged communities has been raised from time to time.  </P>
        <P>It is a matter on which my Department has consulted with the Department of Finance who would have primary responsibility in this area.</P>
        <P>While it is accepted that there may be some potential symbolic value in the suggestion nonetheless the proposal is one which is problematic and raises a number of particular difficulties.</P>
        <P>Revenue which has been accumulated by the Criminal Assets Bureau is paid into the Government&rsquo;s Central Fund.  The Central Fund is provided for under Article 11 of the Constitution.  This fund, except where provided otherwise by law, is the destination of all State revenues and the source of all Government spending.  It is the Central Fund from which the Government draws for expenditure on all necessary public services and investment including the provision of drug services.</P>
        <P>With certain exceptions, it is believed that earmarking revenues for a specific expenditure programme would, in general, constrain the Government in the implementation of its overall expenditure policy.  Furthermore, if certain revenues were earmarked for particular projects any projects thus funded would be dependent on actual revenue collected from that source.  Therefore, a fall in revenue generated by that source could imply a fall in expenditure on such projects.</P>
        <P>Given the variable and uncertain nature of the value of the assets seized by the Bureau in any given year, in addition to the potential delays through the possibility of legal challenge to court disposal orders, the provision of ongoing funds to drug programmes or projects in this manner would be problematic.  Such a revenue source would not facilitate the proper planning <Col N="400"/>of drug treatment provision or other such programmes by organisations involved in the delivery of services.</P>
        <P>It could also be said that a significant proportion of the monies secured by the Bureau are already owed to the Exchequer as it often relates to non-payment of taxes and social welfare fraud.</P>
        <P>In the case of drugs services the Government is already allocating very considerable resources to a wide range of Government Departments and State agencies as well as to the community and voluntary drug treatment sectors to tackle the issue of drug misuse.</P>
        <P>There is currently no plan to change the existing arrangements concerning revenue accumulated by the Criminal Assets Bureau.</P>

	<P>It has been standard practice over the years to publish all of the Visiting Committee Reports on the same day.  Their actual date of publication is dictated by the date on which all of the reports are received, checked and made ready for publication.  On this occasion their readiness coincided with the publication of the other reports.  It is customary for the Irish Prison Service to discuss the matters of concern that the Visiting Committees may have with them and to take the necessary action to resolve these issues where feasible.</P>

	<P>As the Deputy is aware, there has been a consistent increase in the total prisoner population in Ireland over recent years, with dramatic increases in the number of sentenced prisoners, those being committed on remand and a trend towards longer sentences.  This situation is particularly apparent over the past 12 months during which time the total number in custody has increased by 435.  This represents a rise of over 11% in the numbers in custody. The Irish Prison Service must accept all prisoners committed by the Courts into its custody and does not have the option of refusing committals.</P>
        <P>I wish to inform the Deputy that the total number of prisoners in custody on 15 November 2010 was 4,416.  The number of prisoners on temporary release on that day was 660 which represented approximately 12.5% of the overall prison population.  The figures requested by the Deputy in relation to temporary release are set out in the tables.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The Irish Prison Service has been engaged in an extensive programme of investment in prisons infrastructure which has involved both the modernisation of the existing estate, the provision of extra prison spaces, and the improvement of the prisons regime.  Since 1997, in excess of 1,930 new prison spaces have come on stream in the prison system.  These include the new prisons in Castlerea, the Midlands, Cloverhill, the D&oacute;chas Centre and new accommodation in Limerick, Portlaoise, Castlerea, Mountjoy and Wheatfield prisons and at the open centres in Shelton Abbey and Loughan House.  The Irish Prison Service has also completed the renovation of an unused landing in Limerick Female Prison which has provided an extra 14 cells with in-cell sanitation.</P>
        <P>The Irish Prison Service plans to commence construction later this year on a new accommodation block in the Portlaoise/Midlands prisons complex which will provide 300 prison spaces in the medium term.  Work is also due to commence on converting an administrative building on the D&oacute;chas site into a new accommodation block which will provide 70 spaces in the short term.</P>
        <P>The Government is fully committed to developing a new prison campus at Thornton Hall, County Dublin, and recently approved the procurement of the first phase of the prison accommodation blocks and related support facilities.  This work will result in the provision of an initial 400 cells capable of accommodating up to 700 prisoners.  Work has already started on the construction of the access road and the procurement process for other aspects of the project are being advanced.  The development of a new prisons facility at Kilworth, Co Cork, to serve the Munster region is also a key element of the prisons modernisation programme.</P>
        <P>Temporary release arrangements, in accordance with the Criminal Justice Act 1960 as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003, can operate similar to a system of parole, which is a feature of prison systems worldwide.  They are an important vehicle for re-integrating an offender into the community in a planned way. The generally accepted view is that the risk to the community is reduced by planned re-integration of offenders compared with their return to the community on the completion of their full sentence.</P>
        <P>The Irish Prison Service has also judiciously used temporary release as a means of reducing numbers in times of serious overcrowding.  Each case is examined on its own merits and the safety of the public is paramount when decisions are made.  In addition, all releases are subject to conditions, which in the vast majority of cases include a requirement to report on a regular <Col N="403"/>basis to the offender&rsquo;s Garda Station. Of course, any offender who breaches his or her conditions may be arrested and returned to prison immediately by the Garda&iacute;.</P>

	<P>I would remind the Deputy that a provision which prohibits upward only rent review clauses in future business leases is contained in Section 132 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009.  That provision came into force on 28 February last. </P>
        <P>The prohibition on upward only rent review clauses does not apply to business leases (or agreements for such leases) which were entered into prior to the commencement of the section.  Advice was sought from the Office of the Attorney General as to whether or not the prohibiting provision could be applied retrospectively.  It was indicated that wholesale interference with existing leases was not a feasible option.  Real legal and constitutional difficulties would arise if property rights were to be affected retrospectively.  My Department is not aware of any recommendations of the type suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>Policing and justice responsibilities were devolved to the Northern Ireland Assembly on 12 April 2010.  The Garda Commissioner and I held a first meeting with Minister Ford, who was accompanied by PSNI Chief Constable Baggott, on 16 April in Stormont.  Since then I have met with Minister Ford on several occasions.  We have twice met to review formally cooperation under the Intergovernmental Agreement on Cooperation on Criminal Justice Matters.  We also met jointly in September with Scottish Cabinet Secretary for Justice Kenny MacAskill MSP and in October we addressed the annual Cross-border Organised Crime Seminar in Belfast.  Minister Ford also joined me at a Garda graduation event in Templemore late last month.</P>
        <P>In the last week Minister Ford and I have appeared before the Oireachtas Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, addressed the first annual seminar on cross-border cooperation between the two Probation Services (which was immediately followed by a meeting to review criminal justice cooperation under the Agreement) and attended an event in Dundalk marking the launch of a new academic research project on the Peace Process.  These meetings serve to highlight the closeness of the relationship between the various criminal justice and law enforcement agencies in our two jurisdictions and the importance that both Minister Ford and I place on ensuring that North-South cooperation is supported and enhanced, for the benefit of all the people of Ireland.</P>
        <P>In respect of the second part of the Deputy&rsquo;s question, I can assure him that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland are resolute in their determination to <Col N="404"/>maintain and reinforce the already excellent level of cooperation that they enjoy, and which has played a significant role in preventing attacks in the border region.  Such cooperation has resulted in a number of individuals being arrested and brought before the Courts on terrorism-related charges.  The counter-terrorism strategies and intelligence-led operations of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in cooperation with its counterparts in Northern Ireland, are focused on targeting and disrupting any operational planning or logistical support being conducted or contemplated in this jurisdiction.  I am fully satisfied that the level of policing and security resources, both overt and covert, dedicated to this task continues to be commensurate to the threat posed.</P>

	<P>The Deputy will understand that it is not the policy nor would it be in the public interest to comment in detail on matters relating to the personal security of individuals, including information relating to persons who have acted as witnesses in criminal trials and who, as a consequence, may be the subject of Garda protection or persons in the Garda Witness Security Programme.  A high level of confi<Col N="405"/>dentiality is essential to protect the individuals involved and the operation of the protection measures in place.</P>
        <P>Witness intimidation is an offence pursuant to Section 41 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999, which specifies the offence as harming, threatening or menacing or in any other way intimidating or putting in fear another person who is assisting in the investigation of an offence by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, with the intention of causing the investigation or course of justice to be obstructed, perverted or interfered with.  Following the enactment of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, the offence is now punishable on indictment by a fine or a term of imprisonment of up to 15 years.</P>
        <P>Since 1997 the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has operated a Witness Security Programme in response to attempts by criminal and other groups to prevent the normal functioning of the criminal justice system, including threats of violence and systematic witness intimidation.  Legislation was not required to establish this Programme, but its operation is supported by Section 40 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999 which makes it an offence for any person, without lawful authority, to try to identify the whereabouts or any new identity of a witness who has been relocated under the Programme.  The offence is punishable on indictment by a fine or a term of imprisonment of up to five years.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na rigorously enforces the provisions in the law relating to witness intimidation and protection.  In circumstances where the Senior Investigation Officer in a case has identified a witness who is crucial to the case and the evidence to be preferred is not available elsewhere, and there is a serious threat to the life of the witness or his/her family an application can be made, with the consent of the witness, to have him/her included in the Witness Security Programme.  Where a threat to or intimidation of a witness or a potential witness arises during the course of criminal proceedings, the matter may be addressed through the trial judge, who has discretion to revoke bail or place other sanctions on the accused/suspect.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The Garda&iacute; enjoy the confidence of the public generally. The most recent evidence for this is the <i>Quarterly National Household </i>Survey of the Central Statistics Office, in relation to Crime and Victimisation in 2010 which found that 67% of those surveyed rated the Garda&iacute; in their local area as good or very good.</P>
        <P>The report referred to by the Deputy was commissioned by the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime to establish, from the victim&rsquo;s perspective, the needs of victims of crime and their families and the extent to which those needs are met by voluntary organisations and the criminal justice agencies. It showed that 70% of victims were satisfied or very satisfied with the sensitivity of the Garda&iacute; in taking statements. It is a matter of concern, however, that 40% of respondents to a questionnaire expressed themselves as being dissatisfied with their overall dealings with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</P>
        <P>The fieldwork for the research was conducted in 2009. In July 2010, I launched the <i>Victims Charter and Guide to the Criminal Justice System</i>.  This includes a Garda Victims Charter, which gives detailed undertakings in relation to what services victims of crime are entitled to expect <Col N="406"/>from Garda&iacute;. It also provides contact details for those victims who feel that they have not received the level of service they are entitled to and who wish to make a complaint. In launching the Charter, I emphasised that I would like to see all the criminal justice agencies implement their victims charters in full and I urged that monitoring be put in place to assess the level of implementation.</P>
        <P>The Garda authorities themselves recognise the need to continuously improve service provision. To this end, the Garda Commissioner established the Garda National Crime Victims Forum to consult with voluntary organisations providing assistance to victims of crime. The Forum met for the first time in March this year and a further meeting will take place at the end of November 2010. I am satisfied that it is through monitoring their own activities and a co-operative approach between the Garda&iacute; and victims&rsquo; representatives that service provided to victims ratings will be enhanced.</P>

	<P>As at 31 October there were 530 persons awaiting a first instance asylum decision in the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner (ORAC), while 1,055 persons were awaiting an asylum appeal decision in the Refugee Appeals Tribunal (RAT).  For the avoidance of any misunderstanding, I should say that the majority of these cases are relatively recent applications i.e. in the system less than 12 months.</P>
        <P>Persons who are refused asylum are entitled to seek leave to remain in the State under the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) when there is also the possibility for them to make an application for Subsidiary Protection.   As at 31 October 2010 approximately 9,000 such cases were recorded as pending.  However, this does not mean that it can be stated definitively that this is the actual number of people residing here who have been refused asylum status.  In common with the practice in other States, it tends to be the case that significant numbers of persons leave the State during and after the processing of their asylum applications.   As Ireland does not operate a system of exit controls, it is simply not possible to state the true figure in this respect.  There is evidence from our visa applications processes to suggest that some of these persons have in fact returned to their country of origin.</P>
        <P>Neither is it possible to state the costs of accommodation for such persons, because there is no mandatory requirement for asylum seekers (or for persons who seek to remain in the State on other grounds having been refused asylum) to avail of State provided, or State funded accommodation.</P>

        <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to recent statistics released by the Central Statistics Office which showed a very significant number of offences committed by persons on bail in the past three and a half years, including 33 murders; if he is satisfied with the current operation of the bail laws in view of these figures; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The number of offences where the suspected offender is on bail is a matter of concern.  A decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the court, which is, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of its judicial functions.  There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail, since, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty.<b></b> The statistics compiled by the Central Statistics Office indicate that in 2009 there was a reduction of 7% in the number of offences recorded where the suspected offender was on bail, compared with the previous year.</P>
        <P>Late last year, I obtained Government approval to commence work on a new Bail Bill.  The Bill will restate and consolidate bail law.  In addition, a number of matters to improve the operation of the law are being examined.  These include:</P>
        <P el="5">(a) <?oasys _ix ?>providing that the courts must have regard to the nature and seriousness of any danger to any person or the public posed by the release of the accused person on bail;</P>
        <P el="5">(b) <?oasys _ix ?>creating presumptions that bail should be refused for people charged with certain types of serious crime.  In view of restrictions resulting from the European Convention on Human Rights, such presumptions would act as a form of guidance to the courts in identifying those who present unacceptable risks of committing serious offences if granted bail; and</P>
        <P el="5">(c) <?oasys _ix ?>extending the powers of the courts to refuse bail where that is necessary to prevent the commission of further offences to include more minor offences which fall below the current level of seriousness required by the Bail Act 1997. I hope to be in a position to bring proposals to Government before the beginning of the next D&aacute;il session.</P>

	<P>Proposals for the introduction of a new system which would allow the taking of contemporaneous written notes to cease where interviews are electronically recorded are being considered by my Department and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in consultation with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Office of the Attorney General.  While proposals for a new system are well advanced, it is not a straight-forward matter and there are a number of legal, technological, training and financial issues to be addressed before any changeover to a new system can take place.</P>
        <P>Accordingly, the matter is one of a number of issues now being considered by the Advisory Committee on Garda Interviewing which I established earlier this Summer.  This committee, chaired by the Honourable Mr Justice Esmond Smyth, was established following the recommendations of the Morris Tribunal to oversee policy on interviews in Garda custody, and to ensure that policy and practice relating to interviewing are kept under continual review.  I will give very careful consideration to the views of the committee on this matter.  In the meantime the current practice will continue.</P>

I am assured that he will complete his examination and other appropriate enquiries as expeditiously as possible, following which he will report to the Commissioner.  When he does so, the Commissioner will consult with the law officers on issues arising in respect of criminal liability.</P>
        <P>I am informed by my colleague the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs that the Health Service Executive is continuing its audit of Catholic dioceses to ensure that it, as the statutorily responsible body, is fully aware of all cases of clerical child sex abuse known to the Church and that each diocese is in a position, in terms of the policies and procedures in place, to handle allegations of child sexual abuse and prevent the possibility of such abuse in the future.

	<P>In February 2010 the Dubai police confirmed that several suspects, believed to have been involved with the killing of a senior Hamas figure, had entered Dubai on the passports of a number of foreign countries, including a total of eight Irish passports.  Subsequent investigations carried out by the Passport Service and by the Garda&iacute; have confirmed that the eight Irish passports used were forgeries and it was concluded that an Israeli Government agency was responsible for the misuse and, most likely, the manufacture of the forged Irish passports.  The Garda investigation into the matter is ongoing and if evidence is forthcoming to indicate the commission of criminal offences in this jurisdiction a file will be submitted to the DPP on completion of enquiries.</P><Col N="410"/>
        <P>In June 2010 allegations were made about the use of Irish passports against the background of persons allegedly carrying out long-term, &ldquo;deep cover&rdquo; assignments in the United States on behalf of the Russian Federation.

I am informed that the Passport Service is also carrying out an investigation into the matter.  In light of this, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further except to say that the Government regards the fraudulent use of Irish passports as a most serious matter.</P>

	<P>I have been informed by the Director General of the Irish Prison Service that he has circulated the report to the Governors of each institution and asked them to address any operational issues raised in the report regarding their specific prisons. </P>
        <P>As regards overcrowding, the latest penal statistics published by the Council of Europe indicate that the level of overcrowding in countries such as the UK, France, Spain and Italy far exceeds the challenges currently facing our own prison system.  In relation to the Inspector&rsquo;s recommendation on the capping of prisoner numbers in individual prisons, the Irish Prison Service could not comply with this at this point in time as it could not be achieved without releasing sizeable numbers of prisoners considered unsuitable for early release.</P>
        <P>Ireland is not unique in having to manage an increasing prisoner population  &mdash; a fact acknowledged by the Inspector of Prisons in his commentary on this issue.  We have to modernise and further upgrade our prison capacity to address the question of overcrowding and to improve the prison regime.  I would draw the Deputy&rsquo;s attention to the Government&rsquo;s commitment to providing resources to the Irish Prison Service so that an extensive programme of investment in prisons infrastructure could be undertaken which has involved both the modernisation of the existing estate and the provision of extra prison spaces.  This significant programme of capital works includes the new prisons in Castlerea, the Midlands, Cloverhill, the D&oacute;chas Centre and new accommodation in Limerick, Portlaoise, Castlerea and Wheatfield prisons and at the open centres in Shelton Abbey and Loughan House. Since 1997, in excess of 1930 new prison spaces have come on stream in the prison system.</P><Col N="411"/>
        <P>In addition, Government capital investment will allow the Irish Prison Service to continue with its building programme.  The Irish Prison Service plan to commence construction later this year on a new accommodation block in the Portlaoise/Midlands prisons complex which will have the potential to provide 300 prison spaces in the medium term.  Work is also due to commence on converting an administrative building on the D&oacute;chas site into a new accommodation block which will provide 70 spaces in the short term.</P>
        <P>The Government recently approved the procurement of the first phase of the prison accommodation blocks and related support facilities for the prison campus at Thornton Hall.  This work will proceed and will result in the provision of an initial 400 cells capable of accommodating up to 700 prisoners.  Work has already started on the construction of the access road and the procurement process for the other aspects of the project are being advanced.  The development of a new prison facility at Kilworth Co. Cork to serve the Munster region is a key element of the prisons modernisation programme.  The new facilities at Kilworth will, when complete, allow for the decommissioning of the accommodation at Cork Prison and its replacement with new  modern prison facilities.  It is anticipated that the capacity of the new prison will be in the region of 450 and will also include accommodation and facilities for male and female prisoners.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I can assure the Deputy that the Government attaches the highest priority to tackling serious crime.  In setting the policing priorities for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2010, I asked the Commissioner to continue the focus of the force on serious crime, in particular organised crime.  This priority is reflected in the Garda policing plan for this year and the specific initiatives undertaken by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Deputy will be aware that the criminal law has been significantly strengthened in recent times <Col N="413"/>so as to provide additional legislative measures to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in their efforts to combat organised crime.   </P>
        <P>The Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, which entered into force on 23 July 2009, makes available a number of specific measures targeted at organised crime.  In addition, further measures contained in the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 relating to evidence obtained by means of covert surveillance and measures contained in the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 relating to the use of weapons have greatly strengthened the response to serious crime.  Members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are utilising all available legislation to target organised crime including the provisions contained in the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 amending the Criminal Justice Act 2006 in relation to organised crime.  In this regard, I am informed by the Garda authorities that as of 31st October 2010 eight individuals have been charged under the legislation, six under Section 72 of the Act (participating or contributing to certain activities) and two under Section 71A of the Act (directing the activities of a criminal organisation).</P>
        <P>The success of Operation Chisel which targeted an organised criminal group based in northern inner city Dublin and which resulted in the arrests of thirteen people is an indication of how the Garda&iacute; are utilising the legislative provisions to target such criminals.  Ongoing targeted operations such as Operation Anvil, which commenced in the Dublin Metropolitan Region in May 2005, has already had considerable success.  As of the 31st October this year Operation Anvil had resulted in the seizure of 1,458 firearms and led to the recovery of over &euro;40 million worth of property.</P>
        <P>The Garda&iacute; also use a multi-agency approach, whereby all of the National Units from National Support Services are used to combat serious crime.  This integrated approach adopts best practice in implementing a co-ordinated use of Garda resources and using available criminal legislation to its fullest extent.  This approach is closely monitored and kept under review by senior Garda management.  Where there may be an identified requirement for additional legislative provisions to further enhance existing provisions I will not hesitate in bringing forward proposals.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 95 and 153 together.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will appreciate that the incident in question is currently the subject of a Garda investigation and so it would be inappropriate for me, as Minister, to make any comment at this time in relation to any such investigation.  With regards to obtaining a security licence, the Private Security Authority, established under the Private Security Services Act 2004, is the <Col N="414"/>regulatory body with responsibility for regulating and licensing the private security industry.  The Authority is an independent body under the aegis of my Department.  My Department is therefore not involved in the day to day running of the Authority and the processing of licence applications is a matter solely for the Authority.</P>
        <P>I would however like to assure the Deputy that the vetting of applicants is an integral part of the licensing process of the Private Security Authority.  I am informed that, in the case of contractor licensing, all directors of a company, the partners in a partnership, all sole traders and any shareholder in a company with a shareholding of 20% or more are vetted, on the Authority&rsquo;s behalf, by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na. All applicants for individual licences also go through the vetting process.  I am also informed by the Authority that when deciding whether to grant a licence to a person with a relevant conviction, it will take the following into account:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />nature and seriousness of the offence(s) involved</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the length of time since completion of sentence</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />overall interests of the public good</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />relationship of the crime to the purpose of requiring a licence</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />age of person before and after offence</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />conduct of person before and after the offence</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />evidence of rehabilitation</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">The PSA has written criminality guidelines in place to assist the Authority in making a decision, however they are in no way bound by these guidelines and may decide,where it deems the conviction(s) renders an applicant unsuitable to hold a licence, to refuse an application.  The criminal record checking and criminality guidelines are continually monitored and validated to ensure that these systems operate as effectively as possible.  I can inform the Deputy that, it is in this context that, discussions are ongoing, at my request, at a senior level within my Department, the PSA and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to ensure, to the greatest extent possible, that inappropriate persons are not in a position to secure licences in the private security sector.  It is a complex legal area but based on the outcome of these discussions, I will then be in a position to decide if anything further needs to be done on this matter.</P>

	<P>Each year I determine priorities for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in accordance with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  These priorities inform the annual Garda Policing Plan.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that local Garda management throughout the State closely monitors patrols and other operational strategies in place, in the context of crime trends and the policing needs of the community.  This monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.  Where necessary, dedicated initiatives targeting specific crime types are implemented to prevent, detect and reduce such incidents.</P>
        <P>Garda management is aware of the importance of Garda personnel levels and the allocation of additional personnel to local communities.  This issue is raised on a regular basis with senior Garda management at Regional and Divisional levels, in particular at the Joint Policing Committees.  At my request, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate carried out an inspection of resource allocation, including personnel, in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate published the report earlier this year, and its recommendations are currently being examined by the Garda Commissioner and his senior management.  The Commissioner, with his senior managers and Divisional Officers, arranges for the allocation of Garda personnel throughout the State.  Garda management is aided in this by a distribution model known as the Garda Establishment Redistribution Model (GERM).</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Commissioner that this model indicates the most effective distribution of Garda personnel and acts as a guide to Garda management decision making.  It takes into account many different policing variables, including crime trends, socio-economic factors, and census information.  The allocation of Garda personnel takes account of these factors and in addressing the policing requirements of each individual Division.</P>

        <askee>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</askee>
        <Quest> the number of persons deported from the State in 2010; the cost of deporting those persons; and if he will make a statement on the matter. </Quest>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>In the period January to end October this year, a total of 241 persons were removed from the State on foot of Deportation Orders. In addition to these, a further 2,597 persons were refused leave to land at the State&rsquo;s frontiers and were returned to the place from where they had come.  Moreover a further 131 persons were returned to other EU member states under the arrangements in place on foot of the EU legal instrument know as the Dublin Convention II.</P>
        <P>While my Department&rsquo;s records do not specifically identify the costs associated with the return of persons in the latter two categories referred to above, they are not likely to be significant since in the case of refusals of leave to land costs are borne by the carriers and in the case of Dublin Convention II cases, the persons in question would be returning to the UK in a significant number of cases and to other European States in the remainder.</P><Col N="416"/>
        <P>In the case of persons who are deported on foot of deportation orders, costs arise on foot of removal on scheduled flights and in the majority of cases, on foot of chartered aircraft.</P>
        <P>In the period in question, the total net cost of scheduled and chartered flights was approximately &euro;205,000. For the sake of completeness I should add that the European Border Management Agency &mdash; FRONTEX &mdash; is a very significant asset in returning persons to distant countries. For example, so far this year, FRONTEX has funded 7 chartered flights in which we participated at no cost.</P>
        <P>In the case of costs associated with 5 other chartered flights, there was no cost to Ireland as the flights were funded by other EU member states. Finally, Ireland is also in a position to draw down approximately &euro;500,000 from the European Return Fund 2008-2013 to meet the cost of deportations.</P>
        <P>The deportation of failed asylum seekers is costly, particularly where this involves removals to distant countries such as Nigeria or China for example. In many cases, removals are carried out using commercial flights which usually involves transit through other European airports as Ireland does not have direct flights to most of the countries of return.   In addition, most flights have to be booked at short notice, near to the date of departure, which involves higher costs than if booked well in advance. However, such costs must be looked at in tandem with the considerable expense arising from the continued presence in the State of persons who have no valid basis for being in the State.  Such costs would include accommodation and social welfare costs as well as detention costs in certain cases. While it is important to keep deportation costs to a minimum, to not remove persons who have no valid basis for being in the State would call into question the integrity of the entire asylum and immigration systems.  This would leave this State open to further illegal immigration and even greater expense to taxpayers.</P>
        <P Just="Left">My Department will continue to arrange deportations in the most cost effective manner possible including the use of charter flights where this is considered to be most effective. My Department will also continue to work in cooperation with other EU Member States, through the EU-wide FRONTEX network, to carry out joint deportation operations to destinations of shared interest.</P>

	<P>To allow an EU Member State to make a sustainable application for EGF assistance in respect of redundancies occurring in a particular enterprise or sector, strict eligibility criteria must be satisfied under the European Globalization Adjustment Fund Regulation (EGF).</P>
        <P>These criteria include meeting defined minimum redundancy numbers within  certain reference periods. In this context, the current EGF Regulation stipulates that there must have been at least 500 redundancies over a period of four months in respect of a  single enterprise, its suppliers or downstream producers, or at least 500  redundancies over a period of nine months in a NACE 2 (economic activity)  sector.</P>
        <P>The EGF Regulation in force until 30 April 2009 stipulated a minimum number of redundancies of 1,000 in both of these scenarios.  Provided that all relevant eligibility conditions have been met, an EU member state has 10 weeks within which to submit an EGF application.</P>

	<P>The PLC Scheme prescribes the terms and conditions of funding in respect of students attending courses in approved PLC Centres. Students are eligible to be considered for grant assistance in respect of one approved PLC Course. Clause 3.2 of the PLC Scheme sets out the circumstances under which grant assistance may be awarded in respect of subsequent study at PLC Level i.e. where a  candidate already holds a qualification, no higher than FETAC Level 5, and is now pursuing a course that offers progression which may be deemed eligible for  grant aid.</P>
        <P>Under the terms of the PLC Scheme a grant may not be paid in respect of a second period of attendance at the same level for a course approved for the purposes of this scheme, irrespective of whether or not a grant was paid previously.  However, a student may qualify if he/she is progressing to a   higher level course.</P>
        <P>The decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for the relevant grant awarding authority i.e. the applicant&rsquo;s local authority or VEC.  Where a grant application is refused, the reason for the refusal is given by the grant awarding authority.  An applicant may appeal the decision to the relevant local authority or VEC.</P>
        <P>Where the grant awarding authority decides to reject the appeal, the applicant may appeal this decision to my Department by submitting an appeal form outlining clearly the grounds for the appeal.  No appeal has been received by my Department to date from the candidate referred to by the Deputy.</P>

	<P>The top 5% is the general criterion used by the Dublin City University Centre for Talented Youth in Ireland as an indicator to teachers of giftedness for purposes of their talent search. </P>
        <P>In 2007, &ldquo;Exceptionally Able students &ndash;Draft Guidelines for Teachers&rdquo; was published jointly by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and the Council for Curriculum Examinations and Assessment in Northern Ireland. The guidelines identify approximately 5-10% of the population as exceptionally able, with up to 0.5% being profoundly exceptionally able. Giftedness varies on a continuum of ability, and the guidelines advise against relying solely on IQ measures, as exceptional abilities in terms of creativity, art, leadership, social and physical skills may not be identified.</P>
        <P>The NCCA/CCEA guidelines are designed to raise awareness of the social, emotional and academic needs of exceptionally able students and to assist teachers in planning their teaching and learning. The guidelines provide advice to schools on identification of gifted children, set out profiles of students, and whole school and classroom strategies and case studies which demonstrate how schools can best meet the needs of such students.  The general strategies include differentiated teaching, acceleration and enrichment approaches in the context of participation in mainstream schools.</P>
        <P>Further case studies on Curriculum Provision for Exceptionally Able Students  were published in March 2010 by the NCCA as part of its participation, with  Switzerland and the Netherlands in a CIDREE (Consortium if Institutions for  Development and Research in Education in Europe) project.</P>
        <P>The Special Education Support Service funded by my Department offers professional development programmes for teachers on strategies for teaching exceptionally able students. The service also makes on-line training available on Teaching Gifted and Talented Students through the Institute of Child   Education and Psychology Europe, and provides the resources Signposts, and Metacognition in the Classroom and Beyond: Differentiation and Support for Learners for teachers and schools.  In addition, eleven schools are taking part in an Equality of Challenge project, designed to pilot models of educational provision for exceptionally able students.</P>
        <P>Looking at our School has been published by my Department as an aid to self evaluation in schools, as part of a quality cycle of school development planning, self appraisal and review. One of the criteria examined at primary and post primary level is the &ldquo;provision for exceptionally able and talented youth&rdquo;.</P>
        <P>www.giftedkids.ie is a website supported by the National Centre for Technology in Education and other organisations which provides information and advice on  giftedness for parents and teachers, as well as enrichment opportunities for  students.  The Centre for Talented Youth in Ireland, based in Dublin City University identifies gifted children through annual talent searches, and provides Saturday and evening classes and summer programmes, support for  parents and teachers, as well as undertaking research in the area.</P>
        <P>My Department also promotes participation in the Maths and Science Olympiads providing additional training and national and international competition opportunities for gifted students.</P><Col N="421"/>
        <P>My Department does not provide additional resources in respect of gifted children, and the funds expended on curriculum supports and professional development in this area are not readily identifiable separately.</P>

	<P>Significant support is given to schools by way of language support provision. The level of extra teaching support provided in respect of language support to any school is determined by the numbers of eligible pupils enrolled and the associated assessed levels of those pupils&rsquo; language proficiency. This is done through an annual application process in the Spring/Summer of each year.</P>
        <P>Following on from the Government decision in Budget 2009 in relation to language support provision my Department published Circular 0015/2009 which sets out a structured and transparent process for the allocation of up to 4 language support teachers to schools.</P>
        <P>Additional support is available for those schools which have at least 25% of their total enrolment made up of pupils that require language support. Such applications for additional language support are dealt with through the Staffing Appeals process.</P>
        <P>It is important to note that the resources allocated to schools to meet the needs of pupils learning English as an Additional Language are additional to other supports and funding provided for schools. The overall education of pupils with a requirement for English as an additional language remains the responsibility of the mainstream class teacher.  All pupils including migrant pupils (irrespective of their English language proficiency) are counted for <Col N="422"/>the regular pupil teacher ratios in schools. Schools have flexibility in relation to how they deploy their EAL teachers to meet the needs of pupils that require language support.</P>

        <P>The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria and assigned a band rating of 1.4.

      <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan"><TitleTxt>Minister for Finance</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Brian Lenihan</NameTxt>
	<P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the collection of tobacco products tax, and for tackling the illicit trade in cigarettes and tobacco products, that Revenue employs a multi-faceted strategy to deal with this problem. It includes ongoing analysis of the nature and extent of the problem, developing and sharing intelligence on a national, EU and international basis, ongoing review of operational policies, development of analytics and deployment of detection technologies, optimum deployment of resources at point of importation and internally to intercept the contraband product and to prosecute those involved.   Revenue enforcement officers are deployed at all key ports and airports.  Staff deployed at these locations are often augmented by additional staff from other areas when specific operations are organised. Interception at the point of importation is achieved through a combination of risk analysis, profiling, intelligence, and the screening of cargo, vehicles, baggage and postal packages.  </P>
        <P>Revenue enforcement officers also target this illicit trade at the post-importation level by carrying out intelligence-based operations and random checks at retail outlets, markets and private and commercial premises.  In addition Revenue and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na carry out regular multi-agency operations, particularly in relation to large maritime importations and in checks at inland markets.</P>
        <P>In terms of detection equipment, a second mobile X-ray container scanner, to augment the one first deployed in 2006, was commissioned by Revenue in January 2010 and is now fully operational. Smaller baggage/ parcel scanners are deployed at all major ports, airports and postal depots. Two new X-ray scanners were also purchased within the last 12 months for use in postal depots.  In addition to the x-ray equipment, Revenue uses a tobacco detection dog.</P>
        <P>Although Revenue&rsquo;s overall staff numbers have been reduced over the past two years in the context of Government policy on civil service numbers, Revenue has ensured that the resources deployed in this work have been maintained.</P>
        <P Just="Left">Revenue&rsquo;s enforcement approach in the fight against the illicit tobacco trade is under continuous review.  For example, in July of this year Revenue launched a nationwide tobacco operation, which concentrated additional Revenue resources at ports, airports and at various retail points for the purpose of identifying illicit tobacco products.  This resulted in 561 seizures totalling 13.7 million cigarettes and 195 kg tobacco in the course of the two-week period of the operation. A subsequent 3-day operation held earlier this month resulted in the seizure of over 900,000 cigarettes and 88 kg of tobacco. Further such intensive operations are planned, to supplement the normal ongoing level of detection and enforcement activities.</P>
        <P>The Revenue Commissioners have also established a high level internal group, chaired at Commissioner level to examine the risks related to tobacco excise, and to monitor and optimise performance in relation to detection of counterfeit and contraband tobacco products. This group has promoted a number of initiatives aimed at counteracting the illicit trade in tobacco. These include improved profiling of passengers and freight to identify tobacco smugglers, the recent establishment of a tobacco hotline, coordinating national blitz style operations, evaluation and acquisition of scanning and other detection technologies and learning from best practice internationally.</P><Col N="426"/>
        <P>This multi-faceted approach that Revenue has adopted has resulted in the seizure of 164 million cigarettes and more than 2,900 kgs of tobacco to date in 2010.</P>
        <P>With regard to the penalties available for prosecution of tobacco smuggling related offences, the penalty on summary conviction for evasion of duties is  &euro;5,000, and/or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months. The penalty on indictment is up to &euro;126,970 and/or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years, or, where the value of the product concerned is greater than &euro;250,000, up to three times the value of the products. The penalty of &euro;126,970, which was enacted by the Oireachtas in this year&rsquo;s Finance Act, had been sought by Revenue and represents a significant increase on the previous penalty of &euro;12,695. (The previous penalty also included the option of three times the value of the products and/or a term of imprisonment not exceeding 5 years).  These increased penalties are considered adequate.  Of course, as the Deputy is aware, the precise penalty imposed on conviction in each individual case is solely a matter for the Courts and I do not propose to make any comment in that regard.</P>
        <P>There have been 85 convictions for cigarette smuggling to date in 2010.  The fines imposed amounted to &euro;44,580 and, in addition, 19 custodial sentences have been imposed. The average fine for cigarette smuggling offences in 2010 is &euro;524.</P>
        <P>A further 35 convictions were secured for illegal selling of unstamped tobacco products with total fines of &euro;90,750, and 6 custodial sentences and 2 community service orders imposed. The average fine for cigarette selling offences in 2010 is &euro;2,593.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 120 and 121 together.  </P>
        <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they operate two cutters.  Both have a national remit, which includes the west coast of Ireland.  Either or both vessels can and will be deployed to patrol and carry out operations along that coastline as and when required. Deployments consist of a mixture of routine patrols and specific risk-driven operations.  This practice will continue.  Revenue&rsquo;s policy of flexibility in the deployment and use of the cutters strives to maximise the value of these resources and to place them at the disposal of all areas of the coastline, as operational needs require.</P>
        <P>In the years 2007, 2008 and 2009 R.C.C. Suirbh&eacute;ir spent a total of 52 days in Galway port area.  This includes 37 days on which the vessel entered Galway Docks area. As Galway Docks has controlled entry and exit to times of High Water it is not always possible, operationally, to confine the vessel for this length of time.  On such occasions the vessel may berth at one of the available berthages in the Galway Bay area.</P>

	<P>My Department is aware of the report by Trident Consulting entitled &ldquo;Future Pension Provision&rdquo; which was commissioned by the three teachers unions, ASTI, INTO and the TUI. In addition, my Department is aware of the views of these unions concerning the Government&rsquo;s planned introduction of a single pension scheme for all new-entrant public servants.  The Trident Report was made available to officials of my Department and was the subject of a specific meeting between my officials and the teachers unions.  As I announced in Budget 2010, the Government are committed to the introduction of a new single public service pension scheme for new joiners. The new scheme is aimed at securing considerable long-term Exchequer savings, while continuing to offer fair and reasonable pensions to retired public servants. Its principal features will include career-average benefit accrual, <Col N="428"/>inflation-indexation of benefits and an increased pension age. Extensive consultations on the proposed new scheme with Government Departments and with the staff side have taken place. Draft legislation to introduce the new scheme is currently in preparation, and it is planned that the scheme will be operational in 2011.</P>
        <P>I welcome the Trident Report as a contribution to the debate on pension provision.  However the Report&rsquo;s recommended approaches to pension provision differs in fundamental respects with the Government&rsquo;s policy and I can not accept the Report as a policy basis for pension provision for new-entrant teachers at this time.</P>

In relation to the transaction in question, it appears that the property purchased was non-residential property &mdash; an old schoolhouse. As this was the nature of the property on the date of execution of the deed of transfer, the rates at which duty is charged are those applicable for non-residential property.  The intended change of use of a property after its purchase does not determine either the nature of the property for stamp duty purposes or the rate of stamp duty charged. Furthermore, first time buyer relief can only be claimed in respect of residential property.</P>

In addition, pursuant to Sections 59 and 60 of the Health Act 2007, an Interim Order was made by the District Court in Portlaoise on 28 October 2010 cancelling the registration of a designated centre in Co. Offaly under Part 8 of the Health Act, 2007.  This matter remains before the Courts.</P>
        <P>In addition, under Section 66 of the Act the registered provider must notify the Chief Inspector before closing a designated centre. Twelve centres have notified the Chief Inspector of their intention to close.</P>

	<P>The Adoption Act, 2010, commenced on 1st November 2010. The Adoption Authority was also established on that day.  This is now a matter for the Adoption Authority.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the Adoption Act, 2010, is to improve standards in both domestic and intercountry adoption.  The regulatory framework governing adoption has been strengthened in an attempt to ensure that the best interests of children are protected at every step throughout the adoption process.</P>
        <P>Accredited bodies &mdash; organisations delivering adoption services &mdash; must comply with the terms of the legislation, which was first published in January 2009.  The new legislation seeks <Col N="431"/>to end the practice whereby a single adoption agency could provide the full range of adoption services, from pre-birth counselling to post birth placement with prospective parents.  This was a very clear policy decision taken to avoid the obvious conflicts that could arise.  The registration of accredited bodies is a matter for the Adoption Authority and any queries in this regard should be addressed to the Authority.</P>

	<P>On 1 November 2010 I announced that the Government has decided to approve a voluntary early retirement scheme and a voluntary redundancy scheme for certain categories of staff in the public health service.</P>
        <P>The purpose of the schemes is to achieve a permanent reduction in the numbers employed in the public health sector from 2011 onwards and to facilitate health service reform.  The Government must strike a balance between incentivising people to leave now and the cost of any package. The Government is capping the total amount that will be paid out under the schemes at &euro;400m in 2010. The terms on offer, particularly given the current budgetary situation, are fair and reasonable.</P>
        <P>The savings to be achieved in 2011 will depend on the uptake of both schemes and the grades of staff involved.  A reduction of the order of 4,500 to 5,000 staff could generate savings of approximately &euro;200m depending on the mix of voluntary severance and voluntary early retirement.  However, it is impossible to predict the uptake of a voluntary scheme. The potential savings take account of pension payments in 2011 however it is just an estimate as we have no way of knowing the grade and scheme mix at this point.</P>
        <P>The January 2010 pay reductions will be disregarded for the purpose of calculating pensionable remuneration under the VER, i.e. payment will be based on salary rates applicable at 31st December 2009.  Under the redundancy scheme, preserved pension and lump sum payable on attaining preserved pension age (60 or 65, as appropriate) will be calculated in accordance with the rules in place at the time preserved pension age is reached.</P>

	<P>The internet is a worldwide phenomenon with no borders and no single organisation controlling it.  There is, however, an existing self-regulatory framework for internet service providers (ISPs) in operation in Ireland which actively encourages the adoption of best practice procedures aimed at limiting the proliferation of illegal child pornography content online.  Members of the public may report such material to the www.hotline.ie service of the Internet Service Providers&rsquo; Association of Ireland (ISPAI).  If the material is hosted here and deemed to be illegal and in contravention of Irish law, ISPAI members are obliged to remove such materials.  If the material is hosted in another jurisdiction, it is notified to the internet hotline in that jurisdiction and/or to the relevant law enforcement agencies for follow up, with the aim of having illegal content taken down.</P>
        <P>At present, mobile phone operators in Ireland, under a voluntary agreement brokered by the European Commission with the GSM Alliance Europe, the association representing European <Col N="435"/>mobile phone operators, implement a form of filtering on their mobile internet service, which prevents access to websites which have been identified as containing child pornography content.</P>
        <P>In a number of EU Member States, a system of internet blocking/filtering has been introduced on a voluntary basis, whereby a &ldquo;blocklist&rdquo; of sites containing child pornography is made available by the police or other competent authorities, and is utilised by individual ISPs to prevent access to such content.  A number of other Member States have introduced or are considering the introduction of legislation requiring ISPs to block access to websites containing child pornography.  It is generally acknowledged that all such internet blocking or filtering systems are not foolproof and can be circumvented in certain circumstances.  However, such filtering systems are understood to be useful in preventing internet users from inadvertently encountering such illegal content.</P>
        <P>The issue of the possible utilisation of blocking/filtering methodologies to prevent access to identified webpages containing child pornography is being considered further by the Office for Internet Safety with advice from the Internet Safety Advisory Council.  In undertaking research in this area, the Office for Internet Safety has had discussions with a variety of relevant interests in relation to the possibility of introducing internet filtering, specifically in respect of illegal child pornography content, in Ireland.  However, I should make it clear that no decisions have been arrived at on this issue of internet filtering/blocking at national level.  Any proposals for introducing such a system would need, at the very least, to be submitted to Government for consideration.  The introduction of any such system, particularly if on a mandatory basis, may require the introduction of primary legislation.</P>
        <P>However, a draft proposal for a Directive on combating the sexual abuse, sexual exploitation of children and child pornography was published during 2010 by the European Commission.  The draft Directive, as originally published, contains a proposal to require Member States to implement some form of blocking system in relation to websites containing child pornography. Ireland&rsquo;s participation in the adoption and implementation of this measure has been approved by the Oireachtas.</P>

        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that if an investigation showed that a mobile phone was being used at the time of a road traffic collision, this would form part of the proof and would be contained in the investigation file submitted to the law officers for decision.</P>
        <P>In the context of investigating such collisions, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na would be entitled to seek out and preserve evidence of any use of a mobile phone.  The legislative power to do so is provided by the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Act 2005.  However, to do so there would <Col N="436"/>need to exist a suspicion that the use of a mobile phone was a contributing factor to the traffic collision being investigated.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 147 and 148 together.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005 makes provision for the compilation and publication of crime statistics by the Central Statistics Office, as the national statistical agency, and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.</P>
        <P>I have requested the CSO to provide statistics directly to the Deputy.</P>
        <P>The Irish Prison Service has introduced a range of measures in all closed prisons to prevent the flow of and assist in the capture of contraband such as mobile phones, so as to ensure that they are not used for such illegal purposes as directing criminal activities.</P>
        <P Just="Left">The number of seizures, both at entry and within the prison, is directly correlated to the new security procedures in place.  These include:</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the introduction of enhanced security screening for all persons (visitors and staff) entering our prisons;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the establishment of a drug detection dog service within the Irish Prison Service involving approximately 30 handling teams;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the establishment of Operational Support Units dedicated to developing expertise in searching and gathering intelligence on illicit material being hidden inside our prisons.  They will be available in addition to the normal prison staff and will be target specific security problem areas;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the introduction of Body Orifice Security Scanner (BOSS) chairs for the searching of prisoners on entering/leaving the prison;</P>
        <P el="5"><Miles com="bull66" />the erection of netting over exercise yards in closed prisons to counteract phones being thrown over perimeter walls.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">Other preventative measures include cell and area searches for contraband such as mobile phones which take place in all prisons on a daily basis.  These involve random, targeted and intelligence led searches and have been particularly effective.  Indications are that the availability of mobile phones has decreased across the prison system.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>As I have stated in the House on a number of occasions, the abduction and false imprisonment of a person&rsquo;s family or friends, in order to coerce them into assisting with a robbery, is a particularly abhorrent type of crime.</P>
        <P>There are agreed response procedures in place for dealing with such incidents.  Regular meetings are held between An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and financial institutions to discuss bank security issues and in particular kidnap prevention and response protocols.</P>
        <P>Clearly it is incumbent upon the banks and financial institutions to do everything possible to prevent these robberies.  That means that the protocols must be followed and systems put in place to ensure that, for example, it is not possible for employees who have been placed under terrible duress to be in a position to access large amounts of cash.  When the protocols are followed the Garda&iacute; are given a great advantage in their efforts to foil these crimes and arrest those responsible.  That has been proven to be the case.</P>
        <P>The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na remain totally focused on combating this form of criminality as part of the concerted efforts being made to tackle organised criminal gangs.  New legislation has been put in place to provide for covert surveillance evidence to be used in Court.  I have also introduced legislation which specifically targets the organised criminal gangs responsible for these reprehensible crimes.  The Deputy will appreciate that bank charges and fees are not primarily a matter under my control as Minister for Justice and Law Reform.  I have in any case made it clear that I am not proposing that additional costs should be imposed on the consumer.  I am of the view that we should examine the current levels of cash in circulation within the economy.  This is a matter that has been raised with me including by bank staff representatives.</P>
        <P>To date in 2010 (14th November, 2010) five so-called &lsquo;tiger&rsquo; kidnappings have taken place involving the staff or relations of staff of financial institutions and the following table shows the number of such incidents recorded between 2005-2009.  It is the policy of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na not to disclose the amount of money taken during such crimes.</P>

	<P>The confidential reporting system under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na (Confidential Reporting of Corruption or Malpractice) Regulations 2007 commenced operation in June 2008. The Garda Commissioner has issued a Confidential Reporting Charter to all sworn members and civilian staff of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The Charter contains the contact details of the Confidential Recipients to whom confidential reports may be made.  These include the external Confidential Recipient, Mr Brian McCarthy, the former Secretary General to the President, who was appointed by my predecessor.  They also include the nine Confidential Recipients appointed by the Garda Commissioner from within the Garda organisation. </P>
        <P>I am informed by Mr McCarthy that so far he has been contacted in 5 cases by persons within the Garda organisation about their concerns.  Two of these cases have been completed.  Mr McCarthy&rsquo;s contact details have been supplied to all the people for whom his services are intended, namely sworn members and civilian employees of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  His office is located in a building shared with other bodies operating under the aegis of my Department.  It is not a public office and members of the public do not have access to his services.</P>
        <P>The Regulations oblige the Garda Commissioner to report to me on an annual basis in relation to confidential reports made during that year and the action taken in relation to them.</P>

	<P>I am glad to be able to inform the Deputy that my proposals are to include in the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Bill, referred to in the Government Legislation Programme, provisions to enable the transfer from my Department to the Legal Aid Board of responsibility for the administration and management of criminal legal aid.  Drafting of the Bill is in the course of being finalised with a view to publication in this Session. </P>
        <P>The aim in the Bill is to strengthen the system of granting legal aid.  It will, among other matters, regulate better the taking of statements of means, increase the sanction for false declarations, allow the Board to verify the means of applicants and to prosecute cases of abuse.  The Board will be in a position to explore the method by which legal services are delivered.  I am in consultation with the Attorney General with a view to making as many changes as possible in the system of criminal legal aid, consistent with the requirements of the Constitution.  The details of the final proposals will be announced by way of the publication of the Bill in the near future.</P>
        <P>The transfer to the Board of responsibility for criminal legal aid should not result in any additional cost to the Exchequer. Moreover, the overall effect of the Bill when fully implemented should result in savings.  Having regard to its very significant cost to the <Col N="439"/>Exchequer, I am determined to achieve a system of criminal legal aid that is subject to more stringent checks and balances.</P>

      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>The law in relation to assignment of District Court judges is provided for in the Courts Acts.  Permanent assignments of District Court judges are made by the Government following consultation with the judge concerned and the President of the District Court.  Temporary assignment of judges to a District other than their permanent assignment may be made by the President of the District Court with the judge&rsquo;s consent.  In addition, the President of the District Court may temporarily assign &lsquo;moveable&rsquo; District Court judges to any District as the need arises. </P>
        <P>Since a majority of the serving District Court judges were solicitors prior to their appointment, it is not always possible to make assignments to a District other than that in which they were formerly based.</P>

        <P FLI="0">The Irish Prison Service has used taxis for many years as a means of transporting certain prisoners on escort, mainly to court, but occasionally to hospital.  In 2005, the IPS carried out research on this matter with a view to replacing taxis with official vehicles, however, in the vast majority of cases, hiring a taxi made economic sense.</P>
        <P>In late 2005, the Prison Service Escorts Corps (PSEC) was established on an independent basis within the IPS to provide a prisoner escorting service, primarily for court escorts and inter-prison transfers. Consequently, the use and cost of taxi transport for prisoners has reduced considerably.</P>

	<P>I have undertaken to progress the recommendations of the Working Group on transparency in commercial rent reviews contained in the report which was published in August.  That Working Group recommended the establishment of a public database containing relevant details of letting arrangements and rent reviews in the commercial property market.  As I indicated during the course of the recent Second Stage debate on the Property Services (Regulation) Bill 2009, an appropriate amendment is being developed within my Department for inclusion in that Bill which would see the Property Services Regulatory Authority being given responsibility for the management of the database.  Work is ongoing in relation to finalising the precise operational details pertaining to that database.  </P>

	<P>The position is that these children arrived in the State on 24 April 2005 with their mother and applied for asylum.  Their applications were refused following detailed<b></b>consideration of their cases by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. </P>
        <P>Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 the children along with their mother were informed, by letter dated  26 March 2006, that the Minister proposed making deportation orders in respect of them.  They were given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of Deportation Orders or of submitting written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why they should be allowed to remain in the State.  Notification of entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection  in the State, in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006) was subsequently issued.  A Subsidiary Protection application was submitted in accordance with these Regulations.</P>
        <P>The father of the family arrived in the State on 11 September 2007 and applied for asylum. He was informed, by letter dated  22 September 2010, that the Minister proposed making a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of submitting an application for subsidiary protection and/or submitting written representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain in the State.  He submitted a Subsidiary Protection application on 13 October 2010, which has yet to be considered.</P>
        <P>The children and their mother were notified by letter dated 20 July 2007 that they were not eligible for Subsidiary Protection in the State and that the Minister would proceed to consider whether Deportation Orders should be made in respect of them.  Following extensive<b> </b>consideration of their cases under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, Deportation Orders were signed in respect of them on 26 February 2008.  These Orders were served, by letter dated 11 March 2008 and required them to present themselves at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) on a specified date and time in order to make travel arrangements for their deportation from the State.</P>
        <P>Representations were recently received from a member of the family asking that her and her family&rsquo;s Deportation Orders be stopped.  This letter is being treated as an application for revocation of the Deportation Orders in accordance with the provisions of Section 3(11) of the Immigration Act, 1999 and is under consideration at present. When a decision has been made on that application, that decision, and its consequences will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.  The children and their mother are still the subject of valid Deportation Orders and should continue to meet reporting requirements as directed by the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</P>
        <P>I should<b> </b>remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.</P>

	<P>The Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) provides employment vetting for a large number of organisations in Ireland registered with the Garda&iacute; for this purpose and which employ persons in a full-time, part-time, voluntary or training capacity to positions where they would have substantial, unsupervised access to children and/or vulnerable adults.  </P>
        <P>The processing time for vetting applications fluctuates in line with periods of increased demand.  Furthermore, additional time may be required to process an individual vetting application in cases where clarification is required as to the details provided or where other enquiries need to be made, for example, when the person in question has lived and worked abroad.  There will always be a reasonably significant time period required to process a vetting application.  Registered organisations have been advised to take account of this in their recruitment and selection process.  However, the Garda&iacute; make every effort to reduce this to the minimum possible consistent with carrying out the necessary checks.  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the current average processing time for vetting applications received at the GCVU is approximately 12 weeks.</P>
        <P>The allocation of Garda resources, including personnel, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner. Due to the high volume of applications, an additional ten persons have recently been recruited to the Vetting Unit on a temporary basis.  In addition, overall staffing arrangements at the Unit are kept under review.</P><Col N="444"/>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the Garda Central Vetting Unit has not received a vetting application in respect of the person to whom the Deputy refers.   In the circumstances, I can only suggest that the person seeks clarification from the organisation submitting the application.</P>

      </Qst>
      <Speaker pid="DermotAhern"><TitleTxt>Minister for Justice and Law Reform</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Dermot Ahern</NameTxt>
	<P>I wish to inform the Deputy that a total of 5,889 persons were committed to prison in the time frame referred to as a result of the non-payment of a court ordered fine.  It is not possible to provide all of the statistical information requested by the Deputy without the manual examination of the numerous records concerned and obviously this would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort which can not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.  However, I can advise that a sum total of &euro;342,627.13 was collected by the Prison Service as payment towards fines during the period 1 November, 2009 to 30 September, 2010.  I cannot provide figures for the 12 month period requested as full returns are not yet available for October 2010.</P><Col N="445"/>
        <P>I cannot comment on the cost of securing such convictions as this is a matter which of its nature extends beyond the remit of my Department.  In the context of costs associated with imprisonment, it should be noted that the number of persons imprisoned for non-payment of fines constitute an extremely small part of the prisoner population.  On 15 November 2010, there was less than 0.4% of the prisoner population in this category.</P>
        <P>I can inform you that the average cost of an available staffed prison space during the calendar year 2009 was &euro;77,222 (&euro;92,717 in 2008), a decrease on the 2008 cost of &euro;15,495 or 16.7%.  The decrease in average cost is attributed to the following two factors:</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />a decrease in total costs of &euro;17.7 million (of which &euro;15.5 million relates to pay costs); and</P>
<P el="5"><Miles com="mdash66" />an increase in bed capacity of 495 from 3,611 as at 31 December, 2008 to 4,106 as at 31 December 2009.</P>
        <P FLI="0" el="5">As the Deputy will be aware, the recently enacted Fines Act 2010 will, I believe, provide further scope for keeping people out of the prison system.  While the necessary arrangements have to be put in place by the Courts Service to fully facilitate its operation, I expect that the capacity to pay provisions in section 14 will be among the first features of the legislation to be commenced from early January, 2011.  Section 14 places an obligation on the court to take account of the defendant&rsquo;s financial circumstances before a fine is imposed.</P>

Appropriate training is provided to Garda personnel to facilitate them in effectively carrying out their functions in relation to missing persons.  Further training initiatives have been undertaken over the years.  In addition there have been contacts with the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children in Washington, the FBI Academy, the New York Missing Persons Bureau and the New York City Coroners Department with a view to examining techniques used in the US and with the PSNI.  The experience gained by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in this way has been invaluable in their work in dealing with missing persons.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that they are satisfied that adequate resources, including staff and technology resources, are in place to deal with missing persons cases in line with best international practice.</P>

	<P>I wish to inform the Deputy that on 15 November, 2010, there were 4,416 prisoners in custody as compared to a bed capacity of 4,430.  This represents in effect an occupancy level of 100%.  </P>
        <P>As the Deputy will appreciate the Irish Prison Service must accept all prisoners committed by the Courts into its custody and does not have the option of refusing committals.  It is the case that there has been a consistent increase in the total prisoner population over recent years.  This situation is particularly apparent over the past 12 months during which time the total number in custody has increased by 435. This represents a rise of over 11% in the numbers in custody.</P>
        <P>Prison overcrowding is not unique to this jurisdiction, rather it is an international issue that has been widely acknowledged, including by the Inspector of Prisons.</P>
        <P>The Irish Prison Service has been engaged in an extensive programme of investment in prisons infrastructure which has involved both the modernisation of the existing estate and the provision of extra prison spaces. Since 1997 in excess of 1,930 new prison spaces have come on stream in the prison system.  These include the new prisons in Castlerea, the Midlands, Cloverhill, the D&oacute;chas Centre and new accommodation in Limerick, Portlaoise, Castlerea and most recently Wheatfield prisons and at the open centres in Shelton Abbey and Loughan House.</P>
        <P>The Irish Prison Service plans to commence construction later this year on a new accommodation block in the Portlaoise/Midlands prisons complex which will provide 300 prison spaces in the medium term.  Work is also due to commence on converting an administrative <Col N="448"/>building on the D&oacute;chas site into a new accommodation block which will provide 70 spaces in the short term.</P>
        <P>The Deputy will also be aware of the Government&rsquo;s commitment to developing a new prison campus at Thornton Hall, County Dublin. The new prison facility will provide accommodation for 1,400 prisoners with operational flexibility to accommodate up to 2,200 in a range of security settings.</P>

        <P>The operation of the legislation relating to bail is kept under continuing review by my Department, and proposals for amendment of the legislation are brought forward when that is considered necessary.  A decision to grant bail in a particular case is a matter for the court, which is, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of its judicial functions. There is a constitutional presumption in favour of bail, since, in the eyes of the law, a person is innocent until proven guilty.</P>
        <P>Late last year, I obtained Government approval to commence work on a new Bail Bill. The Bill will restate and consolidate bail law. In addition, a number of matters to improve the operation of the law are being examined. These include:</P>
        <P el="5">(a) <?oasys _ix ?>providing that the courts must have regard to the nature and seriousness of any danger to any person or the public posed by the release of the accused person on bail,</P>
        <P el="5">(b) <?oasys _ix ?>creation of presumptions that bail should be refused for people charged with certain types of serious crime; in view of European Convention on Human Rights restrictions, such presumptions would act as a form of guidance to the courts in identifying those who present unacceptable risks of committing serious offences if granted bail, and</P>
        <P el="5">(c) <?oasys _ix ?>extending the powers of the courts to refuse bail where necessary to prevent the commission of further offences to include more minor offences below the current level of seriousness required by the Bail Act 1997.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Question Nos. 178 and 189 together.</P>
        <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are two categories of organised crime groups operating in this jurisdiction.  The first category consists of individuals / groups that are well established and tightly structured involved in drug trafficking, armed robbery and firearms offences.  The second category involves groups whose activities are characterised by less cohesive group structures and criminal activities which are mainly confined to Ireland.  I am further informed that information regarding such criminal groups is disseminated on a regular basis to Europol. The Deputy will appreciate that membership of organised gangs tends to be fluid and the nature of criminal activity is such that offences committed by members of gangs may or may not be connected with the individual&rsquo;s membership of such gangs. The existence of such gangs and their membership does not remain static.   It is therefore not possible to accurately attribute specific figures to the membership or activities of such gangs or to the criminal convictions of their members.</P>
        <P>However, I can assure the Deputy that members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are utilising all available legislation to target organised crime including the provisions contained in the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 amending the Criminal Justice Act 2006 in relation to organised crime.   In this regard, I am informed by the Garda authorities that as of 31st October 2010 eight individuals have been charged under the legislation, six under Section 72 of the Act (participating or contributing to certain activities) and two under Section 71A of the Act (directing the activities of a criminal organisation). In addition, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to develop and implement strategies to dismantle and disrupt criminal networks, utilising advanced analytical and intelligence methods to facilitate targeted operations to enable early intervention and prevention of organised crime.</P>

	<P>Recorded crime statistics for 2009 published by the Central Statistics Office show a reduction in nine of the 14 crime groups for which statistics are given, compared with 2008.  Decreases in the numbers of cases of manslaughter and dangerous driving leading to death contributed to a fall in homicide offences of 10.1%.  There were also welcome decreases in public order offences, which were down 7.8% during 2009 and controlled drug offences, which were down 6.3.%. The statistics for the third quarter of 2010, the most recent available, show a decrease in 11 of the 14 crime groups for which statistics are given, compared with the same quarter in 2009.  The number of homicide offences decreased by 23.5% in the quarter, when compared with the same quarter last year, and 20.7% year on year.  The number of controlled drug offences decreased by 11% and weapons and explosive offences by 8.2%.  There was also a significant increase &mdash; of 138.8% &mdash; in the number of cases detected of cultivation or manufacture of drugs. This shows that the Government&rsquo;s policies on tackling crime and the resources made available, along with the outstanding work of the dedicated members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, are having a positive effect.</P><Col N="452"/>
        <P>While there is no acceptable level of homicide, the number of cases of murder and manslaughter combined showed no increase between 2008 and 2009 and a decrease of 8.3% in the third quarter of 2010.  The Garda&iacute; face severe challenges in dealing with gangland murders.  It was partly against that background that I introduced greatly strengthened legislation in the area of organised crime which is being fully utilised by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009, the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009, the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 and the Criminal Procedure Act 2010, which ends the ban on retrying persons who have been acquitted in specified circumstances and provides for reform of the law on victim impact statements.</P>
        <P>I have introduced further significant legislative proposals in the Criminal Justice (Forensic Evidence and DNA Database System) Bill, and I will not hesitate to introduce additional measures if that becomes necessary.<b>  </b>  I have also secured Government approval to commence work on a new Bail Bill to consolidate and update bail law with a view to presenting a clear, accessible and modern statement of the law.</P>
        <P>There was a worrying increase of 2.2% in property theft shown in the 2009 figures, but the statistics for the third quarter of 2010 show decreases in burglary and related offences (down 16.6%) and theft and related offences (down 0.5%). These two categories make up the greatest proportion of property offences. Both the Commissioner and I have been concerned at the level of property crime and one of the policing priorities which I set for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in 2010 is achieving maximum levels of safety for local communities. An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will continue to develop and implement strategies to target those committing such crimes, which are often carried out against vulnerable members of the community.</P>

        <P FLI="0">It is not possible to provide figures to the Deputy for all forms of temporary release as this would require the manual examination of records. Such an examination would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort and could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.</P>
        <P>Temporary release arrangements, in accordance with the Criminal Justice Act 1960 as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003, can operate similar to a system of parole, which is a feature of prison systems worldwide. They are an important vehicle for re-integrating an offender into the community in a planned way. The generally accepted view is that the risk to the community is reduced by planned re-integration <Col N="454"/>of offenders compared with their return to the community on the completion of their full sentence.  The Irish Prison Service has also judiciously used temporary release as a means of reducing numbers in times of serious overcrowding. Each case is examined on its own merits and the safety of the public is paramount when decisions are made. In addition, all releases are subject to conditions, which in the vast majority of cases include a requirement to report on a regular basis to the offender&rsquo;s Garda Station. Of course, any offender who breaches his or her conditions may be arrested and returned to prison immediately by the Garda&iacute;.</P>

	<P>Tackling juvenile crime is a priority for this Government. The Government&rsquo;s policy on youth crime is set out in detail in the National Youth Justice Strategy 2008-2010. This strategy is underpinned by the principles of the Children Act, 2001 as amended. The approach adopted involves the deployment of Garda juvenile liaison officers, community Garda&iacute; and the use of such measures as the Garda Diversion Programme, Garda youth diversion projects, young person&rsquo;s probation projects and community sanctions, in addition to the incremental process of warnings, good behaviour contracts and anti-social behaviour orders. The Deputy will be aware that the Department of Justice and Law Reform along with other Government Departments is subject to the Government&rsquo;s moratorium on recruitment and the current financial constraints. However, I can assure the Deputy  that  the resources at the disposal of the Department and its agencies are managed effectively, and I am satisfied that there are adequate resources to address this issue.</P>

	<P>The European Arrest Warrant Act 2003, which became law on 1 January 2004, gives effect to the European Union Council Framework Decision of 13 June 2002 on the European Arrest Warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States.  It puts in place simplified procedures for the surrender of persons between the Member States of the EU.</P>
        <P>Under the provisions of the Act, a court may, upon application made by or on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions, issue a European Arrest Warrant in respect of a person where it is satisfied, <i>inter alia</i>, that a domestic warrant has been issued for the arrest of that person but has not been executed and the person may not be in the State. As the Deputy will appreciate, both the courts and the DPP are independent in the exercise of their functions and, as Minister for Justice and Law Reform, I have no function in the making of such an application.</P>

	<P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the number of Garda stations with PULSE connections has been increased to 369. These stations account for the capture of over 85% of incidents on the PULSE system.  Email and internet access facilities are also available at every Divisional Headquarters, District Headquarters and 24 hour Garda Station.</P>
        <P>It has never been the intention of the Garda authorities to provide PULSE at every Garda location.  The extension of the system is regularly reviewed by Garda management with additional stations added as operational needs demand.   In addition, the Garda Information Services Centre in Castlebar has access to PULSE for recording incident details phoned in by investigating members.  This facility also covers all non-networked locations.  With regard to other modern technology, the Deputy  will be aware, in particular, that the National Digital Radio System is being rolled out for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and it will be operational for the Force nationwide in 2011.</P>

	<P>The European Union has made great strides in the field of Freedom, Security and Justice over the past number of years. Justice and Home Affairs Work Programmes and their accompanying Action Plans have played a central role in fostering a more structured and cohesive approach to cooperative and legislative initiatives. The Union has advanced its work, <i>inter alia</i>, in the fight against organised crime including the fight against drug trafficking.</P>
        <P>Ireland welcomed the Stockholm Programme, which was endorsed by the European Council in December last, as the new five-year work programme for the JHA area. This followed a series of discussions between Ministers for Justice and Ministers for the Interior of the Member States over the preceding months.</P>
        <P>The Stockholm Programme set out the need for a strong, coordinated response to organised crime due to its cross border nature. The very serious issues of trafficking in human beings, child pornography, cybercrime, financial crime, counterfeiting of means of payment and drugs trafficking have all been identified as priorities for action. The all-pervasive nature of organised crime means that actions in these areas need to be tackled in a comprehensive and coordinated manner as the influence of organised crime remains a common factor across the individual areas of concern.</P>
        <P>Recent Justice and Home Affairs Councils have discussed the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction annual report, the Commission Communication on the mid-term review of the Drugs Action Plan (2009-2012) and the Pact against International Drug Trafficking.  I will continue to work with my EU colleagues in the Justice and Home Affairs Council to ensure that every possible measure, legislative or otherwise, is put in place to enhance EU strategies for combating transnational organised crime.</P>

	<P>The Department of Foreign Affairs, through Irish Aid, pre-positions essential humanitarian relief items in a series of depots located close to those regions which are most susceptible to natural or other disasters. The pre-positioning of such stocks forms part of the Rapid Response Initiative established in the aftermath of the 2004 Asia tsunami.</P>
        <P>The United Nations Humanitarian Relief Depots (UNHRD), which are highly specialised, are administered by the World Food Programme and are strategically situated in Brindisi, Italy; Accra, Ghana; Subang, Malaysia; Panama and Dubai. They are supported by a growing number of national governments and international humanitarian organisations, meaning a large reservoir of supplies is available which can be borrowed and replaced should our own stocks be insufficient. The UNHRD network has proven itself an important instrument in Ireland&rsquo;s humanitarian response and has allowed Irish Aid to organise airlifts and shipments of essential shelter, water and sanitation supplies to emergencies such as those which affected Haiti and Pakistan earlier this year.</P><Col N="459"/>
        <P>Given the highly effective and cost-efficient nature of the UNHRD system, owing to its pooling structure and proximity to disaster and emergency prone regions, and current budget constraints the Government has no plans at present to develop an alternative facility which would have a high capital and management cost.  As regards peacekeeping, the Defence Forces deploy to various UN and UN-mandated missions from the Curragh in County Kildare which is the location of the Defence Forces Training Centre and Logistics Base. In recent years, as the nature of peacekeeping missions has become more complex, Ireland has also deployed police and civilian personnel to various crisis management missions. Deployment takes place smoothly and I do not consider at this time that value would be added by seeking to develop new site for this purpose.</P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>The back to education allowance (BTEA) scheme is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to remove the barriers to participation in second and third level education by enabling eligible people on social welfare to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course that leads to a higher qualification than that already held.</P>
        <P>With effect from 19th July 2010, changes have been made to the qualifying conditions of the back to education scheme to reflect the present economic situation. The period for which a person is required to be on a qualifying social welfare payment before accessing BTEA was reduced from 12 months to 9 months (a 2 year qualifying period continues to apply to participants coming from Illness Benefit).  People who are awarded statutory redundancy may access the scheme immediately, provided an entitlement to a relevant social welfare payment is established prior to commencing an approved course of study.</P>
        <P>In addition, a person can avail of BTEA to resume studies in a second or subsequent year of a third level course whereas prior to July, a person could only apply for BTEA if s/he was commencing year one of a course.  This also applies to people who are granted an exemption from a period of their third level course. A person who completed earlier year(s) of his/her third level course on a part-time basis but is now getting a jobseeker&rsquo;s payment, may apply for BTEA to continue the course on a full-time basis.</P>
        <P>These enhancements build on other improvements made to the scheme in recent years in response to the changing economic climate: from September 2007 the qualifying period for illness benefit was reduced from 3 years to 2 years; from September 2008, the cost of education allowance, which is an additional annual payment made to cover the cost of books and materials, was increased from &euro;400 to &euro;500; from September 2009, the 6 month waiting period for those pursuing second level courses was reduced to 3 months.</P>
        <P>The requirement to be in receipt of a social welfare payment for a minimum period has always been a feature of the scheme.  A waiting period is considered essential given that BTEA confers entitlement to income support for an indefinite period and is considered necessary in the context of targeting scarce resources at those who need it most.  The back to education allowance has an important role to play in enhancing the employability skills of jobseekers.   The conditionality of the scheme will continue to be monitored in the context of the objectives of the scheme.</P>

        <P>The Department operates a network of some 125 Local and Branch Offices throughout the country.

        <P>People residing in Ireland are advised to complete the relevant State Pension application form available on the website, which includes questions requesting details of employment outside the Republic of Ireland. The Department will notify other countries covered by EU Regulations or bilateral agreements that the person may be entitled to a pension from them.  In addition if a person has not yet reached age 65, but has reached the age of eligibility for EU Pension in another EEA country they have worked in, and from which they now wish to claim an EU pension, this can also be done through the Department&rsquo;s offices in Sligo. The application form EU65 is available on the website.</P>
        <P>People Residing outside Ireland are advised to apply for EU Pension to the pension institution in their country of residence if living within an EEA country; or to the pension institution in the EEA country in which they were last insurably employed if living outside the European Economic Area.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 200 and 201 together.</P>
        <P>I am advised by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that a very approximate average cost of processing an appeal is &euro;115.  This covers the period 1 January 2010 to 31 October 2010 and was calculated by dividing the number of appeals decided into the administrative budget of the Office for that period.  The administrative budget comprises staff salaries and other administrative costs in relation to the processing of appeals such as the cost of postage, stationery and room hire.  This cost does not include the costs of other inputs that lie outside the administrative budget of the Appeals office.</P>
        <P>The average time taken to process a summary decision is 28 weeks, while the average time to process an oral hearing is 44.5 weeks.  These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation and include all activities during this period including time spent in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant and any further investigation, examination or assessment by the Department&rsquo;s Inspectors and Medical Assessors that is deemed necessary.</P>
        <P>A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process. During 2009, 59% of all appeal cases were dealt with by way of oral hearing but, due to some of the initiatives outlined below, this has been reduced to 31% in 2010 to date.  In order to be fair to all appellants, the vetting of appeals and the arranging of oral hearings are dealt with in chronological order.</P>
        <P>In addition to the provision of extra staff and also the decision to use experienced retired staff strictly on a short term basis to supplement the current resources, with the services of eight retired officers having now been secured on a part-time basis and operating since July; more emphasis is now being placed on dealing with appeals on a summary basis so as to <Col N="462"/>increase productivity, a project to improve the business processes in the office was undertaken which has resulted in a number of improvements being implemented and significant enhancements have been made to the office&rsquo;s IT and phone systems.</P>
        <P>As a result of all of these initiatives, a total of 22,995 appeals have been finalised until the end of October in comparison to 14,278 in the same period in 2009.  I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping current processes under continuous review with a view to achieving a more effective throughput of appeals, while ensuring that any progress does not conflict with due process in terms of the rights of appellants and adherence to the requirements of natural justice.</P>

	<P>The integrity of the Pay-Related Social Insurance (PRSI) system is dependent on timely, appropriate contributions being made to the Social Insurance Fund by employers, employees and the self-employed, as laid down in social welfare legislation.</P>
        <P>Contributions due to the Social Insurance Fund are collected by the Revenue Commissioners.  The Department&rsquo;s Inspectorate has the responsibility of ensuring that employers and the self-employed comply with their PRSI obligations. Employer compliance is monitored by Inspectors whose remit includes a detailed examination of employers&rsquo; records to ensure that correct PRSI payments are being made in respect of all employees.  In addition, any irregularity in a customer&rsquo;s PRSI record detected at claim processing stage or reported directly by the customer is referred to the Inspectorate to enquire into the matter.</P>
        <P>In addition to the general inspectorate, the Department has a Special Investigation Unit (SIU) working full-time to combat fraud and abuse.  The SIU also undertakes employer inspections to ensure compliance with PRSI obligations.  A Joint Inspection Unit (JIU), drawn from inspectors from both the SIU and the Revenue Commissioners provides a co-ordinated approach, combining the powers of both agencies, and monitors compliance with both the PRSI and taxation systems.</P>
        <P>If the employer is not able to produce wage records, the employee is asked to complete a statement detailing evidence of employment and payment of earnings.  If the employment is confirmed either by way of wage inspection or employee statement, the Department&rsquo;s Client Eligibility Services is advised to update the employee&rsquo;s PRSI record for the period of employment in question.  Where a benefit claim is pending, the relevant scheme area is similarly advised.  This is to ensure that there is no loss of benefit to an employee caused by their employer&rsquo;s failure to make timely and proper returns on their behalf.</P>
        <P>Where PRSI undercharges are confirmed, the Inspector sets out the PRSI arrears or underpayment in respect of each employee for each tax year and issues a demand to the employer for payment.  Should the employer fail to respond satisfactorily, a statutory demand will issue by registered post and the employer given 14 days to respond.  If the employer fails to respond, the case is considered for prosecution.  Equally, if other offences are detected in the course of <Col N="463"/>an inspection, for example, failing to record employees or understating of earnings, the case may be considered for prosecution even where the employer makes full restitution.</P>
        <P>The Department is committed to ensuring that employers comply with their statutory obligations, thereby ensuring that employees do not suffer a delay in securing any social welfare entitlements and contributions to the Social Insurance Fund are made in an accurate and timely manner. There is no time limit on how long an investigation may take but every effort is made to ensure that it is brought to a conclusion as quickly as possible.</P>

The person concerned has been advised that if they are not satisfied with the decision, they should appeal the decision to the HSE Appeals Office. However, if there is additional documentary evidence now available this should be submitted to the Community Welfare Service and the original decision can then be reviewed in light of the new facts and fresh evidence. </P>

      <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv"><TitleTxt>Minister for Social Protection</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v</NameTxt>
	<P>In considering any changes to social welfare schemes, full consideration is given to the impact of any proposals on the recipients involved.  The Government is acutely aware and appreciative of the contribution made by carers.  It was for that reason, that when resources were available, we invested heavily in improving social welfare rates and services for carers.</P>
        <P>Following this year&rsquo;s Budget, the carer&rsquo;s allowance rate for carers over 66 years of age has not changed and remains at &euro;239.  The rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance for someone under 66 is &euro;212.</P>
        <P>Since the introduction of the carer&rsquo;s allowance in 1990 payments to carers have been increased and expanded.   Carer&rsquo;s allowance was increased in 2007, 2008 and 2009 by 12.1%, 6.5% and 3.3%, respectively. As a result, even with the reduction announced in the last Budget for carers under 66, the weekly rate of payment for the carers allowance is still almost 20% higher this year than in 2006 and more than 147% higher than in 1997.</P>
        <P>The means test for carer&rsquo;s allowance has been significantly eased over the years, and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse&rsquo;s earnings. Since April 2008, the income disregard has been &euro;332.50 per week for a single person and &euro;665 per week for a couple. This means that a couple with two children can earn in the region of &euro;37,200 and qualify for the maximum rate of carer&rsquo;s allowance as well as the associated free travel and household benefits.    A couple with an income in the region of &euro;60,400 can still qualify for a minimum payment, as well as the associated free travel and household benefits package.   These levels surpass the &lsquo;Towards 2016&rsquo; commitment to ensure those on average industrial earnings continue to qualify for a full carer&rsquo;s allowance.</P>
        <P>From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full time care to a person who needs such care, regardless of their income.  The rate of the respite care grant has also been increased to &euro;1,700 per year in respect of each care recipient since June 2008.</P>
        <P>The Government will continue to support carers and the people they care for within the resources available.</P>

	<P>The retention or the incomplete return of tenancy deposits feature in a large portion of the disputes cases referred to the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) and statistics in this regard are available in that body&rsquo;s 2009 Annual Report which is available online at www.prtb.ie  .  </P>
        <P>In November 2009 I announced the preliminary outcomes of my review of the Residential Tenancies Act which regulates the tenant-landlord relationship in the private rented sector and <Col N="466"/>under which the PRTB was established.  Among those outcomes is a commitment to introduce fixed fines where deposits are found to have been illegally retained and to consider the issue in more detail.</P>
        <P>The PRTB commissioned research on the viability of a separate deposit retention scheme in Ireland pursuant to its function under section 151(1) of the Residential Tenancies Act to provide advice to the Minister concerning policy in relation to the private rented sector. On foot of this research, the Board endorsed my proposal to introduce fixed fines as outlined above and also decided not to recommend the establishment of a deposit retention scheme.</P>
        <P>My Department has considered a number of critical issues in this area, and I have decided that it is prudent to proceed at present with the fixed penalty proposal but not with a wider deposit retention scheme. It is my belief that the fixed penalty model will act as a significant deterrent for landlords who might otherwise consider retaining a deposit without any legitimate grounds for so doing.  I believe that this initiative will, over time, greatly reduce the current problem of deposit retention.</P>
        <P>It is my intention to have the General Scheme of a Bill amending the Residential Tenancies Act before the Government very shortly.</P>

	<P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 213, 214, 217 and 218 together. </P>
        <P>The details sought by the Deputy are contained in the following tabular statement.  Under the provisions of the governing EU Regulations, payments under the Single Farm Payment may be made only in respect of eligible land and applicants under the Scheme are obliged annually to declare the land parcels available to them; details of the eligible area of the land parcels are recorded on Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS), my Department&rsquo;s computer-based land parcel tracking system.  Details of the use and area claimed for each of some one million parcels on the LPIS system are registered and continually monitored by my Department.</P>
        <P>In Ireland, the vast majority of Scheme applicants have been making sufficient deductions from their claims to take account of ineligible areas in that they reduced the area claimed.  However, in many cases as no mapping evidence supporting these deductions were provided, the ineligible features were not, therefore, recorded onto LPIS. As LPIS underpins all the area-based payments, worth in excess of &euro;1.8 billion annually, it is crucial that it accurately reflects the true position on the ground, particularly given the audit scrutiny that this Scheme attracts not just in Ireland but also in all Member States. To this end, the initiative I took earlier this year in urging all farmers to map out ineligible areas was crucial and, given the overwhelming response, absolutely vital.</P>

        <P FLI="0">I can confirm that the balancing payments under the Single Payment Scheme are on target to begin issuing as and from 1 December<i>. </i>  In addition to issuing balancing payments to those farmers whose applications are fully processed and whose maps are fully digitised, payments will also issue to those farmers where some or all of their maps are still to be digitised, with the payment being calculated on the basis of the confirmed eligible land. Because of this decision, which I made following consultation with the EU Commission, many farmers, whose balancing payments would otherwise have been delayed until their digitising is complete, will now receive payment. I estimate that the net effect will be additional payments worth in excess of &euro;100 million issuing in the early days of December.</P>
        <P>I am determined that this momentum will be maintained and that the maximum numbers of farmers will receive their full payments as the earliest possible date.<i> </i> At the same time, I must continue to emphasise the absolute urgency in getting the mapping system fully accurate and up-to-date to protect Irish direct payments.</P>

	<P>Under current EU rules there are no provisions available for capping farm payments or for excluding applicants with entitlement to these payments.

	<P>Under the provisions of the governing EU Regulations, payments under the Single Farm Payment may be made only in respect of eligible land and applicants under the scheme are obliged annually to declare the land parcels available to them; details of the eligible area of the land parcels are recorded on LPIS the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS), my Department&rsquo;s computer-based land parcel tracking system.  Details of the use and area claimed for each of some one million parcels on the LPIS system are registered and continually monitored by my Department. </P>
        <P>No changes have been made with regard to the classification of eligible areas under the Single Farm Payment.  Historically, the vast majority of scheme applicants have been making sufficient deductions from their claims to take account of such areas in that they reduced the area claimed.  However, in many cases as no mapping evidence supporting these deductions were provided, the ineligible features were not, therefore, recorded onto LPIS.  As LPIS underpins all the direct payments, worth in excess of &euro;1.8 billion annually, it is crucial that it accurately reflects the true position on the ground, particularly given the audit scrutiny that this scheme attracts not just in Ireland but also in all member states.</P>
        <P>As you are aware, these schemes are fully and partially funded by the European Union and the relevant Competent Authorities in each member state are obliged to ensure that the requirements of the governing EU Regulations are observed and that only valid applications that fully comply with the requirements are paid.  The administration of these schemes in each member state is subjected to close scrutiny by officials of the EU Commission and the EU Court of Auditors to ensure that the regulatory requirements are met and that the schemes are applied in a uniform manner across the European Union.</P>
        <P>Each year in advance of the closing date for the Single Payment scheme, my Department sends pre-printed application forms (which include a list of parcels declared by the applicant in question the previous year) to each applicant.  It is the responsibility of all applicants to ensure that the details in each year&rsquo;s application are accurate.  As a further aid to farmers, my Department issued maps of all lands parcels in early 2010.  Applicants were advised of the need to carefully review these maps and to make the appropriate deductions, if any, to the area of eligible parcels as necessary.  For example, where a house or other building has been constructed, farmers are required to submit maps outlining the exclusion with their applications to allow accurate deductions to be made.  It is also necessary for applicants to exclude ineligible features such as scrub, roadways, etc.  Therefore, the LPIS database has to be amended on an ongoing basis to reflect any permanent changes such as parcel boundary changes, addition of new parcels, etc.</P>
        <P>This year some 70,000 farmers submitted maps identifying ineligible areas.  Work on the digitisation of the land parcels identified in on-going in my Department.  When this work is complete very significant and essential progress will have been achieved in updating the LPIS. <Col N="473"/> If any applicant is not satisfied with the outcome of digitising in respect of any of their land parcels declared, for example, where an over-claim is established, that person is given an opportunity to appeal the decision to my Department.</P>

	<P>The young farmers&rsquo; installation scheme was suspended for new applications on 14 October 2008.  An allocation of &euro;4.5 million has been provided in this year&rsquo;s Estimates to meet the financial commitment involved in processing applications received under the scheme prior to its suspension and the preceding installation aid schemes.  Expenditure under the scheme is still eligible for co-funding by the EU.</P>

        <P>I also note the latest report from the Credit Review Office.  To date there are only two cases of farmers being actively dealt with by the Credit Review Office.  One of these has been completed and the farmer concerned has reached an agreement with his lending agency.</P>

        <P>An application under the single payment scheme/disadvantaged areas scheme was received from the person named on 13 May 2010.  The advance of the single payment issued on 3 November 2010.

	<P>An application under the single payment scheme/disadvantaged areas scheme was received from the person named on the 27 April 2010.</P>
        <P>This application was selected for and was the subject of a ground eligibility and animal identification inspection.  The inspection process is complete and the results are now being processed.</P>
        <P>Under EU regulations governing the disadvantaged areas scheme and the single payment scheme, all ground eligibility inspections must be completed before any payment can issue to any applicant under either scheme, including those not selected for a ground eligibility inspection.</P>
        <P>In the vast majority of cases that were inspected amendments have had to be made to the maps in order that the land parcel identification system that is used for making payments to farmers is kept up-to-date.  Processing of these changes is continuing with priority being given to applications that were the subject of a ground eligibility inspection.</P>

      <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen"><TitleTxt>Minister for Defence</TitleTxt><NameTxt>Deputy Tony Killeen</NameTxt>
	<P>Ireland has offered, through the UN Standby Arrangements System (UNSAS), to provide up to 850 military personnel for overseas service at any one time.  This figure equates to some 10% of Ireland&rsquo;s standing Army (excluding reserves) and demonstrates Ireland&rsquo;s commitment to the cause of international peace.  This is the maximum sustainable commitment that Ireland can make to overseas peacekeeping operations.  Ireland is currently contributing 143 Defence Forces personnel to 12 different missions throughout the world.  Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas are listed in the tabular statement below.  The main overseas missions, in which Defence Forces personnel are currently deployed, are the EU-led operation ALTHEA in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with 43 personnel and the NATO-led International Security presence (KFOR) in Kosovo with 12 personnel.  Other personnel are serving as monitors and observers with the United Nations and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).  Staff are also deployed at the organisational headquarters of the EU, OSCE and NATO.  </P>
        <P>KFOR was established on 10 June, 1999 in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1244, for an initial period of twelve months, to continue thereafter unless the UN Security Council decides otherwise.  KFOR&rsquo;s mandate is to establish a safe and secure environment in Kosovo conducive to the implementation of refugee return and reconstruction.  The EU military mission Operation ALTHEA was established under the authority of UN Security Council Resolution 1575 (2004) of 22 November, 2004 as the legal successor to SFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  On 18 November 2009, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1895 (2009) renewing EUFOR&rsquo;s mandate for a further period of 12 months.  Both of these missions are authorised under Chapter VII of the UN Charter and participation by the Defence Forces in the missions is reviewed by the Government on an annual basis.  The additional cost to the Defence Vote of participation by the Defence Forces in KFOR and Operation ALTHEA over the past twelve months was in the region of &euro;5.7m and &euro;2.4m respectively.  The Defence Forces contribution to the KFOR mission was downsized during the past year and will be further downsized in 2011 as will our contribution to Operation ALTHEA.</P>
